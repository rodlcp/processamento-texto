The concept is based on the modularity of the photovoltaic (PV) power supply system (PVbox) that can be multiplied in order to fully cover the electricity demand of each application. Based on that the interconnection between multiple PVboxes is done via an Intelligent Connection System (ICS) specially designed for this application.

The proportion of new energy in the system is higher and higher, which poses a great challenge to the system frequency stability and energy storage life and capacity. This paper proposes a new optimal scheduling model for system of wind/photovoltaic/ storage. Because of the complementarity of wind and photovoltaic energy, the combination of the two can effectively reduce the randomness of the output. Using the frequency modulation capability of the wind turbine and PV unit to track the prediction curve can reduce the burden of energy storage equipment and increase economy. An optimal dispatching model aimed at generation cost is established, and the frequency constraint is added based on traditional constraint conditions to prevent the frequency deviation from exceeding the allowable value.

However, because of the cost of BESS is relatively high, the effectiveness of fluctuation smoothing has been limited. Meanwhile, capacity optimization of energy storage can reconcile the relationship between energy storage cost and the smoothing effectiveness. Thus, a novel sizing algorithm of BESS is proposed to optimize the capacity of BESS. Firstly, state-of-charge (SOC) of energy storage system is used as index to avoid over-charge/-discharge of energy storage system to prolong the lifespan of BESS. Secondly, an objective function is presented to minimize the overall cost including the invest cost, operation cost and punishment cost to determine the optimal BESS capacity.

However, the PV power shows drastic fluctuation which presents great challenge to the power grid. Thus, how to mitigate the fluctuation of PV station needs to be solved. Battery energy storage system (BESS) is flexible to charge/discharge and track the fluctuation of PV power, and also BESS integrated with PV station has fast response capability, so it is well suited for smoothing PV power fluctuations. At the same time, it should be noted that BESS has relatively high price per unit size. So how to prolong its lifetime and decrease the average cost per time unit is significant for the application of BESS. In this paper, a control strategy of BESS based on fuzzy control theory is presented to avoid the overdischarge of BESS, accordingly decrease the potential damage to BESS to decrease its lifetime. Also the fuzzy control theory based charge/discharge scheme is presented to adjust SOC to maintain the state of health (SOH) of BESS.

The chillers and ice CTES equipment are connected in series to cool the chilled water so that large temperature difference and ultra low temperature air supply are realized to achieve small flow for energy saving. This study involves two phases: Development of the mathematical model of the plant development and testing of model predictive control algorithms. A co-simulation environment based on Matlab and TRNSYS is developed. The thermal behavior of the ice tank and plate heat ex-changer is analyzed by lumped formulas of the conservation equations in Matlab while models of other equipment such as chillers, pumps and cooling towers are developed in TRNSYS. The ice CTES system is modeled as a hybrid system, where the water phase transitions (solid-melting-liquid) are described by combining continuous and discrete dynamics. The model predictive control algorithm is designed and developed in Matlab to determine the required ice tank outlet water temperature to minimize operating expenses while meeting equipment and thermal comfort constraints under varying loads. The controller is optimized based on a forward neural network dynamic optimization algorithm. The objective function is a constant coefficient quadratic cost function of the ice tank outlet water temperature response and the use of control effort.

Normally the function of BESS is to mitigate the power fluctuation of PV to meet the requirements of dispatch center. In this paper, besides PV fluctuation smoothing, peak power shaving is also considered in the control strategy of BESS, which means part capacity of BESS is idle when fluctuations of PV power is small and not all BESS capacity is needed, and then on basis of time-in-use electricity price, this part of idle BESS can take part in peak shaving to earn extra benefits. Thus, the size-limited BESS can be fully utilized and meanwhile extra benefits from peak shaving can be achieved. Using actual PV power data, the proposed strategy is verified and the simulation results show that this strategy not only smooth the PV fluctuations, but also creates profits from peak shaving. © 2017 IEEE.","BESS; capacity; operation; optimization; photovoltaic power","Digital storage; Electric batteries; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Battery energy storage system (BESS); Battery energy storage systems; BESS; capacity; Fluctuation smoothing; operation; Photovoltaic power; Photovoltaic power stations; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047098843

In achieving the desideratum ""low-carbon energy system"", in the domain of energy production, the use of innovative low-carbon technologies providing maximum efficiency and minimum pollution is required. Such technology is the fuel cell; as these will be developed, it will become a reality to obtain the energy based on hydrogen. Thus, hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water using different forms of renewable resources becomes a secure and sustainable energy alternative. In this context, in the present paper, a comparative study of two different hybrid power generation systems for residential building placed in Cluj-Napoca was made. In these energy systems have been integrated renewable energies (photovoltaic panels and wind turbine), backup and storage system based on hydrogen (fuel cell, electrolyser and hydrogen storage tank), and, respectively, backup and storage system based on traditional technologies (diesel generator and battery). The software iHOGA was used to simulate the operating performance of the two hybrid systems. The aim of this study was to compare energy, environmental and economic performances of these two systems and to define possible future scenarios of competitiveness between traditional and new innovative technologies. After analyzing and comparing the results of simulations, it can be concluded that the fuel cells technology along with hydrogen, integrated in a hybrid system, may be the key to energy production systems with high energy efficiency, making possible an increased capitalization of renewable energy which have a low environmental impact. © 2017 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040246144

First stage of the signal processing is performed on a Virtex 6 FPGA and partial results are streamed through a fast Ethernet link to a computer, where the final processing takes place. The combination of high performance ADCs and flexible FPGA fabric allows the system to reliably process up to 100,000 detection events per second. This greatly reduces the time needed for data acquisition, compared to its analog predecessor that reached count rates approximately 30 times lower. The second main advantage over old analog spectrometers and earlier digital systems with similar parameters is a great reduction of storage space requirements, achieved by performing particle discrimination on-the-fly using the FPGA.

Among them, ocean, which accounts for 70.8% of the Earth's surface area, contains a wide range and considerable storage of renewable energy. Energy flow density of wave energy is large, which is a low-cost energy source that can provide considerable power through smaller devices. The rational use of marine wave power generation consumes no fuel and resources, does not produce any pollution, less investment and quick return. Therefore, wave power generation has great potential for development. However, there are some problems to be solved urgently in the wave power generation. The wave energy has the characteristics of large amplitude and variable frequency. Therefore, the input power of the wave power generator is generally unstable, discontinuous and abrupt. And facing of changing climate conditions and other factors, wave power generation devices often work in abnormal conditions, which will cause some degree of impact on some devices, also the power quality of the reliability and stability are affected. A single wave power generation system is usually an independent power generation system or directly connected to the offshore power distribution system and is currently the main form of running wave power generation. Directly connected to the offshore power distribution system in the wave power generation system is not enough to cause a significant impact on the voltage and frequency of large systems, but its impact on the voltage, power quality, power electronic devices of the local power distribution network can not be ignored. Through the analysis of wave power generation characteristics, this paper proposes a inverter control strategy based on the principle of virtual synchronous generator (VSG) to introduce the wave power generation system. Because of its similar characteristics of synchronous generators, such as large output impedance, large inertia, power by droop feature distribution, it is suitable for wave energy this low stability, high mutation rate power generation system. Through the introduction of virtual inertia and damping coefficient, it can improve the stability of wave power generation, improve the efficiency of inverter utilization, reduce the cost of system configuration and improve the service life of converter. © 2017 Marine Technology Society.","marine renewables; virtual synchronous generator; wave energy; wave energy power quality","Anchorages (foundations); Electric inverters; Electric power systems; Electron devices; Energy policy; Investments; Marine pollution; Power quality; Synchronous generators; System stability; Wave energy conversion; Wave power; Marine renewables; Power distribution network; Power electronic devices; Power generation systems; Reliability and stability; Wave energy; Wave power generation devices; Wave power generation systems; Hydroelectric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048146656

It has been shown that the capabilities of the current state power system are such that it is able to sustain RES penetration levels from 2000 MW to 3000 MW without large curtailment (less than 5%) of available RES energy, depending on the structure and mix of RES, primarily wind and PV energy. The result of the research is: the analysis on the maximum amount of renewable energy that can be integrated in the Croatian power system while accounting for different availability of imports of electricity from EU electricity markets; the analysis on the necessary conditions for significant penetration of renewable energy sources in the Croatian power system and limiting factors that affect this. Analysis shows importance of heat storage systems with electrical heaters which can significantly contribute to decrease of curtailed RES energy, since they are capable to directly transfer excess electricity to district heating systems. It is therefore important to direct future researches into coupled modelling of power and heat systems in order to better comprehend benefits of such simultaneous optimizations regarding future RES integration. © 2017 IEEE.","District heating; energy storage systems; flexible generation; heat storage; optimization; PLEXOS; pumped-storage hydro power; PV; renewable energy sources; wind power","Commerce; District heating; Heat storage; Natural resources; Optimization; Wind power; Energy storage systems; flexible generation; PLEXOS; Pumped-storage hydro; Renewable energy source; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046106259

Problems such as voltage flickering or frequency deviations can become more severe for isolated grids or islanded microgrids. Various solutions have been proposed to address these issues, mainly based on smoothing the PV output power by adding a storage device. In case of utilizing a hybrid PV/storage DC/AC converter, any abrupt changes in the power output of the PV due to cloud passing are absorbed by controlling the charge and discharge of the storage system. Therefore a storage system based on supercapacitors with quick time response and increased power density is proposed. This paper compares two different 'power smoothing' methodologies in a PV installation, considering a supercapacitor in the common DC-link. The first power smoothing method is based on the moving average algorithm, while the second on controlling the rate of change of the power injected to the grid. The main target focuses on providing comparative results for both control strategies, by implementing simulation tests with real irradiation measurements. A comparative study is also conducted for the sizing of the energy storage, based on the real irradiation profile created to remark the real energy needs of the installation and prevent over-sizing of the supercapacitor. The results show a significant difference in storage size, depending on the power smoothing method implemented, thus a careful consideration of the grid requirements is necessary. © 2017 IEEE.","photovoltaic; Power Electronics Converters; Power Smoothing; Ramp Rate Control; Simple Moving Average; supercapacitor; Supercapacitor Sizing","Electric inverters; Electric power transmission networks; Irradiation; Supercapacitor; Virtual storage; Photovoltaic; Power electronics converters; Power smoothing; Ramp rates; Simple moving averages; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046103887

Among the most important challenges imposed, is the reverse power flow caused by high injected energy from distributed PVs during peak irradiation hours. This is the reason of voltage rises above the permissible limits. Amongst other solutions, such as active power curtailment and reactive power absorption, the installation of distributed Energy Storage Systems (ESS) seems to be an attractive solution since it can absorb surplus power locally, avoiding curtailment methods, power flow losses on the feeder and grid reinforcements. As the cost of storage is decreasing, ESS are expected to be increasingly adopted by prosumers.

Especially batteries are expected to occupy a considerable share of the total energy storage market by simultaneously providing services to different stakeholders such as energy producers, transmission/distribution operators, residential, commercial and industrial consumers. Nowadays, Peak shaving and Time-of-Use applications are the most common services that standalone battery storage systems can provide to industrial consumers (without integrated PV-systems and/or wind turbines). A big part of the existing literature addressing such applications aims at developing an offline algorithm for optimal battery deployment based on a known load profile (or accurately predicted) without taking into consideration real time conditions. This paper investigates the impact of industrial load forecasting errors on dispatching strategies of battery storage systems on economically driven peak shaving and Time-of-Use applications. An artificial neural network has been developed and used as a prediction model of an industrial load profile. The neural network was trained, validated and tested on historical load data with time resolution of 15 minutes, provided by the local distribution operator of the Belgian electric grid. The performance of the neural network in terms of output-target regression and mean absolute error is 0.833 and 10.02% respectively. Afterwards, a simulation was carried out comparing four different scenarios of peak shaving. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the presented neural network is not competitive enough. Peak shaving based on predicted profiles becomes reliable for lower forecasting errors. For this purpose, further access into the process and types of loads of the user is required in order to come up with a more sophisticated prediction model. © 2017 IEEE.","Artificial Neural Networks; Battery Storage; Demand Charge; Energy Storage Systems; Load Forecasting; Peak Shaving; Supervised Machine Learning; Time-of-Use (TOU)","Battery storage; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric power plant loads; Errors; Forecasting; Neural networks; Renewable energy resources; Supervised learning; Wind turbines; Demand Charge; Energy storage systems; Load forecasting; Peak shaving; Supervised machine learning; Time of use; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046018284

The more severe contingency can lead to the higher operation cost. When contingency occurs, generator must perform a re-dispatch to ensure all constraints satisfied. The constraints include transmission limit, ramp rate and generator limit. Re-dispatch tends to result in high generation cost. Therefore, energy storages are required to reduce the re-dispatch cost.

Battery packs offer cell interconnections that allow to obtain several possible voltage and discharge current ratings. Typically, the battery packs are designed to meet the specifications of the application within a certain range, and sometimes they are oversized just to consider degradation effects that may affect battery performance in the long term. However, operating a battery pack at different ranges for the state-of-charge and temperature, among other variables, might have a major impact on its lifespan. This paper, introduces a technique on how a modular battery pack can be designed in terms of extending the lifespan of the energy storage device, where each battery module has different capacity ratings. The available energy on each module of the battery pack is constrained and controlled to meet the electric demand, ensuring optimal ranges for the state-of-charge. Also, the article shows that it is possible to meet energy requirements with the modular battery pack at a lower cost than just a single module battery pack. © 2017 IEEE.","Battery Packs; Lithium-ion batteries; State of Charge; State of Health Estimation","Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Electric batteries; Ions; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Secondary batteries; Battery pack; Battery performance; Cell interconnection; Degradation effect; Discharge currents; Energy requirements; State of charge; State of health; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043233616

These diesel generators are mostly in the latter stage of operational age, thus have limited capability and poor performance. Microgrid has been introduced lately, as a system to integrate more renewable energy sources to the existing power system. Photovoltaic (PV) source is one of the most popular renewable energy source which is utilized by microgrid. However, the fluctuating characteristic of microgrid operation and the intermittent characteristic of PV are making it harder for diesel generator to maintain the stability of the system. This situation might lead to further diesel generator performance degradation, causing operational and maintenance costs to rise. This research proposes a microgrid concept consisted of PV, diesel generator, and battery, aiming to minimize the impact for diesel generator caused by PV integration. Droop control is utilized to enable load sharing between diesel generator and PV source through gridconnected inverter. This scheme will enable the PV and inverter to participate in maintaining system operation and ease the operation of diesel generator. A battery energy storage system is introduced as a buffer to further enhancing system stability. It can be shown that under this scheme a microgrid with PV is able to actively participate in maintaining grid condition by sharing load with diesel generator, assisted by the battery as a buffer. © 2017 IEEE.","Battery; Diesel Generator; Droop Control; Microgrid; Photovoltaic.","Battery storage; Buffer storage; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric inverters; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Battery; Diesel generators; Droop control; Micro grid; Photovoltaic; System stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042746552

The control input is designed in MT and FC. The AC bus frequency deviation is denoted as the system controlled output. The problem of rationally utilizing MT, FC and BES is formulated as an optimal control (H2 control) problem, whereas the frequency regulation issue is formulated as an Hœ control problem.

In this paper, we propose a multi-timescale coordinated optimization strategy for hybrid three-phase/single-phase multi-microgrids. With the consideration of the economy of microgrids and three-phase unbalance constraints of multi-microgrids, a strategy of collecting-distributing fuzzy modified adaptive particle swarm economic optimization is provided. In this day-ahead strategy, the system is constructed as a bi-layer rolling optimizing structure, where the lower layer sets objectives for economic optimization, and the upper layer balances constrained tie-line power of single-phase microgrids based on the optimized results obtained from lower layer. On this basis, by taking day-ahead optimized tie-line power as baseline values, we obtain the real-time power of energy storage systems using an improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, which achieves distributed real-time optimization for the multi-microgrid.

Interface circuit is an important component of the energy storage system. This paper presents a non-isolated four-port dc-dc converter for the independent photovoltaic power generation system. The proposed four-port dc-dc convert is used to interface four power ports. These are photovoltaic cells (PV) port, battery port, super capacitor port and load port separately.

The soft-switching cell, which composed of three auxiliary switches, one resonant capacitor and one resonant inductor, is equipped in the traditional bidirectional DC/DC converter to realize circuit ZCT or ZVT operations in both energy transmission directions. Two driving methods are presented to charging energy for different storage applications according to the storage materials' electrical characteristics. There are two methods in buck mode. The first method with low conduction losses suffers from a hard turning off process in one of the auxiliary switches, while the others experience the soft operation. As for the other method, the zero voltage or zero current transmissions in all switches are realized, however, the relative higher but fixed conduction losses are introduced by the resonant circle.

As a result, the cache power occupies a large portion of the total power budget. STT-MRAM (Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Memory) is proposed as a promising solution for the low power cache design due to its high integration density and ultra-low leakage. Nevertheless, the high write power and latency of STT-MRAM become new barriers for the commercialization of this emerging technology. In this paper, we investigate the thermal effect on the access performance of STT-MRAM and observe that the temperature can affect the write delay and energy significantly. Then, we explore the NUCA (Non-Uniform Cache Access) design of the CMPs (Chip-Multi-Processors)with STT-MRAM based LLC (Last Level Cache). A thermal aware data migration policy, called 'Thermosiphon', which takes advantage of the thermal property of STT-MRAM, is proposed to reduce the LLC write energy. This policy splits the LLC into different regions based on the thermal distribution and adaptively migrate write intensive data considering the temperature gradient among different thermal regions. Compared to the conventional NUCA design, our proposed design can save 22.5% write energy with negligible hardware overhead. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Budget control; Cache memory; Computer aided design; Integrated circuit design; Magnetic leakage; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Thermal management (electronics); Thermosyphons; Chip multi-processors; Emerging technologies; Hardware overheads; High integration density; Non-uniform cache access; Spin transfer torque; Thermal distributions; Ultra low leakages; MRAM devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043532775

The objective of this paper is to develop an electromagnetic repulsion mechanism for a 40.5 kV vacuum circuit breaker and then to make an optimization. Design of experiments (DOE) method are used to screen the prominent factors. Result shows that three impact factors are the prominent factors, which include the number of coil turns (N), the capacitance of energy-storage capacitor(C), and the charging voltage (U). The other impact factors include: the height of the coil (H), the inner radius (r) and the outer radius (R) of the coil, the thickness (T) and the diameter (D) of the metal plate, and the initial air gap (δ) between the coil and the metal plate. The effect of these nine investigated factors on the performance of the electromagnetic repulsion mechanism is ranked as: C > N > U > H > D > δ > T > R > r. Considering the requirements of dynamic characteristics and cost, an optimum objective is achieved by minimizing the energy stored in capacitor. The optimized parameters of the electromagnetic repulsion mechanism are with the charging voltage of 650 V, the capacitance of energy-storage capacitor of 15 mF and coil turns of 15. The optimized electromagnetic repulsion mechanism is demonstrated for a prototype of 40.5 kV vacuum circuit breaker. © 2017 IEEE.","design of experiments; electromagnetic repulsion mechanism; optimization; vacuum circuit breaker","Capacitance; Design of experiments; Energy storage; Optimization; Plate metal; Timing circuits; Charging voltage; Dynamic characteristics; Electromagnetic repulsion mechanism; Energy storage capacitor; Impact factor; Metal plates; Optimized parameter; Vacuum circuit breaker; Electric circuit breakers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046891040

In order to efficiently exploit the energy sources of the hybrid system, a suitable sizing is necessary. In this paper, a new sizing method is used based on two optimization criteria: reliability, which used the concept of the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and the system cost. The LPSP expresses the rate of non-satisfaction of the load. For a given load and a probability of loss of energy given under the criterion of a minimum price of the system, an optimum number of hydrogen storage tanks and photovoltaic panels have been calculated. Thus, from hourly data of solar irradiation, ambient temperature and a typical consumption profile, we calculated the hourly power produced by the photovoltaic generator, the amount of hydrogen stored and the capacity of the battery required for the application. Dynamic simulations were performed to evaluate the sizing and control strategies of the hybrid studied system, the obtained results are presented and discussed. © 2017 IEEE.","electrolyzer; fuel cell; hybrid system; LPSP Method; photovoltaic; sizing","Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric power systems; Electrolytic cells; Fuel cells; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen storage; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Electrolyzers; Energy storage systems; Loss of power supply probability; LPSP Method; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic generator; sizing; Stand-alone hybrid system; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046691956

The calculations of energy savings for each used algorithm and the comparison of energy consumption of different light bulbs have been done based on conducted measurements. The implemented system controlled by a microcontroller ATmega16 consists of a photoresistor, a zero crossing detector and a phototriac. Analyzed algorithms were written in the C programming language. From the conducted measurements and calculations it can be concluded that complex systems that combine several approaches in the scope of lighting management enable greater energy savings. Therefore, the implemented algorithm that has the ability to control the light intensity achieved the highest energy savings (38 percent). © 2017 IEEE.","Energy efficiency; Light intensity; Light management; Microcontroller; Premises illumination","C (programming language); Controllers; Data storage equipment; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Incandescent lamps; Microcontrollers; Photoresistors; Time switches; ATmega16; Different lights; Light intensity; Light management; Lighting controls; Management systems; Zero-crossing detectors; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044629912

In addition to a harmful active power penalty, small device dimensions result in rapidly rising leakages and fast growing stand-by power. The critical high power consumption becomes incompatible with the global demands to sustain and accelerate the vital industrial growth, and an introduction of new solutions for energy efficient computations becomes paramount. A highly attractive option to reduce power consumption is to introduce non-volatility in integrated circuits. Preserving the data without power eliminates the need for refreshment cycles and related leakages as well as the necessity to initialize the data in temporarily unused parts of the circuit. Spin transistors are promising devices, with the charge-based functionality complemented by the electron spin. The non-volatility is introduced by making the source and drain ferromagnetic. Recent advances in resolving several fundamental problems including spin injection from a metal ferromagnet to a semiconductor, spin propagation and relaxation, as well as spin manipulation by the electric field, resulted in successful demonstrations of such devices. However, the small relative current ratio between parallel/anti-parallel source and drain alignment at room temperature remains a substantial challenge preventing these devices from entering the market in the near future. In contrast, a magnetic tunnel junction is an excellent candidate for realizing power-reducing approaches, as it possesses a simple structure, long retention time, high endurance, fast operation speed, and yields high integration density. Magnetic tunnel junctions with large magnetoresistance ratio are perfectly suited as key elements of non-volatile magnetoresistive memory compatible with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology and capable to replace dynamic and potentially static random access memories. We review the present status of the technology, remaining challenges, as well as approaches to resolve the remaining problems. Regarding active power reduction, delegating data processing capabilities into the non-volatile segment and combining non-volatile elements with CMOS allows for efficient power gating. It also paves the way for a new low-power and high-performance computing paradigm-based on an intrinsic logic-in-memory architecture, where the same non-volatile elements are used to store and to process the information. © 2017 IEEE.",,"CMOS integrated circuits; Computation theory; Data handling; Drain current; Dynamic random access storage; Electric fields; Electric power utilization; Electrospinning; Energy efficiency; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Magnetic devices; Magnetic moments; Memory architecture; Metals; Microelectronics; MOS devices; MRAM devices; Oxide semiconductors; Random access storage; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor devices; Semiconductor junctions; Static random access storage; Tunnel junctions; Tunnelling magnetoresistance; Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies; High integration density; High performance computing; Large magnetoresistance ratio; Logic-in-memory architecture; Magnetic tunnel junction; Magnetoresistive memory; Static random access memory; Data reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043584915

However, some accidents about battery fire or explosion remind us to focus on their reliability and safety issues. Thus, life prediction as the essential part should be considered during the design phrase of batteries to guarantee the safety and reliability level. In this paper, a new life prediction method based on gas production model of batteries has been proposed. Firstly, based on analysis result of actual gas production mechanism, types of chemical reactions existed in batteries can be determined. Then, through theoretical analysis of these chemical reactions combined with capacity change of battery, the whole gas behavior is divided into two stages. It includes the initial solid electrolyte interface formation stage and the stage of solid electrolyte interface being severely damaged and repaired. Gas production equation of each stage has been constructed. Based on these gas equations, quantitative relationship between the battery capacity and the characteristics of gas production is investigated. With a suitable end-of-life criterion, the application-oriented life prediction model for lithium ion batteries is established. Finally, the verification procedure is presented based on actual test data to validate our method and its advantages.

The use of classical or Li-ion batteries in the industry, mainly utilized in storage systems, is not a viable solution because these devices, after 2-3 years, lose their ability to store electricity and the materials employed are polluting, even banned in some countries. The European Union regulation like RoHS 1 and RoHS represent sometimes a real bottleneck. Fortunately in the last time on the market more and more are present electronic passive components like supercapacitors. The Supercapacitors (Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitors - EDLCs) are the promising solution for the future. They do not contain lead or other polluting materials on a side and on an other side they are able to storage large quantity of electrical charge. EDLCs have a very long lifespan (&gt; 106 unloading cycles) and very small internal resistance, which allows charging and discharging at very high currents (hundreds of A). Also, another advantage of using EDLCs battery systems in power structures is a decrease of the weight of the entire system. We have simulated and analysed the behaviour of a 100F/12V EDLC system by connecting 6 supercapacitors (600F/2.5V) in series. In this context, using an EDLC system, we have obtained interesting results after the primary power source has been disconnected. The proposed model is in the R&amp;D phase, but the test results are promising. EDLC is a very viable solution for use in a hybrid electric system such as a UPS or electric car. © 2017 IEEE.","automotive; EDLC; Electrical Energy Storage; Supercapacitor","Electric energy storage; Hazardous materials; Lithium-ion batteries; Storage (materials); Supercapacitor; Uninterruptible power systems; Unloading; automotive; EDLC; Electrical energy storage devices; Electrical energy storages; Electrochemical double-layer capacitors; European Union regulations; Polluting materials; Primary power sources; Electric power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046624362

However, the deployment of Ad-hoc mobile cloud is hindered by the limitation of mobile devices, such as storage capacities and relatively short battery lives. To overcome such problem, this paper proposes a task assignment algorithm based on particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing (PSO-SA) in Ad-hoc mobile cloud. The main contribution of our work is considering the fairness of resource utilization of all devices and total energy consumption of all devices under the constraint of time delay. We also combine particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing to avoid falling into local optimal solution and guarantee the convergence speed. PSO-SA is used to make the decision for task assignment to achieve two main objectives which include minimizing total energy consumption and balancing the fairness of resource utilization of all devices. Through the simulation, it is shown that compared with other population-based optimization algorithms PSO-SA has less energy consumption and the result of PSO-SA can be close to the optimal solution. © 2017 IEEE.","Ad-hoc mobile cloud; cloud; particle swarm optimization; simulated annealing; task assignment algorithm","Clouds; Energy utilization; Optimal systems; Signal processing; Simulated annealing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Convergence speed; Local optimal solution; Mobile clouds; Optimal solutions; Population-based optimization; Resource utilizations; Task assignment; Total energy consumption; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046442051

It has reduced the dependence on main electricity grid and enables the consumer to become a part of electricity supply system.

Data network storage by which many people share resources, becomes an important way of modern information dissemination and preservation. However, the security of the network storage platform has been a concern to users. Therefore, all kinds of private cloud storage platforms emerge, provide the users with a relatively independent space for personal use. After a long period of use, it is found that the traditional private cloud storage platform can reach a certain amount of security, however, the security is only relative to open public network location. At the same time, there are multiple users under instantaneous access protocol congestion, and big-data feedback delays the problem of high interaction nodes. In view of the traditional architectural characteristics and problems of private cloud causes, the paper, based on the NAS, puts forward private cloud storage platform design and implementation method.

In general, a microgrid can operate in both grid connected mode and islanding mode. Ensuring the continuity of protection in both operation modes is a great technical challenge. Dealing with different short circuit currents level depending on the operation mode as well as ensuring selectivity and sensitivity are the issues of the proposed protection scheme. The present work presents a microgrid protection scheme for a three busbar radial microgrid which includes energy storage and a static compensator (STATCOM). Protection strategy is based on the implementation of bi-directional overcurrent relays and includes over-and under-voltage and frequency relays as back-up protection. The main restriction is perhaps a limitation in normal working at 80% of the rated current of the converter-based generator, leaving the 20% remaining to overcurrent detection. In the other hand, an impedance measurement method is used to perform the islanding protection. Results show that the protection scheme detect effectively the islanding condition and also isolate three-phase faults applied in each bus-bar. © 2017 IEEE.","Distributed generation; Fault analysis; Microgrid protection","Busbars; Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric relays; Smart power grids; Fault analysis; Grid-connected modes; Impedance measurement; Islanding conditions; Microgrid protections; Over-current detections; Renewable power generation; Selectivity and sensitivity; Electric equipment protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043450584

Owing to comparatively rapid accelerations and decelerations, supercapacitors can be very appropriate for both energy storing and supplying due to their high power density. As a matter of fact, mobile energy storage devices not only ensure the possibility to store vehicles braking energy but also contribute in supplying trolleybus drive with power in acceleration mode, thus reducing overhead DC network energy transmission losses that are variable according to the distance between trolleybus and substation. This paper presents the chosen trolleybus model Skoda 27Tr simulations both without and with supercapacitor energy storage system. Due to additional storage device weighs, trolleybus mass increase impact on drive energy consumption and transmission loss energy is studied.

In this paper, both the positive and negative breakdown characteristics of PC are investigated and the streamer patterns are obtained by ultra-high-speed cameras. The experimental results show that the positive breakdown voltage of PC is about one time higher than the negative one, which is abnormal compared with the common liquid. The shape of the positive streamer is filamentary and branchy, while the negative streamer is tree-like and less branched. Based on these experimental results, a charge layer structure model at the interface between the metal electrode and liquid is presented. It is suggested that the abnormal polarity effect basically arises from the electric field strength difference in the interface between both electrodes and PC. Furthermore, the recombination radiation and photo-ionization also play an important role in the whole discharge process. © 2017 IEEE.","High permittivity; Liquid dielectric; Polarity effect; Propylene carbonate; Streamer discharge","Carbonation; Dielectric materials; Dielectric properties of liquids; Electric discharges; Electric fields; Electrodes; High speed cameras; Liquids; Permittivity; Propylene; High permittivity; Liquid dielectrics; Polarity effect; Propylene carbonate; Streamer discharges; Dielectric liquids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043521599

Therefore, an efficient control of energy storages and corresponding power converters is required. Two operating modes of the converter are considered: Current control mode and voltage control mode. Current control enables efficient charge/discharge process of energy storages whereas the voltage control is responsible for maintaining the microgrid bus voltage. Both modes have different applications in a microgrid operation. An averaged model of the converter was derived for controller design purposes and utilized for development of a cascaded contol loop.

Nowadays, there exist diverse types of batteries with different characteristics under charging and discharging conditions; their usage varies according to the specific application. Different power electronics circuits can be used to control the charge and discharge of a battery; one of the most implemented is the DC-DC Buck-Boost converter. Typically, the controllers for this kind of converters depend on the inductor and capacitor parameters, which differ for every application depending on the desired voltage and current at the output of the converter. The objective of this work is to develop a neural controller with on-line identification of the control variables for the battery bank charge and discharge processes required to be connected to a DC Microgrid. The proposed controller does not depend on the converter parameters; for this reason, it can be used under different voltage and current requirements without considering changes in its implementation. Another advantage of the proposed controller, is that a unique control law can be employed for both buck and boost discharging and charging operations. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Controllers; Cybernetics; Electric batteries; Electric inverters; Secondary batteries; Buck boost converter; Charge and discharge; Control variable; Different voltages; Neural control; Neural controller; On-line identification; Power electronics circuits; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044192903

A digital model of the system, and of the changes that occur within, are being maintained and updated, as triggered by real-life events. Morphologically, such applications contain several distinct architectural entities: databases holding the state, central components describing how the system reacts to external events and mechanisms through which the user can view the current state and issue new commands. Each of these entities may use distinct paradigms and employ different technologies. A production-ready software application ends up assembling a relatively high technology stack and provides the final abstractions for both the problem and its solution. In this paper we propose a short-circuit for the long chain of technologies that are usually employed in large, production-ready software applications. The resulting architecture is a distributed, message-based system which behaves as a hybrid between a database and a runtime environment.

The structure of Triple-Level Cell (TLC) can offer higher data density over Single-Level Cell (SLC). However, TLC RRAM suffers from high write energy and latency. Data compression techniques can reduce the size of the data to store. In contrast, data encoding methods such as Incomplete Data Mapping (IDM) can 'expand' the size for latency and energy reduction. We observe that the compression ratio of each cacheline varies, and therefore the saved space of each compressed cacheline is different. On the other hand, we find that different IDMs have different tradeoffs in capacity and write latency/energy. To fully exploit the space saved by compression for reducing the write latency/energy, and improving the performance of TLC RRAM-based main memory system, Compression-Ratio-Aware Data Encoding (CRADE) is proposed. The key idea of CRADE is to dynamically select the best-performing IDM according to the compression ratio of each cacheline. The cacheline is compressed first, and then the compressed cacheline is encoded by IDM. For each compressed cacheline, the IDM which uses the fewest states to encode is applied on the condition that the encoded data size will not exceed the cacheline size. Experimental results show that CRADE can reduce the write energy by 15%, decrease the write latency by 19%, reduce the read latency by 4%, and improve the IPC performance by 2% compared with the state-of-the-art scheme. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Dynamic random access storage; Encoding (symbols); Random access storage; RRAM; Signal encoding; Data compression techniques; Energy reduction; Improving performance; Incomplete data; Low stand-by power; Resistive random access memory (rram); Single level cells; State-of-the-art scheme; Data compression ratio",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041686644

Realization of the unity of logic computing and data storage in the same die has opened up a promising research direction of in-memory computing (IMC). Meanwhile nonvolatile memory (NVM) based programmable (or reconfigurable) logic architecture has always been a hot topic in the circuit and system societies. To date, lots of interest has been attracted and amazing advance has been made in the two fields, yet none can fully exploit the advantages of both. This paper takes a major step forward by introducing a novel nonvolatile programmable stateful IMC architecture via a single resistive device, which is a completely different design paradigm from previous studies. Each memory cell can perform different Boolean logic functions by dynamically programming the input signals. The computing output result is in-situ stored in the memory cell itself and can be readout with a memory-like operation. We will first give a brief review on this filed and then introduce our recent work. We will illustrate how the programmable stateful IMC operations can be implemented via a single resistive device and how the logic computing and data storage can be united within a memory chip. © 2017 IEEE.","In-memory computing (IMC); Nonvolatile memory (NVM); Programmable logic; Resistive device","Computation theory; Computer architecture; Data storage equipment; Data transfer; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Memory architecture; Nonvolatile storage; Reconfigurable architectures; Semiconductor storage; Boolean logic functions; Computing paradigm; Design paradigm; Logic architecture; Non-volatile memory; Programmable logic; Reconfigurable; Resistive device; Computer circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041684984

Transparent Off-chip DRAM cache (TOD cache) is a new DRAM cache structure where off-chip DRAM module is used as L4 cache and managed by hardware. The capacity and latency ratio of TOD cache over NVM are both quite different from those of traditional on-chip SRAM or die-stacked DRAM cache over off-chip DRAM memory. All the factors including hit latency, miss latency and hit rate need to be re-considered for TOD cache design. In this study, we first point out that three types of traditional cache schemes cannot be used directly for TOD cache, since set-associative cache suffers from extra tag lookup latency, direct-mapped cache has low hit rate and tag cache is too small to efficiently hold the working sets of tags for DRAM cache. Based on these observations, we propose a novel cache scheme, TDV, that fuses these three different types of cache together to take their advantages. In TDV, a direct-mapped cache is used as the first-level cache to achieve short access latency, a set-associative victim cache is taken as the second-level cache to obtain extra high hit rate, and a SRAM tag cache only serves for the victim cache rather than the whole DRAM cache and thus improves the hit rate of tag cache significantly. The simulation results show that, TDV cache has a performance improvement of 6.3% and 8.3% on average than state-of-the-art direct-mapped (Alloy cache) and set-associative cache (ATCache) with same DRAM and SRAM capacity. © 2017 IEEE.","Cache associativity; DRAM cache; Non-Volatile Memory; Tag cache; Victim cache","Buffer storage; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Nonvolatile storage; Static random access storage; Associativity; Direct mapped cache; Emerging non-volatile memory; Non-volatile main memory; Non-volatile memory; Set associative cache; Tag cache; Victim caches; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041650412

Currently, although carbon materials exhibit high power rate, their energy storage density is limited by the double layer mechanism. Therefore, pseudocapacitive transitional metal oxides (TMOs) are studied extensively. To further avoid the agglomeration of nanostructures, encapsulated architecture is adopted. In this work, hierarchically encapsulated core-shell MoO3@SnO2 nanobelts have been synthesized with a facile two-step hydrothermal strategy, with conductive SnO2 nanoparticles coated onto MoO3 nanobelt skeletons. As-prepared pristine SnO2 and composite MoO3@SnO2 are characterized by a variety of techniques to study the morphologies and nanostructures. They were further fabricated as the negative electrodes of supercapacitors. The specific capacitance of composite MoO3@SnO2-based electrodes is as high as 584.3 F g-1, which is much superior than that of pristine SnO2 nanosheets (48.3 F g-1). In addition, electrochemical impedance analysis shows that charge transfer kinetics of composite MoO3@SnO2 has been improved significantly owing to this favorable core-shell encapsulation strategy. The reversible nature of MoO3@SnO2 is also confirmed by retaining 86.2% of initial capacitance after 2000 galvanostatic charge and discharge cycles. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Carbon; Charge transfer; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Molybdenum compounds; Molybdenum oxide; Nanobelts; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Shells (structures); Supercapacitor; Synthesis (chemical); Charge transfer kinetics; Electrochemical impedance analysis; Energy storage density; Galvanostatic charges; High power rates; Negative electrode; Specific capacitance; Transitional metal oxide; Tin compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041223326

The high-energy capacity of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayer for Li-ion battery was recently introduced. Compared with Li-ion battery, the growing interests have been concentrated on the Na-ion batteries and Mg-ion batteries based on two-dimensional nanomaterials. Though the Li- and Mg-ion batteries based on MoS2 nano-tubes have been theoretically studied, knowledge about the Na, Mg-ion batteries with MoS2 monolayer is lack. To look insight into the capability of energy storage, herein, we performed the first-principles calculations to investigate the Li, Na, and Mg ions adsorption on and diffusion through the MoS2 monolayer. The binding energies of these ions at different sites, including top of S atom, top of Mo atom, and hole site (centre of hexagonal lattice), were measured. It was found that the binding energy at the top of Mo atom is the largest, which indicates the possibly stable absorption configuration. Energy barriers of ions passing through and diffusing over the MoS2 monolayer were also calculated.

The combination of the use of various dimensions fillers and surface modification to prepare high thermal conductivity and high dielectric permittivity composite materials has attracted great attention. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), in general, has acted as basis materials to prepare dielectric materials due to its high permittivity and favorable flexibility. In this study, the modified BN (m-BN) was prepared by coating with polydopamine (PDA) to improve the compatibility and reduce the interfacial thermal resistance. Meanwhile, MWCNT grafted with PAAc named m-MWCNT was also used. The novel sandwich-structured PVDF nanocomposites with m-BN fillers in the outer PVDF layers and m-MWCNT in the middle PVDF layer were prepared by spin-coating. Results shown that the optimized sandwiched structure of PVDF composite with 20 wt% m-BN fillers in the outer layers and 2% m-MWCNT in the middle layer displays a high thermal conductivity of 3.5 W m-1K-1 (three times of that of single layer). The dielectric constant of sandwiched structure PVDF composite is 17, which is about 190% times higher than that of PVDF/m-BN (single layer). These enhancements in dielectric properties may be attributed to m-MWCNT and Maxwell-Wagner interfacial polarization which was generated from the multi-layers structure. The mechanism is further explored. © 2017 IEEE.","dielectric properties; PVDF; sandwich-structured composite; thermal conductivity","Coatings; Dielectric properties; Dielectric properties of solids; Fillers; Fluorine compounds; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanotechnology; Permittivity; Surface treatment; Thermal conductivity; Thermal conductivity of solids; High permittivity; High thermal conductivity; Interfacial polarization; Interfacial thermal resistance; Poly (vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF); Polymeric dielectrics; PVDF; Sandwiched structure; Dielectric materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041205199

Different from previous studies, this work focuses on deriving the relationship between the NGD and the energy storage capability of the resonator, which is usually denoted by the quality (Q) factor. In this derivation, the Q factor is divided into two parts, including the external (Qe) and internal quality (Qi) factors. By analyzing the equivalent circuit of the coupled resonator, the relationship between group delay and Q factor is extracted, as the group delay is related to ratio of Qe and Qi. Furthermore, the group delay is with a sudden change from positive to negative as Qe is beyond the catastrophe point.

Swinging during a fixed period as a gravity pendulum of a certain weight, the swing of the pendulum decays faster if the damping is larger, and more slowly if the damping is smaller [1]. An active pendulum device for damping measurement is presented in this paper. By measuring the power of the pendulum compensation when the pendulum swings with the same amplitude and frequency in fluids with different damping effects, the device can calculate the overall effect of fluid damping. First, a conical pendulum mechanical model of a free pendulum is established based on the principle of virtual displacement and D'Alembert's principle, and then the space trajectory of free pendulum motion and conical motion is studied by solving the Lagrange equation and taking into consideration the motion law of free swing compensation. Next, the PID algorithm is used to analyze the pendulum attitude data measured by the sensor, adjust the wind speed of the DC fan output and maintain the dynamic balance of the pendulum. The pendulum tested in the fan drive performs a simple harmonic swing in different fluids according to the given amplitude and frequency. The power of the system compensation is related to the fluid damping. © 2017 IEEE.","Damping pendulum; Energy supplement; PID algorithm; Servo control","Damping; Digital storage; Equations of motion; Space flight; Wind; D' Alembert's principle; Damping measurements; Design and implementations; Energy supplement; Pendulum control system; PID Algorithm; Principle of virtual displacements; Servo control; Pendulums",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040593523

This is caused by the limitations of both mobile networks and mobile devices such as low bandwidth, frequent disconnection, low energy and low storage capacity. In order to help programmers, developers and SQ evaluators to deal with the limitations of mobile environments and to achieve a high level of mobile software quality, we have designed two frameworks ISO9126-FRAM and Diffserv-FRAM. ISO9126-FRAM consists in using the SQ standard ISO 9126 in mobile environments while DIFFSERV-FRAM concerns the use of the SQ standard ISO 9126 with the DiffServ Quality of Service (QoS) model to evaluate the software quality in mobile environments. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to present and compare these two frameworks of SQ evaluation to show the disadvantages and advantages of each one. This comparison is based on the Framework Mapping Comparison Method. As a result of this comparison, the correlation between the two frameworks can be strong as it can be weak depending on the studied SQ characteristics. In addition, differences have been identified at the empirical evaluation level of the two frameworks in terms of the encountered difficulties. © 2017 IEEE.","DiffServ; ISO 9126; Mapping comparison method; Mobile environments; Quality of service; Software quality","Application programs; Computer software selection and evaluation; Ferroelectric RAM; Low power electronics; Mapping; Mobile telecommunication systems; Quality control; Comparison methods; DiffServ; Iso 9126; Mobile environments; Software Quality; Quality of service",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045580907

However, the connection of wind power generation with high voltage systems lead to power quality problems due to the stochastic behavior of wind speed. Power quality problems are associated with the power fluctuations, voltage stability, frequency regulation and harmonic voltage and current distortion. Energy storage systems have been studied as an alternative to solve power quality problems. Related to harmonic distortion, the limits of individual and total voltage and current distortion for wind farms are defined in IEC Std. 61400-21: Measurement and assessment of power quality characteristics of grid connected wind turbines. To evaluated the effectiveness of energy storage systems, a power quality study of a large-scale wind farm with and without storage is presented. The study is focused on voltage drops and harmonic voltage and current distortion at the wind farm output. The study shows that the storage system could be implemented as a harmonic current distortion mitigation technique and improve the voltage level at the wind farm output when a short circuit occurs in the connection with the power grid. © 2017 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); Harmonic distortion; Power quality; Wind power generation","Battery storage; Electric batteries; Electric distortion; Electric fault currents; Electric power generation; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Harmonic analysis; Harmonic distortion; Power quality; Problem solving; Quality control; Stochastic systems; Voltage control; Wind; Wind effects; Wind power; Wind turbines; Battery energy storage systems; Doubly Fed Induction generators (DFIG); Energy storage systems; Frequency regulations; Grid connected wind turbine; Large-scale wind farms; Power quality problem; Quality characteristic; Asynchronous generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044119246

As a consequence the amplitude and frequency of frequency variations has grown. Renewable power plants such as wind and solar PV do not inherently respond to the frequency variations. However, also renewable energy systems (RES) can take part on the frequency regulation by including such controls to the system. In the current day power grid the connected rotating synchronous mass, that is the inertia, represents certain amount of kinetic energy. This energy can be replaced by synthetic inertia of RES, but the main questions are what kind of dynamics are required from the energy sources and are they capable of executing the required performance. Another issue is how different energy sources should take part in the frequency regulation. This paper focuses on the available kinetic energy in a grid where power production is based mostly on renewables. Key technologies investigated include wind, solar, and battery energy storages. As a result kinetic energies for each technology is calculated for small island environment that is assumed to operate independently. © European Power Electronics and Drives Association & the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).","Converter control; Energy storage; Generation of electrical energy; Power transmission; Renewable energy systems","Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Power electronics; Renewable energy resources; Battery energy storage; Converter controls; Different energy sources; Frequency regulations; Frequency variation; Generation of electrical energy; Renewable energy systems; Renewable energy systems (RES); Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042139791

Using analytical methods this paper compares two electric powertrains with respect to energy consumption and efficiency: the standard single-motor architecture, derived from conventional internal combustion engine vehicles and equipped with a high-speed electric motor and a mechanical reduction system, versus the novel in-wheel direct drive topology. The potential benefits of a two-speed transmission to improve the driving range of battery electric vehicles are also studied. A backwards-simulation model from the wheels (load) to the battery (source) has been developed to simulate an EV during representative drive cycles. The results show superior performance of the in-wheel powertrain, which can provide up to 14% energy saving vs. the single-motor configuration thanks to the absence of mechanical transmission components and related power losses. Furthermore, the adoption of a two-speed gearbox on a single-motor electric vehicle doesn't provide any effective energy saving benefit versus a fixed reduction gear. On the contrary, it consumes more battery energy during urban driving, up to 7%, due to the lower efficiency of the multi-gear transmission compared to the single-speed type. © assigned jointly to the European Power Electronics and Drives Association & the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).","Adjustable speed drives; Electric propulsion systems for electric vehicles; Electric vehicle propulsion systems and their energy storage; Electrical machines and drive systems","Battery electric vehicles; Electric batteries; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internal combustion engines; Power electronics; Powertrains; Propulsion; Secondary batteries; Speed; Traction motors; Transmissions; Variable speed drives; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Wheels; Adjustable speed drives; Comparative studies; Electric power trains; Electric propulsion systems; Electrical machine; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Mechanical transmission; Vehicle propulsion systems; Electric drives",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042097321

Instead of recycling or sending them immediately to landfills, these battery systems could be reused in other applications, such as grid or end-user applications. Second-life batteries are still expected to be capable of storing and delivering substantial energy. It is possible that they could satisfy the requirements of stationary applications. Indeed, the total lifetime value of the battery will increase when the remaining capacity of batteries can be invested to meet the requirements of other energystorage applications. Consequently, the price of battery systems will be decreased, which helps the widespread commercialization both of electric vehicles and grid storage systems. However, there is an increasing need to investigate the potential of using second-life batteries in stationary applications (i.e., electric supply, ancillary services, grid system, end user/utility customer, and renewable integration). While some used battery technologies are now ready for commercial demonstration, there is no clear market structure to demonstrate the benefits of the used batteries for grid applications. While the need and opportunities for second-life batteries are obviously a number of gaps and limitations currently constrain the adoption of using the second-life batteries for grid-scale applications. Therefore, in this article, a comprehensive technical analysis is provided by addressing all aspects of a battery's life cycle to investigate the feasibility of reusing the retired EV batteries in stationary applications.

The Quasi-Z-Source Inverter (qZSI) enables the integration of energy storage easily in addition to the other energy source mainly used for output power smoothening. In this paper the possibility to integrate energy storage in qZSI structure is analyzed in case when the input voltage is low or when battery is the only source of energy.

Energy storage devices with only 5% energy storage of wind farm’s rated capacity can produce the same virtual inertia as a same capacity synchronous generator. To reduce the additional costs of individual energy storage devices, this paper proposes a new hybrid modular multilevel converter (HMMC) with integrated battery energy storage. It has the capability of smoothing battery current and reducing battery voltage, while possessing DC fault ride-through capability with no additional costs in comparison with previous work on energy storage MMC. Voltage balancing, control strategy and parameter design are discussed in the paper, while simulation results illustrate three working States (charging, discharging, and idle) of battery and power balancing of submodules.

The use of a controllable actuator to drive this process has many advantages, but the voice coil actuators previously used are too large and heavy for practical use with common injection volumes (~1 mL). We instead propose a compact slotless tubular linear permanent magnet synchronous motor design for jet injection. The design was determined by utilizing a semi-analytical electromagnetic modeling technique to predict the performance of any given motor design, an optimization scheme for the motor mass at a given power dissipation, and an automated routine for estimating cogging force using finite-element analysis. A prototype motor was constructed, with a nominal mass of 322 g, a stroke of 80 mm, and a target operating power of 1.2 kW; experimental data show that the motor constant is within 10 % of the target, and that the cogging force is in close agreement with the model.

Thus, there is a need for improved condition monitoring to increase its life expectancy and performance. In this work, Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is implemented using a bi-directional DC-DC converter to characterize the lithium-ion battery under near realtime conditions. EIS is a widely used technique for characterizing electrochemical cells, however, due to long procedural time involved, it is limited to offline (laboratory) testing. This paper investigates several types of impedance spectroscopy (IS) techniques that can be performed while a battery is connected to a load, to characterize the lithium-ion battery and hence determine and monitor its State of Health (SoH) and State of Charge (SoC). The main contribution of this work is the implementation of a multi-sine broadband impedance spectroscopy (BIS) technique in a switching converter to reduce measurement time and thus enable near real-time IS measurement. The proposed technique is carried out using the associated battery converter without additional components incorporated into the converter. Results obtained show that the BIS implemented on the switching converter is effective at characterizing the battery's impedance spectrum as compared to the conventional EIS. © 2017 IEEE.","Broadband impedance spectroscopy; DC-DC converter; Impedance spectroscopy; Lithium-ion","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Condition monitoring; DC-DC converters; Electric batteries; Electric impedance measurement; Electric inverters; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Energy conversion; Ions; Lithium; Secondary batteries; Spectroscopy; Bidirectional DC-DC converters; Broadband impedance spectroscopies; Energy storage technologies; High energy densities; Impedance spectroscopy; Lithium ions; Online condition monitoring; Switching converter; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041466196

But EVs can provide ancillary services for the power system as distributed energy resources through Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. The fast and accurate prediction of schedulable capacity (SC) of EVs is the first step to enable this benefit. In this paper, two different time scales schedulable capacity forecasting (SCF) methods are proposed, including the real-time SCF method and a day head SCF method. Firstly, the real time of SCF of EVs is calculated by collecting the real-time charging or discharging data of individual EVs and a distributed data parallel calculation method to solve problems of the mass data process and storage problem. Secondly, the large amount of results of the real-time SCF, is used as historical data, to train the SCF models one day ahead by parallel decision tree regression algorithm (PDTR) and parallel random forest regression algorithm (PRFR). These proposed methods are evaluated by the real time operation data involving 521 EVs in the filed in China on Spark.

Generation side controls, e.g., virtual synchronous generator control and droop control, have been widely adopted to stabilize the frequency of islanded microgrid. However, this is not ideal method due to the capacity limitation and power fluctuation of distributed generation(DG). Meanwhile, energy storage system(ESS) installation will significantly increase the investment of microgrid since the high construction cost. In this paper, an autonomous control scheme of active power electronics loads(APELs) was proposed to make the APELs regulate their power consumption in proportion to their adjustable power capacities based on the frequency monitored locally. With the participation of the APELs, the power supply-demand imbalance can be solved and the microgrid frequency deviation can be maintained within the allowable range. Therefore, the additional power reserve of DGs and energy storage systems are not required. Meanwhile, the proposed control scheme is distributed control algorithm for APELs. As a consequence, the central controller and the communication links can be saved. The effectiveness of the proposed control is demonstrated via Matlab simulations in islanded microgrid. © 2017 IEEE.","Active Power Electronics Loads; Autonomous Control; Frequency Control; Microgrid","Distributed parameter control systems; Electric frequency control; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Investments; MATLAB; Power electronics; Active power; Autonomous control; Capacity limitation; Distributed control algorithms; Energy storage systems; Frequency deviation; Micro grid; Stability and reliabilities; Power control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041439535

Then a simple but efficient control logic is proposed to decide the sequence of cells to be charged. The supercapacitor is modeled as a RC equivalent circuit. Instead of balancing the terminal voltage of cells, we use an constant-current charging method to identify the parameters of supercapacitors, and calculate the equivalent capacitor voltage, which is further used in the voltage balance.

For comparison purposes, three load profiles representing the demands from the residential, commercial and industrial sectors, have been used and normalized to display the same daily energy consumption level with different demand patterns. The results of the simulations, obtained using Matlab 2016, have revealed that for the same energy consumption and renewable resources, the running expenses of any proposed scheme are mainly dependent on the demand sector. Consequently, it can be recommended that in Bloemfontein and South Africa in general more focus should be on implementing grid-connected renewable hybrid energy with storage system in the commercial and industrial sectors instead of in the residential sector. © 2017 IEEE.","Demand sectors; Distributed generation; Grid-connected; Optimal scheduling; Time-of-Use","Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Housing; MATLAB; Photovoltaic cells; Scheduling; Bidirectional power flow; Demand sectors; Energy consumption levels; Grid-connected; Grid-connected photovoltaic system; Optimal scheduling; Photovoltaic systems; Time of use; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039964945

While, in the past, nearly all generation technologies could be dispatched on demand, modern planners must incorporate intermittent renewable energy into their scenarios of the future energy mix. Based on forecasts of power and energy requirements and the costs of various technologies, selected scenarios test the trajectories of future prices and adequacy. The draft Integrated Resource Plan for South Africa published by the government in 2016, together with the diverse reactions to it, provide extensive material for analysis. Lessons include the need for careful identification of technical constraints, not simply basing a plan on the cost models; that forecasting the effects of the intermittency of solar and wind energy in South Africa is possible with available measured outputs; and that storage or curtailment of high renewable energy output when penetration levels increase are important. The analysis indicates the effects of intermittency on the cost models, and the significance of electricity supply industry structure and tariffs in supply planning. It appears bias in the planning group may affect the outcomes of integrated resource plans. The practical constraints in the plans advocating greater renew ables penetration could reduce system reliability, which means that decisions about the trajectory need to be taken now. The South African situation appears to be relevant for other developing and emerging economies. © 2017 IEEE.","Integrated resource plan; Levelised cost of energy; Load factor; Renewable energy","Costs; Energy policy; Renewable energy resources; Resource allocation; Technological forecasting; Wind power; Generation technologies; Integrated resources; Levelised cost of energies; Load factors; Renewable energies; Scenarios of the future; Solar and wind energies; Technical constraints; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039957738

One of the main customers who install the PV Rooftop is the residential load with TOU structure. Normally, there are many characteristics and types of BESS, depending on the application. To combine with PV Rooftop, Li-ion Battery is an appropriate type. Battery capacity, State of Charge, C-rate and lifetime are necessary factors that should be considered. The characteristics of BESS considerably affect the investment cost (IC) and O&M cost (OC) of BESS, especially battery capacity. The larger battery capacity the higher IC and OC. However, the larger battery capacity will reduce more electricity charge (EC) of the customers, which is the most attractive benefit of BESS, particularly when the Net-Metering Scheme is applicable. Therefore, an appropriate battery capacity and operation schedule of BESS for PV Rooftop is investigated in this paper by using Genetic Algorithm.

By comparing the energy-deposition spectrums in sensitive volumes (SV) and single event upset (SEU) cross sections, it was found that secondary electrons and nuclear reactions of the 200 MeV/n incident ions have significant impact on the device response. Secondary electrons excited by the energetic space ions can spread beyond the SV of the 65 nm bulk CMOS SRAM and result into partial collection of the ion track. This mechanism causes the constant increase of SEU cross section with ion LET, even deviating from the surface area of the SV by 3.3×. Nuclear reaction can lead to unexpectedly large energy-deposition events in the SV by 10x than the initial LET, which create SEU cross sections in the sub-LETth region, although with lower probability than direct-ionization process by 104×∼105×. Higher ion energy seems to enhance the influence of secondary electrons and nuclear reaction. Moreover, soft error rates of the 65 nm bulk CMOS SRAM technology on GEO were predicted and discussed. © 2016 IEEE.","Monte-Carlo; nuclear reaction; secondary electron; single event upset; static random access memory","CMOS integrated circuits; Deposition; Electrons; Heavy ions; Monte Carlo methods; Radiation effects; Radiation hardening; Secondary emission; Static random access storage; Transients; Energy depositions; Ionization process; Lower probabilities; Monte Carlo predictions; Secondary electrons; Single event upset cross sections; Single event upsets; Static random access memory; Nuclear reactions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043603574

PSO algorithm is used to find out optimal energy mixing rates that can minimize daily energy cost of a renewable microgrids under energy balance and anti-islanding constraints. The optimal energy mixing rates can be used by multi-pulse width modulation (M-PWM) energy mixer units. In our numerical analyses, we consider a multi-source renewable energy grid scenario that includes solar energy system, wind energy system, battery system and utility grid connection. We assume that variable energy pricing is used in utility grid to control energy dispatches between microgrids.

Given the current energetic concern, the importance of the massive integration of renewable energies and storage systems, in number and kind, has become obvious. Nonetheless, demand matching with these two options is quite challenging inasmuch as renewable energy sources are significantly random and as storage systems are high-priced and imitate load and production uncertainties. For this purpose, herein we firstly used Gaussian Mixtures to model renewable energy outcome; secondly, we developed a probabilistic procedure to size Energy Storage Systems as an aggregated unit, and finally, we examined the impact of distributing generation on uncertainties of individual units.

Configuring the battery energy storage system (BESS) in the FCS can reduce the load peak and the distribution capacity, and can also use the Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity prices to reduce the charging costs. But the storage capacity demand is too large if configure the BESS directly, economy is not ideal. In fact, the plug-in electric bus driving behavior is regular, it can improve the load characteristics by adjusting the bus's charging strategy, and then consider the configuration of BESS.

In view of the fact that the uncertainty of the power generation in a renewable energy grid is very prominent, power grid dispatching control which takes the power balance as the primary task must adopt targeted response measures. Based on the operation mechanism of energy storage, a mathematic model of day-ahead scheduling and real-time scheduling with pumped storage power station is established from the view of the progressive connection between day-ahead scheduling and real-time scheduling. The reserve capacity for balancing fluctuating power is mainly borne by the conventional power supply, and the reserve for balancing uncertainty power is mainly borne by the pumped storage power station.

Along with that, it also possesses advantage of convenience in pre-charging super capacitors(SCs) from DC link without additional charging circuits. For the sake of adaption in an ESS, a compound control strategy is developed for the proposed MMDDC, which consists of multiple closed loops. By means of this, system current can be restricted to a safe value, and hence system reliability has potential to be improved.

But identification and extraction of effective HIs in different working conditions is still a challenge. In this paper, a self-adaptive non-invasive HIs extraction approach is explored, which benefits enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the indirect health indicators under different working situation. A cluster of potential HIs are extracted from the data samples of the battery. Principle component analysis (PCA) is taken into consideration to select and fuse those different HIs.

The signal propagation speed of high-speed optocoupler is fast due to Schottky clamped transistors. As the characteristic parameter, propagation delay time (PDT) was chosen to evaluate storage life of high-speed optocouplers. Then, failure modes of high-speed optocoupler during storage were surveyed. Degradation of light emitting diode (LED) is the main failure mode of high-speed optocoupler which would affect the propagation speed. Considering that the main stress of storage is temperature, high temperature storage was designed to accelerate degradation on luminous efficiency of LED. 20 devices were divided into 4 groups which were placed under 100 °C, 125 °C, 150 °C, 175 °C respectively. Degradation tendency of PDT was predicted by function fitting, which based on the results of PDT using least square method. Devices under 175°C had some abnormal failure and its PDT was invalid. According to the tendency of PDT under 100°C and 125°C, activation energy and accelerated factor in Arrhenius equation of different temperatures can be calculated.

This paper proposes a new system to stabilize the voltage fluctuations in grid which often occur in some situations. For example, when a large number of distributed generating resources are connected to the grid and when the load fluctuates rapidly. A system has been proposed here as a solution to the problem of under voltage problems in grid. Whenever distributed generating units such as photovoltaic cells and micro turbines are connected to the grid, the grid voltage increases above the upper acceptable level. During the over voltage situations, the proposed system will be deactivated and the energy storage system will get power from the grid; as a result, the grid-voltage will decrease to an acceptable level. The paper also describes a Grid Tie Inverter (GTI) for the system. The system consists of a monitoring mechanism which continuously monitors the grid-voltage fluctuations. If the grid-voltage falls down to a certain level the control unit will send a command to boost converter unit to boost up the voltage level of the energy storage system.

To forward a network packet, MDTN relies on the relay nodes, using the 'store-carry-forwards' routing method. However, nodes will be selfish and unwilling to forward messages for others due to the limited resources such as energy, storage space and bandwidth. Therefore, it is necessary to bring in incentive mechanism to motivate the selfish nodes to cooperatively forward messages. In this paper, we divide present incentive mechanisms into three categories: reputation-based scheme, tit-for-Tat (TFT)-based incentive scheme and credit-based incentive scheme. Then we qualitatively analyze and compare typical incentive mechanisms have been proposed. Finally, we make a conclusion and point out the inadequacies in present incentive mechanisms under MDTN. © 2017 IEEE.","data forwarding; incentive mechanism; MDTN; selfish behavior","Digital storage; Wireless networks; Data-forwarding; End-to-end connections; Incentive mechanism; Incentive schemes; MDTN; selfish behavior; Store carry forwards; Three categories; Delay tolerant networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035810879

Compared to traditional memory, it has many advantages, such like lower-energy use, higher density and better scalability. PCM is supposed to replace DRAM and become the next generation of memory in embedded systems. However, PCM still has some disadvantages, such as the limitation of writing times. Although some approaches have been proposed to relieve these disadvantages, they can not well resist the malicious wear attacks. In this paper, we propose a practical approach named RandMap to achieve wear level in PCM. RandMap separates PCM into layers, and each layer uses its own random mapping table to achieve wear level when converting the logic address to physical address. When the writing time of a layer reaches the threshold, its random mapping table will be updated immediately. RandMap can implement wear level and enhance the ability of resisting malicious wear attacks, and it is available for large-size PCM. Our evaluation on SPEC2000 and SPEC2006 benchmarks shows that RandMap can improve the wear-level effect to 77.2% compared to previous approaches, and it can support the PCM size up to 16GB. © 2016 IEEE.","Embedded systems; Phase change memory; Random mapping; Wear level","Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Mapping; Physical addresses; Lower energies; Non-volatile; Phase change memory (pcm); Random Mappings; Wear attacks; Phase change memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039959359

In certain applications it is desirable that spectral shaping codes provide some error correction capability or that they possess an increased robustness to errors. These errors may be introduced during transmission, processing or storage of digital information. In this paper, an interleaving method is introduced to increase the robustness of DC free codes toward burst errors whilst maintaining the spectral shaping property of DC free codes. Interleaving when applied to a coded communication system results in a reduction in the mean bit error rate (BER) of coded bit streams. © 2017 IEEE.","DC free; error correction; interleaver; Knuth; power spectral density","Bit error rate; Computer networks; Error correction; Errors; Power spectral density; Spectral density; Spectroscopy; Channel constraints; Dc-free; Digital information; Error correction capability; Frequency spectra; Interleavers; Interleaving methods; Knuth; Codes (symbols)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039946539

Distributed generation and storage facilities near the load centers are probably the most important concepts that are used to improve the quality and the reliability of the consumed energy. Siting and sizing of DG generations in distribution systems may create several problems in traditional radial power systems, which were originally designed for unidirectional power flows. This paper presents an optimal DG allocation and sizing approach in a traditional distribution network where the whole year load variation is taken into account. Optimization aims to minimize both the total voltage variation, TVV, in a day and daily percentage energy losses along the feeder branches. The two objectives are first formulated as singular optimization problems and then combined in a multi-optimization problem. Meta-heuristic Cuckoo search algorithm is used to solve the resulting constrained optimization problem. The proposed formulation is applied to a 12-bus radial distribution system and the MATLAB simulations are performed to validate the performance of the approach. © 2017 IEEE.","daily energy losses; distributed generation; smart grids; voltage violations","Constrained optimization; Distributed power generation; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Energy dissipation; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; MATLAB; Smart power grids; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Cuckoo search algorithms; Distributed generation and storage; Optimization problems; Radial distribution networks; Radial distribution systems; Smart grid; Voltage violation; Optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039944076

Indonesian government has stated that basic need of electricity is 60 kWh, however it is not easy to fulfill it. Fortunately, Indonesia is rich in biomass potency. Therefore, converting biomass energy to electricity might be a solution to the country electricity problem. A simple thermal energy harvesting system comprised of biomass burner and thermoelectric generator was investigated. Hot water storage was introduced to provide steady temperature. This paper specifically reported about the fuel storage mechanism of the proposed system. Two fuel storage mechanisms are investigated: integrated and bulk storage types. Integrated storage is a fuel storage facility that is included on energy harvesting device which useful in short-term operation, while bulk storage is located external of energy harvesting device which normally used for long-term operation. Based on the specification of pellet type, which is referred to EN 14961-1 standard, calculation shown that the largest volume of integrated fuel storage type for 168 hours of operation is 0.345 m3, while the bulk fuel storage type is 4.728 m3 for 6 months of operation. © 2017 IEEE.","biomass; fuel storage dimension; Indonesia; minimum electric energy; remote household; thermoelectric generator","Biomass; Electronic equipment; Energy conversion; Energy harvesting; Fuels; Rural areas; Technical presentations; Thermoelectric energy conversion; Thermoelectric equipment; Electric energies; Electric energy conversion; Energy harvesting device; Indonesia; remote household; Rural electrification; Short-term operation; Thermoelectric generators; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037063349

The implementation of alternative energy saving technologies is often not realized due to various factors hampering the implementation thereof. Thermally Activated Building Systems (TABS) is one of such technologies that utilize the inherent heat storage capacity of a building's concrete structure for comfort heating and cooling purposes. The concrete's heat storage capacity and various other factors need to be accounted for in order to dynamically predict the heat transfer behaviour of such systems. In this study, a commercial software program (MS Excel) was used to develop a two-dimensional FDM heat transfer model capable of dynamically predicting the air and surface temperatures of an enclosure. An experimental model was constructed and used to experimentally validated temperature predictions obtained from the FDM model. The average prediction accuracy of the heat transfer model ranged between -0.4°C and +1.4°C for the enclosure's surface temperatures and varied by +0.7°C for the enclosure's air temperature. © 2017 Cape Peninsula University of technology.","cooling; electricity; energy saving; heat storage capacity and natural resources; heating","Air conditioning; Atmospheric temperature; Concretes; Cooling; Cooling systems; Electricity; Enclosures; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Finite difference method; Forecasting; Heat storage; Heating; Natural resources; Surface properties; Commercial software; Experimental modeling; Heat storage capacity; Heat transfer model; Heating-ventilation-air-conditioning systems; Surface temperatures; Temperature prediction; Thermally activated; Heat transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033404273

These water transfer schemes are high energy consumers due to the large pumps utilised for distributing water over great distances against significant static heads. With the present electricity situation in the country, Eskom invested in, among others, Demand-Side Management (DSM) interventions to ease the load on the electrical grid during peak hours. A transfer scheme's pump station that utilises Variable Speed Drive (VSD) technology for pump control was identified for a possible load management intervention. To develop an optimised control philosophy that utilises the VSD technology, tests were conducted on the pump station. Data gathered from these tests was used for the verification of a simulation model built to verify the proposed optimised control philosophy. After the proposed strategy was simulated and optimised, control and maintenance constraints limited the implementation of the control philosophy. The simulation however, indicated that an annual electricity cost savings of approximately R 3.3 million can be achieved. Due to the constraints, it was not possible to implement the load management initiative for a significant part of 2016. During periods when the pump station was operating at a reduced capacity, a 2.29 MW evening peak load reduction was achieved. This equates to a daily cost saving of R10 000 during the winter high demand season. © 2017 Cape Peninsula University of technology.","Demand Side Management (DSM) strategies; Pump control; Variable Speed Drives (VSDs); water transfer schemes","Demand side management; Digital storage; Electric load management; Electric power plant loads; Electric utilities; Pumps; Variable speed drives; Control philosophies; Electrical grids; Electricity costs; Management interventions; Peak load reductions; Pump control; Simulation model; Water transfers; Potable water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033402235

In a dairy farm, the bulk milk cooler (BMC) should cool milk from a temperature of 35°C to a storage temperature of 4°C. Since the BMC is the major equipment used to extract heat from the milk, it is important to understand the efficiency of the system in a bid to reduce demand in dairy farms. This study presents a comparative analysis on the COP of a direct expansion BMC to establish its performance under the morning (AM) and late afternoon (PM) milking times. A data acquisition system was designed to capture the power consumption of the BMC, refrigerant temperature at the compressor and condenser inlet and outlet points, milk temperature as well as the relative humidity and ambient temperature. Findings from the study showed that on average the COP of the AM milking time was higher (2.20) than that of the PM milking time of the BMC (1.93). It was noted that, increase in milk volume led to increase in the COP such that the peak period with high milk volumes recorded high COP increase by 12.61% and 19.81% for the AM and PM milking times respectively. Notwithstanding, the performance of the BMC was also directly influenced by the change in ambient temperature. © 2017 Cape Peninsula University of technology.","bulk milk cooler; coefficient of performance; milk cooling","Cooling systems; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Farms; Temperature; bulk milk cooler; Coefficient of Performance; Comparative analysis; Dairy processing; Data acquisition system; Direct expansion; Refrigerant temperature; Storage temperatures; Dairies",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033401482

To deal with this obstacle, we propose a multilevel cell which stores two bits per memory cell. In addition, we propose a novel sensing scheme to read out the stored data in the multilevel SOT-MRAM cell.

Thereby, it's necessary to implement an energy storage system. Among the energy storage devices, the battery is a promising solution that has higher energy storage density, but the inconvenience is the low power density and limited charge/discharge cycles. The supercapacitor guarantees a long cycle life and has a large range of operating temperatures, but suffers from a low energy density and high cost. Combining the two storage devices is possible to obtain good compromise in terms of energy density and a long cycle life. This paper, present a hybrid energy storage with a photovoltaic energy source, that consists of a combination of battery and supercapacitor, where both are connected to the DC bus. An energy management strategy is proposed for the hybrid energy storage with a view to improve the performance of the battery storage. The simulation result has been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the integration of supercapacitor in the photovoltaic energy storage. However, the obtained results of the comparison of photovoltaic energy storage without supercapacitor and with supercapacitor prove that the electrical stresses on the battery are reduced by introducing the supercapacitors. © 2017 IEEE.","Battery; component; Energy Management; Photovoltaic; Supercapacitor","Charging (batteries); Electric batteries; Energy management; Energy storage; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Supercapacitor; Battery; Charge/discharge cycle; component; Energy management strategies; Energy storage density; Energy storage systems; Management and controls; Photovoltaic; Storage management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034740519

Specifically, the proposed control scheme online detects any problematic battery cell through a supervisory monitoring scheme that oversees the main monitoring system of battery pack. Then, a matrix power switches system connects the SC-bank in parallel with the problematic cell, in order to attain voltage equalization with the other battery cells. Moreover, urgent energy assistance is provided to any weak cells in case of high dynamic conditions, by aiming to keep their voltage as close as possible to the voltage of the other series connected cell unites. The SC-bank is connected to a problematic battery cell through a bidirectional non-isolated dc-dc converter.

To avoid battery deep charging and discharging and prolong its service life, a multi-source coordinated control strategy for islanded DC microgrid is proposed based on battery's state of charge (SOC).

These stations are characterised by an important flexibility but are subject to operational restrictions due to their limited capacity. Currently, their added value is therefore derived when they are included within an existing portfolio. Storage utilities are consequently mainly participating in power markets related to the transmission grid, even when they are installed at the medium-voltage level. In this context, this work aims at quantifying their impact on the operating conditions of the distribution network. More particularly, the investigated case study illustrates that such storage plants may have a significant negative impact on the distribution network operation. © 2017 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

This innovative and experimental storage system provides MV electric supply to a university campus, thus providing real operational data to validate the proposed use cases.

However, the uncertainty factors resulting from electricity users will exert an effect on its economic benefits. To compensate for power shortage, an energy storage capacity optimisation model is developed based on grading compensation rules. The bounded unresponsive load caused by customers' usage habits and subjectivity is represented by a truncated normal distribution model. Moreover, according to the percentage of unresponsive load, LAs are classified into four grades, facing different compensation standards and market admission rules. Through examples of Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) historical load data, it is proved that the model is capable of solving energy storage capacity optimisation problems for LAs to reduce the effects of unresponsive load. Besides, another conclusion can be drawn that rational market rules can spur LAs onto upgrade their resources, which will definitely contribute to stable and reliable market operation. © 2017 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The project presented in this paper is about the design and implementation of an ESS made from disposed electric vehicle (EV) li-ion batteries. These batteries can hold up to 80% of their initial rated capacity. The proposed ESS uses load demand forecasting using exponential smoothing method. The forecasts produced by the Holt-Winters Taylor exponential smoothing are fed to a microcontroller that controls the charging and the discharging of the proposed ESS through a bidirectional AC-to-DC converter. The charging of the ESS happens at low demand of electricity, or when the renewable resources have an output.

The experiment proved that the computing speed of the proposed algorithm is significantly higher than the traditional algorithm and the time-frequency distribution verifies the effectiveness of this proposed algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","Dictionary; IC engine; Matching Pursuit; Time-frequency distribution","Engines; Glossaries; Integrated circuits; Internal combustion engines; Time series analysis; Timing circuits; Vibration analysis; IC engines; Matching pursuit; Matching pursuit algorithms; Nonstationary signals; Over-complete dictionaries; Storage requirements; Time-frequency atoms; Time-frequency distributions; Signal processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034581742

One possible solution is processing-in-memory (PIM) which moves several logic components into the main memory to accelerate the logic computation. Recently, the concept of processing-in-nonvolatile-memory (PINVM) was proposed to against the technology issue in which the DRAM and logic technology require different metal layer. In addition, PINVM has the potential to mitigates the thermal influence of 3D-Technology based PIM. Spin-orbit-Torque (SOT) Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) is one of promising NVMs with high energy-efficiency, fast switching, separate read/write paths etc. In this paper, we propose a concept of reconfigurable processing-in-SOT MRAM (PISOTM) architecture to integrate reconfigurable logic into non-volatile memory. We extend the existing main memory interface and modify the controller to obtained various arithmetic function. Several dataintensive workloads are selected to evaluate the performance of our proposed PISOTM architecture.

In addition, the tight expense control of electronic products promotes the localization of devices, In which a variety of domestic devices have been used. The brass(Cu-Zn alloy) pins plated with gold(Au) and tin lead(SnPb) layers have poor solderability and frequent quality problems after a period of storage. By comparison, the main difference between the domestic device and the imported device is the plating layer structure. In this study, 3 kinds of samples are used. By SEM(Scanning Electron Microscope), EDS(Energy Dispersive Spectrometer) and XPS(X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) tests, it was found that the sample with nickel(Ni) plating layer and the copper(Cu) plating layer had the best wettability between the pin and the solder, and the relative content of Zinc(Zn) diffused from the brass in the Au plating layer was below 5%, which was lower than that in the sample with neither Ni plating layer nor Cu plating layer, about 10%. The formation of Zinc oxide(ZnO) on the surface of unplated sample was also confirmed. The conclusion is that the Ni plating layer and the Cu plating layer played a role of the barrier layer, which effectively prevented the diffusion of zinc from brass to the plating layer and the surface oxidation, which resulted in the nonwetting behavior between pins and Pb37Sn63 solder. © 2017 IEEE.","barrier layer; brass; diffusion of Zn; Ni plating layer","Binary alloys; Brass; Copper alloys; Copper plating; Diffusion; Diffusion barriers; Electron devices; Electronics packaging; Gold; Lead alloys; Nickel; Nickel plating; Scanning electron microscopy; Spectrometers; Tin alloys; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zinc; Zinc alloys; Zinc oxide; Zirconium alloys; Barrier layers; Electronic product; Energy dispersive spectrometers; Ni plating; Nonwetting behavior; Space electronics; Spacecraft electronics; Surface oxidations; Plating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032785914

Energy harvesting is a promising alternative of battery to power these embedded systems. However, the intrinsic instability of energy harvesting systems leads to potential frequent power interruptions. In order to survive the power failures, non-volatile processor (NVP) is proposed to back up volatile information before power depletion and recover the system status after power resumes. Non-volatile memory (NVM) is typically attached for cache and main memory backup. There are researches working on optimization of the backup, however, little of them involve multiple level cell (MLC) NVM. In this work, we first discuss the benefit of applying MLC NVM for cache backup, and then propose a three-stage energy-aware cache management strategy to improve the system performance and energy utilization while guaranteeing successful backups. Evaluation shows that the proposed scheme can achieve 16.7% energy reduction with comparative performance with the single level cell (SLC) based hybrid cache. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cache memory; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Energy harvesting; Energy utilization; Industrial research; Outages; Real time systems; Comparative performance; Energy harvesting systems; Energy reduction; Intrinsic instability; Multiple-level cells; Non-volatile memory; Power interruptions; Single level cells; Power management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032725624

Despite its capability for line-speed queries, it is very power hungry and capacity inefficient. Many recent research efforts, such as CoolCAMs and SmartPC, were proposed to reduce power consumption by constructing a pre-classifier to activate TCAM blocks selectively. However, these efforts achieve power savings at the expense of poor utilization of TCAM capacity, and the potential of power reduction is not fully exploited in many cases. In this paper, we propose MEET-IP, a memory and energy efficient two-stage scheme for TCAM based IP routing table lookup. Based on a top-down optimization of partitioning algorithm, routing tables can be evenly split into TCAM blocks without memory holes or a large amount of index TCAM. Experimental results based on real routing tables show that our design achieves more than 98% power reduction with a TCAM storage overhead of less than 3% on average. © 2017 IEEE.","IP routing table lookup; Memory efficient; Power reduction; TCAM","Computer networks; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Logic gates; Routers; Table lookup; IP routing; Memory efficient; Partitioning algorithms; Power reductions; Recent researches; Storage overhead; TCAM; Ternary content addressable memory; Ternary content adressable memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032265057

Among all the solutions to extend the network lifetime, relay mechanism plays a crucial role. However, previous works only concentrate on energy efficiency of sensor nodes regardless of energy storage diversity among sensor nodes, which may severely limit the performance of enhancing the network lifetime of WBANs. In this paper, a Lifetime Enhanced Relay Selection Scheme is proposed under the topology constrains specified in IEEE 802.15.6 standard which considers both energy consumption rate and sensor's energy condition. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared to existing relay selection methods, the proposed scheme is more suitable for WBANs and has better performance in extending lifetime of WBANs. The simulation results also show that maximizing network lifetime is equivalent to equalizing the residual energy among sensor nodes. © 2017 IEEE.","consumption rate; lifetime; relay selection; residual energy; Wireless Body Area Networks(WBANs)","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Numerical methods; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication repeaters; Wireless networks; Consumption rates; lifetime; Relay selection; Residual energy; Wireless body area network; Wireless local area networks (WLAN)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032434243

Smart grids (SG) have been proposed as a mechanism to modernize and facilitate the operation of energy grids in the presence of multiple third-parties vying to sell electricity and related services. Recently, a new concept has emerged in relation with SG: transactive energy - a framework to integrate and coordinate multiple independent suppliers of electric services in an economic marketplace that enables purchases in a way that obeys the physical constrains of the underlying energy grid. Our team is developing a transactive energy framework called Open Access Smart Grids (OASIS). OASIS features a distribution-level marketplace where the underlying electric resources and services are open to access and provisioned by third parties. In this paper, we present a cloudbased and big data-enabled brokerage system for Smart grids, which is a critical component of OASIS. In this brokerage system, consumer energy requests, and energy bids issued by producers, are collected and matched to find a list of energy purchase orders to be dispatched to the winning producers.

Especially in aerospace where radiation is quite intense, the stability and correctness of systems are greatly affected. By exploiting the beneficial features of high radiation resistance and non-volatility, spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM), a kind of emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM), is promising to be used as registers to avoid errors caused by radiation. However, substituting SRAM with STT-RAM in registers will affect system performance because STT-RAM suffers from long write latency. The early write termination (EWT) method has been accepted as an effective technique to mitigate write problems by terminating redundant writes. Based on the above background, this paper proposes to build registers by STT-RAM for embedded systems in rad-hard environment. Targeting the microarchitecture level of pipeline, the impact of architecting STT-RAM-based registers is discussed considering data hazard due to data dependencies. Furthermore, integrated with the EWT technique, a Read Merging method is proposed to eliminate redundant normal reads or sensing reads which are conducted along with a write. As a result of carrying out these actions, the energy and performance can be improved greatly. The results report 68% (and 75%) and 32% (and 39%) improvements on performance (and energy) by the proposed Read Merging method compared to the cases where STT-RAM is naively used as registers and intelligently used by integrating EWT, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Big data; Data privacy; Electromagnetic waves; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Merging; Pipelines; Radiation effects; Radiation hardening; Random access storage; Static random access storage; Data dependencies; Emerging non-volatile memory; High radiation resistance; Micro architectures; Nonvolatility; Pipeline optimization; Single event upsets; Spin transfer torque; Data communication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032370886

Here, battery degradation includes two parts, one is the degradation caused by battery temperature during EVs' charging and discharging; another is the degradation caused by the depth of discharge (DoD). Considering the real-time electricity price, the optimum operation of each hour, i.e., charging, discharging or frequency regulation, can be obtained by V2G control center.

In this paper, an improved virtual impedance based coordinated control strategy for distributed SCs is proposed to achieve accurate power distribution. Unlike the existed strategy which can hardly adjust the output power of each SC if the energy storage system contains several distributed SCs, the proposed control scheme can allocate the output power of each SC according to the state-of-charge (SOC) without causing current oscillations. The power distribution among each SC is realized based on low-bandwidth-communication (LBC). And power distribution coefficients which are proportional to the SOC of each SC are introduced. By appropriate tuning the coefficients, the accurate power distribution of SCs is achieved. This method can not only supply energy instantly under transient conditions caused by loads or sources, but also realize precise power distribution between SCs. Meanwhile, this coordinated control strategy which has improved reliability is simple to implement, since it only uses local controllers and LBC network to exchange information between SCs. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by simulation results. © 2017 Technical Committee on Control Theory, CAA.","DC microgrid; low-bandwidth-communication (LBC); power distribution; Supercapacitor (SC); virtual impedance",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032202688

Considering each charger as an agent, the current-sharing control design can be modeled as the output current consensus-tracking problem of nonlinear and non-identical multi-agent systems with the bounded control input. The communication topology between each parallel charger is modeled a directed graph, which only needs a spanning tree. In order to guarantee the boundedness of the control input, a general saturation function is introduced into the control law.

The system stability and dynamic performance of the proposed cooperative control scheme is evaluated by analyzing the transfer function matrix from the input duty ratio to the output current.

The second objective of the controller is to control the electric vehicle to track a predefined speed profile. The dynamics of the vehicle and the supercapacitors are modeled from first principles to facilitate the controller design. It is assumed that the battery, as the primary energy source for the vehicle, is properly sized such that there is no need to control its state-of-charge.

The emerging memory technology-phase change memory (PCM) is proposed to break the bottleneck of the current memory system. However, its weaknesses in write endurance and long access latency make it cannot fully replace DRAM. Consequently, researchers presented the architectural design aimed at DRAM/PCM hybrids and the corresponding page migration scheme to give full play to their merits. The urgent challenges facing by existed page migration schemes are poor performed under weak locality in data streams and further improvement need in prediction of future access tendency. In this paper, we propose an efficient page migration policy called DualStack which features dynamic page management according to global read and write information and temporal locality. It is designed to keep write-intensive pages to DRAM and read-intensive pages to PCM, and specially avoid frequent and unnecessary migration between hybrid memory media.

In this paper, the effects of storage and bandwidth on OCS network performance and the principles of trading storage for bandwidth are discussed. Our research indicates that bandwidth is fair to flows with different sizes and is insensitive to different mean flow durations under the same load. On the contrary, the networks with massive storage are tend to discard larger flows and have favourable blocking rate to flows with smaller mean size. These results suggest that to achieve better performance in networks with mass storage, large flows should be split before transmitted to the network.

The ability to define network resources (e.g. routing/switching elements, bandwidth) in this context is still scarce, but there are clear evidences that this is a future reality. In this article, we consider that cloud infrastructure services will allow the definition of complete infrastructures, to which we refer as Virtual Infrastructures (VIs). These VIs comprise computing, storage and network resources. This article specifically tackles the VI embedding problem, which is known to be NP-hard. Having in mind this fact, different embedding strategies based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation are presented. The problem is addressed by proposing strategies that target load balancing and energy consumption of physical resources along with re-optimization strategies. A thorough evaluation of the different strategies is performed, studying the VI acceptance ratio, physical infrastructure energy consumption, and the impact of reconfigurations. Results show that there is a clear tradeoff between improving the VI acceptance ratio and reducing the physical infrastructure usage without allowing re-optimizations.

The system operator usually generates a signal which is called, Area Control Error (ACE), based on the difference between these two parameters. The expected goal is to keep the system near nominal frequency value. Traditionally, frequency regulation is managed by varying the output of power stations connected to the electric grid. The article presents a method in which electric energy, which is necessary for power balance keeping, is recycled, in the system. First, the system absorbs energy when it is in abundance, then discharges the same for the desired frequency regulation effect. The method is based on kinetic energy storage technology in high-speed flywheels (FES).

The ever increasing proportion of intermittent power sources (wind and solar) in the power system changes the basic paradigm of power engineering economics whereby instead of adjusting generation output to the demand at the time, the focus is shifting towards adjusting consumption based on the output of intermittent generation. That is the goal of the so-called smart grids, where the consumer will be adapting to intermittent generation by responding to price signals. In spite of or rather because of this, there will still be (at the moment, more and more) the need for power sources and appliances that will, at the dispatcher's request, quickly increase or decrease generation or instead of generators become consumers, i.e. their technical parameters enable them to maintain balance between generation and consumption and network frequency within set limits. On the generation side, these are primarily gas turbines and closed cycle gas turbines, pumped storage hydro stations, heat plants with turbines equipped with heat accumulators or accumulating heat into a heat distribution network and networks of CHPs (combined heat and power) also with heat accumulators supplying heat into buildings in a wide area, but centrally controlled. On the demand side, these are HDO systems (a form of ripple control in the Czech Republic) which control appliances that convert electricity into useful heat, which is easier to accumulate for water heating purposes, electrical boilers connected into heat networks and in the future also P2G systems using cheap electricity to break down water into oxygen and hydrogen. Being affiliated with current heat plants, they will utilize carbon from fossil or biofuel combustion for the methanisation of hydrogen and its injection into the natural gas network for the purposes of seasonal energy accumulation. Nonetheless, for accumulation of alternate current over the course of a day to a week it is still the best to make use of the benefits of pumped storage hydro power stations which remain to be a proven form of electricity accumulation in the grid. The vast majority of them are designed and constructed in mountainous regions so that they can take advantage of the differences in elevation of the landscape. This appears to be at odds with nature protection interests. The paper concentrates on a location of an active lignite quarry in the northwest of the Czech Republic, where the interests of nature protection would not be affected. From an economical perspective, in the case of a pumped storage hydro station, capital expenditure is key and therefore the paper also includes an assessment of the economic viability of the project, through the valuation of the effects resulting from the provision of ancillary services to the transmission system.","Accumulator of energy; Ancillary services; Conventional power units; Economic efficiency of investments; Flooded quarry; Income from services provisions; Income from services sales; Investment outlay; Photovoltaic panels; Power balance; Power to gas; Pumped storage power plant; Reclamation after mining; System services; Transmission power system; Wind turbines","Boiler control; Carbon; Closed cycle machinery; Cogeneration plants; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric equipment protection; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Hydroelectric power plants; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Plants (botany); Pumped storage power plants; Quarries; Wide area networks; Wind turbines; Accumulator of energy; Ancillary service; Conventional power; Economic efficiency; Income from services provisions; Photovoltaic panels; Power balance; System services; Transmission power systems; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029668441

However, such an arrangement results in large oscillating components in the battery current, which is harmful to battery performance and lifetime. In most literature this is solved using DC-DC converters as active interfaces between battery and submodule. This paper investigates a passive filter arrangement as an alternative solution to the DC-DC converters. Where the batteries are interfaced with the submodules using a passive filter that suppresses the fundamental component and control technique that injects circulating current to suppress second harmonic component. It is concluded that this passive technique could be an attractive solution especially where high reliability is of concern. © 2017 IEEE.","Battery Energy Storage System (BESS); circulating current injection; integrated split-battery; Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC); passive filter interface","DC-DC converters; Electric batteries; Electric inverters; Energy storage; Power control; Power converters; Power electronics; Alternative solutions; Battery energy storage systems; Circulating current; Fundamental component; integrated split-battery; Modular multi-level converters; Oscillating components; Second harmonic component; Passive filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029319999

The proposed MPPT is featured with Optimized Finite-Control-Set Model Predictive Control (FCS-MPC) to provide continuous extraction of maximum solar energy. The estimation-based approach allows for elimination of the current sensors in PV panels unlike the well-proven MPPT methods, e.g., perturb and observe (P&O) and ripple-correlation control (RCC), where costly sensing devices are widely deployed. With developed control strategy, fast tracking response for the PV plant along with acceptable control bandwidth under solar irradiation transients and PV panels mismatch are achieved. The introduced circuit of power conversion has led to decreased number of solar cells and a 50% reduction of the energy storage sizing compared to the basic MMC configuration. The effectiveness of the discussed MPPT solution over the solar irradiance variations is compared with the both P&O and RCC methods. The behavior of the studied PV system is also evaluated under different operational scenarios through simulations to confirm the designed concept. © 2017 IEEE.","Maximum Power Point Trackers; Model Predictive Control; Multilevel Power Converter; Optimization problem; Photovoltaic generation; Sensorless operation","Maximum power point trackers; Model predictive control; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Power converters; Power electronics; Predictive control systems; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Modular multi-level converters; Multilevel power converters; Optimization problems; Photovoltaic generation; Ripple correlation control; Sensorless operation; Solar photovoltaic power; Power control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029318520

As seismic diffractions carry valuable information related to these geological structures and discontinuities, diffraction imaging is an effective tool for this type of reservoirs. In this paper, we apply diffraction imaging technique in a study area of Tarim Basin and make comprehensive analysis of weak diffraction energy from different perspectives. The basic function using diffraction imaging dataset is for more accurate detection of dissolved caves, which has been emphasized in recent years. One step further is to utilize weak diffraction energy for fault system recognition. Two more issues are involved here when using diffraction imaging dataset: It is found that weak diffractions may cast some new lights on reservoir connectivity analysis, which is crucial for oil and gas development stage. Besides, weak diffractions also give some clues between well production and reservoir scale. © 2017 SEG.",,"Carbonation; Caves; Diffraction; Geophysical prospecting; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum reservoirs; Carbonate reservoir; Diffraction energy; Diffraction imaging; Matrix porosity; Oil and gas; Pores and fractures; Reservoir characterization; Storage spaces; Tarim Basin; Western China; Dissolution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113860377

Despite this potential and the advantages it presents over conventional geophone arrays, challenges remain regarding geometrical sensitivity and noise-floors. Furthermore, there has been little application of DAS systems at Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) injection sites. Here, we present the results of hammer blow field experiments, in subzero conditions using a single cable DAS recording setup. We test different data processing routines and compute Signal to Noise Ratios (SNRs) in the time and frequency domains. We find that most energy is observed in the 20-600 Hz band and that SNR ratios are approximately half those of geophones, which record simultaneously. An STA/LTA automated trigger detection routine performs well for the majority of the DAS recording channels but with some detections not defining the expected hyperbolic move-out with distance for common arrivals. These likely represent later, secondary arrival phases, possibly reflections from the frozen-unfrozen ground interface. Despite this, using a single homogenous velocity model it is possible to locate the hammer blows to within 3.9 m of their actual locations. These encouraging initial results will be used to tailor the setup and acquisition parameters in further field and laboratory tests. This will ultimately lead to the preinjection site characterization and subsequent microseismic monitoring of active CCS sites in the future. © 2017 SEG.",,"Acoustic noise; Carbon capture; Data handling; Digital storage; Geophysical prospecting; Seismology; Acoustic sensing; Condition; Emerging technologies; Field experiment; Geophone array; Hammer blow; Noise floor; Sensing systems; Sensing techniques; Storage sites; Signal to noise ratio",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106217992

It often works with some independent plants of renewable energy that work together under the circumstances of center control.

The emerging technologies are connecting to the grid via power converters which means that these are practically decoupled from the grid parameter changes. This reduction of the system inertia could lead to higher rate of change of frequency and deviations. One of the possible solutions is providing the inertial response through controlling to enhance the stability.

With wind generators and energy storage devices provided synthetic inertia to the system during frequency excursions the load shedding could be avoided in the simulation studies. With the evaluation concepts presented, the optimization of synthetic inertia activations can be planned.

Users can be relieved of the burden of storage and computation, by outsourcing the large data files to the cloud servers. However, from the cloud service providers' point of view, it is wise to utilize the data deduplication techniques to reduce the costs of running large storage system and energy consumption on cloud servers. Based on the dynamic nature of data in the cloud storage system, we not only need to assure the data integrity with an auditing protocol supporting dynamic data operations for users, but also consider resorting to data deduplication techniques in the dynamic data operations for cloud service providers to achieve the goal of reducing costs. Thus, in this paper, we propose a mechanism that combines data deduplication with dynamic data operations in the privacy preserving public auditing for secure cloud storage. The analysis of security and performance shows that the proposed mechanism is highly efficient and provably secure. © 2017 IEEE.","cloud computing; cloud storage; data deduplication; dynamic data operation; privacy-preserving auditing; public auditing","Cloud computing; Cost reduction; Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Dynamics; Energy utilization; Green computing; Ubiquitous computing; Cloud storages; Data de duplications; Dynamic data; Privacy preserving; Public auditing; Data privacy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034651637

These curves are function of instantaneous solar irradiation and cell temperature; and outline the maximum power that the system can supply at any given moment. As a consequence of this PV systems lack overload capacity, which is common in traditional rotating generators; and therefore, PV systems cannot supply short term or transient load demands. To solve this issue two approaches can be taken; one is to constantly operate the PV system below its maximum power level, which has the drawback of non-optimal energy harvesting. The other is integration of energy storage elements to the power conditioning system, which allows optimizing power generation, while adding overload capacity. In addition, this approach also allows smoothing out short term irradiation variations allowing the system to improve energy harvesting. Focusing on the second approach analysis of short term energy storage requirements in PV systems is performed in this paper. As a result, sizing guidelines and a design procedure for a supercapacitor based energy storage system are developed. In addition, effectiveness of the proposed method on improving PV generator performance is tested and verified through computer simulations. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy Storage; Photovoltaics; Short term Transients; Supercapacitors","Design; Electric generators; Energy harvesting; Energy resources; Irradiation; Renewable energy resources; Supercapacitor; Energy storage systems; Overload capacity; Photovoltaics; Power conditioning systems; Short term; Solar irradiation; Storage elements; Storage requirements; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028504347

As base load power plants cater the power demand throughout the day, the peak power plants have to be operated only during the high demand time. Since the running cost of peak load power plants are extremely high compared to base load plants, the suppliers are always trying to reduce the peak load using many techniques. As in pumped storage hydro power plants, energy storage systems can absorb energy during the off peak time and supply the energy back to the system during peak time. In this research, the objective was to find a system that virtually acts like a pumped storage power plant at consumers' premise. It was found that using a battery bank, the energy can be stored and supplied to the premise to reduce the peak load. The feasibility study of the proposed system has been carried out and the results shows the storage system can reduce the peak load at the consumer premise and hence make and impact to reduce the peak load in a utility as well. By making the peak load reduced, it was proposed to reduce the toxic gas emission of peak load power plants. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy conservation; Energy storage; Peak clipping","Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Gas plants; Pumped storage power plants; Secondary batteries; Base-load power; Energy storage systems; Feasibility studies; Peak clipping; Pumped-storage hydro; Storage battery; Storage systems; Toxic gas emissions; Hydroelectric power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034662306

In the proposed model, we use internet of things concept to predict the energy consumption and time travel between two chosen points source and destination. In fact, each car sends the state of the road to the data center: accidents, crowded streets, road works, etc. Based on the real-time traffic information and the state of roads, the application calculates the estimation of energy consumption, to aid the driver in piloting the truck in a safe and economical manner. Drivers then, choose the optimal route that reduce the energy consumption which may be the longest one.

The nonlinear DC-link voltage loop model is globally linearized by treating the square of DC-link voltage as the state variable and lumping the nonlinear and uncertain terms in the power balance equation as the total disturbance. An Extended State Observer (ESO) is designed to observe the total disturbance, and a control law which compensates the speed variation and the total disturbance is proposed.

To compensate for the intermittent nature of the renewable energy resources like solar, wind, biomass, etc. storage systems must be employed in this types of microgrids. Energy storage systems are based mainly on batteries. Different batterie technologies are used: gel lead acid, valve regulated lead acid, flooded lead acid, Lithium-ion, LiFePO4, etc. One major challenge when using LiFePO4 in this application is their higher cost compared to the other types combined with performance degradation uncertainties. To address this challenge and allow optimal use of this type of batteries accurate knowledge about lifetime and accurate lifetime models are needed. In this paper a test bench and results for LiFePO4 battery pack life cycle are presented in order to investigate the opportunity to use such batteries as storage devices in renewable energy microgrids.

The usage of the BESS is multi-objective. It could be a part of large-scale virtual power plant, or a part of frequency containment reserve (FCR), and simultaneously operate as a backup power source. In such, part of the storage capacity could considered to be shared between the customers, electricity traders, distribution network company and the transmission system operator. In order to increase efficiency of the BESS operation and capacity allocation, information from the energy end-users could be used. Similarly, the energy resources in end-users' homes can be used to provide flexibility. Control of loads, such as heating, cooling and ventilation within the boundary conditions of the in-house climate can be used simultaneously with the energy storage resources for similar purposes or to support the BESS functionalities.

The challenging issue of controlling and analyzing an autonomous dc microgrid with different RES units operating at their maximum power point (MPP), through the sharing regulation of energy storage systems (ESS) is presented in this paper. In particular, droop-based dc voltage regulation is implemented exclusively on the converter interface of each ESS involved. The well-known cascaded mode control technique is adopted with the fast inner-loop current controllers to be included in the analysis of the complete dc microgrid system. Also, in order to concentrate on the system dynamic performance, as it is achieved by the ESS charging or discharging, an adequately detailed model of the Li-ion battery is used; in contrary, the different RESs are inserted as simple current sources, with varying current values determined by the supervisory MPP tracking mechanism, and are considered as unpredictable piece-wise constant inputs. As proven in the paper and verified by extensive simulations, this scheme can guarantee stability and convergence to steady state equilibrium under several varying resistive loads and RES operating conditions. © 2017 IEEE.","dc microgrids; droop-based regulation; energy storage systems; power converter control; stability","Circuit theory; Convergence of numerical methods; Electric power distribution; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy policy; Energy storage; Lithium-ion batteries; Maximum power point trackers; Renewable energy resources; Voltage regulators; droop-based regulation; Energy storage systems; Micro grid; Power converter control; Reactive power regulation; Renewable energy source; Stability and convergence; System dynamic performance; System stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028637145

An improved control strategy for PFC converters with small storage capacitance suitable for medium and high power is proposed on the basis of conventional ACM PFC, which effectively eliminates third harmonic input current due to the low energy-storage capacitance. Compared to other methods to eliminate electrolytic capacitors, the proposed method has the advantage of nearly unity power factor, suitable for medium and large power application.

This will be done by developing a strategy for enhancing the performance in terms of lifespan, storage capacity and efficiency for LABs-TVs. The technical solution will be proposed by first analyzing the existing technologies deployed around the world (i.e Europe, China, South Africa, United Kingdom and America).

This reduces both the cost of generation and environmental effects. However, this has implications on the frequency stability in that frequency dynamics become faster with low inertia. This makes frequency control complex and difficult and thus frequency stability becomes challenging. The frequency deviation should be kept small as Damaging Vibrations (DV) and Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) occur for large deviations in the worst case, leading to total black out. For example, in Kenya, there has been increased penetration of RE especially wind and solar into the grid.

Due to the randomness and capacity limitation of DG units, the islanding microgrid may face overload challenge with load increasing. The islanding microgrid need massive energy storage system for power reserve or load shedding to maintain microgrid stable. However, this is not ideal solution due to the high construction cost and reliability of power supply.

A flexible load control is proposed to control power electronics load to control its power consumption, which is implemented using converter control variables measured locally. Through the flexible load control strategy, supply-demand balance can be realized automatically, and the system reliability can be maintained and enhanced.

The conventional P-f droop, used to obtain accuracy load sharing, cannot balance the SoC. To overcome the drawback, this paper proposes a unified SoC based droop control method with distributed communication lines. In this scheme, the droop coefficient is changed by the correction information in real-time, which is obtained by the distributed control. Moreover, regardless of charging mode or discharging mode, the unified SoC balancing is able to be guaranteed. Meanwhile, load demand sharing is adjusted by this control method. The model of SoC based droop control is established, and the stability is verified through small signal analysis of the complete system. Finally, the effectiveness of SoC balancing and transient response are verified through simulations. © 2017 IEEE.","droop control; power sharing; small signal stability; SoC balancing","Distributed parameter control systems; Distributed communications; Distributed control; Droop control; Droop control method; Energy storage systems; Power sharing; Small signal stability; Small-signal analysis; Signal analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034107365

But the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources causes obvious impact on the conventional power systems especially the control strategies. In order to solve the problem, microgrid is introduced, which usually consists of distributed generators(DG), storage system, loads and converters. There are two kinds of microgrid: DC microgrid and AC microgrid. Compare with AC microgrid, the conversion loss and transmission loss of DC microgrid is lower, furthermore, its control strategy is less complex. Due to the advantages of DC microgrid, it has drawn increasing attention in recent years especially the coordinated control of DC microgrid, which is very essential for the correct operation of DC microgrid. The control methods of DC microgrid can be divided into two categories: centralized control and distributed control. Since centralized control strongly relies on communication system, it gradually replaced by the distributed control, which can further classified into many subcategories such as droop control and hierarchical control. Compared with centralized control and droop control, hierarchical control method is easier and reduce the dependence of communication system, so the reliability of this control method can be ensured. In this paper, a hierarchical control strategy is provided to improve the operation performance of DC microgrid. The crowbar control and load shedding control are also included in this hierarchical control strategy.

Two such cases will be considered in this work: the photovoltaic (PV) power plant, and the electric bus. Variable nature of solar irradiation owing to local meteorological and environmental conditions, makes it impossible to deliver energy from PV plants at the power level corresponding to the clear-sky model. Energy storage systems equipped with ultracapacitors (UC) can cope with the rapid power fluctuations, and stabilize the output power for several tens of minutes. Computer simulations have been carried out on the clear-sky model superimposed with the actual power fluctuation data obtained in the field from a 50 kW PV power plant. Two UC modules of 63F/125V are connected in series to store/deliver energy by means of a bidirectional buck/boost converter, so as to compensate for the short-term active power fluctuations. As the second case study, the use of UCs during acceleration and deceleration time periods of a 250 kW electric bus is simulated to decrease the overall stress of the built-in battery, and to increase the operating efficiency.

The active storage unit (ASU) is employed to absorb SHC with ASU's input current (iasu) following SHC. In order to accurately extract ASU's current reference (iasu∗) in a simple way, a real-time calculation method is proposed. At the same time, an adaptive method is also proposed in which iasu∗ changes adaptively according to load, line frequency and ripple energy handled by output capacitor. As a result, ASU is turned off under light load and absorbs partial ripple energy under heavy load to meet the voltage ripple requirement. Moreover, peak voltage control is introduced to improve efficiency when the ASU operates under light load. Therefore, ASU's power loss is reduced and voltage ripple is well controlled within limit. The proposed control strategy is verified by experiment results on a 1.3kW prototype with TMS320F28335 digital controller. © 2017 IEEE.","Acitive Storage Unit; Adaptive Control; Digital Control; Effciency Optimization; Peak Voltage Control; Single-phase PFC converter","Digital control systems; Voltage control; Adaptive Control; Digital control; Digital controllers; Efficiency optimization; PFC converters; Real-time calculations; Single-phase power; Storage units; Electric power factor correction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034031718

First, the boost converter with an input capacitor is taken as an example, and its small signal model including the dynamic equivalent circuit of solar cell is built up. Based on this, the stable condition of the PVES system in constant voltage charging (CVC) mode is deduced with Routh stability criterion, which indicates that environmental factors as well as load condition affect the system stability, in deed, by influencing the small signal dynamic resistance rD of diode in solar cell. And, the system stability gets worse with the decrease of rD. Besides, the junction-capacitance of solar cell also has impact on system stability. Hence, the output voltage controller should be designed with rD=0, which means the junction-capacitance is shorted (its effect can be ignored) and the load reaches its minimum value. The controller parameters obtained with this method can ensure the PVES system operate stably throughout the entire variation range of environmental factors as well as charging power. Finally, the correctness of theoretical analysis has been verified by a 150W prototype. © 2017 IEEE.","constant voltage charging; energy storage system; photovoltaic; robust PI controller; stability","Capacitance; Controllers; Convergence of numerical methods; DC-DC converters; Design; Energy storage; Equivalent circuits; Heterojunction bipolar transistors; Solar cells; Stability criteria; Constant voltage; Dynamic equivalent circuit; Energy storage systems; P-i controller designs; Photovoltaic; PI Controller; Routh stability criterion; Small signal dynamics; System stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034030245

PVs operate as current controlled voltage sources (CCVS). A maximum power point tracking (MPPT) based droop control scheme is introduced to explain the proposed operation mode. Thus, this mode enables PVs to supply an auxiliary service of frequency regulation and a maximum utilization of renewable energy.

The utilities have imposed ramp limitations in some countries or regions, such as Germany, Puerto Rico, Ireland, Hawaii, etc. There are three ways to achieve power ramp-rate control (PRRC), one is by using energy storage system (ESS), the second is active power curtailment, and the third is by using ESS-MPPT hybrid system. The use of ESS is still too expensive for utilities-level real power compensation. It requires maintenance and has limited lifetime. The conventional active power curtailment cannot deal with power drops. In this project, we proposed a PRRC method which does not require any ESS. The PV generation is curtailed before the actual shading occurs by using a forecasting system. The curtailed PV generation has been evaluated by using a case study. The proposed PRRC can limit the ramp-rate effectively. The curtailed generation can be very small in certain cases which could make it has the advantage over ESS. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Energy storage; Hybrid systems; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Active power; Energy storage systems; Forecasting system; Intermittency; Power drops; Power ramp rates; PV generation; Solar photovoltaic power; Power control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033714504

The two parameters are set manually at the present, where exist great subjectivity and randomness, causing great waste of energy. However, the complex mechanism, serious nonlinear and interference of the process make it difficult to establish precise mathematical model to calculated set-points. In order to solve this problem, a method based on case based reasoning is proposed to optimize the set-points of coking gas denitriation process. The case construction, case retrieval, case reuse, case modification and storage are discussed in detail, meanwhile, noticed the defect that the single feature description of current working condition may result in biased solutions of traditional case reuse, a case reuse method based on principal component regression-multiple case fusion is proposed.

Large scale wireless sensor networks (LSWSNs) consists of some them that have sensing, computation, wireless communication, and free-infrastructure abilities. The target signal selection problem in LSWSNs attracts attention of people from academic researchers, industry, and military department. The target signal selection scheme is usually designed for LSWSNs to enhance the percentage of detected targets. However, the target signal selection problem can be formulated as a nonlinear mixed integer optimization problem, which is hard to solve. In this paper, we propose a chaotic immune niche genetic algorithm (CINGA) based target signal selection approach for maximizing the percentage of detected targets. We first formulate our objective function to maximize the percentage of detected targets under multiple constraints. The proposed algorithm combines the advantages of the high efficiency of immune operation and the global search ability of the chaotic generator. An analysis is given to show the correctness of CINGA, and simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance improvement of CINGA against parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) and ant colony optimization (ACO). Although sub-optimal for LSWSNs, simulation results show that the proposed CINGA allows to reach higher monitoring percentage compared to PGA and ACO approach. Furthermore, it was found that the immune operation helps evolution to avoid local optima. © 2017 IEEE.","Chaotic generator; Niche genetic algorithm; Target signal selection; Wireless sensor networks","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Low power electronics; Microsensors; Nanosystems; Optimization; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Chaotic generators; Large-scale wireless sensor networks; Mixed integer optimization; Niche genetic algorithm; Parallel genetic algorithms; Target signals; Wireless communications; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029353193

Such a hybrid structure demonstrates the main advantages of ac and dc distribution networks, such as easier renewable energy integration and less power conversion losses. A typical hybrid ac/dc DG system consists of: a dc-side, an ac-side and an interlinking voltage source inverter (VSI) as power interface between the two sides. Dc and ac resistive and constant power loads, as well dc and ac distributed energy resources (DERs) are incorporated. To enhance system reliability and dynamic performance, energy storage devices are connected to the dc link, allowing the power to flow in both directions, via a bidirectional boost converter. A challenging issue in the design of a hybrid ac/dc DG system is to apply effective, reliable and robust control in order to ensure stable operation at the desired conditions and to avoid adverse impacts between the different parts. In this frame, opposite to the small signal analysis, existing in the literature, in this paper, a nonlinear control design and analysis of the complete hybrid system is deployed. Based on the accurate system model, cascaded-mode proportional-integral (PI) controllers are designed and suitably implemented to the power electronic interfaces in order to regulate both the ac and dc voltages as well as the ac-side frequency.

The system is composed of a PV array feeding RL load through a dc-dc boost converter and three-phase inverter. To assess the system performance, simulations based on hybrid co-simulation approach are performed. At the outset, the PV model is elaborated using Pspice, verified and compared with experimental data picked up from the measurement. Two maximum power point tracker (MPPT) techniques, Perturb and observe (P&O) and Incremental Conductance (IncCond) are used to drive the boost converter in order to get the maximum power from the PV array. An innovative harmonic elimination pulse width modulation (HEPWM) technique with very high performance is used to generate the gating signals and to drive the inverter stage. Simulations are carried out and good results were obtained, in term of PV extracted power point of view as well as the AC output waveforms quality. © 2016 IEEE.","Co-simulation; MPPT; PV inverter; real-time Harmonic elimination PWM","Digital storage; Electric inverters; Energy conservation; Harmonic analysis; Maximum power point trackers; Photovoltaic cells; Power converters; Pulse width modulation; Voltage control; Cosimulation; DC-DC boost converters; Incremental Conductance (Inc cond); Photovoltaic inverters; PV inverter; Real time; Standalone applications; Three-phase inverter; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027868781

This is particularly true for wind energy which is experiencing significant growth year-on-year. A significant part of this growth is at large-scale commercial power systems. However, there is a growing interest in small-scale renewable energy technologies to capture this intermittent but plentiful resource. A combined wind and solar energy hybrid system utilises two renewable energy resources, in doing so diversifies supply and as a result will make the system power output more stable and continuous. In this paper the details of the hybrid system model, using Matlab Simulink, are given. The model developed, is discussed giving key details on the characteristics of each part of the wind and solar energy hybrid system. The hybrid system model developed includes four subsystems: The solar energy subsystem, the wind energy subsystem, the inverter subsystem, the battery storage subsystem. The renewable energy resource is converted, using the wind turbine and photovoltaic panels to AC, via an inverter, which supplies the load. Any surplus energy is stored in the battery. It was found, from the simulation that the maximum power can be obtained under different circumstances using the developed maximum power point tracking algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","Maximum power point tracking (MPPT); simulation; wind and solar","Electric batteries; Electric inverters; Energy conversion; Energy resources; Hybrid systems; MATLAB; Maximum power point trackers; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind power; Wind turbines; Hybrid system models; MATLAB/ SIMULINK; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithms; Performance modelling; Photovoltaic panels; Renewable energy technologies; simulation; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027866760

It is based on a 3-phase process: (1) Determining the load profile of the village by making a power balance, the average daily consumption and establishing the load; (2) Determining the optimum photovoltaic (PV) peak capacity and storage capacity which yield the lowest total specific discounted costs over a specified project lifetime; and (3) Sizing all PV system components and updating the cost-benefit analysis based on quoted project cost. This methodology is applied to Aftissat, a fishing village in Boujdour (Southern Morocco). We found an optimal peak capacity of 128 kWp, and 623 kWh of battery storage capacity. The 126 kWp PV capacity, and 800 kWh battery storage capacity were actually installed. The payback period is 9.0 years, and the discounted specific cost is 1.40 MAD/kWh. The corresponding CO2 emissions are reduced by 98.3%. Laayoune is one of the most interesting solar locations with a potential of 2 450 kWh m-2 year-1 at an optimum angle of the panels of 28°. An increase in diesel rate and solar irradiation of the site greatly reduces the PV power and storage capacity to install. The depth range of ideal discharge is between 40 and 70%.

Adding inorganic filler in the polymer matrix is an effective way to increase the energy density of the polymer materials, the characteristics of composites and inorganic filler with high dielectric constant and high breakdown strength of polymer materials. However, the aggregation and phase separation of inorganic fillers in the polymer matrix is still the key obstacle to the practical application of the composites. Here, we develop a novel strategy for the growth of high aspect ratio calcium copper tianate nanofibers (CCTO-NFs) with electrospinning method, and then the high energy density nanofiber composites materials are fabricated using polydopamine (PDA) modify high aspect ratio CCTO-NFs in a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) matrix. The microstructure, dielectric properties, and energy storage density of the composites were studied. It was found that the two types of fillers were dispersed homogeneously in the PVDF-HFP matrix. The dielectric constant of the composites filled by CCTO nanofiber is large than CCTO nanoparticles at the same content. Stronger interfacial polarization mainly determined the dielectric properties that we observed on PVDF-HFP/CCTO-NFs composites. Moreover, a relatively low dielectric loss and a low conductivity achieved is attributed to the high aspect ratio of fillers and excellent compatibility of the CCTO nanofiber and PVDF-HFP matrix. Furthermore, when the content of filler was 10 wt.%, the discharged energy density of PVDF-HFP/CCTO NFs composites (1.508 J/cm3) is 4.17 times higher than that of PVDF-HFP/CCTO NPs composites (0.214 J/cm3). Such significant enhancement could be attributed to the combined effects of the surface modification and large aspect ratio of the CCTO-NFs. This work may provide a route for using the surface modified CCTO nanofibers to enhance the dielectric energy density in ceramic-polymer nanocomposites. © 2017 IEEE.","CCTO nanofiber; dielectric properties; electrospinning method; energy density; Nanocomposites","Aspect ratio; Dielectric losses; Dielectric properties; Dielectric properties of solids; Electric brakes; Electrospinning; Filled polymers; Fillers; Nanocomposites; Nanofibers; Phase separation; Polymer matrix composites; Spinning (fibers); Surface treatment; Discharged energy densities; Electrospinning method; Energy density; Energy storage density; High dielectric constants; High energy densities; Interfacial polarization; Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene); Dielectric materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027894533

However, the performance of dielectric composites is not sufficiently aligned with the requirements of application due to low thermal conductivity. Therefore, the investigations of the new methods as the design of structure and modification of the fillers to prepare excellent comprehensive performance of materials have attracted great attention. In this work, Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is used as matrix to prepare dielectric materials due to its high dielectric permittivity and favorable flexibility. Boron nitride (BN) with high thermal conductivity and a wide band gap is adopted as fillers. Meanwhile, the modified BN (m-BN) was prepared by coating with polydopamine (PDA) to improve the compatibility between the matrix and the fillers. The multi-layer polymeric composites based on PVDF and m-BN was fabricated via layer by layer spin coating technique. The morphology of fracture surface of PVDF/m-BN composites was investigated by scanning electron microscope. Clear interfaces can be observed in the PVDF/m-BN composites. The influence of both structures and m-BN concentration on the dielectric properties and thermal conductivity of nanocomposites were also discussed. Compared with single-layer, multi-layer exhibited obvious improvement in dielectric constant. The dielectric constant of sandwich-layer nanocomposites with 10 wt% m-BN loading reached 16, which is 30% higher than that of single layer. These enhancements may be attributed to Maxwell-Wagner interfacial polarization, which was generated from the multi-layer structure. In addition, the thermal conductivity of sandwich layer is 4 folds of single layer and the breakdown strength of the composites has increased by 30% due to the well-organized m-BN. Therefore, this works offers a new method for the potential usage of sandwich-structural PVDF nanocomposites in electric power field. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Coatings; Dielectric properties; Dielectric properties of solids; Energy gap; Fillers; Nanocomposites; Permittivity; Polymers; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermal conductivity; Comprehensive performance; High thermal conductivity; Interfacial polarization; Low thermal conductivity; Morphology of fracture surfaces; Multilayer structures; Poly (vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF); Polymeric dielectrics; Dielectric materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027887272

Monitoring of power cables will increase reliability of supply and the integrity of the transmission system. Wireless Sensors Nodes (WSNs) are independent sensors which can sense and monitor certain parameters including temperature, humidity, load condition, etc., and then transmit the data collected wirelessly to a base station. Power to the WSNs is usually provided by batteries. However, batteries have a finite amount of energy and need replacement when exhausted, which is a great cost of manpower. This paper presents an improved approach based on electromagnetic induction to take energy from electromagnetic fields around 10kV three-core cables. The whole energy harvesting system is composed of three parts: energy-gaining coils, rectifier & filter circuit, energy storage & regulated output circuit. The performance of this methodology is evaluated under simulation using Ansoft & Simplorer and laboratory tests. The results indicate that this proposed non-invasive energy harvester can collect energy from surrounding electromagnetic fields of three-core cables, and generate impulse power of tens to hundreds of milliwatts which can meet the requirements of WSNs.

This paper aims at evaluating the impact of an increased penetration of battery electric vehicles (BEV) on the Dutch power system, using the Dispa-SET unit commitment and optimal dispatch model. The analysis starts with an extensive dataset of charging transactions for the year 2015 in the Netherlands, recorded from about one third of all public charging stations in the country. This dataset is used to generate the charging load profile of the current BEV fleet, and to compute the connected BEV battery capacity at each hour of the year, to be used for modelling a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) option in the system. Different hypotheses are formulated on the future penetration of this technology. The corresponding charging profiles and available battery capacities are generated. These time series are entered into Dispa-SET to simulate the Dutch power system under different hypotheses of BEV and variable renewable energy deployment. Two different BEV charging cases are distinguished: an immediate charging strategy, and the use of BEV battery capacity as variable storage unit. For each scenario, aggregated indicators are computed, including average electricity price, cycling of power plants, electricity mix in each country, or level of curtailment. Results indicate that in the Netherlands the effect of BEV is negligible at the current deployment level. It becomes significant if BEV constitute the largest share of the vehicles fleet. In this case, the additional demand is absorbed by the power system at the expense of higher electricity generation costs. If BEVs are used for V2G, they can positively impact the power system, increasing system flexibility and significantly reducing the level of curtailment and electricity generation costs in case of high shares of renewable sources. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Battery electric vehicles; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric power generation; Fleet operations; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Vehicles; Charging load profiles; Charging strategies; Combustion engines; Electricity generation cost; Electricity prices; Flexible resources; Variable renewable energies; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027193310

The upper-level optimization problem represents the optimal AC power flow problem with the objective of minimizing the active power losses from the perspective of the DSO, while the lower-level optimization problem models the profit maximization problem faced by a competitive wind producer under uncertainty associated with market prices and its own power production profile.

This study analyses a private investment in Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) operating in a zonal market characterized by transmission congestion between zones. This study shows negative NPV values for the investment in PHS technology in two Italian zones. The profit analysis of the private investor should be accompanied by the assessment of its impact on social welfare, represented here in terms of avoided CO2 emissions and RES system integration. PHS operation, despite being costs minimizing from a system standpoint, does not guarantee optimality in terms of social welfare improvement. On the other side, transmission upgrade investment projects are profitable and might contribute to increase the overall social gain. Policy incentives in support to one technology or another would intervene if its social value would at least cover the net loss. © 2017 IEEE.","Environmental economics; Hydroelectric power generation; Power generation dispatch; Power system economics; Transmission lines","Commerce; Economics; Electric lines; Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission; Hydroelectric power; Power markets; Privatization; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Economic and environmental assessments; Environmental economics; Investment projects; Power generation dispatch; Power system economics; Renewable energy source; System integration; Transmission congestion; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027173971

We introduce a new CRM design, which involves shortterm clearing of a market for generation capacity in parallel with that of the wholesale electricity market. The proposed CRM allows for participation of capacity providers from both generation and demand side. Also, emerging technologies that were not able to participate in existing CRMs due to the longterm nature of those markets (e.g., storage) are able to participate in the proposed market for generation capacity. The proposed CRM is shown to satisfy the competitiveness, fairness and energy security principles defined by the European Commission. Finally, our analysis shows that the proposed CRM can ensure supply adequacy at a lower cost when compared to rival designs, by taking advantage of daily and seasonal variability in system demand. © 2017 IEEE.","Adequacy of supply; Capacity market; Capacity remuneration mechanism (CRM); Power system economics; RES integration","Commerce; Economics; Energy policy; Energy security; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Adequacy of supply; Capacity markets; Capacity remuneration mechanism (CRM); Electricity generation capacity; Emerging technologies; Power system economics; Renewable energy source; Wholesale electricity markets; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027094951

However, the intermittent nature of RESs brings several challenges because such sources introduce significant operational variability and uncertainty in the system. Framed in this context a new stochastic mathematical planning model is proposed considering the placement and sizing of energy storage systems and reactive power sources that altogether enable high penetration of RESs. The model employs a linearized AC model, balancing well accuracy with computational burden. The model is tested on a standard distribution network system. Numerical results show that the simultaneous integration of energy storage systems and reactive power sources largely leads to a substantially increased penetration of RESs in distribution systems. Furthermore, dramatic reductions in losses, system costs and emissions are observed. Results analysis also reveal the positive contribution of such a planning on the overall voltage stability in the system. © 2017 IEEE.","Distributed generation; energy storage systems; reactive power support; renewable energy sources; stochastic programming; variability and uncertainty","Distributed computer systems; Distributed power generation; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy storage; Natural resources; Reactive power; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Energy storage systems; Integration of renewable energies; Reactive power support; Renewable energy source; Simultaneous integration; Standard distributions; Stochastic mathematical models; variability and uncertainty; Stochastic models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034776473

However, uncontrollability and variability of renewable resources is an important barrier that could be overcome by incorporating energy storage systems (ESSs). Among ESSs technologies, Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) is a promising technology able to be incorporated in isolated and insular power systems with limited geographical conditions and high natural resources, thus increasing the system framework flexibility. Under this context, development of a proper strategy to control VRB in daily scheduling of insular systems, considering charge controller operation and VRB dynamic behavior, is a necessity. Hence, this paper presents an optimization model based on cycle charging strategy capable to include these features. The proposed approach is illustrated by analyzing two systems, obtaining a reduction on generating costs between 1.35% and 25.3% depending on system characteristics, wind power profile, and its penetration level. © 2017 IEEE.","Economic dispatch; energy storage system; unit commitment; vanadium redox battery; wind power","Charging (batteries); Electric batteries; Electric load dispatching; Energy storage; Optimization; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Vanadium; Wind power; Economic Dispatch; Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Geographical conditions; System characteristics; Unit-commitment; Vanadium redox batteries; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Flow batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034773928

The smart grids incorporated into a hybrid system with optimal energy mix are partly solution to the severe environmental problems, the scarcity of fossil fuels and the constant growth of energy needs. The optimal energy mix contains renewable energy sources, energy efficiency solutions, and energy storage options. In more complex multi energy systems the monitoring and control of the all energy flows (electricity, heat, gas) has been crucial for the evolution to the smart grids as a part of the wider smart energy systems infrastructure, especially in smart cities. In this paper the three step investment minimization problem of the total costs for the instalment of the smart energy system has been formulated. The results show yearly electricity and heat balance (and even hourly) obtained using HOMER software tool. The developed model together with available software can support the decision making in planning phase of the smart energy subsystem. © 2017 IEEE.","Distributed power generation; Energy storage; Power system planning; Smart grids","Decision making; Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Hybrid systems; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Smart city; Environmental problems; Minimization problems; Monitoring and control; Multi-energy systems; Power system planning; Renewable energy source; Smart energy systems; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034771757

A large number of scientific studies highlight the potential benefits, while transmission and distribution system operators actively engage in numerous pilot projects. However, independent investors might be reluctant to invest in energy storage, mainly due to factors such as the high investment cost, the relatively limited service life of storage technologies and the absence of clear business cases within the current regulatory framework. In this paper, arbitrage between the day-ahead and the imbalance markets is investigated to identify a potential business opportunity for a hydrogen bromine redox flow battery.

If energy storage (ES) facilities are required to provide such flexibility, the technical constraints on the operation of ES must be taken into account in this scheduling problem, which is typically not done in deterministic models. Stochastic optimization enhances the procurement of flexibility, but may require more computational resources. This paper proposes an improved deterministic model for the co-optimization of controllable generation and ES, accounting for the technical constraints of the ES system and arbitrage opportunities with conventional reserve capacity. In a case study, the proposed unit commitment (UC) model is shown to yield significant operational cost reductions without affecting the systems reliability, while the increase in calculation times is limited. © 2017 IEEE.","energy storage; Reserves; unit commitment","Cost reduction; Energy storage; Optimization; Scheduling; Stochastic models; Uranium compounds; Computational resources; Deterministic modeling; Energy storage systems; Production and consumption; Reserves; Stochastic optimizations; Unit commitment scheduling; Unit-commitment; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034752820

In a traditional supply network, such energy can only be utilized, if another vehicle simultaneously consumes this volume (e.g. it accelerates). Since the occurrence of such situations is limited due to schedule restrictions and the structure of the supply network, vast majority of braking energy is lost. Budapest Transport Corporation (BKV Zrt.) has thus called for proposals in the subject of recovering braking energy of trams. The aim of the project was to examine the amount of possibly recovered energy, and to propose technological solutions that enable this process. Present paper introduces methodology and selected results of the examinations, performed by the applicant group of Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The group has proposed two different technological solutions that are representing unrestricted feedback, feedback with power restrictions (limited by the power of the converter), feedback with power and energy restrictions (use of energy storage) scenarios, all capable of recovering significant part of braking energy. © 2017 IEEE.","electric vehicles; energy storage; power conversion; simulation","Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Recovery; Vehicles; Budapest University; Electric traction vehicles; Power conversion; Power restrictions; Recovered energy; simulation; Technological solution; Transport corporations; Electric traction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034752125

At high penetration levels their contribution to the feeders' energy losses are increasing significantly. Currently, due to the absence of Smart Grid infrastructure, the DSOs aggregate these losses to the total LV grid losses without being able to allocate them to each individual prosumer. In this paper, analytical expressions for the estimation of the Residential Load Annual Duration Curve (RLADC) with and without a PVS are proposed and are based on the annual domestic energy consumption and on the maximum load and PVS power. Apart from losses estimation, the expressions can also facilitate the proper sizing of prosumer energy storage systems (ESSs) for peak saving and voltage regulation. The validity of the expressions was tested through comparison with measurements of household consumption, solar irradiation and temperature. In order to demonstrate the use of the expressions, two working examples regarding the estimation of energy losses and storage sizing are presented. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy consumption; Energy losses; Energy storage; Photovoltaic systems; Power system planning","Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Photovoltaic cells; Voltage regulators; Analytical evaluation; Analytical expressions; Comparison with measurements; Domestic energy consumption; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Household Consumption; Photovoltaic systems; Power system planning; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034749474

The proposed protection scheme was not dependent from fault current contribution of the DG units and was selective with the DG unit low-voltage-ride-through curves.

The growing share of renewables represents a forthcoming challenge since FCR are generally provided by synchronous generators. In this paper, batteries are associated with a power-to-heat system (P2H) composed of electrical resistances, allowing a very high flexibility as well as a valorization of the generated heat. They are controlled to react first, leading to a significant reduction of the battery use while allowing a satisfactory regulation of the battery's stored energy. This is made possible by adding an offset that allows the proposed system to consume power in average.

According to the day-ahead power forecast of renewable energy generation and electric power users' load, the strategy draws the payload power curve. The objective function is to minimize the difference between power supply and demand. Then, a day-ahead optimization model based on demand response is established. The results of the model are used to obtain the working condition at a certain time in the future, such as the switching state of the controllable distributed generation, the working state of the shiftable loads, the reference charging power and discharge power of the energy storage device, and reference state of charge. The example shows that the proposed optimization strategy can effectively reduce the load during the peak period of power consumption, reduce the residual power of renewable energy generation and increase the load rate of the controllable distributed generation. Meanwhile, this method predicts renewable energy generation and the short-term power of the load. According to the level of prediction error, the running state is coordinated and controllable among the controllable distributed generation, shiftable loads and energy storage device, providing an adjustable power margin for real-time scheduling of individual microgrids. © 2017 IEEE.","Controllable distributed generation; Day-ahead optimization; Demand response; Energy storage device; Independent microgrid; Renewable energy generation; Shiftable loads",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028088590

And the capacity of wind farm in China was 145.1GW, which was 141.6GW in European Union at the same time. China became an important region that has the largest wind installed capacity. Wind power has its characteristic of randomness and uncertain. And the large-scale wind would bring a lot of challenge to the safety and economic of operation in state grid. At the present, the fluctuation of wind power is adjusted through the participating of thermal units, which is a waste of fossil energy and money. Due to the fluctuation caused by integration of large-scale wind power, current grid can not deal with it without considering the features of renewable energy. In recent years, the pumped-storage stations had been proposed to arrange the output in order to smooth the fluctuation of wind power. In this paper, an new scheduling policy is put forward to deal with the randomness of wind farm and to improve the intermittent of wind power. The improved pumped-wind-hydro-thermal optimization strategy discussed here only aims at cutting down the fluctuation and operation cost, but also improving the power generation of clean energy.

However, the load and grid output power may fluctuate drastically, resulting in the dc bus voltage rise or fall sharply. The power demand is composed of both high-frequency and low-frequency component that brings some difficulties to energy distribution. Therefore, it is still a challenge to design a safe and high-efficiency energy allocation strategy to respond to the power demands and stabilize the bus voltage in time. In this paper, an adaptive energy allocation strategy based on the isolation frequency is proposed to address this challenge.

The voltage and frequency control is ensured by a voltage source inverter (VSI), in cooperation with a Dump Load (DL) connected on the VSI DC side. In order to enhance the MG stability, a short-term energy storage system based on a supercapacitor (SC) is added to the MG control system, while non-critical loads are interfaced through a controlled circuit breaker. During overloads, the SC will inject power into the MG DC-link as long as its state-of-charge (SOC) is kept over a pre-defined level. After this level is reached, the non-critical loads will be disconnected, and the SC will begin to charge. The overload regime is created either by the connection of a massive resistive load or by the direct starting and loading of a significant power induction motor (IM).

While the coupling between different kinds of energy carriers limits the operational flexibility of the integrated energy system, which contradicts with the increasing penetration of variable wind power. Fortunately, the integration of multiply-energy carries on the other hand provides customers with multiply options for fulfilling their energy demand. With the development of demand response (DR) technologies and energy net-work systems being increasingly flexible, it has become a realistic possibility for encouraging customers to adjust their energy demands in response to system operation conditions. Based upon the concept of energy hub which is a unit that provides the conversion and storage of different energy carriers, the flexibility of customers' energy demand is analyzed. Moreover, a two-step sequential dispatch framework is proposed for the incorporation of customers' demand response. In the proposed technique, the energy production constraints are relaxed via the demand response, which allows a better utilization of wind power and a reduction of the energy costs. An integrated energy system is developed to illustrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed technique. © 2017 IEEE.","Demand response; Economic dispatch; Integrated energy system (IES); Two step sequential dispatch","Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Sales; Scheduling; Wind power; Demand response; Economic Dispatch; Energy carriers; Energy productions; Integrated energy systems; Operational flexibility; Sequential dispatch; System operation; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026749615

This adds more uncertainty to the system, which also faces all traditional sources of uncertainty and those pertaining to other emerging technologies such as demand response and electric vehicles. As a result, distribution system operators are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain an optimal daily operation of such systems. Such challenges/limitations are expected to be alleviated when distribution systems undergo the transformation process to smart grids, equipped with appropriate technologies such as energy storage systems (ESSs) and switchable capacitor banks (SCBs). These technologies offer more flexibility in the system, allowing effective management of the uncertainty in RESs. This paper presents a stochastic mixed integer linear programming (SMILP) model, aiming to optimally operate distribution network systems, featuring variable renewables, and minimizing the impact of RES uncertainty on the system's overall performance via ESSs and SCBs. A standard 41-bus distribution system is employed to show the effectiveness of the proposed S-MILP model. Simulation results indicate that strategically placed ESSs and SCBs can substantially alleviate the negative impact of RES uncertainty in the considered system. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Electric power system stability; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy storage; Integer programming; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Appropriate technologies; Distribution network system; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Mixed integer linear programming; Optimal daily operation; Sources of uncertainty; Transformation process; Variable renewable energies; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026742697

Ever since, the accurate assessment of the LIB state-of-charge (SOC) during the demanding EV operation regimes posed serious challenges. Hence, several methods were developed in order to estimate the available useful charge, ranging from the less robust and straightforward Coulomb Counting to the powerful, nonlinear Kalman Filter variations. The kernel of any effective state-of-charge estimator resides within the employed battery model, mimicking the actual behavior of the part, so that a causal relationship between SOC and other physical quantities (e.g. terminal voltage) emerges. This article depicts a systematic procedure for designing a comprehensive equivalent circuit battery model using readily available tools, such as Matlab/Simulink suite, for a LiFePO4 pouched cell. Also, some key but not obvious aspects concerning the battery modeling approach (i.e. LIB parameters extraction) are pointed throughout the paper. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Automobile electronic equipment; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric batteries; Electric machinery; Electronic equipment; Equivalent circuits; Hybrid vehicles; Lithium-ion batteries; Oscillators (electronic); Power electronics; Causal relationships; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); Measurement methods; Nonlinear Kalman filter; Parameters extraction; Parametric modelling; Physical quantities; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027701656

These processors are designed to flexibly support highly diverse workloads with classic techniques such as on-chip cache and dynamic pipelining. Yet, it is difficult for the on-chip cache to exploit irregular data locality in large-scale graph processing, even though there are a few high-degree vertices that are frequently accessed in real-world graphs, it is not efficient to perform regular arithmetic operations via sophisticated dynamic pipelining. In short, general-purpose processors could not be the ideal platforms to graph processing. In this paper, we design a reconfigurable graph processing accelerator, with the purpose of providing an energy-efficient and flexible hardware platform for large-scale graph processing. This accelerator features two main components, i.e., the on-chip storage to exploit the data locality of graph processing, and the reconfigurable functional units to adapt to diversified operations in different graph processing tasks.

With the appropriate use of this devices, dc grid distribution technologies can be enabled, offering more flexibility and controllability to the system. One of the trends for low-voltage dc grid networks is the use of a 'two-phase' dc lines in order to facilitate the adaptation to the present-time ac grids, and also to allow the use of diverse loads. Another feature of such dc grids is the distributed storage elements in houses and buildings, that have highly importance in the system, being responsible for storage of energy during low demand, provide energy during peak consume, and participate in the grid voltage stability if necessary. This storage system needs an isolated power converter for grid interfacing and a battery bank with the capability to independently control the energy flow in each phase. In this view, this paper aims to present and discuss the analysis, design and simulation of two 15 kW two-stage converters, connected to each phase of a ±380 Vdc microgrid and sharing the same battery voltage. The first stage, connected to a battery bank with voltage range of 315 V to 567 V, consists of a non-isolated synchronous Boost converter with current control. Whereas the second stage, connected to grid and to the output of the Boost converter, is an isolated bidirectional LLC-type converter that uses a symmetrical resonant network in order to provide identical characteristics in both ways of energy transport. © 2017 IEEE.","Bidirectional DC-DC converter; Dc microgrids; Energy storage; LLC converter; Synchronous Boost","Distributed power generation; Electric batteries; Electric inverters; Electric power system control; Electric power system interconnection; Energy storage; Power converters; Power electronics; Resonant circuits; Bidirectional DC-DC converters; Design and simulation; Distributed storage; LLC converter; Micro grid; Synchronous Boost; Synchronous boost converters; Two-stage converter; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027832075

These companies balance quality of service (QoS) revenue and power consumption by migrating virtual machines (VMs) and allocating the resource of servers adaptively. However, existing approaches model the QoS revenue by service-level agreement (SLA) violation, and ignore the network communication cost and immigration time. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based adaptive resource management algorithm, which aims to get the balance between QoS revenue and power consumption. Our algorithm does not need to assume prior distribution of resource requirements, and is robust in actual workload. It outperforms other existing approaches in three aspects: 1) The QoS revenue is directly modeled by differentiated revenue of different tasks, instead of using SLA violation. 2) For geo-distributed data centers, the time spent on VM migration and network communication cost are taken into consideration. 3) The information storage and random action selection of reinforcement learning algorithms are optimized for rapid decision making. Experiments show that our proposed algorithm is more robust than the existing algorithms. Besides, the power consumption of our algorithm is around 13.3% and 9.6% better than the existing algorithms in non-differentiated and differentiated services. © 2017 IEEE.","Differentiated services; Geo-distributed data centers; Power consumption; QoS revenue; Reinforcement learning","Behavioral research; Decision making; Digital storage; Electric power utilization; Green computing; Information management; Internet service providers; Learning algorithms; Natural resources management; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Telecommunication services; Adaptive Resource Management; Differentiated Services; Distributed data; Network communications; Renewable energies; Resource requirements; Service Level Agreements; Service provisions; Quality of service",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027861481

To overcome this, optical circuit-switched (OCS) networks are equipped with assistive storage, so that bulk data that are delay tolerant can be temporarily stored at intermediate nodes and forwarded at later times. But, the use of storage greatly complicates the routing problem, since data storage must be incorporated into routing. This motivates us to simplify this issue by applying slotted operations for the network. Intuitively, the slotted network suffers from degraded network performance due to the inefficient utilization incurred by the slot constraint. However, our simulation shows that when the slot size equals to half the mean duration, the blocking probability is reduced from 0.076 to 8.5×10-5, and the number of network reconfigurations is reduced by a factor of 5, compared to the unslotted case. We reveal that in spite of the inefficient utilization, the slotted operations mitigate bandwidth fragmentation. This suggests in the slotted case, more bandwidth gaps on the links are available for accommodating other requests, and they are aligned with each other in time. Requests hence are delivered with less store-and-forward (SnF) operations being performed. Thus, when the number of SnF allowed for routing each request is limited (in order to reduce the computational complexity of routing), requests are more easily served in the slotted than in the unslotted cases. Our research provides clue for designing scalable slotted OCS networks with assistive storage. © 2017 IEEE.","Bulk data transfer; optical circuit switching; routing; storage; store-and-forward","Bandwidth; Blocking probability; Data transfer; Delay circuits; Digital storage; Energy storage; Optical data storage; Switching networks; Timing circuits; Bandwidth fragmentation; Bulk data transfer; Intermediate node; Network re-configuration; Optical circuit switching; routing; Simulation studies; Store and forward; Delay tolerant networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027284617

Commonly, passive balancing is widely used in BMS because cheap and simple to implement. The passive balancing used passive element (resistor) to dispose of the excess charge of battery. The use of this resistor is quite effective for small battery capacity. For large battery capacity used in EV and HEV, a big power resistor is needed so that the balancing time of the battery is faster. With a large power resistor for each battery cell will result in BMS hardware becomes large. In this paper was designed a passive balancing BMS that combines the power resistor and MOSFET internal resistance as a balancing resistor. The use of MOSFET internal resistance will save space on BMS hardware compared with power resistor with greater balancing current capability. The proposed method was applied to 1P15S battery pack consisting of 15 cells LiFePO4 battery with a capacity of 200 Ah. The preliminary experimental result shows that using internal resistance of the MOSFET as a balancing resistor was feasible and effectively done.

Electrical hybrid vehicles are one of these alternatives and an important part of them is their energy storage systems which are used to relieve the main source which is generally a fuel cell. To ensure energy storage, the supercapacitor is considered as an interesting device because of its high power density compared to batteries. The hybridization of the main source with another source like energy storage device allows to improve the dynamic response, especially, during transient states. However, it will be necessary to apply an energy management strategy to share the energy flow between sources responding to load demand.

However, PMDD configuration generally has a big ring size and expensive construction cost. To potentially reduce the cost of PMDD, various research designs were investigated, including reduction of weight, lessen of material usage, and simulations on electrical losses. However, as of this time of writing, there has been no research design on the placement of permanent magnets (PM) for optimal energy generation. Thus, this study aims to make an optimal design of a PMDD ring by varying three main parameters, namely in-between magnet clearance, rotor-stator distance, and rotational speed. SolidWorks was used to design the model, ANSYS Fluent was used to simulate the various design combinations, and JMP software was used to analyse the data statistically. Results showed that amongst the three parameters, only the rotor-stator distance significantly influenced the power output of the simulated equipment. Further investigation can be done on the variation of magnet numbers, increase combinations, and investigation of power losses. © 2017 IEEE.","horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT); permanent magnet direct drive (PMDD); permanent magnets (PM); simulation; wind energy; wind turbine design","Digital storage; Environmental management; Nanotechnology; Optimal systems; Stators; Turbogenerators; Wind power; Wind turbines; Direct drive; Horizontal axis wind turbines; Permanent magnets (pm); simulation; Turbine designs; Permanent magnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047767479

It is playing a significant role as high-density static memory storage. However, the timing sequences of NAND Flash Memory is too complex for user to operate. Nowadays, multiple dies parallel structure are gradually applied into the storage system to improve data access speed. In this paper, to apply the concept of pipeline technology and parallel processing to the whole system, we suggest designing multiple dies NAND Flash Memory Controller architecture. This design is different from the existing technology, which using a single controller to operate multiple dies NAND Flash Memory concurrently. Another important feature is that the double data buffer technology is adopted by the NAND Flash Memory controller, which can promote the performance of the design. The experimental results based on FPGA demonstrate that our controller can operate NAND Flash Memory correctly to meet the requirements of functionality and show the excellent performance that the speed of read is 626MB/s and the speed of program is 50.8MB/s at system clock frequency of 50MHz. From this, we can see that the proposed design implement high-speed data storage. © 2017 IEEE.","access speed; double data buffer; multiple dies; NAND Flash Controller; NAND Flash Memory; pipeline technology and parallel processing","Controllers; Dies; Energy conservation; Flash memory; NAND circuits; Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; Speed; Data buffers; Digital electronics; Important features; Nand flash controllers; NAND flash memory; Parallel processing; Parallel structures; Pipeline technology; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047144958

In this paper, the characteristics of passive balancing are obtained by the on-line passive balancing experiment of charge and discharge under different capacity, current ratio and equalizing threshold of lithium battery. The experimental results show that the balancing current ratio (ratio of the equalizing current to the main circuit current) can effectively enhance the effect of passive balancing. The passive balancing time ratio (ratio of balancing time to charging/discharging time of main circuit) and the balancing effect of the discharging state is larger than that of the charging state. The passive balancing of the discharging state is critical. The battery inconsistency can be effectively improved by appropriate reduction of the balancing threshold. In summary, the optimization of the passive balancing parameters of the battery pack plays an important role in improving the inconsistency of the battery pack. © 2017 IEEE.","Battery pack; Lithium-ion battery; Parameters optimization; Passive balancing","Battery Pack; Charging time; Ions; Balancing currents; Balancing parameters; Charge and discharge; Charging state; Charging/discharging; Current ratios; Lithium-ion battery strings; Parameters optimization; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047118429

Installed charging station can be in the form of individual parking slot in the owner residence or massive parking lot in a community area. Commonly, parking lot has been built on the ground and consumes a large area. A parking lot can be transform into high rise parking lot for having higher parking capacity with less ground area needed. This paper will discuss about high rise parking lot which have additional surface for better solar radiance capture rather than on-the-ground parking lot. The building was designed to be able to support electric vehicle (EV) both in alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) type depends on EVs' energy storage systems. Microgrid architecture was implemented to facilitate the charging process and also to incorporate local power resource i.e. solar power. Designated photovoltaic installments are proposed to optimize the microgrid in the vertical surface of the building. This facade installment should be controlled in one building energy management system (BEMS) and improved the performance of the microgrid. The PV will help the building in decreasing its dependency to the utility grid and increase its profit with no longer spend expenditure on high cost electricity. © 2017 IEEE.","charging station; electric vehicle; microgrid system; parking lot; photovoltaics; vertical facade installation","Charging (batteries); Electric energy storage; Electric impedance measurement; Electric vehicles; Energy conservation; Facades; Solar energy; Urban transportation; Building energy management systems; Charging station; Energy storage systems; Ev charging stations; Micro-grid systems; Microgrid architecture; Parking lots; Photovoltaics; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046754257

Advancement in technology, especially in the transportation sector, has brought the focus of conventional vehicles to PEVs. In order to fast-charge the PEV with minimum effect on the grid, and to meet the necessary energy demand, renewable energy solutions are a promising candidate. To present grid-friendly solutions, first, the paper analyzes the load curves (a base load in addition to uncoordinated PEV charging load) with a designed Energy Storage System (ESS) for load shedding. Then a PV system is employed to support the ESS, therefore reducing its cost and size. At last, forecasting of the demand is conducted in order to meet the need within a short term. Simulation results are presented for different scenarios. The results obtained from the forecast show potentials, and the analysis of the ESS shows a steady load demand. The solution provided can be further researched for analyzing other prospective problems. © 2017 IEEE.","Distributed Generation; Energy Storage; Forecasting; Grid-to-Vehicle; Peak Shaving; Plug-in Electric Vehicle; PV","Distributed power generation; Electric load distribution; Electric load forecasting; Electric power plant loads; Energy storage; Forecasting; Plug-in electric vehicles; Charging loads; Distribution systems; Energy demands; Energy storage systems; Load-shedding; Peak shaving; Renewable energies; Transportation sector; Electric load shedding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050394361

This technology facilitates a natural gas with high methane contents storage method which may be done with simple compression. One of the porous materials that is commonly applied to adsorb methane in ANG tank is activated carbon which is a material that has large surface area because of its high porosity. Activated carbon can be produced from banana peel waste and water hyacinth because of its high carbon contents. The production of activated carbon from banana peel waste and water hyacinth is carried out by variation of two different chemical activator, ZnCl2, concentrations (0.25 N and 1 N). Activated carbon with the best characterization from each source will be adopted as adsorbents on the designed ANG tank system in order to discover their storage capacity and delivery capacity based on their adsorption isotherm properties. They are compared with the commercially available activated carbon EnerG2 which has a surface area of 1750 m2/g. The best activated carbon produced from banana peel waste and water hyacinth has a surface area of 797.04 m2/g and 540.77 m2/g, respectively.

A testboard was designed, which contained 50 pieces of 0603 size (1.5 × 0.75 mm) chip resistors. The solder paste was deposited by stencil printing, and the solder joints were formed with vapour phase soldering. The intermetallic layer growth was accelerated after soldering with HTSL (High Temperature Storage Life) testing at two different elevated temperatures; 100 and 150 °C. The HTSL testing was carried out for up to 1500 hours. In every 500 hours, samples were taken out from the test to measure the thickness of the intermetallic layer by analysing cross-sections with Scanning Electron Microscopy. It was found that the determined value of activation energy is influenced by the length of the HTSL testing. Since the uncertainty of the layer thickness measurements is higher at lower thicknesses (i.e. at the beginning of the HTSL testing), longer duration of testing (1500 hours at minimum) is recommended. Besides, the results showed that higher activation energy belongs to the layer growth in the Innolot alloy compared to the SAC305 alloy. © 2017 IEEE.","activation energy; HTSL testing; innolot alloy; intermetallic layer growth; vapour phase soldering","Electronics packaging; Intermetallics; Lead-free solders; Scanning electron microscopy; Soldered joints; Soldering; Thickness measurement; Uncertainty analysis; Chip resistor; Elevated temperature; High temperature storage lives; Intermetallic layer; Lead-free solder alloy; Solder joints; Stencil printing; Vapour phase soldering; Activation energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046934121

Distribution system operators (DSOs) are obligated to ensure high supply security, especially in deregulated electricity markets. DSO face penalties or pay compensatory costs when they are unable to supply electricity reliably to customers. DSOs can increase their supply reliability by either employing expensive high-reliability technology or backup power supply such as battery energy storage systems (BESSs) or generators. We have presented a novel mixed integer linear programming model to determine the economic feasibility of installing BESSs at a secondary substation in a medium voltage network. We have also determined the minimum capacity and optimal schedule of the installed BESS. Moreover, we have examined the cost-effectiveness of using BESSs if they are also used for peak shaving instead of remaining idle when there are no outages. We validated our simple but effective methodology by applying it to a substation network in Finland. All the interruptions were reduced with a BESS capacity of 112 kWh, and the savings were significant for BESS costs less than 300 €/kWh. Moreover, peak shaving increased the cost savings. However, the current costs of lithium-ion-based BESSs are nearly thrice as high, and they must decrease further before BESSs can be cost-effectively used for interruption management and peak shaving. © 2017 IEEE.","Battery Energy Storage Systems; Distribution System Operators; Interruptions; Mixed Integer Linear Programming; Outages","Cost effectiveness; Deregulation; Digital instruments; Electric power transmission networks; Integer programming; Lithium-ion batteries; Outages; Smart power grids; Battery energy storage systems; Deregulated electricity market; Distribution systems; High-reliability technology; Interruptions; Medium voltage networks; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046268220

The emergence of renewable energies and distributed systems has been worldwide hastened. Yet, several challenges face this metamorphosis, above all, renewable energy uncertainties which require the integration of storage systems. When the system is undersized, the renewable energy would be dumped, and when it is oversized, the storage would be ineffective. Optimal configurations with probabilistic constraints are then primordial. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is twofold: First, it formulates a novel modeling of energy storage systems by introducing the idleness and counterbalance probabilities; and second, it proposes a suboptimal sizing by maximizing the goodness of fit between the probability density functions of residual power, or the difference between the generation and consumption, and the matching storage output power.

Normally, this DC electricity sourced from renewable energy. LED lamps are one of the lighting solutions that use DC sources, but these lamps need a series of drivers to operate. In this study, we used a buck converter as an LED driver to lower the source voltage. This buck converter works based on PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) system and uses Arduino as a pulse controller. The output voltage that has been lowered will be connected with the LED arrays i.e. the series of LEDs arranged in serial form. The driver circuit is also integrated with a battery with the working voltage of the lamp as a power storage that serves as a LED power supply when the source is disconnected. Based on the free-load buck converter test, the output voltage (Vo) value was strongly influenced by duty cycle changes and has an average error rate of 2.7% for simulation testing and 10.6% on project board testing. The test level of LED lights using lux meter was conducted on a closed test box with a size of 30 × 30 cm.

In this paper, a stochastic smart charging framework for CES in residential microgrids is proposed. A linear optimization problem for scheduling the charging process of the community battery to times when electricity prices are low, while accommodating the aggregated surplus renewable energy of households, is formulated. The goal is to satisfy the aggregated residual load of households at every time slot. To do so, a Markov chain-based forecasting approach is used for generating synthetic aggregated surplus solar Photovoltaics (PV) power and residual load profiles day-ahead. Numerical results are obtained using a history of real load and solar PV generation profiles of 10 households in the city of Amersfoort, the Netherlands. The forecasting performance is evaluated and compared with a persistence model by means of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Then, the technical and economic performance of the smart charging process is presented for different annual periods. Results show that based on a time-varying electricity tariff and depending on the annual period, the CES with a smart charging process can bring a cost saving up to 68% in comparison with the traditional scenario without a storage. © 2017 IEEE.","Community Energy Storage (CES); Forecasting; Markov chains; Microgrids; Scheduling; Self-consumption","Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Linear programming; Markov processes; Mean square error; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; Stochastic systems; Alternative solutions; Community energy storages (CES); Forecasting performance; Linear optimization problems; Micro grid; Renewable energy source; Root mean squared errors; Self-consumption; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044974379

However, the stochastic input from renewable energy resource brings difficulty in balancing the energy supply and demand. Purchasing extra energy from macrogrid to deal with energy shortage will increase MG energy cost. To mitigate intermittent nature of renewable energy, energy trading and energy storage which can exploit diversity of renewable energy generation across space and time are efficient and cost-effective methods. But a storage with large capacity will incur additional cost. In addition, due to MG participating energy trading as prosumer, it calls for an efficient trading mechanism. Therefore, this paper focuses on the problem of MG energy management and trading. Energy trading problem is formulated as a stochastic optimization one with both individual profit and social welfare maximization. Firstly a Lyapunov optimization based algorithm is developed to solve the stochastic problem. Secondly the double-auction based mechanism is provided to attract MGs' truthful bidding for buying and selling energy. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that individual MG can achieve a time average energy cost close to offline optimum with tradeoff between storage capacity and energy trading cost. Meanwhile the social welfare is also asymptotically maximized under double auction. Simulation results based on real world data show the effectiveness of our algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Digital storage; Optimization; Power markets; Problem solving; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Cost-effective methods; Environment friendly; Lyapunov optimizations; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy source; Social welfare maximization; Stochastic optimizations; Stochastic problems; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044969463

Our control approach is based on a tube scaling model predictive control where new optimization variables - scaling factors - are introduced that optimally balance disturbance compensation by individual controllable microgrid entities.

Cooperative data offloading is a promising approach to alleviate the traffic congestion, which leverages the device-to-device (D2D) communications among mobile users. However, mobile users may not be obligated to participate in cooperative data offloading, since it will involve additional costs such as storage, bandwidth and battery energy. In this paper, we propose a centralized caching-based incentive mechanism, which stimulates mobile users to cache and forward contents for MNOs. First, we formulate a caching user selection and content allocation problem by considering the service coverages of mobile users and the content popularity in cellular networks. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we introduce a heuristic algorithm with polynomial time complexity. Second, we propose a payment determination algorithm, which satisfies the properties of individual rationality and truthfulness. Finally, simulations are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism. Compared with conventional caching schemes, our coverage-aware caching strategy achieves a better performance in terms of the utility of both MNOs and mobile users. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Complex networks; Digital storage; Heuristic algorithms; Mobile telecommunication systems; Polynomial approximation; Traffic congestion; Wireless networks; Allocation problems; Content popularities; Determination algorithm; Deviceto-device (D2D) communication; Incentive mechanism; Individual rationality; Mobile network operators; Polynomial time complexity; Cooperative communication",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026209061

Due to the mobility feature of use terminals in the real environment, the analysis of successful transmission is particular important in mobile networks. In this paper, the position of cache-enabled users are distributed as a Homogeneous Poisson Point Process (HPPP) and user moves following the random walk mobility (RWM) model. Then, the successful transmission probability is analyzed through the observation of the one step movement of the typical user using stochastic geometry methods. Meanwhile, in order to optimize the successful transmission probability, two methods are considered, i.e., file segmentation transmission (FST) and retransmission mechanism (RM). Simulation results show that the successful transmission probability can be improved by several network parameters, e.g., user density, transmission zone radius and caching probability, but exhibits a decline with increasing velocity or downloading time. Besides, considering segmentation cost, there is a tradeoff for the optimal segment number for the FST and RM schemes. © 2017 IEEE.","Mobility; Successful transmission probability; User caching","Carrier mobility; Energy efficiency; Mobile telecommunication systems; Stochastic systems; Wireless networks; File segmentations; Poisson point process; Random walk mobility; Retransmission mechanism; Stochastic geometry; Transmission probabilities; Transmission zones; User caching; Probability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026201603

Therefore, an improved droop control strategy is proposed to consider the energy storage system with unmatched line impedance. Firstly, the dynamic virtual impedance is used to eliminate the influence of the line impedance. At the same time, the SOC index is reduced by the e-index droop, which reduces the impact of the error convergence process on the system.

This paper proposes a coordinated control scheme of energy storage devices and PV inverters to solve the voltage rise/drop issues. And the scheme is guided by voltage-power sensitivity. When the voltage exceeds the upper limit, the energy storage devices are charged instead of curtailing the active power of PV inverters, and the stored energy is discharged after making use of the reactive power of PV inverters when the voltage is less than the lower limit. What's more, in view of the situation that the number of monitoring devices is much smaller than that of network nodes, a voltage estimation algorithm is proposed, in which the feeder is divided into multiple regions and the voltage extremums of each region are estimated on the basis of voltage drop theory. Both voltage estimation algorithm and regulation scheme are implemented by a multi-agent system with a redundant communication scheme to improving the reliability. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated in a LV distribution network model in Matlab, and the results verify the effectiveness. © 2017 IEEE.","energy storage; multi-agent; PV inverter; sensitivity; voltage estimation","Electric inverters; Energy storage; Multi agent systems; Voltage distribution measurement; Voltage regulators; Communication schemes; Low-voltage distributions; LV distribution networks; Multi agent; Photovoltaic inverters; PV inverter; sensitivity; Voltage estimation; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049337875

Hydrogen takes a potential role in the future ESDs due to its cleanness and high energy density. Convert electricity into hydrogen is a relatively mature technology named the Power to Hydrogen (P2H). But during the conversion process, only 60% ∼ 70% consumed electricity is converted into hydrogen. To overcome the efficiency limitation of traditional P2H process, this paper proposes a P2HH (Power to Heat and Hydrogen) concept which not only works as a flexible load consuming the residual electricity, but also supplies extra heat partly instead of the gas boilers for the heat load. Temperature plays an important role in the efficiency management of P2HH, because it directly influences the proportion of power to Hydrogen and power to Heat. When applying in an integrated energy microgrid (P2HH-MG), P2HH could help increase the whole system efficiency in spite of the possible efficiency decrease of the P2H process. A MPC control strategy is adopted in this P2HH-MG to test the optimal economical operation. © 2017 IEEE.","MPC; Power to Heat and Hydrogen (P2HH); Temperature control","Electric energy storage; Predictive control systems; Temperature control; Conversion process; Economical operation; Efficiency limitations; Efficiency managements; Energy storage devices (ESD); High energy densities; Integrated energy systems; Power to Heat and Hydrogen (P2HH); Model predictive control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049312763

When there are multiple energy storage units (ESUs) in the dc microgrid, the overcharge or over discharge is avoided. Therefore, a new adaptive droop control is proposed according to the state of charge (SOC). Once the ESS is out of work due to fault or fully charged, the renewable energy source needs to switch from the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode to the droop control mode.

Accordingly, it is necessary to propose a SOC definition based on energy theory. SOC is divided into static SOCs and dynamic SOCd to be applied the calculation of SOC in varied cases of energy storage battery. On this basis, considering the stored energy during the operation process is reduced constantly and the load power changes, dynamic SOCd estimation method is proposed. On a basis of experimental data on batteries carrying varied power loads, the algorithm fits the energy function of battery energy release with the changes of load power.

Optimal planning, which is the most important issue that need to be resolved in the design stage, directly determines the economic and security benefits of microgrids. To achieve greater economic benefits for stand-alone microgrids that comprise diesel generators, wind turbine generation systems, photovoltaic generation systems and battery energy storage systems, this paper presents an optimal planning method that considers the day-ahead real-time pricing demand response (DARTP-DR). First, an optimization model that includes the DARTP-DR is established based on a price elasticity matrix. Next, a combinatorial solution algorithm that combines the genetic algorithm with pattern search is introduced to solve the model. The proposed optimal planning method is applied to a real case study, and the results show that considering the DARTP-DR in the optimal planning considerably reduces the lifetime cost of stand-alone microgrids. © 2017 IEEE.","optimal allocation; price elasticity matrix; real-time pricing; stand-alone microgrid","Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Elasticity; Genetic algorithms; Planning; Battery energy storage systems; Day-ahead real-time pricing; Micro grid; Optimal allocation; Photovoltaic generation system; Price elasticity matrixes; Real time pricing; Wind-turbine generation; Real time systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049161225

Therefore, the virtual inertia control strategy at the energy-storage terminal in DC microgrid is proposed. The strategy sets the droop coefficient at the battery terminal as a function, which takes the voltage variation rate as the variable; When the DC microgrid system is disturbed, the battery provides additional inertia power, equivalents to increasing the capacitance on the DC side.

Based on singular perturbation theory, a two-timescale approach is proposed to separate the FESS into the fast and slow subsystems. Stability analysis of the transient fixed points indicates that the FESS shifts from the spiking state to the quiescent state when the slow variables cross the bifurcation point of the fast subsystem. Mechanism analysis reveals that the root cause of the bursting dynamics is the voltage instability of the FESS. Moreover, the stability boundaries of key parameters are derived, and application requirements of the proposed approach are also discussed, guiding the extension of the approach to engineering applications and dynamics analysis. Constant voltage discharge experiment is performed based on the FESS test bench built in Key Laboratory of Smart Grid of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, which validates the theoretical results. © 2017 IEEE.","bursting; Flywheel energy storage system (FESS); Homotopy method; Hopf bifurcation; singular perturbation; two-timescale","Dynamics; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Flywheel propulsion; Flywheels; Perturbation techniques; Stability; Wheels; bursting; Flywheel energy storage system; Homotopy method; Singular perturbations; Time-scales; Hopf bifurcation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049145651

The hybrid energy storage system consists of the lithium battery and the super capacitor for their complementary performances of high energy density and high power density. And voltage balancer is also used to coordinate with hybrid energy storage to balance the power on two DC buses. In order to smooth the working current of the lithium battery and avoid the high-frequency harmonic interaction between two DC buses from voltage balancer, the super capacitor is adopted as an energy buffer to compensate the ripple power. The output power of the lithium battery and working state of voltage balancer are controlled separately by measuring the relationship between two sets of super capacitors. Meanwhile, the response of the lithium battery and voltage balancer to the super capacitor is correctly implemented by adjusting voltage reference values of DC buses.

Noticing the low dimensionality of temporal measurements of power grid states as well as the sparse nature of malicious attacks, robust principal component analysis (RPCA) is applied to false data injection attack detection in power grid and low-rank matrix fitting (LMaFit) is chosen as the solving algorithm. However, conventional RPCA is an offline method which confines its application, to meet the real-time requirement of power grid attack detection, by use of low-rank projection matrix, an online RPCA based detection mechanism is proposed, which returns detection results immediately as soon as new power grid measurements arrive and needs less computing time and storage space. Experiments on the SCADA test bed show that the proposed online RPCA based detection method works well and its performance on detecting and computing is better than the previous online PCA based method. Specially, the detection sensitivity of the proposed algorithm is 4 orders of magnitude higher than online PCA, and the calculation speed is improved by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude compared to offline RPCA. © 2017 IEEE.","false data injection attack; online robust principal component analysis; power grid information security; SCADA system","Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Matrix algebra; Network security; Robust control; SCADA systems; Cyber infrastructures; Detection sensitivity; Electric power infrastructure; False data injection attacks; Power grids; Real time requirement; Robust principal component analysis; Supervisory control and dataacquisition systems (SCADA); Principal component analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049125156

The affinely adjustable robust dispatch framework is solved using the second-order cone programming, and the optimal base-point output and participation factors of energy storage and diesel generator in each dispatch interval are obtained on the wind fluctuation according to an uncertainty set. Numerical results show that the optimal operating cost increases slightly with the increase of wind power output uncertainty with higher operating costs using AARO method, but the more robust dispatch scheme, compared to deterministic cases.

These effects are analyzed in a power tower with a net capacity of 100 MWe, 8 hours of thermal energy storage and a solar multiple of 1.8 in Upington, South Africa. A large, medium and a small size heliostat with a total area of 115.56 m2, 43.3 m2 and 15.67 m2 respectively are considered for comparison. A radial-staggered pattern and an external cylindrical receiver are considered for the heliostat field layouts. The optical performance of the optimized heliostat field layouts has been evaluated by the Hermite (analytical) method using SolarPILOT, a tool used for the generation and optimization of the heliostat field layout. The heliostat cost per unit is calculated separately for the three different heliostat sizes and the effects due to size scaling, learning curve benefits and the price index is included. The annual operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs are estimated separately for the three heliostat fields, where the number of personnel required in the field is determined by the number of heliostats in the field. The LCOE values are used as a figure of merit to compare the different heliostat sizes. The results, which include the economic and the optical performance along with the annual O&amp;M costs, indicate that lowest LCOE values are achieved by the medium size heliostat with an area of 43.3 m2 for this configuration. This study will help power tower developers determine the optimal heliostat size for power tower plants currently in the development stage. © 2017 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023593572

The world is turning to decentralized generators, including fuel cell systems, which use hydrogen as fuel. This gives a special interest to the system of storage of the hydrogen produced mainly by the solar energy.

This present paper deals with controlling the power emanating from the photovoltaic system and consumed by the electrolyzer, through the use of neural networks to optimize the power generated by the photovoltaic system.

The control system is designed in synchronous reference frame based on symmetrical components theory to guarantee a full compensation of positive-negative-and zero-sequence of currents components in case of unbalancing conditions.

Hydrogen, a potential and clean fuel, can be applied in the state-of-the-art technology of 'zero emission' vehicles. Hydrogen economy infrastructure both for stationary and mobile purposes is complicated due to its critical physico-chemical properties and materials play crucial roles in every stage of hydrogen production to utilization in fuel cells in achieving high conversion efficiency, safety and robustness of the technologies involved. Moreover, traditional hydrogen storage facilities are rather complicated due to its anomalous properties such as highly porous solids and polymers have intrinsic microporosity, which is the foremost favorable characteristics of fast kinetics and reversibility, but the major drawback is the low storage capacity. In contrast, metal hydrides and complex hydrides have high hydrogen storage capacity but thermodynamically unfavorable. Therefore, hydrogen storage is a real challenge to realize 'hydrogen economy' that will solve the critical issues of humanity such as energy depletion, greenhouse emission, air pollution and ultimately climate change. Magnesium based materials, particularly magnesium hydride (MgH2) has been proposed as a potential hydrogen storage material due to its high gravimetric and volumetric capacity as well as environmentally benign properties to work the grand challenge out. © 2017 Author(s).","Air pollution; environmental; H2 fuel car; hydrogen storage; MgH2",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028565748

The biggest challenge of hybrid memory is how to decrease the average memory access cost for the higher cost of NVM's read/write operation. Currently, most researches are based on migration. However, the page migration itself is a high cost operation. And the migration based policy produces many migration operations, which induces high cost in memory access. Therefore, in order to decrease the cost, we present a virtual page behavior based page management policy (VBPM) in this paper. According to the virtual pages' behavior, we allocate virtual pages into DRAM or PCM physical pages correspondingly. The whole process is migration independent. The experimental results show our VBPM decreases the average memory access time by 24%, moreover, VBPM improves real-time performance in critical path. © 2016 IEEE.","hybrid memory; memory access; PCM; virtual page","Costs; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Energy utilization; Memory architecture; Mobile ad hoc networks; Pulse code modulation; Sensor networks; Average memory access time; Hybrid memory; Low energy consumption; Memory access; Phase change memory (pcm); Read/write operations; Real time performance; virtual page; Phase change memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024497923

The motivation for this project is based on the fact, that present configuration of traction lines, old-fashioned trolleybuses and traction substations do not allow for the effective use of recovered energy. The fundamental issue lies in the transfer of recovered energy back from the DC traction to the AC distribution network. In many cases, this is not a technical problem on the side of traction substation only, but the reverse flow of the electrical energy can cause problems even in the distribution network. The distributor of electrical energy lays down restrictive conditions for allowing the reverse transfer of energy. With the latest developments in the field of electrochemical energy storage systems and particularly by continuously declining their prices, a modern approach aims to use stationary or mobile energy storage systems for saving non-utilized energy from the DC railway and to re-use it for covering the consumption peaks. We have verified options for long range control of energy flows between substations and trolleybuses. Based on the long-term on-site measurement and performed data analysis in our dedicated software we have defined critical points for significant energy savings.

In order to guarantee stable electricity production predictability of the wind farm operational behaviour is essential. Big data approaches have the potential for a significant role in realizing this goal. In order to gain insights in turbine operational behaviour it is necessary to obtain a farm wide dataset, containing the operational sensor data of the different machines and context information such as maintenance data. Advanced analytics can use this data for understanding normal and deviating turbine operational behaviour. These insights will help in optimizing the operation and maintenance strategy of the farm.

The continued constant voltage completes the battery charging until the battery current decreases to nearly zero. To optimize the FLC, a Multi-Objective Hierarchical GA (MOHGA) is used to extract the significant fuzzy rules and simultaneously fine-tune the shape of membership functions and the system parameters.

It is becoming widely used in CPU, GPU and embedded devices. Meanwhile, as CMOS technology continues shrinking, negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) has become a major reliability concern. Recent studies show that SRAM suffers from NBTI effect, so it is a significant issue for SPM. While most research has focused on mitigating aging on cache, little attention are focusing on SPM aging mitigation. In this paper, we propose a temporal-based power management technique to turn SPM pages into sleep modes according to its recently used history. To account for different access behaviors of different applications, we propose a dynamic threshold adjustment algorithm to adjust a predefined threshold (Pth) to turn off the idle pages dynamically. We also propose a FSM-based power management technique that combines both voltage scaling and power gating techniques to change the states of SPM pages into drowsy mode or sleep mode at runtime. The experimental results show that degradation is improved more than 7% when both techniques are used simultaneously. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Energy management; Industrial management; Integrated circuit testing; Memory architecture; Negative bias temperature instability; Power management; Static random access storage; VLSI circuits; Voltage scaling; CMOS technology; Drowsy mode; Dynamic threshold; Embedded device; Lower-power consumption; Power gatings; Power management techniques; Scratch pad memory; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021450670

In practice, this will be implemented by increasing the use of wood chips, as the by-products of the wood-processing industry, bark and wood, are already completely utilised. The annual targeted use of wood chips for 2020 is 25 TWh, which means a chip volume of 13.5 million m3 [1]. As the use of wood fuel has grown, the number of fuel terminals in Finland has increased to ensure the availability and quality of wood fuel. Biofuel terminals functioning as storage facilities for solid biomass, such as chips, can cause a significant nutrient and solid matter load on the environment. In order to decrease and prevent this load, the water economy in the storage areas must be organised properly.

However, changing from one fuel to another is not straightforward: Experience shows that wood pellets ignite more readily than coal in power plant mills or storages. This is not very well explained by applying conventional thermal ignition theory. An experimental study at lab scale, using pinewood as an example fuel, was conducted to examine self-heating and self-ignition. Supplemental experiments were performed with bituminous coal. Instead of characterizing ignition temperature in terms of sample volume, mass-scaling seems more physically correct for the self-ignition of solids. Findings also suggest that the transition between self-heating and self-ignition is controlled both by the availability of reactive material and temperature. Comparison of experiments at 20% oxygen with those under inert atmosphere revealed two distinct pathways, pyrolysis and exothermic heterogeneous oxidation. At low temperatures and sufficient oxygen availability, heterogeneous oxidation of the solid seems to be favored over pyrolysis for wood, but not for coal. Current ignition models do not reflect the existence of these different pathways, which may be the reason behind the discrepancy between theory and observations. © 2018, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

The location of the biomass power plant has a high impact on the cost of the plant because feedstocks price for the biomass is greatly affected by logistics costs. The agent-based simulation model was developed to estimate costs and availability of feedstock for a number of biomass demand points by using spatial information of the feedstock in the European area. These values are the amount of delivered fuel to the demand site, the highest monthly storage levels, the number of deliveries arrived at the plant, the energy content of the feedstock arrived at plant, and costs of acquiring the feedstock. The results of the model are theoretical but with specific data impact of the plant location to feedstock acquisition may be estimated for agricultural residues with the model.

In this study, a new active contour model (ACM) implemented by the level-set framework is proposed for segmenting vessels from TOF-MRA data. The energy function of the proposed model, combining region intensity and boundary information, is composed of two region terms, one boundary term and one penalty term. The global threshold embedded into the first term is used to guide the extraction of thick vessels. While, the dynamic intensity threshold in the second term is employed to obtain the tiny ones. The boundary term is used to drive the contours to evolve towards the boundaries with high gradients. And lastly, the penalty term is used to avoid re-initializing the level set function. Compared with the global threshold based method and localized hybrid level-set method, experiments implemented on the segmentation of cerebral vessels present that our method is not only able to achieve better Dice Similarity Coefficient, but also able to extract whole cerebral vessel trees, including the thin vessels. © 2016 IEEE.","ACM; Cerebral vessel; Level set; Segmentation","Diagnosis; Digital storage; Image segmentation; Virtual reality; Visualization; Active contour model; Boundary information; Brain blood vessels; Cerebral vessels; Hybrid level set method; Level Set; Medical diagnostics; Similarity coefficients; Blood vessels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025472081

One option to compensate this is by using fossil fuel back up, but it is not a sustainable option due to the increased greenhouse gas emissions associated with fossil fuels. Another option is to couple a concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant, provided there are ample solar resources available. Additionally, in order to increase the capacity of the combined power plant, storage can be added to the CSP plant. In this paper, detailed modeling of solar resources at Bahçe Wind Farm located in the Bahçe district of Osmaniye province has been performed and a 50MW CSP plant to hybridize with wind plant has been proposed. Based on the simulation results, it is found that average capacity factor of connected transmission lines can increase by ∼ 34%, with approximately 11% of energy dumped under extreme circumstance. © 2017 IEEE.","Capacity factor; CSP plant; Hybridization; Transmission lines; Wind power plants","Electric lines; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Solar energy; Average capacities; Capacity factors; Combined power plants; Concentrated solar power; CSP plant; Detailed modeling; Hybridization; Intermittent behaviors; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025681020

Thus, one of the biggest challenges of the twenty-first century is to decrease fossil fuels' consumption and boost their consequent replacement by other cleaner and more environmentally friendly energy sources. One of the most adopted action plans, towards obtaining a more environmentally sustainable planet, involves the integration of renewable energy as a primary form of energy production, thus reducing consumption of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. Several countries present a high potential, not only in Photovoltaics, but also in Wind production, which allows these two energy sources to be explored with some impact. However, wind production has a high degree of variability, which makes its production values not always consistent with forecasted values. Consequently, there is a need to mitigate those wind power forecast errors. This paper proposes a methodology to assess the home photovoltaic potential that can be used to mitigate those wind power forecast errors caused by this high wind variability. This study considers only domestic photovoltaic and storage systems, which can be used to mitigate the wind forecast errors throughout the day. © 2017 IEEE.","home PV systems; home storage systems; wind energy production; Wind forecast","Errors; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Technological forecasting; Wind power; High degree of variability; Integration of renewable energies; Photovoltaic potentials; PV system; Storage systems; Technological development; Wind energy production; Wind forecasts; Weather forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025450591

The proposed D-UPQC contains a PV and an Energy Storage System (ESS) and may be operated in grid connected, or in island mode, in case of grid failure. The control strategies are designed to guarantee that in grid connected mode the voltage applied to a set of loads (microgrid) and the current injected in the Low Voltage (LV) grid present minimum harmonic content. Also, in this operation mode, the proposed D-UPQC is able to mitigate voltage sags, improving Power Quality (PQ) in the microgrid. A simulation model of the proposed system is obtained in Matlab/Simulink. Results are obtained with the D-UPQC working as an interface between the PV System, the ESS and the LV grid. The obtained results show that the proposed system guarantees PQ enhancement in the microgrid, and guarantees nearly unitary PF in the connection to the LV grid. © 2017 IEEE.","Distributed Energy Resources; Microgrids; Power Quality; Voltage Sags","Energy resources; Control strategies; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy storage systems; Grid-connected modes; Harmonic contents; Micro grid; Unified power quality conditioners; Voltage sags; Power quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025427230

However, battery operating temperature plays a vital role on the reliability, lifespan, safety and performance of EV and HV. Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) must keep the operating temperature of the battery pack between 20 °C and 40 °C in order to achieve good performances and long lifespan. To this day, this task remains a challenging subject for the electric vehicle (EV) development. BTMS consumes energy from the on-board battery pack, thus reducing the range of the vehicle. In order to reduce this adverse impact, this paper presents a novel approach that takes advantage of the non-uniform surface distribution of li-ion battery cell, which results from complex reactions inside the cell. First, li-ion hotspots were identified and found next to the positive and negative tabs. Then, thermoelectric coolers (TEC) are mounted next to the tabs and in the center of the li-ion battery. The control circuit is designed to turn on and off TECs in order to reduce the parasitic power feeding the BTMS. Experimental results show the feasibility of this system. © 2017 IEEE.","battery thermal management system (BTMS); lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4) battery; thermoelectric coolers (TECs)","Battery management systems; Cooling systems; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Hybrid vehicles; Intelligent systems; Ions; Iron compounds; Secondary batteries; Temperature; Temperature control; Thermal variables control; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectric refrigeration; Thermoelectricity; Vehicles; Wireless telecommunication systems; Battery thermal managements; Electrochemical energy storage; High energy densities; LiFePO; Lithium iron phosphates; Operating temperature; Solid state batteries; Thermoelectric cooler; Lithium-ion batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021658126

Fell cell (FC) is one of the promising technologies for solving energy issues in the future owing to the interesting features such as high electrical efficiency, low emissions, low noise level, and modularity. IEM-based processes, such as microbial fuel cell (MFC) and reverse electrodialysis (RED) may be combined with water or wastewater treatment into an integrated system. By using the integrated system, water and energy could be produced simultaneously. The IEM-based processes can be used for direct electricity generation or long term energy storage such as by harnessing surplus electricity from an existing renewable energy system to be converted into hydrogen gas via electrolysis or stored into chemical energy via redox flow battery (RFB). In this paper, recent development and applications of IEM-based processes in energy conversion are reviewed.

While most of these technologies are not commercially viable at present due to some of their limitations, the battery energy storage system (BESS) are having incremental market entries and continual improvements for use in different renewable energy applications in transportation, energy back-up, smart grid systems etc. In this paper, the advancements of BESS in renewable (photovoltaic) energy applications are reviewed alongside other ESS. It is of importance that as we approach the electric future, there is also a need for smart storage technologies which would be commercially viable and with the continual improvements in battery technologies, in comparison with other developing ESS, BESS may not be obsolete in the near future but rather contribute to a faster realization of smart electric future as their continual advancements continue. © 2017 Cape Peninsula University of Technology.","Battery energy storage systems; battery technologies; electric future; renewable energy applications","Electric batteries; Energy storage; Renewable energy resources; Battery energy storage systems; Battery technology; electric future; Energy applications; Energy storage systems; Renewable energy applications; Renewable energy source; Smart grid systems; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025682550

Hence, the optimum configuration of the proposed MHK-PHS hybrid system is determined in order to investigate the effect of each demand sector on sizing and operation of the hybrid system.

The results have shown that the industrial load sector incur the lowest cost of energy at the highest capital cost as opposed to the residential and commercial load sectors. However, from economic perspective, the residential demand sector proved to be more favorable to the proposed hybrid system due to the lowest net present cost (NPV).

But batteries will affect submodule power, making it more difficult to control submodule capacitor voltage. Firstly, this paper analyzes the impact of batteries on capacitor voltage. It has opposite characteristic in discharging and charging mode. In discharging mode, capacitor voltage is self-balancing. But in charging mode, capacitor voltage is easy to be unbalanced. Then a modulation ratio factor is defined to control submodule power through changing the AC component of submodule terminal voltage. On this basis, a close-loop based voltage balancing control method is proposed. Different from traditional method, arm current is not needed here.

The topology is derived by integrating a staked dual-active half-bridge converter (DAHB) into a switched-inductor buck-boost BDC. With the secondary windings of two coupled inductors in series connection, high voltage gain and reduced switch voltage stresses can be obtained. Hence, reduced turns-ratio of two coupled inductors and low-voltage rated MOSFETs can be used to realize high efficiency conversion. The coupled inductors can operate not only as a switched-inductor of two buck-boost BDCs, but also as two transformers of the equivalent DAHB converter. What's more, with PWM plus phase shift (PPS) control scheme, soft-switching of all the active switches can be realized.

The proposed converter overcomes the narrow voltage gain range of conventional resonant DC-DC converters, and meanwhile achieves high efficiency. It is realized by configuring a full-bridge mode and a half-bridge mode operation during each switching cycle. The fixed-frequency phase-shift control schemes are applied and the normalized voltage gain can be always from 0.5 to 1, regardless of the load. The transformer root-mean-square (RMS) currents in both the forward and the reverse modes have a negligible variation with respect to the voltage gain, which is beneficial to low conduction losses throughout a wide voltage range. Moreover, the applied MOSFETs are soft-switched, allowing for minimum switching losses. Both the operation principles and characteristics of the proposed converter are analyzed. Finally, a 1-kW converter prototype is built and the experimental results verify the theoretical analyses. © 2017 IEEE.","Bidirectional DC-DC converter; Resonant converter; Wide gain range","Electric inverters; Gain measurement; Power converters; Power electronics; Bidirectional DC-DC converters; Energy storage systems; Full bridge mode; Low conduction loss; Phase shift control; Resonant converters; Resonant dc-dc converter; Wide gain range; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020010673

As the size of digital media grows along with amount of data, manual search of digital audio files according to its genre is considered impractical and inefficient; therefore a classification mechanism is needed to improve searching. Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Average Energy (E) and Silent Ratio (SR) are a few of features that can be extracted from digital audio files to classify its genre. This research is conducted to classify music from digital audio (songs) into 12 genres: Ballad, Blues, Classic, Harmony, Hip Hop, Jazz, Keroncong, Latin, Pop, Electronic, Reggae and Rock using above mentioned features, extracted from WAV audio files. Classification is performed several times using selected 3, 6, 9 and 12 genres respectively. The result shows that classification of 3 music genres (Ballad, Blues, Classic) has the highest accuracy (96.67%), followed by 6 genres (Ballad, Blues, Classic, Harmony, Hip Hop, Jazz) with 70%, and 9 genres (Ballad, Blues, Classic, Harmony, Hip Hop, Jazz, Keroncong, Latin, Pop) with 53.33% accuracy. Classification of all 12 music genres yields the lowest accuracy of 33.33%. The test results with the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to 120 songs for k = 3 accuracy reaches 22.5%, k = 5 accuracy reaches 22.5%, k = 7 accuracy reaching 26.7% and k = 9 accuracy reaches 26.7 %. Results showed that genre classification by matching the shortest distance through the centre of the class, yields better results than using the k-NN algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.","Average Energy (E); k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN); Nearest Centroid Classifier; Silent Ratio (SR); Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR)","Digital storage; Information management; Nearest neighbor search; Pattern recognition; Average energy; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); Nearest centroid classifiers; Silent Ratio (SR); Zero crossing rate; Audio acoustics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020698033

Hybrid memory architecture composed of emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and DRAM is a promising approach to large-capacity and energy-efficient main memory. However, hybrid memory systems pose a new challenge to on-chip cache management due to the asymmetrical penalty of memory access to DRAM and NVM in case of cache misses. Cache hit rate is no longer an effective metric for evaluating memory access performance in hybrid memory systems. Current cache replacement policies that aim to improve cache hit rate are not efficient either. In this paper, we take into account the asymmetry of cache miss penalty on DRAM and NVM, and advocate a more general metric, Average Memory Access Time (AMAT), to evaluate the performance of hybrid memories. We propose a miss penalty-aware LRU-based (MALRU) cache replacement policy for hybrid memory systems. MALRU is aware of the source (DRAM or NVM) of missing blocks and prevents high-latency NVM blocks as well as low-latency DRAM blocks with good temporal locality from being evicted. Experimental results show that MALRU improves system performance against LRU and the state-of-the-art HAP policy by up to 20.4% and 11.7% (11.1% and 5.7% on average), respectively. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Buffer storage; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Memory architecture; Average memory access time; Cache replacement; Cache replacement policy; Emerging non-volatile memory; Energy efficient; State of the art; Storage densities; Temporal locality; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020233675

Specifically, the ESD connected to the DC-link capacitor of the DFIG is controlled to regulate the transient DC-link voltage. This is actually equivalent to absorb the power imbalance between the captured wind power and the power delivered to the grid by the DFIG during the fault so that the DC-link voltage and the rotor current dynamics can be greatly improved. Moreover, the rotor speed and the pitch angle are also controlled to initiatively react to the low voltage transient, which includes increasing the rotor speed to store the unbalanced energy as kinetic energy and augmenting the pitch angle to decrease the captured wind power. Thus, due to less unbalanced power flowing into the rotor, the DFIG dynamics can be further ameliorated and the required ESD capacity can be obviously saved. As the grid side converter (GSC) can be free from managing the transient DC-link voltage, it is manipulated to devote its whole capacity to inject reactive power to the grid for voltage support during the fault. By simulating a single-machine-infinite-bus power system, comparisons with other control methods are conducted to prove that the novel proposed control method can well ensure the DFIG LVRT capability but save the ESD capacity, and also significantly improve the terminal voltage dynamics during the grid fault. © 2017 IEEE.","Doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG); energy storage device(ESD); low voltage ride-Through; static synchronous compensator (STATCOM); Transient voltage support","Asynchronous generators; Dynamics; Electric current regulators; Electric energy storage; Electric fault currents; Electric machine control; Electric power transmission networks; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatic discharge; Energy storage; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Power quality; Static synchronous compensators; Wind power; Doubly fed induction generators; Energy storage devices (ESD); Low-voltage ride-through; Static synchronous compensator STATCOM; Transient voltage; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020231401

In order to keep persistent data consistent in case of system failures, most prior work relies on persist ordering constraints which incurs significant overheads. Strand persistency minimizes persist ordering constraints. However, there is still no proposed persistent memory design based on strand persistency due to its implementation complexity. In this work, we propose a novel persistent memory system based on strand persistency, called SPMS. SPMS consists of cacheline-based strand group tracking components, a volatile strand buffer and ultra-capacitors incorporated in persistent memory modules. SPMS can track each strand and guarantee its atomicity. In case of system failures, committed strands buffered in the strand buffer can be flushed back to persistent memory within the residual energy window provided by the ultra-capacitors.

And consumption of fossil fuel will increase rapidly, which has brought serious challenges to the mobile operators in cost control and the ecological environment. With the development of renewable energy and smart grid, great changes have taken place in energy structure and energy utilization of the cellular network. The future trend of cellular networks will present a multi-source power. Traditional grid as the main body, centralized powering the base station form the wide area power grid, to maintain the basic power of wireless network. As a supplement, green base station can combine the set of equipment, base station, storage battery and charge controller together to achieve micro electric power network by multi-sources energy harvesting technology. However, the harvest of the renewable energy is influenced by the time-space instability. The demand of users and the consumption of the cellular networks are also influenced by space-Time instability. Therefore, this paper proposes a model of the flexible configuration of energy through the energy management unit(EMU), through energy cooperation between base stations and smart grid, we can get optimal energy configuration. By analyzing the scenario of N time slots, m base station, we solve the optimal energy profiles for each time slots according to the greedy algorithm and Linear programming, and then the relevant simulation will validate the algorithm. By using the algorithm to realize the energy cooperation according to the demands of each node, we can recede the instability of the process of energy harvesting.

However, the mainstream current (spin transfer torque, STT or spin Hall effect, SHE) driven MRAMs (STT-MRAM or SHE-MRAM) face intrinsic problems in terms of high write power and long latency, significantly limiting the applications for low-power and high-speed working memories. The recently-developed new-generation MRAM, named VCMA-MRAM, which exploits the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect to write (or assist to write) data information into magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), holds the promise to efficiently overcome these problems. Despite the impressive possibility of improving write power and speed, this technology, however, is currently under intensive research and development (R&D), and some challenges still await answers. In this paper, we investigate the perspectives and challenges of VCMA-MRAM for working memories from a cross-layer (device/circuit/architecture) design point of view. We demonstrate that VCMA-MRAM outperforms STT-MRAM and SHE-MRAM in terms of area, speed, energy consumption and instruction-per-cycle (IPC) performance, benefiting from the low-power and high-speed VCMA-driven data writing mechanism.

However, these NVMs suffer from the write endurance problem. In order to prevent a malicious program from wearing out NVMs deliberately, researchers have proposed various wear-leveling methods, which remap logical addresses to physical addresses randomly and dynamically. However, we discover that side channel leakage based on NVM row buffer hit information can reveal details of address remappings. Consequently, it can be leveraged to side-step the wear-leveling. Our simulation shows that the proposed attack method in this paper can wear out a NVM within 137 seconds, even with the protection of state-of-the-art wear-leveling schemes. To counteract this attack, we further introduce an effective countermeasure named Intra-Row Swap (IRS) to hide the wear-leveling details. The basic idea is to enable an additional intra-row block swap when a new logical address is remapped to the memory row. Experiments demonstrate that IRS can secure NVMs with negligible timing/energy overhead, compared with previous works. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Side channel attack; Timing circuits; Attack methods; High storage density; Low stand-by power; Non-volatile memory; Side-channel; State of the art; Wear leveling; Write endurances; Physical addresses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020181897

A novel simplified SFR model, approximating frequency and governor responses with quadratic and linear functions respectively, is first developed, leading to a fast and accurate computation of the frequency indexes such as frequency deviations. Then, taking the frequency and governor response limit constraints into account, algorithms are proposed to search for optimal size and controller parameters for the ESS during transient frequency control (TFC). The performance of the ESS controllers with optimum parameters (OP) and constant parameters (CP) is evaluated by comparing the frequency and governor responses for wind power fluctuations.

Energy internet aims to lower the dependence on traditional fossil energies, and to increase the utilization efficiency of RES to the greatest extent. In regions like northern China, plenty of RES are being abandoned every year, especially in heating season. Meanwhile, most residents in these regions are now using seriously polluted coal fired ways for warmth. Clean heating system utilizes excess RES replacing coal fired ways to meet heat demand. Due to the volatility and uncertainty of intermittent renewable energy, to guarantee reliable heating service, distributed heat storage devices and support from thermal power are necessary. In this way, either bigger or smaller scale of the clean heating would lead to inefficient utilization of resources in view of the electricity-heat integrated energy system. Based on energy internet technology, from the perspective of minimizing fossil energy consumption of the integrated energy system, combining planning issues and coordinated optimization operation issues, the paper proposes an optimal planning model to optimize the scale of the clean heating and capacity of electric heating devices as well as thermal storage devices. At last, simulation in the West Inner Mongolia Power Grid shows the running condition of the system and optimization results. © 2017 IEEE.","clean heating; energy internet; optimal planning; renewable energy sources; the electricity-heat integrated energy system; thermal storage","Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Heat storage; Heating; Heating equipment; Natural resources; Planning; Virtual storage; Energy internet; Integrated energy systems; Optimal planning; Renewable energy source; Thermal storage; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020170296

Hence, this fact should be modified due of the great increase in their penetration rate in the grid. This is because of the first source of these systems of energy production (wind) which is very random and unpredictable nature. For this reason, and to guarantee the production / consumption equilibrium, energy storage systems are envisaged. The storage system should be faster to work on line respect with the produced and consumed power fluctuations respectively. Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS) is suitable for this kind of application because of its features: High performance, good efficiency, long lifetime (similar to the wind generators), ecological system, which is enough to improve the quality of the energy. In this work, our aim is to develop a simple FESS used double star Asynchronous machine (DSIM) associated to Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). The presented strategy is used to a WECS based on a Dual Star Induction Generator (DSIG). The presented FESS is used not only to smooth wind power fluctuations, but also to adjust the frequency and the voltage of the grid during operating conditions. The suggested FESS contains a power electronic converter supplying the DSIM connected to a flywheel. Numerical results of 1.5MW DSIG system are provided to show the feature of control method and the large interest of energy storage in such WECS. © 2017 IEEE.","double stator Asynchronous generator; FESS control; field-oriented control; flywheel energy storage system (FESS); wind turbine","Asynchronous generators; Asynchronous machinery; Electric generators; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Flywheel propulsion; Flywheels; Numerical methods; Power converters; Renewable energy resources; Stars; Vector control (Electric machinery); Voltage regulators; Wheels; Wind power; Wind turbines; Double star asynchronous machines; Double stator; Energy storage systems; Flywheel energy storage system; Frequency regulations; Power electronic converters; Wind energy conversion system; Wind generator systems; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020253862

Interest in hydrogen generation is on the rise due to its potential as a scalable green energy source, its transportability, and other positive factors. While various studies have been conducted on hydrogen generation, this review explores three major factors in hydrogen generation in relation to sustainability: substrates or hydrogen storage media, catalysts for speeding up the rate of hydrogen reaction, and methods employed. The media used to store the hydrogen, such as metal hydrides and complex hydrides, is examined in relationship to hydrogen yield, ease of hydrogen generation or treatment, cost and environmental friendliness. A list of popular catalysts - particularly precious/rare earth metals, strong acids and weak acids - is examined and compared in terms of hydrogen yield, environmental friendliness, and cost. The recent trend in hydrogen generation techniques and material treatment innovations such as hydrolysis, and ball milling of nanocomposites is examined. Innovations in hydrogen storage material selection and techniques will go a long way in lowering hydrogen generation cost, increasing hydrogen yield and ameliorating negative environmental impacts. © 2017 IEEE.","ball milling; catalyst; Hydrogen generation; hydrogen storage media; hydrolysis","Ball milling; Catalysts; Costs; Environmental impact; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Hydrolysis; Manufacture; Milling (machining); Storage (materials); Sustainable development; Alternative sources of energy; Complex hydrides; Environmental friendliness; Green energy sources; Hydrogen generations; Hydrogen reaction; Hydrogen storage media; Material treatment; Hydrogen production",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020032017

A real-time optimal energy dispatch for microgrid is proposed in this paper, which can reduce the energy loss and enhance the economy. Compared with the conventional dispatch method, that is more useful because the real-time dispatch can avoid some predictive error accumulation and the battery energy storage in the microgrid can transfer energy from one scheduled period to another. First, the object function of optimal energy dispatch is put forward and the constraints of microgrid are analyzed. Second, after the optimal model is established, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to search the optimal solution of the problem. Third, the best rated capacity of batteries of a certain microgrid is determined by simulation.

This enables extension of functionality and application range of the converter to the energy storage and buffering systems. Two novel methods of reverse power flow control were introduced: one that requires no qZS network reconfiguration and is based on the resonant properties of the given topology, while the other is based on the qZS network reconfiguration into LC filter and does not depend on whether an IS converter is resonant or not.

However, the write inefficiency associated with NVM brings significant challenges to the last-level cache (LLC) replacement design. LLC replacement policies in the context of DRAM hardly focus on writeback optimization. Based on the observation that writeback to NVM diminishes the performance gained from replacement optimization, we exploit to improve LLC replacement policy with a writeback-Aware reuse stack (Warstack). Warstack enhances the default reuse priority in terms of writeback intensity. Incooperating with an accurate writeback intensity predictor (WBIP), Warstack dynamically ranks the reuse priority and retains high write-intensive blocks to mitigate the write traffic. Evaluations with memory-intensive multi-programmed programs from SPEC CPU2006 show that Warstack improves performance and energy efficiency by about 12% and 15% on average. © 2017 IEEE.","Cache Replacement; Non-Volatile Memory","Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage; Energy efficiency; Nonvolatile storage; Cache replacement; Emerging non-volatile memory; Lastlevel caches (LLC); Non-volatile memory; Replacement policy; Write-back; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019624303

Energy storage systems are playing very important role in renewable power systems and microgrids. Depending on the nature of power requirement, utilization of multiple energy storage units with distinguised characteristics in terms of power and energy density is quite common in microgrids. Batteries are one of the most commonly used energy storage systems in microgrids, to support slow transients or steady state load demands. The power charge/discharge rates affects the stress levels in the battery, which in turn affects the battery life span; and its power pattern affects stored/discharge energy from the battery, which in turn affects the state of charge (SOC) of the battery. Therefore, to optimize the charge/discharge rates a two stage rate limit control scheme is proposed, and its application for different operating modes is discussed in this paper.

The bio-oil obtained from the biomass has many advantages than traditional use. Firstly, it has features such as high energy density, easy storage and easy transportation. Bio-oil can be used as a fuel in engines, turbines and burning units directly. Besides, it can be converted into products in higher quality and volume via catalytic cracking, hydrodexygenation, emulsification, and steam reforming [1,2]. Many organic solvents such as acetone, ethanol, methanol, isopropanol are used in the supercritical liquefaction processes. When we think about the cost and effects of the organic solvent on nature, it will be understood better that it is necessary to find solvent that are more sensitive against nature. Here, water must have an important place because of its features. Most important solvent of the world water is named as ""universal solvent"" because none of the liquids can dissolve the materials as much as done by water. Water is found much at the nature and cost of it is very few when compared with the other solvent. Hydrothermal liquefaction, a thermochemical conversion process is an effective method used for converting biomass into the liquid products. General reaction conditions for hydrothermal liquefaction process are the 250-374°C temperature range and 4 - 22 Mpa pressure values range, besides, the temperature values can be higher according to the product that is expected to be obtained [3,4].

In fact, it succeeded in discharging users from computational and storage burden to offer them as services following pay-As-you-go principle. The substantial feature of Cloud is the ability to scale up with the rise of users' demands. However, Cloud performance falls into the duty of scaling up to fulfill the user requirements and the dramatically increase in energy consumption dilemma. In order to establish a certain trade-off, server consolidation tries to tackle this challenge by maximizing resources utilization per server in order to minimize the number of active servers. In fact, with the ever-growing demands on cloud services, cloud providers must be able to manage highly fluctuating workloads and avoids SLA violation. In this paper we are concerned by two main levels: Front-end and back-end. The former exhibits the set of users that utilize cloud services and the later is materialized by data centers where the factual load is carry out. It's significant to say that the front-end users are the leading responsible of the workload shape within data centers. We point out this fact in an attempt to further investigate the server workload within real time angle. The main goal of this paper is to formalize the server load according to users' behavior in term of submitted tasks and submission rate and to apply stream mining techniques as an introductory step to build a real time prediction system. © 2017 IEEE.","real time; server load prediction; Stream Mining; task; user","Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Web services; Real time; Server loads; Stream mining; task; user; Green computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018270225

A significant milestone would be to manage that variation from renewable sources before it reaches the grid.

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop a fuzzy TOPSIS method to deal with above multiple criteria decision making(MCDM) problems. Here, the linguistic variables are represented by membership degrees applying the axiomatic fuzzy set (AFS) theory, then the application of TOPSIS approach is extended.

When it is operated in the grid connected mode, it is connected to the grid at the point of common coupling (PCC). A micro grid normally consists of renewable energy sources, a diesel generator, storage facilities and a central controller. The micro grid described in this paper contains only a diesel generator, a wind emulator and the loads. Designing of central controller is the main objective of this research. This paper discuss how the governor of the diesel generator is controlled via a central controller in both the isolated and grid connected operations. Frequency should be controlled in isolated operation and the power flow through point of common coupling (PCC) should be controlled in the grid connected operation. MATLAB Simulink was used to simulate and analyze both of these situations.

To enhance the scalability and reliability of publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems implemented on a large-scale in WSNs, dedicated broker devices with large storage and computation capacities can be replaced with virtual brokers (VBs), each formed by multiple co-located sensor nodes that shared resources to collaboratively perform the role of a conventional broker. As communication is a major consumer of energy, which is a scarce resource in WSNs, how the WSN is structured in terms of the number of partitions and the size of VB can impact the energy consumption of the network. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to optimal network structuring of large-scale WSN with virtual brokers for pub/sub communication. Underlying the approach is an analytical model which determines the optimal number of partitions and VB size that jointly minimize the total communication overhead of the WSN. © 2017 IEEE.","analytical model; network structuring; publish/subscribe; virtual broker; wireless sensor network","Analytical models; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Communication overheads; Computation capacity; Large-scale wireless sensor networks; Network structuring; Publish/subscribe; Scarce resources; Shared resources; virtual broker; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018697417

The panels are mounted on roofs at a decline angle of 20° to 45°. In winter time, a dense layer of snow at a width of e.g. 10 cm keeps off solar radiation from the photovoltaic cells for weeks under continental climate conditions. Practically no energy is produced over the time of snow coverage. Only until outside air temperature has risen high enough for a rather long time interval to allow partial melting of snow the snow layer rushes down in an avalanche. Following this proposal, snow removal can be arranged electrically at an extremely positive energy balance in a fast way. A photovoltaic cell is a large junction area diode inside with a threshold voltage of about 0.6 V to 0.7 V (depending on temperature). This forward voltage drop created by an externally driven current through the modules can be efficiently used to provide well-distributed heat dissipation at the cell and further on at the glass surface of the whole panel. The adhesion of snow on glass is widely reduced through this heating in case a thin water film can be produced by this external short time heating. Laboratory experiments provided a temperature increase through rated panel current of more than 10°C within about 10 minutes.

In comparison with other bio-metric techniques gait analysis has some special security features. Most of the biometric techniques use sequential template based component analysis for recognition. Here we have proposed a developed technique for gait identification using the feature Gait Energy Image (GEI). It is implemented using Kohonen Self-Organizing Mapping (KSOM) neural network. GEI representation of gait contains all information of each image in one complete gait cycle and requires less storage and low processing speed. As only one image is enough to store the necessary information in GEI feature, recognition process is a bit easier than any other feature of gait recognition. Gait recognition has some limitations like viewing angle variation, walking speed, clothes, carrying load etc. Robust View Transformation Model (RVTM) is used to solve the problem of viewing angle. RVTM transforms the viewing angle data from various angle to specific angle. RVTM enhances recognition performance. Our proposed method compares the recognition performance with template based feature extraction which needs to process each frame in the cycle. We use GEI which gives all possible information about all the frames in one cycle and results in better performance than other feature of gait analysis. © 2016 IEEE.","Gait analysis; Gait Energy Image; Kohonen Self-Organizing Mapping network; Unsupervised learning","Biometrics; Digital storage; Feature extraction; Gait analysis; Image processing; Mapping; Unsupervised learning; Biometric techniques; Component analysis; Gait energy images; Gait identifications; Human identification; Recognition process; Self-organizing mapping; View transformation models; Pattern recognition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017306940

As the human population increases, our rate of consumption of these fossil fuels also increases. On the other hand, world population continues to grow and the limited amount of fossil fuels begin to diminish, it may not be possible to provide the amount of energy demanded by the world by only using fossil fuels to convert energy. The solution to the problems of limited fossil fuels and their impact on the environment is to have renewable resources play a larger role in the supply of energy. In this case wind energy is the most promising green energy. As wind turbine output is proportional to the cube of wind speed, the wind turbine generator output fluctuates due to wind speed variation. Thus this paper focuses on the comparative study between conventional wind turbine models with modified pitch controller and proposed a new technique called modified pitch governor with exciter controller to control output voltage and frequency without using any costly energy storage devices. In this study variable load is considered and real wind speed data is taken to obtain realistic response.

Among various renewable resources, wind energy seems to be promising solution to provide reliable power supply with improved system efficiency. It is essential for wind farm to control the frequency as well as power. Some methods for smoothing the wind generator output fluctuations using several types of energy storage systems have been proposed, but these methods have a cost of problem. This paper proposes a new pitch control system for smoothing the wind generator output fluctuations. The simulation results show that the wind farm output fluctuations due to the wind speed variations can be smooth more effectively by the new pitch controller than the conventional pitch controller. It is confirmed that the wind farm output gives rise to fluctuations of system frequency more as the power capacity of wind farm becomes large. The wind farm output fluctuations, as well as energy and the power system frequency can be made more accurate by using new pitch controller.

An EV frequency control strategy is proposed considering the charging and discharging characteristics of the EV battery. Different from battery energy storage system, the availability of EVs largely depends on the charging behaviors. With different charging power and different charging time, three charging strategies are studied (dumb charging, smart charging and constant charging).

In this paper, potential game theory is introduced to model the coordinated optimization of a standalone microgrid comprised of wind turbine, photovoltaic cell, diesel engines and storage battery. Specifically, the electric load is classified into non-interruptible load, non-transferably interruptible load and transferably interruptible load, considering the peak load shifting effect of demand side reserve on microgrid coordinated operation. Then an optimization model based on potential game is established by taking diesel engines, battery and electric load as players and their operating cost as payoffs. The superior finite increment property of potential game guarantees the existence of pure strategy equilibrium.

It is very important to study the joint generation dispatching issue of power grid for nuclear power peaking. Due to the anti peaking characteristics of wind power output, power load peak valley difference further increases, and thus it exacerbates the difficulty of peak load regulation in power grid. By increasing the capacity of heat storage device, the peak load regulation can be realized when nuclear power is regarded as the base load in power grid. A joint nuclear-thermal-wind-heat storage generation dispatching model is proposed in this paper according to the time transfer capability of heat storage device energy.

The increasing number of private PV arrays calls out for high energy storage capacities in order not to overload the grid. Despite being the current storage technology of choice, chemical batteries are still too expensive and have certain disadvantages compared to FESS, such as capacity fade over time and currently still difficult recycling. Within a research project at the Graz University of Technology a feasibility study for a low-cost, low-loss FESS was conducted. Energetic dimensioning was performed using actual PV power and electric load data recorded at a building in Austria with 6 apartment units. A low-cost flywheel system with an energy content of 5.0 kWh and 2.2 kW maximum rated power using a steel rotor and economic off-the shelf components was designed and investigated. Self-discharge of the proposed FESS design was significantly reduced using a cast silicone bearing seat, which allows supercritical rotor operation. Axial bearing loads were compensated by nearly 100% via repelling permanent magnets allowing drastic down-sizing of the bearings and further reduction of torque loss. The concept was validated by a small-scale test setup, which showed promising results. Finally, an improved design option is compared to the initially proposed FESS in terms of costs and self-discharge. © 2016 IEEE.","flywheel energy storage; photovoltaic; renewable energy; Solar power","Costs; Electric batteries; Electronic Waste; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Flywheel propulsion; Flywheels; Photovoltaic cells; Silicones; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wheels; Energy storage capacity; Flywheel energy storage; Flywheel energy storage system; Off-the-shelf components; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energies; Rooftop photovoltaic systems; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016994062

The small signal behavior of the system is investigated considering the real part of the dominant eigenvalues. The impact of the participation of the distributed generation sources on the small-signal stability has been investigated. While it is essential that participation of the alternator should be a minimum from economic and environmental considerations, it has been observed that its participation is essential for satisfactory operation of the grid in terms of maintaining frequency of the system as well as from general stability considerations. Too little contribution from the micro-alternator may drive the system unstable even under small disturbance conditions.

It is necessary to motivate residential users to participate in managing their household appliances. However, it is a considerable challenge for residential users to find an optimal scheduling scheme of household appliances by themselves. In this paper, a novel model for home energy management system (HEMS) based on Internet of things (loT) is proposed to solve this challenge. The model not only utilizes radio frequency technology (RFID) to achieve full automatic control of household appliances, but also employs renewable energy, storage battery and plug-in electric vehicles (PEV). Considering various users' demands, the model can set four kinds of demands for household appliances via terminal appliances. To provide a higher users' satisfaction, two types of satisfactory functions are presented. The model adopts the time interval optimization strategy to find an optimal scheme, and the objective function minimizes the users' electricity costs as well as maximizes the users' satisfaction. Meanwhile the discrete multi-objective bacterial colony chemotaxis algorithm (DMOBCC) is adopted to solve this problem. Case studies are implemented to demonstrate the time interval optimization strategy and simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","Appliances scheduling; Demand response(DR); Home energy management system (HEMS); Users' satisfaction","Automation; Biochemistry; Domestic appliances; Electric machine control; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Equipment; Housing; Internet of things; Plug-in electric vehicles; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Bacterial colony chemotaxis algorithm; Demand response; Home energy management systems; Objective functions; Optimal scheduling; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); Radiofrequency technology; Users' satisfactions; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017261398

The Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) technique is proposed to solve the optimization model. The model takes into account the fluctuations of renewable energy resources and load demands within the microgrid and uses appropriate forecasting to overcome these fluctuations. The proposed MPSO-based EMS has been tested on a real microgrid in stand-Alone mode (Goldwind Smart Microgrid System, Beijing, China). Simulation results have revealed that the proposed MPSO-based EMS can solve the day-Ahead optimization model in acceptable fast computation time efficiently. To validate the performances of the proposed strategy, simulation results were also obtained using Genetic Algorithm (GA).

Ensuring that data is accessible to the rightful individual as well as deletion of the data from the third party storage are vital. It is usual for the third party service to create copies of the uploaded data for reliability, as a result of which deleting the data the owner uploaded does not guarantee the inexistence of the data from the cloud. A method called File Assured Deletion or FADE has been introduced to handle both the accessibility and deletion issue. By encrypting the outsourced data, it guarantees the privacy and integrity of it while associating data with a policy assures its deletion upon policy revocation. Although FADE is a consistent and coherent cloud overlay system designed to work on top of present day cloud infrastructure, it involves a third party key manager which needs to be considered trusted in order for the system to work. Simplified File Assured Deletion or SFADE takes the principals of the previous approach and modifies it to create an easier to implement and friendlier system for the ordinary users, by making it independent of a key manager. FADE and SFADE both lacks sharing feature i.e. way for the data owner to share the outsourced data in a secure way with other users chosen by data owner. This paper discusses the prospect and proposes technique to implement data sharing while adhering to the policy based encryption in FADE and SFADE. © 2017 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Cryptography; File Assured Deletion; Security; Storage","Cloud computing; Cryptography; Energy storage; Managers; Cloud infrastructures; Cloud storage systems; Coherent clouds; File Assured Deletion; Outsourced datum; Security; Sharing features; Third party services; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016777372

In this paper, we investigate the distributed data storage problem in the SIN, a novel hybrid distributed storage (HDS) strategy is proposed to improve the data reliability based on the AS network model. After a data object is optimal encoded using maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, the storage process is divided into two phases: the inter-AS storage phase and intra-AS storage phase, respectively. The inter-AS storage is modeled as an optimal storage allocation problem for a heterogeneous network under multiple constraints, where different AS networks have different capacities and availabilities. Then, we deduce the distributed storage within each AS network to a data persistence problem. As a result, the data object is disseminated over the SIN and it can be recovered by collecting a few encoded packets. The proposed strategy utilizes the advantage of AS network model of SIN, while aiming to improve data reliability and energy efficiency. © 2016 IEEE.","Autonomous system network; Data persistence; Hybrid distributed storage; Space information network","Distributed computer systems; Energy efficiency; Heterogeneous networks; Information management; Information services; Autonomous systems; Data persistence; Data reliability; Distributed data storages; Distributed storage; Maximum distance separable code; Multiple constraint; Space information network; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016820040

In the present study, a charging controller which uses an Arduino microcontroller, is designed. 3 (three) indicator lights are installed to indicate the battery charging process, power diversion to dummy load and battery power level. The performance of the designed controller is evaluated by simulating 3 cases. In this simulation, a battery with maximum voltage of 12.4 V is used. Case 1 is performed with input voltage equals the one set in Arduino which is 10 V. In this case, the battery is charged up to 10.8 V. In case 2, the input voltage is 13 V while the maximum voltage set in Arduino is also 13 V. In this case, the battery is charged up to maximum voltage of the battery. Moreover, the dummy load indicator is ON and charging indicator is OFF after the maximum charging voltage is reached because the electricity is flowed to the dummy load. In the final case, the input voltage is set to be 16 V while the maximum voltage set in Arduino is 13 V. In this case, the charging indicator is OFF and dummy load indicator is ON which means that the Arduino has successfully switched the power to be flowed to dummy load. From the 3 (three) cases, it can be concluded that the designed controller works perfectly to control the charging process of the wind turbine. Moreover, the charging time needed in each case can also be determined. © 2017 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014790918

The excess energy produced, with respect to the load requirements, is sent to the batteries for storage. When the energy produced by the wind generator is not sufficient, load's energy requirement is covered by the battery system, ensuring, however, that voltage, frequency and other system characteristics are within the proper boundaries. For the purpose of this study, a Voltage Oriented Control system has been developed in order to monitor the autonomous operation and perform the energy management of the network. This system manages the power flows between the load and the storage system by properly controlling the Pulse Width Modulation pulses in the converter, thus ensuring power flows are adequate and frequency remains under control.

This paper proposes a framework for energy cooperation among base stations (BSS) in coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission based cellular networks, where the BSS are powered by hybrid power supplies including both the conventional grid and renewable energy sources. The considered network deploys BSS having independent energy storages, which are assumed interconnected by resistive power lines for energy sharing. The network also integrates dynamic point selection (DPS) CoMP technique for selecting the best serving BSS for an user equipment. The objective of the proposed cooperation is to maximize the usage of renewable solar energy leading to reduced on-grid power consumption. The proposed energy cooperation among BSS exploits the tempospatial diversities of both the renewable energy generation and the traffic demand.

In future, RES is expected to play a key role in meeting the vast power demand. This will result in a risk to stability and reliability of the power system, owing to the intermittent nature of RES. They introduce significant errors in forecasting, depending on which Distribution Company's (DISCOMs) will purchase energy to meet the demand. Any difference between the real time demand and forecasted demand is to be met by the DISCOMs in the real time market (RTM) at extra prices, thus exposing them to the risk of price volatility.

If within one server has more than one virtual machine, the performance is given on those servers will be reduced and not optimal. Therefore, to increase the need for the use of server storage performance accelerator. Currently, PernixData FVP already implemented in UKRIDA virtualization environment, in particular the computer lab. There is a performance increase in real terms that can be perceived by the user, but until now there has been no special tests to assess the extent of increase in performance. This research was conducted with the hope to provide the data (results of measurements) on the increase in IOPS performance obtained for each type of RAID using PernixData FVP as a software-based accelerator, as well as consideration of the use of RAID levels mthat correspond to the needs of each. This study focuses on improving storage performance with the use of software-based accelerator as well as with different RAID levels. These results indicate that the use accelerator with two different policy provides improved performance compared to the server without the accelerator. © 2016 IEEE.","accelerator; PernixData; RAID; server; storage; virtual; virtualization","Digital storage; Energy storage; Particle accelerators; Servers; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Computer lab; Performance analysis; PernixData; RAID; RAID storage; Storage performance; virtual; Acceleration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015844015

In this paper, we propose a light-weight PIM architecture, approxPIM, which leverages approximate computing techniques to enable InMemory Processing in a realistic 3D-stacked DRAM, Micron's Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC). Using the newly-released atomic instruction support of the HMC, approxPIM can process a wide range of data-intensive applications without adding any logic resources into the memory devices. Furthermore, we propose to approximate those accuracy-insensitive applications with the limited functioning set of HMC commands so that they could be smoothly mapped to the HMCs without the inference from processors, therefore enabling energy-efficient Processing-in-Memory and greatly expanding the scope of target PIM applications with HMC. In general, approxPIM gives a comprehensive study on HMC's potential and weakness in the application of Processing-in-Memory. Evaluation results show that our approxPIM significantly boosts the energy-efficiency and performance of the whole system. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Computation theory; Computer aided design; Dynamic random access storage; Three dimensional integrated circuits; 3d-stacked drams; Computing techniques; Data-intensive application; Efficiency and performance; Energy efficient; Evaluation results; Logic resources; Processing in memory; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015302567

We herein report a convenient protocol for forming a high-quality graphene/graphene oxide (GO) thin membrane on solid-state substrate via the Langmuir-Blodgett self-assembly technique. The process includes layer formation at the liquid-solid-air interface, pulling solid-state substrate vertically from the interface and chemical reduction of the membrane (selective process). Parameters which may alter the properties of membrane have been investigated. The pH was considered the most crucial factor since it affected the smoothness and continuity of the membrane. Pulling cycles had pronounced influence on the thickness of the membrane. Direct formation of the graphene-based membrane on solid-state substrates may eliminate concerns about metal particle residue from the graphene transfer process, incomplete removal of the organic chemicals, and assure the intactness and continuity of the graphene/GO layer. It is therefore believed that the procedure may shed light on the fabrication of high-quality graphene nanodevices. © 2016 IEEE.","graphene; graphene oxide; Langmuir-Blodgett; membrane; self-assembly","Biomedical engineering; Image processing; Interface states; Interfaces (materials); Membranes; Nanostructured materials; Organic chemicals; Phase interfaces; Self assembly; Signal processing; Substrates; Biological engineering; Chemical reduction; Environmental science; Graphene oxides; Langmuir-blodgett; Selective process; Self-assembly technique; Transfer process; Graphene",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015979917

So, electrification of vehicles is one way to minimize their dependence on fossil fuels which also plays a significant role in reducing the greenhouse effect. However, vehicles transformation enhances the electric load which has a significant impact on current power system and upcoming smart grid which may eventually affect the reliability. In this paper, the reliability and economic assessment of micro-grid consisting of renewables as well as diesel generators, considering non-controllable loads as well as controllable EVs load, is investigated. To further improve the reliability of micro-grid, dedicated G2V and V2G periods are considered.

This paper presents the design of load frequency controllers for power systems that are subject to persistent disturbances by using the principle of matching and the method of inequalities. In the design formulation, the generation rate constraint is explicitly taken into account and a battery energy storage system (BESS) is used. Moreover, a PI controller in the main loop and a lag/lead controller in the BESS minor loop are designed simultaneously so as to mitigate the effects of power fluctuation caused by normal load and renewable energy sources. The principal design objective is to guarantee that the peak magnitudes of frequency deviation, generation rate and BESS power output always stay strictly within respective bounds despite all possible disturbances. The numerical results clearly show that the framework adopted here is suitable for solving such a design problem. © 2016 IEEE.","battery energy storage system; generation rate constraint; load frequency control; persistent disturbance; power systems; renewable energy","Controllers; Electric control equipment; Electric frequency control; Electric load management; Electric power system control; Energy storage; Natural resources; Power control; Press load control; Standby power systems; Battery energy storage systems; Generation rate constraints; Load-frequency control; Persistent disturbances; Renewable energies; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015380787

To meet the need of a large electric power, it is required to develop a large area small scales of distributed generations. Distributed generations utilize renewable energy sources, such as PV, in order to minimize the use of non-renewable energy sources. To maximize the utilization of renewable resources, it is necessary to apply energy storage. This storage is needed to store excess energy generated by renewable energy based power plants.

However, reducing the energy consumption is required. The railway traffic system is observed as a chain of distributed loads while trains are in the accelerating mode and also as distributed generators while trains are in the decelerating mode. Therefore a distributed smart energy management is needed to take full advantages of the braking energy and to reduce the tracking energy by planning the energy consumption at the accelerating time.

HPGS are used to distribute the load between many different energy sources (e.g. utility grid (UG), wind turbine (WT), photovoltaic (PV), fuel cell (FC), and storage battery (SB)). These power sources are combined together in different configurations to form the HPGS. There are two common operation modes for these hybrid power systems; the first one is called as a standalone mode, in which the distributed power sources are combined together to supply the power without any supporting from the utility grid. The other mode is known as the utility grid connect mode, where the combination of these power sources is paralleled connected to the utility grid.

Flywheel Energy Storage Systems (FESSs) have emerged as reliable and cost effective short term storage system. FESS may be used for critical load support or fault ride-through purposes, therefore the FESS reliability must be ensured. In this paper, FESSs are investigated for medium voltage applications where the main concern is the FESS's reliability. The main challenge for medium voltage FESS is the driving machine ratings and interfacing power conversion system. Therefore, two-parallel three-phase Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) are proposed to drive an asymmetrical six-phase Induction Machine (IM) in order to reduce the DC link voltage of the medium voltage system into a proper level for the IMs, where each converter is connected to feed each three-phase set of the six-phase machine. The employment of MMCs and an asymmetrical six-phase IM enhances system reliability as well. The machine and converter mathematical models are presented in this paper. Moreover, a simulation case study for FESS control under the proposed configuration is investigated. © 2016 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.","Asymmetrical six-phase induction machine; Flywheel energy storage; Modular multilevel converter","Asynchronous machinery; Cost effectiveness; Electric machinery; Energy storage; Flywheel propulsion; Flywheels; Reliability; Renewable energy resources; Wheels; Energy storage systems; Engineering applications; Flywheel energy storage; Flywheel energy storage system; Grid Integration of Renewable Energy Sources; Modular multilevel converters; Power conversion systems; Six-phase induction machines; Power converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014991139

However, the high write energy impedes the adoption of MLC STT-MRAM. In this paper, we focus on reducing the write energy consumption. For a 2-bit STT-MRAM cell, the energy consumption of flipping the left bit is greater than that of flipping the right bit. Beside, writing state '01' and state '10' consumes more energy than writing states '00' and '11'. To reduce the energy consumption during MLC STT-MRAM write operations, we propose an encoding scheme to minimize the number of the left bit flips and reduce the write count of states '01' and '10' by exchanging two states with different left bit, such as states '00' and '10', when exchanging two states can reduce the total write energy consumption of a cache line. The main idea of this scheme is state remapping. The experimental results show that the encoding scheme reduces 12.17% write energy consumption on average and up to 27.58% based on the complex write scheme. © 2016 IEEE.","Endoding; Energy saving; Nonvolatile Memory; STT-MRAM","Cache memory; Encoding (symbols); Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Magnetic recording; Random access storage; Smart city; Encoding schemes; Endoding; Energy optimization; Multilevel cell; Non-volatile memory; Spin transfer torque; STT-MRAM; Write operations; MRAM devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013681702

As the scale of distributed computing gets larger and larger, hybrid cloud, which is integrated cloud service utilizing both private and public clouds to perform distinct functions within the same organization becomes a hotspot for both academia and industry. Thus, it will be vital to migrate virtual machines in hybrid clouds. The biggest issue which VM migrationinhybridcloudsfacestodayishowtotransferthelarge amount of storage data. Storage migration of virtual machine with existing mechanisms of memory migration has been studied for a long time. Unfortunately, no one can perform perfectly without modification. It is compelling to consider a newmigration model and optimization methods. In this paper, we analyze the advantage and disadvantage of classical methods, and put forward a method which combines the strengths of pre-copy and post-copy migration model and we also use disk working set to optimize virtual machines storage migration. We have developed and implemented our approach to the QEμKVM hypervisor and run a series of experiments.

In this hybrid memory system, DRAM is used as the data buffer of Flash memory due to the performance and endurance gaps between main memory and Flash. However, the inconsistency of access granularity between the main memory and Flash makes the DRAM-based buffer complex. On the one hand, the basic access unit of Flash is page. However, buffering pages of Flash in DRAM without distinguishing the hot cache lines from cold cache lines within each page leads to a waste of cache capacity. On the other hand, general-purpose replacement schemes focus on high hit rate and do not consider the peculiarities of Flash, thus leads to performance and lifespan overhead. In this paper, we propose TBuffer, an additional buffer in DRAM enhanced by history-aware identification and LazyFlush. History-aware identification can increase hit rate by evicting cold cache lines and keeping more hot cache lines in DRAM, while LazyFlush can further improve performance and lifespan by delaying flushing dirty objects and reducing writes to Flash. We evaluate the TBuffer via trace-driven simulations. Experimental results have shown that it outperforms other existing schemes, increases hit rate by up to 12%, reduces the access latency by a factor of up to 50.8% with an average of 19.7%, and achieves 16.6% lifespan improvement on average. © 2016 IEEE.","Flash-based main memory system; History-aware identification; LazyFlush; TBuffer","Cache memory; Dynamic random access storage; Smart city; Access granularities; Access latency; Improve performance; LazyFlush; Main memory; Replacement scheme; TBuffer; Trace driven simulation; Flash memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013631698

The bandwidth scarcity is the biggest issue in this technology. In order to overcome this issue, cognitive radio driven hospitals are introduced and devices are divided in two categories. Primary devices are the ones with very high priority and their communication is vital for the patients and hospital, so that no interference should be made with such devices. Secondary devices are the ones which has lower priority and they can wait until the primary devices finish their communication and then, they begin to use the allocated spectrum. One of the key functions to assure that there will be no interference is a reliable spectrum sensing method. This method should be a simple one to be able to implement it in the secondary devices. Among all the sensing methods, energy detection based spectrum sensing is the most popular and easy to implement one. Memory based energy detection method is a new algorithm that we introduce in this paper by using memory sticks to improve the energy detection sensing method without making the sensing procedure more complex by only the cost of delay in secondary devices communication. © 2016 IEEE.","cognitive radio driven hospitals; double threshold energy detection; energy detection; memory; spectrum sensing; wireless technology hospitals","Biomedical equipment; Data storage equipment; Hospitals; Optical communication; Signal detection; Wireless telecommunication systems; Double threshold; Energy detection; Medical Devices; Spectrum sensing; Wireless technologies; Cognitive radio",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013918809

Its a key point concerning big data analytic area to process those intermediate data efficiently. However state of the art big data systems rare put an eye on the optimization and effeicient management of those intermediate data. On one hand, intermediate data in MapReduce and other batch systems are stored sequentially in files. Those intermediate date cannot be merged automatically, extra shuffle phase is needed in MapReduce to aggregate values with the same key, which surely costs extra time. On the other hand, some distributed message management system such as stream data processing system can aggregate the intermediate messages effectively, but they are at a much higher-level abstraction. Those systems usually suffer from complicated structure, which may incur the performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a B+ tree based data structure, KVBTree, to manage the intermediate data effectively. An efficient cache strategy is then proposed to increase the storage capability of the KVBTree. We also present the strategies for the querying, inserting and traversing of the data elements in KVBTree. We evaluate the time complexity and the space complexity of KVBTree in the final part of this paper. The experimental results show that KVBTree is able to play an effective role concerning the electric power data. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Aggregates; Data handling; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Information management; Trees (mathematics); Complicated structures; Data-communication; Higher-level abstraction; Message managements; Performance degradation; Storage capability; Storage structures; Stream data processing; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013209374

To guarantee access latency, today's popular OSN providers store users' data in each deployed data center. However, the full replication manner brings relative high storage cost and traffic cost, which extremely increases the economic expenditure of OSN providers. Data placement based on social graph partitioning is an efficient way to minimize cost, but it requires the information of entire social graph and cannot fully guarantee latency. In this paper, we explore an integrated manner of optimizing partitioning and replication simultaneously without distinguishing replica's role. We propose a location-aware data placement scheme (LDP) to conduct the optimization of replica placement. Evaluations with Twitter dataset show that LDP significantly reduces the cost compared with state-of-the-art schemes. © 2016 IEEE.","data placement; geo-distributed system; inter-data center traffic; online social networks; storage","Big data; Costs; Digital storage; Energy storage; Data centers; Data placement; Distributed data; Distributed on-line social networks; Distributed systems; On-line social networks; Replica placement; State-of-the-art scheme; Social networking (online)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013152635

In the case of wind farms, the power generated by wind turbines is highly correlated to wind speed and direction. As a consequence, considerable research is currently being performed to accurately predict wind speed and direction ahead of time. In this paper the wind speed of South African data from the Wind Atlas of South Africa is used to forecast 1 to 24 hours ahead, in hourly intervals. Predictions are performed on a wind speed time series with three machine learning regression algorithms, namely support vector regression, ordinary least squares and Bayesian ridge regression. The resulting prediction errors from each method are compared to persistence forecast which serves as a performance benchmark. The results show a vast improvement on the persistence forecast and a slight improvement of the support vector regression over the ordinary least squares and Bayesian ridge regression. We also show that there is an additional improvement in prediction error when more features are added. © 2016 IEEE.","Bayesian Ridge Regression; Ordinary Least Squares Regression; Support Vector Regression; Wind Speed Forecasting","Benchmarking; Carbon; Digital storage; Forecasting; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Regression analysis; Robotics; Solar energy; Speed; Wind effects; Wind power; Wind turbines; Ordinary least squares; Ordinary least squares regressions; Ridge regression; Support vector regression (SVR); Use of renewable energies; Wind speed and directions; Wind speed forecasting; Wind speed time series; Wind",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012008757

A load frequency trimming control is invested to participate into supply-demand balance service to maintain and enhance the system reliability, only using control variables of the converter itself that can be measured locally. Through the frequency trimming control strategy, supply-demand balance can be realized automatically, and microgrid can avoid malfunction.

A wireless microactuator suitable to drive microfluidic microvalves is discussed in this paper. A microactuator powered and controlled wirelessly, and actuated using electropermanent magnets is developed. Hard and semi-hard magnetic materials are combined to form the controllable electropermanent magnet, which is capable of holding either of the valve states without the need for continuous power consumption. Experimental data has shown that actuation occurs over a very short period of 120μs and approximately just 2mJ of energy is consumed. The key feature of the actuator is the minimal energy consumption during actuation and zero energy consumption between actuations. Wireless power capability is achieved using inductive power transfer and the same link is utilized to deliver the binary open/close signal to the actuator. The actuator is self-sustained, due to the onboard supercapacitor energy storage which stores energy to source a few thousand actuations before fully discharging and meet the peak power requirement during the very short actuation period. These state latching, wirelessly powered actuators are particularly useful in enhancing the portability, reliability and electrical safety of microfluidic applications where energy and real estate are severely limited. © 2016 IEEE.","electropermanent magnet actuator; microactuator; microfluidic system; wireless power","Actuators; Digital storage; Energy transfer; Energy utilization; Fluidic devices; Inductive power transmission; Magnetic materials; Magnets; Microactuators; Microfluidics; Actuator control; Electrical safety; Inductive power transfer; Micro fluidic applications; Micro fluidic system; Semi-hard magnetic materials; Supercapacitor energy storages; Wireless power; Magnetic actuators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010976240

Additionally, as the number of transistors per chip continues to increase, the operating frequency stabilizes due to the power considerations. One of the leading solutions to these issues is to reduce data transfer by adding processing capabilities into the memory itself. For data-intensive applications, this means a significant improvement in processing capabilities by saving a significant amount of time and energy. Although all the attempts to implement this solution so far were unsuccessful, emerging nonvolatile resistive memory technologies (namely, memristors) offer an opportunity for developing a Memory Processing Unit (MPU) based on a technique called 'stateful logic'. The MPU allows adding processing capabilities to the memristive memory cells, thus enabling novel non-von Neumann architectures. The processing within the MPU relies on a sequence of logical operations. This paper presents the design of an MPU controller for executing in-memory computation. Different design techniques to execute processing and storing data within the MPU are described. The MPU controller has been designed and implemented in a VHDL environment and used to execute different operations within the MPU. © 2016 IEEE.","logic; MAGIC; memory controller; memristive systems; memristor; MPU; von Neumann architecture","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Controllers; Data handling; Data transfer; Memory architecture; Memristors; logic; MAGIC; Memory controller; Memristive systems; Memristor; Neumann architecture; Storage allocation (computer)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013477959

Thermal depletion of the soil can be a constraint to this application for large heating-dominated buildings. A large solar assisted ground source heat pump system (SAGSHPS) is analysed for an apartment building located in Belgium. For this specific case a simulation set-up of the system (SAGSHPS) is developed in the software environment TRNSYS. All the components of this system have been dimensioned by hand and then tested in the simulation set-up in order to validate the sizing. No sustainable large heating system can be designed without regeneration of the soil. Geothermal storage with a volume 30% above the calculated volume still encounters thermal depletion problems. Solar collectors to inject solar heat into the ground is a proven technology to reduce depletion of the soil. A SAGSHPS containing 390 boreholes of 107 m deep combined with 100 solar collectors with an absorber area of 303m2 is the sustainable set-up calculated at first in this research. The last system SAGSHPS resulted with 48 boreholes of 107m deep combined with 450m2 solar collectors. Furthermore, this research encloses few design guidelines. This leads to a conclusion that a SAGSHPS can be a sustainable heating system for large buildings in specific cases. © 2017 Building Simulation Conference Proceedings.

The influence of the different systems sizing on the energy supply autonomy is investigated. The solar fractions of the heating and domestic hot water demand are calculated for a reference building in Belgium for different sizing combinations. The simulations are executed in TRNSYS and Matlab. A 15kWh/m2a building can achieve a solar fraction (SF) of 22% with only solar thermal. A SF of 45% can be attained with only TES and 90% with a combined system of TES and ES or only ES. The autonomy is limited by the available roof surface.

The 3D model was created in the off-the-shelf simulation tool COMSOL and the 1D model was an in-house developed TRNSYS type. The main advantage of the 1D model is the short computation time. It, however, comes at the expense of lower accuracy and less detailed results. In most building performance simulations, the detailed knowledge of the temperature distribution over the surface of a wall is not important. For this reason, the results of both models were compared in terms of the average surface temperature of the wall panels, the outlet water temperature and the overall heating and cooling capacity of the panels.

Further the decomposition point, specific heat, density, viscosity and thermal conductivity were determined respectively. Sensible thermal storage cost of the novel eutectic mixture was found to be lower than that of conventional solar salt and HITEC salt. The performance of the binary salt mixture taken at different stages during the test of 1200-hours exposure to constant high temperature and after 120 cycles of sudden cold/hot loading with large temperature difference was discussed based on the results obtained from thermal stability studies. The results show that thermodynamic properties of the molten salt show perfect repeatability before and after the experiments, and most variations rate of the thermal physical properties is within ±1 0 percent, which can be considered as an implication that there is no deterioration of the candidate.

Recently, Ag-Pd core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized and shown their superior electrocatalytic activity of small sizes for fuel-cell applications. On this line, the size-dependent catalytic activation energies based on the thermodynamics continuum model have first applied for different sizes of AgcorePdshell spherical NPs as diameters of 4-20nm. We have created AgcorePdshell NPs by following two routes as (i) the constant Ag core size with increasing thicknesses of Pd shells, (ii) the constant Pd shell thicknesses with different Ag core sizes. By expressing the surface to volume ratio for each size of model NPs, the size-dependent melting temperature of spherical Ag@Pd NPs have obtained. It has found that the melting temperatures of Ag@Pd NPs are below than those of the melting points of bulk materials for pure elements. Thus the catalytic activation energies at their melting points have also computed. Both the melting points and catalytic activation energies of those NPs reduce with the mole fraction of Pd atoms decrease. Our results are agreeing with experiment and molecular dynamics simulations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This is achieved by means of spreading the daytime workloads over an entire 24-hour period, in order to utilise the earths naturally occurring ambient temperature differences. The night-time cooler ambient can be used to charge the latent heat capacity of various “Positive Temperature Eutectic” solutions between +4°C (39°F) and +117°C (242°F) without the use of any refrigeration machinery by simply allowing the surrounding air to freeze these solutions. It is then possible later for the stored energy by the Positive Eutectic Thermal Energy Storage “PETES”, to be released back to the occupied space during daytime to handle the heat gains. This technique is generally called Passive Cooling and it may enable the charging process to take place by means of free cooling, i.e. without running the chillers and as a result becomes a very economical and environmentally friendly system. Furthermore, PETES opens new opportunities to explore heat balance for the existing and new systems, which could offer significant overall system efficiency improvements. Privatisation has created a new kind of energy market whereby the period of energy usage and the type of energy used is becoming the main criteria for price structuring rather than overall energy consumption. Hence, cooling systems must be designed to provide sufficient flexibility for load shifting and a PETES Thermal Energy Storage technique can be considered as a useful tool to achieve this aim. This paper is extended to investigate the Passive Cooling TES systems in the form if Eutectic PETES Solutions. The results of performance tests for various temperature ranges as well as the practical application guidance are also incorporated as part of this paper. © Indoor Environment for Hot Climates - ASHRAE, HotClimates 2017.All Rights Reserved.",,"Energy utilization; Eutectics; Heat storage; Machinery; Phase change materials; Privatization; Specific heat; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Thermal Engineering; Thermoelectric equipment; Environmentally friendly systems; Global applications; Modern engineering; Naturally occurring; Performance tests; System efficiency; Temperature differences; Temperature range; Cooling systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093966349

The main agenda was to increase the temperature difference between the cooled ceiling and the surrounding air for greater energy absorption by the thermal mass. In addition, there are recent developments in application of phase change materials (PCM), for increasing specific heat capacity of concrete. Meanwhile, a different direction of investigation can develop towards searching for geometrical forms of exposed ceiling, which may enhance the airflow for more efficient heat transfer between the air and the ceiling. At centre of the current research is geometrical design of structural elements, which will guide the indoor airflow to increase the heat transfer efficiency. Thus the research addresses not only the heat transfer related design parameters, which include convective heat transfer coefficients, total surface area in contact as well as the temperature difference between the materials, but also the characteristics of indoor airflow. There, in application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the efficiencies of heat exchange through the concrete ceiling with specific geometrical profiles have been examined.

The district of Buiksloterham was a test case to develop feasible and potentially desirable energy supply scenarios for the built environment at district level. It is not possible to develop Buiksloterham, and similar areas with high density, into an energy neutral area within the current legal framework (without wind energy it is not possible). About 1/3 of the energy use in buildings (building-related and user-related) can be supplied by renewable energy. In Buiksloterham a low temperature supply of heat is essential for a maximised use of renewable input. A fourth, low temperature, energy concept, consisting of local heat generation from solar and waste, thermal storage, and heat pumps, seems the best integrated energy system. The non-technical lesson learned is that new energy-efficient energy systems require very good, early planning, appointments, and cost and support of existing energy suppliers.

X Field is an undersaturated oil field which has been accessed by two wells. It is an extremely heterogeneous reservoir with X-1 being a prolific producer while X-2 having no production due to significant facies variation in the reservoir over a short distance (~2km). The field displays depletion drive behavior with rapid pressure decline over low recovery. A reservoir simulation study was undertaken to improve recovery and arrest pressure decline. Attribute analysis and well tests data helped address heterogeneity of the reservoir by predicting the facies distribution throughout the reservoir. These learning's were incorporated into a reservoir simulation model and a line drive water injection pattern was determined as the optimal method to improve recovery in X Field. A new well, X-WIW, was drilled to start injection and sidewall cores were acquired from it. Multiple lab tests were performed on these cores to confirm injected water compatibility with the formation while the well's injection rates and surface parameters were closely monitored to help minimize reservoir damage and achieve continuous injection. Using seismic attribute analysis, a good facies zone was identified for drilling X-WIW for line drive water injection pattern. Well results showed good quality sand which laid further credence to the facies distribution model. MDT showed depleted pressure in X-WIW, therby confirming connectivity between X-1 and X-WIW. Sidewall cores were obtained and multiple tests performed, including Capillary Suction Test (CST), XRD Analysis, Sludge Test and Core Flow Test, which showed no presence of swelling clays and good formation compatibility with injection water. Prior to injection, X-1 was shut in to preserve reservoir energy and current bottomhole reservoir pressure was measured. Upon receiving these lab results, injection was initiated successfully, with X-WIW injecting 2500 bwpd while keeping X-1 shut-in. Periodic measurements of bottomhole pressure were taken at X-1 to observe injection response. The pressure at X-1 was measured to be steadily increasing indicating successful voidage replacement. The most significant new finding was the accurate prediction of the pattern of variation of petrophysical properties through seismic attribute analysis and well tests data which enabled X-WIW to be a successful injector and helped in improving the recovery of X Field. Prior to this water injection project, X Field was predicted to have a recovery factor of 21% which has now been improved to 35%. This significant increase in recovery was made possible by the successful implementation of the water flooding project in a heterogeneous and stratigraphically complex field.

The recovery rate of tight oil with low pressure is unsatisfactory, because of low natural reservoir drive energy. The horizontal well with volumetric fracture is stimulated traditionally by water-flood huff and puff. However, as the decrease of the permeability and productivity of wells, high decline of produced liquids and reservoir pressure is observed by laboratory and dynamic data, which is called stress sensibility effect. This paper presents an integrated method to supplement formation energy and prevent the stress sensibility. The method mainly involves laboratory and numerical model. Firstly, to investigate the possibility of using areal water injection method, two cases are simulated in laboratory. One is simulated as square five-spot well pattern, and another one is horizontal well pattern. Both injector and producer are horizontal well. The injector can be instead of vertical well with large scale hydrofracture for cost saving. Finally, numerical simulation with Non-Darcy flow is carried out. The agreement is obtained with numerical simulation and laboratory. This new method is applied to Chang-7 tight oil in China, with the lower formation pressure factor about 0.8. The reservoir's mid-depth is around 2000m. The tight oil is currently under primary depletion development with an annual production declining rate higher than 50% at the first year. The water-flood huff and puff in Chang-7 tight oil increase productivity to some degree, however, the recovery rate is low finally. The stress sensibility of Chang-7 is measured from lab, and the permeability decrease around 20%. To solve this problem, the method of linear water-drive for tight oil is suggested, using horizontal wells injection-production pattern. The oil productivity increase 3∼4 times than vertical wells, and recovery rate increases 5∼10% in lab. The reasonable technical policy of linear water-drive is optimized by numerical simulation. This systematic technique provides a reliable method for decision making of energy supplement for tight oil with low pressure, which is helpful for effective and economic development of tight oil with volumetric fracture.

As yet, these battery storage systems are mainly used to increase the on-site consumption of local PV generation. However, charging the battery without considering the current generation of the PV system and the current state of the grid means that this application is of little benefit for the grid, e. g. regarding control and stability, reliability, power quality or security. Alongside the use of battery storage systems to limit a PV system's maximum grid feed-in, several other grid and/or system-relevant applications for battery storage systems are possible. One strategy is to use autonomous systems to even out a building's load peaks, mainly caused by heat pumps or other electric heating or cooling systems. Forecast-based operation strategies are required. The research project Spin. OFF uses a self-learning artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the energy demand of buildings. In addition to local autonomous strategies, some system-and/or grid-relevant applications require coordination by third parties. The second strategy, presented in research project MBS+, provides a decentralized micro-grid concept for the optimization of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) in the form of a Battery-Storage-Network (BSN). © Copyright 2017 NCEUB.","Artificial neural network; Battery storage network; Battery storage systems; Grid-relevant applications; Social implications","Cooling systems; Electric power system control; Energy resources; Neural networks; Photovoltaic cells; Secondary batteries; Autonomous systems; Battery storage system; Current generation; Distributed energy resource; Energy demands; Operation strategy; Self-learning; Third parties; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075186537

It bridges the time gap between energy requirement and energy use. For HVAC and refrigeration application puposes, water and water ice constitute the principal storage media. Water has the advantage of universal availability and low cost but it can only be produced using inefficient low temperature refrigeration units if one wishes to use the latent heat capacity. If it is applied purely for sensible energy storage capacity it requires large storage tanks. Phase Change Materials (PCM) between +4 °C (39 °F) and +90 °C (242 °F) range over comes the water disadvantages by combining the latent and sensible energy storage capacities into a single storage unit and therefore offer designers new horizons and practical application options. PCM latent heat cool energy storage can be provided by utilising conventional water chillers for new and retrofit applications without the need for any modifications as well as having the possibility of free cooling. By storing day-time warm energy for evening periods and over-night cool energy for day-time cooling requirements, a PCM system can simply bridge the gap between energy availability and energy use and therefore has the potential to achieve considerable environmental as well as economical benefits for many heating and cooling applications. The aim of this paper is to raise awareness of commercially available PCM solutions and products together with their practical worldwide applications. Typical installation examples around the World will be presented in a format that will aid practising engineers and consultants to develop an effective and low energy based design on PCM based TES cooling / heating and heat recovery systems. © Indoor Environment for Hot Climates - ASHRAE, HotClimates 2017.All Rights Reserved.",,"Heat storage; Latent heat; Refrigeration; Specific heat; Storage (materials); Temperature; Waste heat; Water cooling systems; Cooling requirements; Energy availability; Energy requirements; Energy storage capacity; Heat recovery systems; Heating and cooling; Low temperature energy; Low temperature refrigeration; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074772185

The relation between spin tune and beam energy can be used to determine the energy of a transversely polarized beam. Vertical oscillations excite the beam at frequencies that match the fractional part of the spin tune and the beam loss rate is used to monitor the beam depolarization. However, the standard procedure of these measurements is intrusive and not compatible with user operation of a light source. The Advanced Resonant Spin Depolarization (AdReSD) project aims to extend and improve the method with the goal of making the measurements compatible with the user operation, for instance by acting only on a small fraction of the stored beam.

Whenever it has to stop or reduce speed this kinetic energy has to be dissipated hence energy is lost from the system. This is the case with every mode of transport. With trains due to their mass the amount of energy lost is at a larger scale. Various methods have been developed by train manufacturers and other energy specialists in a bid to recapture this energy from the train. Though these may be successful in some respects they have some significant short comings. One of the most salient of these is that these methods have mechanisms which limit them to electric and electric hybrid trains.

The continuous supply of thermal and electrical energy for the scientific equipment and human beings is a crucial issue for the lunar outposts. In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) can have a tremendous beneficial impact on robotic and human exploration of the Moon, Mars and other planets. In the lunar outposts, it is very necessary to utilize in-situ resource effectively and sufficiently to minimize the hardware which must be brought from the Earth and reduce the mission cost significantly. Since the night lasts for periods of about 350 hours at most locations on the lunar surface, massive energy storage is required for continuous energy supply during the lengthy lunar night and the in-situ resource utilization is demanded. Accordingly, the idea has been proposed to use lunar regolith for thermal energy storage and electrical power generation. A lunar based solar thermal power system with regolith thermal storage is presented in this paper. To improve the thermal conductivity and energy storage efficiency, the processed regolith is adopted in the regolith thermal storage. The solar heating of the regolith thermal storage can be enhanced by a concentrator that tracks the sun to direct the full solar flux to the regolith surface throughout the lunar day. The temperature evolution and distribution of the regolith energy storage system are analysed. The analytical results shows that the lunar based solar thermal power system with regolith thermal storage can meet the requirement of the continuous energy supply for lunar outposts. © 2017, Begell House Inc.

Since the solar energy supply is variable in daytime and zero at night, a considerable amount of solar energy should be stored during the daytime to meet the demands at night. In any solar energy system, a storage unit is required because of the non-constant nature of solar energy; at certain times, only a very small amount of radiation or no radiation is received. This introduces the idea of using Phase Change Materials (PCM’s) which absorb heat, store it and release it for a later use. The Aim of this project is to study the effect of adding PCM’s to a solar water heating system and compare it with the conventional one, since PCM’s can store latent heat when there is no supply (solar radiation) which is in our case at night when the supply is less than the demand. This project can be an efficient alternative to commonly used systems such as boilers and electrical heating systems with reasonable initial cost and environmentally friendly, since it only includes adding PCM’s to any existing solar water heating system without direct contact with the domestic hot water usage. This can be very helpful with the continuous increase of fuel and electricity prices. © SGEM2017 All rights reserved.","Energy storage; Phase change materials; Solar energy","Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar water heaters; Storage (materials); Continuous development; Domestic hot water; Electrical heating; Electricity prices; Solar energy systems; Solar energy technologies; Solar water heating systems; Thermal Performance; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063091693

Also, various technologies and materials have been applied for the storage of clean gas energy, which also could control the combustion process to reduce CO2 emissions. Over the years, microporous and mesoporous materials have been developed as useful technology for gas storage and separation. However, no materials can adequately meet the needs of all applications.

Here the natural gas grid and electrolysis play a crucial role. Power from wind and solar can be converted by electrolysis into H2 which can be stored in the gas grid (Power-to-Gas). This project brings together key players in the Danish natural gas infrastructure, Energinet, Dansk Gas Distribution and Danish Gas Technology Center, in a unique collaboration with EWII Fuel Cells to examine the consequences of injecting H2 directly into the natural gas grid via meter and regulation stations (MIR stations). The project is a direct consequence of Energinet's strategy to integrate RE-gas with the existing gas system and of the Danish R&amp;D strategies and Road Maps on development of electrolyzers. In the project, a closed loop between two MIR stations is established. An electrolysis plant for on-site production of H2 is installed adjacent to the MIR stations and hydrogen is injected directly into the closed loop. The MIR stations' ability to handle significant amounts of H2 (up to 15%) will be examined and the necessary modifications will be conducted. The electrolysis system will be developed as a stand-alone production unit with associated user interface, monitoring, and smart-grid-ready control systems. Preliminary results from the experience in the dynamics of integration of H2 production in gas test loop as a model for the future power-to-gas setup will be included.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057574749

As a result, gases with significantly different composition will be traded and distributed. Also, variation in the gas composition is likely to occur more frequently and more abruptly. These variations have the associated risk of compromising the availability, efficiency and safety of end-use equipment. To help mitigate the risk for gas engines, a novel gas sensor was developed and demonstrated its utility in a feed-forward gas engine control approach for optimum response to changes in the fuel gas composition and the humidity of the combustion air. Utilizing the clear theoretical relationship between the burning velocity of a given gas/air mixture and the surface temperature of a radiant burner, the gas sensor developed comprises a miniature radiant burner fueled with a combustible mixture of the gas and air under consideration. The gas sensor prototype was tested with a range of gas mixtures of CH4 with varying fractions of the hydrocarbon species, ethane, propane, and butanes, and of inert gases. An excellent linear relationship was found between the computed laminar burning velocity and the measured burner surface temperature. In addition, the effect of changes in the humidity of the combustion air on the burning velocity of the gas/air mixture under consideration were incorporated in the gas sensor. The gas sensor was integrated in an engine controller for the DNV GL test engine. Improved control responses were demonstrated for the NO, emissions of the engine when operating on a range of gas compositions compared to the standard control approach.

To facilitate the modeling of renewable gas, model developments in the spatiotemporal network optimization model, OptiFlow, were implemented. The OptiFlow model was hard-linked to the existing energy system model Balmorel, allowing modeling the gas chain from up-stream renewable gas production, through storage facilities to end consumers. Balmorel is a bottom-up, deterministic, partial equilibrium model, which minimizes systems costs under perfect market conditions. The developments in OptiFlow enabled modeling of various processing technologies, e.g., biological- and thermal-gasification as well as electrolysis technologies. The co-simulation of OptiFlow and Balmorel resulted in the socio-economic optimal system, where investments and operations optimization were facilitated for the integrated electricity, district heating, and gas system. The results of this study showed that production of RE-gas is socio-economically attractive in all the investigated scenarios, and that RE-gas directly injected into the natural gas pipeline network is preferred.

To keep the global temperature rise within 2°C, it is commonly believed that it is required to convert the energy industry to a net zero CO2-emission by 2070 and a net zero greenhouse gas emission by 2085. For a 1.5 °C scenario these numbers should be 20 years earlier. Many studies that are available today are applying derivative road maps in the sense that they show the direction but not the final realizable, affordable and acceptable situation. Constraints for a worldwide implementation of renewable energy sources are numerous. Forecasts indicate that there will be high demands and even shortages of rare earth metals, space and other natural resources. Geopolitical complications limit availability even further. This paper addresses the limitations of the main constraint for Europe but it also sketches a possible alternative solution through a thorough fact finding of natural resources and possible solutions. It also shows the role of the gas industry in this. Clearly no available or promising option, including Carbon Capture and Storage, biogas, CNG, etc. can be excluded in possible future carbon neutral energy sources, but this will not be sufficient to fulfill the world's need of energy. However, a total solution is possible and is outlined. The key outcome is to construct a new backbone for sustainable energy in which ocean space is used to produce cost effective sustainable electricity. Superior knowledge, transport and storage capabilities of the gas industry are used to enable continuous supply of sustainable energy to end users in Europe and worldwide. The oceans provide sufficient space for renewable energy sources. This can be done by (floating) wind turbines, combined with power to gas. Maritime and pipeline technologies can be applied to bring the produced energy ashore and to store for timely use and distribution to customers, thereby facilitating other alternative energy production options and smoothen intermittence of electricity production. Besides meeting the constraints and a net zero CO2 emission this study also addresses backbone functionality (with other sources to support), affordability, acceptance and realization options. In spite of the gigantic construction that results from this study the price for sustainable energy is estimated to be around 5 ct/kWh. © 2017, International Gas Union.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057326737

According to the American standard (DOT-CFFC) dedicated to CNG composite cylinders, the stress distributions of the metal liner and the composite overwrap under two loading processes were obtained, which are (1) the working pressure → hydrostatic test pressure → minimum burst pressure; (2) the auto-frettage pressure → zero pressure → working pressure →hydrostatic test pressure → minimum burst pressure. The results showed that the equivalent stress level of the metal liner was significantly reduced by applying auto-frettage pressure to the cylinder prior to zero pressure. In the paper, the winding parameters and the composite layup were determined based on the winding principle and FEM analysis. The influence of the application of the auto-frettage pressure on the stress level of the metal liner was evaluated.

Thus, AGs exhibit substantial performance boosts in numerous applications such as adsorption, separation, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, and so on. Regrettably, AGs generally exhibit high cost, poor thermal and mechanical properties, which seriously restrict their large-scale applications. In this study, ceramic was introduced into commercial available resin derived aerogel due to the enhancement of silicon to thermal stability and low cost of the resin. Silica ceramic modified phenolic resin (PR-SiO2) aerogel was synthesized by a simple sol-gel polymerization of ceramic precursor, PR, hexamethylenetetramine in an ethylene glycol solution, followed by solvent exchange and ambient pressure drying. The modified effect on the porous structure, textural property, and thermal stability was studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM), nitrogen adsorption isotherms, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). According to the characterizations of SEM and nitrogen adsorption, the obtained PR-SiO2 hybrid aerogels have a continuous three dimensional network that consists of phenolic nano-particles and curved nano-sheets with size from 50 to 90 nm, which define numerous mesopores and macropores. TGA in argon atmosphere indicated that the thermal stability of the PR-SiO2 aerogels (both maximum decomposition rate and char yield at 1000°C) is better than that of the pristine PR aerogel. In order to improve the mechanical properties, carbon fabric reinforced aerogel composite was prepared by impregnating carbon-bonded carbon fiber (CBCF) composite with the aerogels. In the micrographs of the aerogel matrix composite, the aerogels are fully and uniformly occupied the void between carbon fibers, and coated with a thin layer on the fiber surface. Moreover, a homogeneous morphology without cracking and fracture was obtained at the fiber/resin interface, as the appropriate porous structure and enough strength of the aerogel networks to decrease and withstand the capillary pressure at the liquid/gas interface during the drying at ambient pressure, prevent the aerogel networks from collapse. Due to the low bulk density (0.18g/cm3), high porosity (∼;90%) and unique fiber geometry (a typical 2D planar random structure with the carbon fibres in the xy direction are distributed homogeneously in plane, while in the z direction over the height of the composite) of the CBCF fabric, the obtained composite possessed low bulk density (0.32-0.45 g/cm3), high compressive strength (0.8-2.8 MPa for different directions) and low thermal conductivity (0.098-0.148 W/(mK)). More importantly, good thermal ablative and insulative properties in oxy-acetylene flame simulated high temperature environment (linear ablation rate as low as 0.085 mm/s, internal temperature peaks below 200°C at 38 mm in-depth position as the surface temperature approximately 1800° C). Therefore, the novel lightweight aerogels and composites are excellent heat-insulation and thermal-protection materials with applications in the fields of energy-saving and aerospace. © 2017 International Committee on Composite Materials.

Analytical solutions for the prediction of adhesive joint strength are limited in their ability to predict damage and failure as they are mostly applicable to simple geometries and may not consider the complex stress states experienced in service environments. Numerical techniques, specifically those based on the finite element method, have provided a means for analyzing and predicting the failure of adhesive joints under various loading conditions. Failure prediction may be classified as methods based on strength of materials, fracture mechanics, and damage mechanics [1]. Therefore, the use of adhesive joints in critical structural applications necessitates the developments of robust integrity assessment methodologies and testing procedures in order to tackle fracture events. A valuable approach for analyzing the fracture properties of adhesive bonded joints is represented by the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) [2], or using cohesive finite elements [3-7]. Delamination growth is predicted when a combination of the components of the energy release rate is equal to a critical value. There are some difficulties when using the VCCT in the simulation of progressive delamination. The calculation of fracture parameters requires nodal variables and topological information from the nodes ahead and behind the crack front. Such calculations are tedious to perform and may require remeshing for crack propagation. The use of cohesive finite elements can overcome some of these above difficulties. Cohesive finite elements can predict both the onset and the non-self-similar propagation of delamination. However, the simulation of progressive delamination using cohesive elements poses numerical difficulties related to the proper definition of the stiffness of the cohesive layer and a very fine mesh to avoid spurious oscillations in the load-displacement curve [8,9], which make analysis very time consuming and computationally expensive. A less expensive method in terms of the CPU time requirement for studying adhesive joints and crack propagation of aircraft structures is the s-vision finite element method. As one of the mesh refinement technique, the s-version finite element method was firstly proposed by Fish [10]. The idea of this method is to overlay a fine local mesh into the concerned area, which is discretized as a rough global mesh. A re-meshing process is not needed by introducing the superimposed finite element method, and the performance is similar to a fine mesh. Due to this advantage, this method is applied to various fields such as laminated composites [11], elasto-dynamic problems [12], crack propagation [13], etc. Recently, an efficient superimposed finite element method has been proposed by Park et al. [14]. As the boundary in the global mesh coincides with the boundary in the local mesh, computational cost is reduced. This method is applied to adhesive joints for an efficient generation of a fine mesh in the thin adhesive layer. An initial global mesh is generated in the substrate. Then, a fine local mesh is overlaid on the global mesh located at the interface between the adhesive and the substrate. Finally, cohesive elements are generated in the adhesive layer using the global nodes and local nodes at the interface. In the present study, CZM has been used in order to investigate fracture behaviour in a pre-cracked double cantilever beam (DCB). In particular, finite element implementation of eight nodes cohesive elements is accomplished using the three dimensional s-version finite element method. The sensitivity of the cohesive zone parameters (i.e. fracture strength and critical energy release rate) in predicting the overall mechanical response is first examined; subsequently, these parameters are tuned comparing numerically simulated load-displacement curves with experimental. In the study of the adhesively bonded DCB of aircraft structures using the s-version finite element method, it was observed that both the global and the global–local models produced very similar deformations in the area of the interest for every step of the total deformation.

However, introducing high-k ceramics into polymer matrix often damage the breakdown strength of polymer matrix, which is crucial for energy storage capability. Here, bio-inspired fluoro-polydopamine modified BaTiO3 nanowires (NWs) was introduced into fluoropolymer matrix to enhance the energy density of polymer matrix, resulting enhanced dielectric constant and comparative breakdown strength.

Control and removal of them is crucial before releasing the coolant outside the containment. Also, primary system decontamination or related components decontamination are one of the biggest issues around the world. During decontamination process, removal efficiency, amount of radioactive wastes and control of them become important. On this basis, a system using nanoparticles with magnetite as a core material and porous layer surrounding it where functional groups are attached is proposed in this study to be applied in nuclear power plant. Magnetic property of the magnetite enables collection by external magnetic field, and porous layer enlarges surface area around the core. Specific functional groups attached on the surface can selectively catch radioactive ions. After certain cycle of usage, contaminated coolant that contains the nanoparticles could be purified through some facility called ‘collector’ where external magnetic fields are applied. With the collector, localization of the radioactive nuclides and minimization of the radioactive waste become possible using magnetic property of the particles, which will minimize the waste compared with conventional approaches where secondary pollution like big amount of radioactive coolant or related facilities are accompanied. Therefore, collection efficiency in the collector part becomes important to guarantee the system, and several calculations were performed to assess the parametric effects in this study. © 2016 Association for Computing Machinery Inc.

It can easily be adapted to fuel both diesel generators and larger utility power plants. The ability of being produced from renewable energy sources allows on-site ammonia production where it is needed. The high hydroelectric, wind, and solar energy source potential of Canada make the energy storage attractive using ammonia. Ontario, with decreasing electricity prices, has potentials for on-site ammonia production from hydropower. Solar energy, as the most abundant source of energy in the world, can be directly utilized for ammonia synthesis via various routes such as electrochemical and thermochemical cycles. Canada have significant potential of renewable resources such as hydropower and wind power. Ammonia can be transported via ocean tankers or pipelines. Besides being a zero emission fuel in the utilization process, about 30% greenhouse gas reduction is possible using renewable energy such as wind in the ammonia production when compared to conventional unleaded gasoline. Compared to propane, greenhouse gas production decreases about 18%. Hence in the overall life cycle, ammonia has significant environmental advantages. Even if ammonia is produced from hydrocarbons, it has similar greenhouse gas emissions with solar energy based route. It is important to emphasize that an ammonia driven passenger vehicle releases less greenhouse gas emissions than compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), diesel, and even hybrid electric vehicles. Considering vehicle and fuel production together, emissions from an ammonia-fueled passenger car is very close to electric vehicles per km traveled as even lower in a few routes. An ammonia-fueled vehicle can save 100 g of greenhouse gas per km compared to gasoline when the complete vehicle and fuel life cycle is considered. Depletion of abiotic resources is moderately lower for conventional ammonia production, which is originated from natural gas, than liquefied natural gas, diesel, petrol and propane fuels. In this report, detailed background information about production and utilization of ammonia is presented in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, an alternative ammonia synthesis method is experimentally realized and tested. The selected route is molten salt electrolyte based electrochemical ammonia production. In Chapter 3, the required hydrogen for ammonia synthesis is produced using photoelectrochemical route and integrated to ammonia synthesis. The experimental results are presented under different conditions. Chapter 4 explains ammonia production from hydrocarbon sources such as natural gas. The comparative results for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and ammonia are given for production and transport phases. Chapter 5 investigates the usage of ammonia in maritime applications and performs a life cycle assessment. In Chapter 6, ammonia is evaluated as a potential fuel for aviation industry and the performances of alternative fuels are comparatively presented. Chapter 7 performs a life cycle assessment for ammonia usage in road vehicles whereas in Chapter 8, ammonia is produced using different routes and decomposed on-board for hydrogen driven vehicles. On-board ammonia electrolysis is also analyzed and presented.

When earthquake occurs, fluid structure interaction (FSI) of free standing spent fuel rack is crucial to dissipate the earthquake energy, which guarantees the structural integrity of the rack. The fluid added mass is the main parameter which is used as input for the rack’s transient structural analysis. In engineering approach, the fluid added mass is generally based on simple geometry such as circular cylinder or square cylinder, however, the actual rack geometry is much more complicated. In order to derive a more accurate fluid added mass, a detail model of spent fuel rack has to be study numerically and experimentally. The forced vibration test is an effective way to get the FSI parameters. In this paper, a 2D transient analysis of a spent fuel rack model is carried out by a commercial CFD software, Fluent. The dynamic mesh method is adopted to simulate the forced vibration of the spent fuel rack. Then fluid added mass is derived based on CFD transient fluid force. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of storage cell gap is carried out. Finally, a model of coaxial cylinder is analyzed by CFD and the theoretical solution, which verifies the correctness of the method.

In this paper, an analysis of marine hybrid power plants is developed, focusing on understanding the operations with energy storage devices. It reviews the strategic loading methodology as well as proposes a steady state weighted average representation of the results. This will lead to a much more intuitive interpretation of the results, thus, an estimation of the fuel saving potential for hybrid vessels with strategic loading can be developed by simply analyzing the generator set fuel oil consumption curves. The need to develop a simple model to estimate the average emissions and fuel consumption is due to the fact that it can be further used to create optimization algorithms, aid in the hybrid power plant design and operation, or in future research in hybrid power plants. Very few studies have been conducted on understanding how the generator-sets and energy storage devices interact, and the reason why it reduces emissions and fuel consumption. This steady state approach takes into account the energy storage device maximum capacity, charge/discharge rate, and the energy storage device efficiency. Dynamical effects like the generator speed fluctuation and engine load ramping are disregarded. Through this geometrical approach, it becomes clear that for most engines, the biggest opportunity for fuel savings and emissions reduction is when at least one generator is disconnected from the grid, as shown on the cases studied, where the fuel savings and NOx emission reduction reached values of up to 15%. In the case of generator-set disconnection, the energy storage devices also serve as a spinning reserve.

Hence, they are widely used for applications including artificial skin, organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), energy storage devices, and flexible sensors. Recent investigations also show that conjugated polymers display great potential to exhibit high thermal conductivity, and thus are promising candidates for next-generation soft heat transfer materials. In this poster, I will present my PhD research focusing on three branches of conjugated polymer study. First is the synthesis of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) thin films possessing ultrahigh conductivity and mobility, complemented by theoretical modeling based on Boltzmann transport and wafer scale device fabrication of radio frequency AC to DC rectifier. Second is achieving record high cross-plane thermal conductivity (>10x common polymers) using undoped poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) thin films along with theoretical modeling. Third, is the fabrication of chemical sensing devices, using various nanostructured PEDOT and related copolymers, and the integration of the sensing devices in printed circuit boards (PCBs). Oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) is used as the synthesis method for the aforementioned polymers. As a solvent free method, oCVD circumvented the problem of low solubility of conjugated polymers and compatible issue between substrate and the solvent. In addition, the unique growth mechanism of oCVD P3HT synthesis essentially enhances the thermal conductivity. oCVD also makes it easy to pattern the polymer film during device fabrication, and provides conformal coating on nanostructured scaffolds. In addition to my three primary focus areas, side projects during my doctoral research include collaborative work with Eni S.p.A on large-scale flexible photovoltaic fabrication; collaborative work with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT on flexible energy harvesting device fabrication; DFT calculations and machine learning assisted monomer selection for light emitting polymers. ©2017 Food and Drug Law Institute.",,"Artificial organs; Chemical sensors; Chemical vapor deposition; Energy gap; Energy harvesting; Engineering education; Engineering research; Fabrication; Heat transfer; Ionic liquids; Learning systems; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Polymer films; Printed circuit boards; Scaffolds (biology); Semiconducting films; Thermal conductivity of solids; Thin films; Timing circuits; WSI circuits; Chemical sensing devices; Electrical engineering and computer science; High electrical conductivity; High thermal conductivity; Organic light emitting diodes(OLEDs); Poly(3 ,4 ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT); Printed circuit board (PCBs); Wafer-scale device fabrication; Conjugated polymers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052128028

At present, the peaking capacity of gas storage accounts for 20% of annual natural gas consumption in the United States, 25% in European Union (EU)and only 2% in China. This shows that in China, the construction of underground gas storage has lagged behind the rapid development of natural gas. Insufficient natural gas storage capacity and poor peak regulation capacity will affect supply security during peak periods. Lack of peaking price and poor investment economy will limit the construction of gas storage infrastructure. As the natural gas industry is in rapid growth stage, the serious lag of infrastructural construction such as gas storage will restrict the development of natural gas industry, therefore it is given the priority in reform. In order to achieve the goal of increasing the proportion of natural gas in primary energy consumption to 10% or more, proposed by the “Energy Development Strategic Action Plan (2014-2020)”, and to promote the high development of the gas industry, as well as to achieve the national goal of low-carbon development, the following suggestions are proposed: (1) Formulate the pricing mechanism and reasonable return of gas storage. Measures should be taken to improve the return of gas storage investment, the approval procedures and restrictions should be eased appropriately and other gas resources should be developed. (2) Temporarily suspend the third-party development of gas storage. The access to gas storage must be based on the interconnection and interoperability of pipelines.

The dynamic mechanical parameters of HTPB propellant at different prestrain levels were obtained through dynamic mechanical analysis, including temperature spectra of storage modulus, loss modulus and tan δ. The glass transition temperature, the activation energy of the glass transition and the mechanical loss defined by tan δ curves were selected as analysis parameters. The analysis results show that the dynamic mechanical properties of HTPB propellant are greatly influenced by the prestrain during the aging process. At the same aging time, with the increase of the prestrain, the flexibility of HTPB polymer chain decreases, as a result, the glass transition temperature and the activation energy increase. Besides, the mechanical loss of HTPB propellant increases with the increase of prestrain, which is due to the aggravation of damage in the HTPB matrix and the dewetting damage of AP filler and HTPB matrix interface. © 2017 International Astronautical Federation IAF.

Due to the good features of high specific energy, low self-discharge, high voltage and no memory effect, the lithium ion battery had gradually displaced the nickelhydrogen battery and lead-acid battery, and become an important energy storage and power supply device in the spacecraft. However, the quick-charge lithium-ion battery that is relatively mature and used in engineering in domestic currently, with specific energy in 30 ~ 120 Wh kg-1, still need to be improved. In this work, a quick-charge 18650 lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 2 Ah was prepared. The performance test results showed that this developed battery could charge in 2 Ah in less than 10 minutes, with a specific energy as high as 158.6 Wh kg-1.

Between these applications astronomy from stratosphere is the one that could benefit most from such observatory because there is no place on earth that can provide such a unique conditions for solar system and space observation. Many astronomers, solar physicists and planetary scientists desire to be above nearly all of the atmosphere, either to reduce atmospheric absorption of signals, or to avoid turbulence that degrades imaging capabilities. Even with today's technological advances it is very competitive challenge to put any scientific instrument to stratosphere and fix it there at specific height and coordinates for period of time that is long enough to enable competitive astronomy science observation. This presentation will cover technological and economical obstacles that must be overcome to successfully deploy and operate scientific observatory in stratosphere that can carry various payloads for astronomy science use. The focus of this presentation will be on energy system, vertical engine propulsion, horizontal and vertical stabilization, aerodynamics, weather challenges in stratosphere, solar and thermal conditions and operations and service of the observatory.

To achieve the goal of easy to use, low cost and high reliability, Shaanxi Engineering Laboratory for Microsatellites, Northwestern Polytechnical University and the Delft University of Technology jointly developed an innovative Self-Powered Wireless Attitude Sensor (SPWAS). It integrates a twin-hole sun sensor, a three-axis magnetometer, power system, data processing and wireless system together. The sun sensor consists of two separate quadrant detectors. Each of them is mounted at a different angle and has independent signal processing circuit. The objectives of this configuration are three folds: (1) To improve the reliability, if one detector is at fault, the other could still work. (2) To expand the field-of-view (FOV), the FOVs of two quadrant detectors are not overlapped for different installation angle. (3) To improve the accuracy, the measuring error of a quadrant detector is not the constant but related to the incident angle of sunlight. If both of the two detectors receive the sunlight simultaneously, the SPWAS will select one angle output with smaller measuring error. Many CubeSats have their magnetometers on the On-Board Computer (OBC) board. The integration of magnetometer avoids possible interferences by other subsystems near the OBC. Besides, the shell of SPWAS is grounded, which could also decrease the interferences. The power comes from solar cells and an innovative super-capacitor based energy storage system, which has better space performance comparing with a lithium battery. In other wireless sun sensor systems, there is no energy storage system. This design could prevent data loss in case of poor light condition or instantaneous no sunlight, so as to guarantee the smooth attitude output. In the eclipse, the energy storage system could also provide power for the magnetometer. We use a highly integrated System On Chip (SOC) as the data processing and wireless system. The processor is a Cortex M4 ARM core with hardware floating point unit, which makes the onboard digital signal processing algorithm realizable. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless transceiver is used to transmit the attitude information to the receiver. The SPWAS is a small size, high reliability and easy to mount attitude measurement unit. CubeSats only need a few grams, small sized receiver to get the attitude information, and no wires are required. © 2017 by the International Astronautical Federation.

The newly introduced next generation of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with ultra-low GWPs do have a very short (atmospheric) lifetime, however, the decomposing products are highly toxic in combination with water, short life HFCs and their blends do not represent a safe and sustainable alternative. CO2, a natural working fluid applied since the early days of refrigeration, has demonstrated to be an energy efficient and environmentally benign alternative. Design effort has to be made to develop affordable high efficient integrated refrigeration systems applicable in high ambient temperature areas. One way to reduce size and costs is to adapt the number of compressors at the various suction groups. Another enhancement possibility is the utilisation of the normally unused expansion work by applying ejectors. The article will describe how enhancement measures like ejectors and pivoting compressors will influences the energy efficiency and can help to downsize systems. Cold energy storage is also an interesting feature, supporting the refrigeration systems with accumulated cooling capacity, applicable during peak capacity periods, without additional compressors. © 2017 International Institute of Refrigeration.

The next step in the so-called Trias Energetica is the local production of renewable energy, both electricity and thermal energy. A large (growing) part of the energy demand is related to hot water consumption. Here thermal solar energy can play an important role. Therefore, development of easy to integrate and install, efficient thermal solar systems is essential. Moreover, the main disadvantage of thermal solar energy systems, i.e. the required south orientation on z tilted roof and the competition with PV systems needs to be tackled to increase the applicability of such systems. In this paper the development of the Sunridge® system, a ridge integrated solar domestic hot water system, is described. A tube in tube concept as SDHW is developed and is placed on the ridge of the roof. The outer tube contains the spectral selective layer and the inner tube is the storage volume, a transparent cover is placed as outer layer. Heat is transferred from the outer tube to the inner tube by means of the effective boiling and condensation of water under low pressure between the two cylinders. The system will be inherent safe for overheating and freezing. The performance and end user price target is to be in the order of the price/performance of a standard SDHW system, nowadays on the market. The final design for the system is ready and pre-production takes place. In 2018 the first systems will go to the market. © 2017.

Due to the toxicity of ammonia a closed cycle preventing the release of ammonia to the surrounding environment would be necessary. Herein, CuSO4 and CuCl2 are investigated in a laboratory scale reactor for their application in thermochemical energy storage with ammonia as reactive gas. In the current setup after 80 seconds peak temperatures of 312°C and 238°C respectively were measured. To circumvent the notable volume expansion during the reaction with ammonia, both copper salts were loaded on zeolite 13X, yielding matrix-supported composite materials. Operation of those materials in the laboratory scale reactor under ammonia revealed, that the rapid temperature increase and the high peak temperatures could be retained, simultaneously simplifying the handling of the materials. © 2017.

Results of two complete charging and discharging cycles are presented. The oil is heated electrically using a copper spiral coil in thermal contact with electrical heaters. A spiral copper coil immersed in a water bath discharges the stored thermal energy. The first complete cycle charges at a low flow-rate of 0.6 L/min and discharges at a high flow-rate of 1.7 L/min. The second cycle charges at a high flow-rate of 1.8 L/min and discharges at a high flow-rate of 1.7 L/min. The charging energy and exergy rates for the first cycle are higher than that of the second cycle, however, the discharging energy and exergy rates are higher for the second cycle. Total stored energy and exergy values for the charging period are higher for the first cycle as compared to the second cycle. The stored energy and exergy are discharged more efficiently in the second cycle. The overall energetic and exergetic efficiencies of the second cycle are higher than those of the first cycle suggesting that a high charging and discharging flow-rate is essential to increase the overall efficiency of the system. © 2017.

The solidification of the initially melted PCM induces a natural convection of air flow inside the cavity. We present in this work the heat transfer behavior between a chosen phase change material (PCM) incorporated in a thin right wall and a square enclosure filled with air whereas the left one is kept at ambient temperature. The solidification of the PCM generates a latent heat inducing a natural convection air flow inside the cavity and compensating the heat loss. The numerical analysis leaded to a Nusselt number correlations depending on constant Stefan number. Nusselt number is given as a function of a Rayleigh number and dimensionless temperature difference between hot and cold sides. These correlations have been established since there is a lake in the literature to evaluate the natural convection heat transfer coefficient between air and a PCM wall.

Among all principally suitable metal oxides due to equilibrium temperature and, in particular, reaction rate and reversibility, only the couple Co3O4 / CoO and to a smaller extend Mn2O3 / Mn3O4 are considered as suitable candidates. Based on recent studies on isothermal TCES-cycles, the impact of temperature and increased O2-pressure on the reaction rate was investigated by varying the O2-partial pressure in the low-temperature oxidation of the reduced oxide. Whereas Mn3O4 was found to react too slow for a process at lower temperatures, CoO was found suitable. For an increase of the O2 pressure to 6 bar between 500-550°C an attractive oxidation behavior was observed. At 900°C Co3O4 / CoO could be cycled within 4.5 minutes between both oxidation states by changing the atmosphere from N2 to O2 and vice versa. © 2017.

These films are used for the protection of food products against moisture uptake and are consumed with them. In order to be suitable for food packaging they need to be stable against physical and chemical changes upon storage. FTIR is a convenient tool to examine the film compounds and changes due to their interactions during ageing. However, the incorporation of a hydrophobic compound into the plasticized biopolymer matrix leads to a complex FTIR spectrum due to peak overlapping, which increases uncertainty concerning peak assignment to specific compounds. Moreover, the complexity of the spectrum prevents the identification of small changes during storage. Literature on FTIR data mostly relies on chemometric approaches. In this work, the effectiveness of the Two Dimensional Correlation Analysis (2D-Cor) to increase spectral resolution by analyzing spectrum into two dimensions and hence allows to differentiate overlapping peaks is exemplified. 2D-Cor analysis was carried out in ATR/FTIR spectra of composite oil bodies-sodium caseinate based edible films plasticized by glycerol during storage under mild conditions for 60 days. Invisible, otherwise, physical changes, due to water uptake and glycerol migration to the film surface, and chemical changes, due to lipid hydrolysis, were revealed using this mathematical treatment of spectra.

In such applications, there is usually a strong positive correlation between field performance and injectivity/longevity of the water injectors. However, injectors are vulnerable to impairments, which can result in gradual injectivity decline and catastrophic failure. Therefore, robust field management and business planning require a good understanding of the impairment mechanisms of water injectors in general and, more important, reliable predictions of their injectivity behaviour and active lifetimes. Following a review of common impairment mechanisms, this paper highlights the complexity and uncertainties of injector failure. It then exploits the two major impairment mechanisms of water-hammer and deep-bed filtration (DBF) to develop simple semi-empirical mathematical models for predicting the time-to-failure of vertical and slightly deviated water injectors. While water-hammer mobilises solid particulates native to the formation and deposits same in the wellbore, DBF entails external particulates suspended in the injection water and deposited in the reservoir. The mechanisms and impacts of these independent sources and deposition of formation-damaging particulates are covered. Among other findings, sensitivity tests performed on the proposed models using realistic input data provide important insights into the mitigation and management of injector impairments caused by water hammer and DBF. To enhance the performance and longevity of water injectors, this study shows that these impairments can be mitigated through practical strategies such as (i) provision of long sumps (rat holes) as part of well completions; (ii) minimising the frequency and duration of emergency shutdown; and (iii) minimising the concentration of solid particulates entrained in injection water. Finally, given the almost inevitability of injector degradation, it is recommended that realistic forecasting of oil and gas production associated with waterfloods should always account for potential injectivity decline and possible failure of applicable water injectors.

Despite these enviable figures, Gas Utilization and Monetization in Nigeria is still below par operations. This is as a result of a number of issues including: • Faulted Gas Distribution Networks • Low Gas Price • Insufficient favorable Gas Policies Based on the current dynamics in Crude Oil Pricing &amp; the need for more alternative and unconventional sources of energy, developing all facets of Natural Gas Technology, which has proven in recent times to be a formidable alternative source of energy is not only beneficial but imperative. In developed Nations, Storage of hydrocarbon resources is essential in order to meet seasonal demands. Continued commodity price volatility indicates that more storage is appropriate. On Thursday, the 31st of March, 2016, Nigeria's power generation grounded to a complete halt, with a total output of 0MW for close to three hours.2 The reason for this detrimental incident has been linked to a number of factors including Pipeline Vandalism and the destruction of vital power infrastructure.3 Other most likely causes are the reduced Oil &amp; Gas Production rates due to the declining Crude Oil Prices and therefore declining Global Demand for Nigeria's Crude. In order to eliminate this problem, Underground Natural Gas Storage is a potential solution that will lead to a continuous availability of Natural Gas irrespective of market conditions and in turn an improvement in economic conditions. Major Fields in the Niger delta are mature provinces, having been in production for well over 35 years, most of these fields are in the decline curve of the Oilfield Lifecycle. These depleted reservoirs can serve as underground natural storage for Nigeria's abundant associated gas.

The list of activities includes energy conservation, flare reduction and carbon management. As part of Saudi Aramco's environmental stewardship program, the company has moved forward, designed and executed its first carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) through an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) demonstration project using carbon dioxide (CO2). The main objectives of the demonstration project are quantifying the amount of CO2 sequestered or stored in the reservoir, addressing the risks and uncertainties involved, including remaining oil saturation, the migration of CO2 within the reservoir, identifying operational concerns, and estimating the incremental oil recovery (beyond waterflooding). Two sets of facilities were specifically constructed for the project: the CO2 capture plant and the produced fluid handling facilities. The CO2 is captured from an industrial plant where it was previously being vented to the atmosphere. It is captured, dehydrated and compressed using a built-for-purpose capturing and compression unit at an existing gas plant facility. The capture plant includes: a seven-stage integrally geared compressor, a tri-ethylene glycol (TEG) dehydration unit located between stages of the integrally geared compressor to dry the CO2, an inter-stage water cooling system, and a dense-phase pump (DPP), which compresses the dry CO2 and then transports it to the field location via an 85 km pipeline for injection. The project includes a row of four injectors and four producers, and two observation wells for monitoring and surveillance. The produced fluids from the EOR wells flow to a nearby gas-oil separation plant (GOSP), where a new stand-alone high-pressure production trap (HPPT), a new compressor and associated facilities have been built for handling the high concentrated CO2 production streams. The produced fluids from the CO2 wells are separated into oil, water and gas, are measured individually, and then connected to the dedicated streams from the GOSP. The HPPT was specially designed and is a fit-for-purpose vessel to handle the produced fluids from the four producers. A unique vertical four-stage compressor was also installed to compress the produced gas. The produced gases are not recycled and join the gas stream going to a gas plant where they are processed and separated. The amount of injected and produced CO2 are measured accurately to determine the amount sequestered in the reservoir. This paper covers the details of the overall facilities design for the first CO2 EOR project in Saudi Arabia.

Its structure is composed of a positive electrode with activated carbon as in double-layer capacitor and a negative electrode based on Li- doped carbon like the Li-ion battery. The advantage of the LiC technology compared to the conventional storage device is because of the power density, the nominal voltage, and the energy density is higher than the EDLCs. Due to their inherent long cycle life, it is indispensable to predict the cycle life of this cell type. The objective of this paper is to investigate the capacitance degradation of LiCs by calendar life test and power-cycling test. In the calendar life test, the degradation is measured at different floating voltages and temperatures. In the power cycling test, the degradation corresponding to the current level and the temperature is evaluated.

In 2015, the Dutch share in electric vehicles (“EVs”) in use worldwide was ~8%(of the approximate 1.2 million vehicles in total). Growth of e-mobility leads to an increasing availability of storage capacity in the grid. This increasing storage capacity can be deployed for “Smart Charging”. The smart deployment of this storage capacity is particularly relevant to grid operators. Key principles of Smart Charging are: (1) free access to renewable - local - energy (provider chosen by EV driver rather than by charging point owner), (2) optimising local grid load (prevents extra grid investments) and (3) facilitates grid flexibility (storage of temporary excess of energy generated in a decentralised manner). ElaadNL strongly supports an open market for electric vehicles, where OEM's, energy providers and new charging station operators can entrepreneur on a level playing field. Supporting an open market via open and royalty free standards for smart charging also means that the government should not interfere with unreasonable energy taxes. Our study1 has shown that the various tax barriers hinder the realisation of these principles and thus flexibility services from storage capacity (EV or static storage). © 2017 MOBI - Mobility, Logistics and Automotive Technology Research Centre.",,"Charging (batteries); Commerce; Electric vehicles; Taxation; Charging station; Decentralised; Grid investment; Grid operators; Level playing fields; Smart charging; Static storage; Storage capacity; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050085429

In case of an accident mechanical loads on Li-ion cells may cause an internal short-circuit which can further lead to severe exothermic reactions (e.g. smoke, fire, explosion). Existing numerical methods to estimate the time-dependent mechanical, electrical and thermal processes are not sufficient at present. For that reason a novel approach has been developed. Three major parts -explicit non-linear structural analysis (FEA), implicit multi-physical simulation and an interface to link these two simulation tools -have been combined to form a continuous work-flow.

Box 2, ZG Petten, NL-1755, Netherlands","There is an increasing need for improving the representation of the power system in energy system models. Recent research has shown that the economic value of each MWh of Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) declines with growing deployment. There are two main reasons for this: (1) even with limited shares of VRE, there is a reduced utilisation of dispatchable power plants and (2) with high shares of VRE, there can be possible excess electricity that might have to be curtailed in case of insufficient storage capacity. These findings tend to be completely ignored by models with low temporal resolution and high shares of VRE. In this work, we aim at endogenizing the flexibility constraints into long-term planning models (such as the JRC-EU-TIMES model) by taking profit of Dispa-SET, a unit commitment and optimal dispatch model. The main idea is to derive generic functions from Dispa-SET that can be used by JRC-EU-TIMES and all other energy system models. In particular, we evaluate the impact of increased variable renewable power and different configurations of power systems (production, storage, EVs, demand and flexible demand) (1) on the operations of power plants and the different storage options, determining their economics such as operating hours, number of cycles and (2) on the amount of possible excess power (power that has to be curtailed, stored, or transformed. Simulations are run in Dispa-SET for a wide set of exploratory configurations of the power system in Dispa-SET. Then, a statistical analysis of the results is performed to derive generic flexibility functions. An example of the use of such flexiblity function is finally proposed for a long-term simulation in the JRC-EU-TIMES model at the European level, showing a non-negligible impact on the value of VRE, on the utilization of dispatchable generation, and on the required storage capacity. © 2017 IMEKO","Energy storage; Power generation dispatch; Power generation planning; Solar energy; Wind energy","Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Environmental impact; Function evaluation; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind power; Energy system model; Long term planning; Long term simulation; Long-term forecasting; Power generation dispatch; Power generation planning; Temporal resolution; Variable renewable energies; Electric load dispatching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048643920

Considering the instability of solar energy, a thermal energy storage(TES) system is required which can assure the steady operation of a solar aided coal-fired power plant. The integration system proposed in this paper is composed of a 660MW power station, a tower solar energy collector and the thermal energy storage(TES) system that uses two-tank molten salt storage systems. All the energy from the solar collector field enter the system firstly before working in different heat exchanger. The TES system can store energy and release energy simultaneously and also works as a buffer that make the output power totally steady. A new operation mode that of the steady 75% boiler load with the additional solar energy input which can provide the additional 10% THA load of even more is also proposed which can effectively reduce the consumption of coal. The simulation model is established to analyse the whole-month performance of TES system and its impact on the overall integration system in each season and the control strategies fitting for the different seasons for the TES system are worked out.

In China, it is reported that almost half of the imported natural gas is in the form of liquefied natural gas. Thus, the issue of how to effectively utilize the cold energy of liquefied natural gas has been more and more concerned. In this paper, a double-acting thermoacoustic Stirling heat electrical generator capable of using liquefied natural gas cold exergy is introduced. The system consists of at least three thermoacoustic Stirling engine units and the same number of linear alternators, which are connected end-to-end to construct a loop configuration. The engine converts the external thermal exergy to mechanical work by completing the thermoacoustic Stirling cycle between the low temperature provided by the liquefied natural gas and the ambient temperature. Then, the alternator converts the mechanical work to electrical power. To understand the operating mechanism and thermodynamic performance of such a cold energy driven thermoacoustic Stirling electrical generator, numerical method based on the classic thermoacoustic theory is performed. In the simulation, the highest output electric power of 13 kW can be obtained with a thermal-to-electric efficiency of 26.3% and the maximum thermal-to-electric efficiency of 36.3% with a total electric power of 5.8 kW can be achieved under the cooling temperature of 110 K and the heating temperature of 303 K. In addition, the influence length of the regenerator on the system performance is also investigated. This study presents a new way to efficiently use the cold energy of liquefied natural gas, especially for small scale applications in some small factories. © 2017 IMEKO","Cold energy; Liquefied natural gas; Thermoacoustic Stirling electrical generator; Thermoacoustic Stirling heat engine","Cryogenic energy storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Exergy; Gas fuel purification; Gases; Numerical methods; Stirling engines; Synchronous generators; Temperature; Thermoacoustic engines; Thermoacoustics; Cold energy; Electrical generators; Heating temperatures; Operating mechanism; Primary energy consumption; Small-scale applications; Stirling; Thermodynamic performance; Liquefied natural gas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048600994

Biomass coupled with post-combustion carbon capture and storage (BIOCCS) could play an important role in deeply cutting CO2 emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. However, adding existing commercial sequestration systems to pulverized coal power plants might significantly increase the cost of electricity and lead to energy penalty. Our goal is to identify candidate coal plants for which CCS options are economically feasible, and therefore to investigate the driving factors that could favor the development of CCS in real geographic regions. The methodology implies the adoption of the spatially explicit model BeWhere, which optimizes the cost of the entire BIOCCS supply chain. Three CCS options are investigated: Biomass co-firing with no carbon sequestration, CCS retrofit and total CO2 removal through BIOCCS. The results shows that the implementation of BIOCCS appears feasible for approximately 10% of the existing coal-fire capacity, thought its cost is highly dependent on the timing and level of CO2 prices as well as on local factors such as biomass costs and proximity of storage sites. © 2017 IMEKO","CCS; Co-firing; Coal production; Emissions reduction; United States","Beryllium compounds; Biomass; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal storage; Costs; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuel power plants; Supply chains; Co-firing; Coal production; Coal-fired power plant; Emissions reduction; Post-combustion carbon captures; Pulverized coal power plant; Spatially explicit modeling; United States; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048600316

Due to the dependence of such systems on the weather conditions the electricity injected into the grid is intermittent in nature with potentially negative impact on the grid operation. The quality and quantity of the electrical power produced from solar systems is directly related to the available solar irradiance and therefore any disturbances to the latter affect the produced power. In this paper, the characterisation and classification of the daily solar irradiance from 12 locations in mainland USA is presented based on 4 years of ground measurements. The K-POP method used evaluates the quantity and quality of solar irradiance for a day and as a consequence classifies the day based on these two indices. The statistical analysis of the results shows high correlation through the years for each station. This is a strong indication that the sky conditions are predictable and that with the utilisation of mechanisms, such as storage, spinning reserve, etc. solar systems can become a major contributor to the energy mix. Finally, this analysis provides better insight into the solar resource of a given location. © 2017 IEEE.","Clearness index; Probability of persistence; Sky conditions","Meteorology; Organic pollutants; Solar radiation; Solar system; Clearness indices; Electrical power; Grid operation; Ground measurements; Sky condition; Solar irradiances; Solar resources; Spinning reserves; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048474014

Examples of underground corrosion problems include electric power transmission towers, buried LPG storage tanks, and metal collars on waste water pipelines. The cause of failure of underground structures is sometimes due to the material utilised and in other cases projects being driven by cost-saving during the design stage. An established approach for the construction of structures designed for a long life employs the principles of life cycle costing. Life cycle costing (LCC) is a tool for dealing with the cost impact of selecting engineering materials for a construction project. LCC analysis carried out on an underground structure often favours the selection of stainless steel as the most durable material requiring low maintenance. In recent times stainless steels have been employed in a wide range of underground service environments such as road tunnels and power cable tunnels. When properly specified the appropriate grade of stainless steel will likely exceed the expected design life of the underground structure. The paper presents cases where corrosion has not affected the performance of underground structures because the correct grade of stainless steel was specified at the design stage resulting in a long service life. An outline is given of the selection process for the appropriate grade of stainless steel to be utilised for underground structures including tunnels. © Corrosion and Prevention 2017.

This will require LH2 production capacities of similar scale as for large-scale LNG plants. Natural gas is an attractive energy source for production of carbon-neutral LH2. This production will require efficient CO2 capture and storage (CCS) combined with hydrogen purification. This work presents an advanced technology combination for large-scale hydrogen production with CCS intended for subsequent liquefaction and ship transport. Pure hydrogen for liquefaction is produced by exposing shifted syngas to a palladium membrane unit. The CO2-rich retentate is dehydrated and separated in a cryogenic condensation unit. The decarbonised, hydrogen-rich top gas from the cryogenic unit can be partly recycled to the membrane unit to increase the hydrogen recovery ratio and CO2 capture ratio.

This helps us to minimize the purchases from distribution network and to reduce costs for electric vehicles charging. Technical and economic considerations are taken into account in the present analysis. Additionally, the model minimizes the greenhouse gas emissions including as an input a tax rate for emissions.

However, its usage is limited to customers, who have access to the pipeline grid. Small scale LNG market in terms of regasification plants or fuelling stations changed the situation dramatically. More than 140 LNG satellite regasification stations were delivered by Chart Ferox, a.s., since 1999. After the technology was verified at large users and the distribution systems of small LNG developed in Europe, smaller customers caught up with this technology. There are plenty of new companies investing to LNG and as result, it initiated development of skidded plants, which are easy to install with low transportation and onsite construction costs. Even though these technologies might be more expensive exworks, minimization of installation costs and civil works, as well as short time construction make them attractive solution. They are easy to relocate for to be exchanged for larger plants after the consumption will grow. They are able to cover just seasonal demand. Skidded fuelling stations and compact regasification plants cover these challenges and undoubtedly go accordingly with these trends. In terms of regasification plants, the technology is consist of a cryogenic storage tank, a vaporizer skid, temperature and pressure control, everything assembled on a frame with average flowrate up to 600 m3.h-1. For larger consumption rates, separate skid with two switchable vaporizers and a trim heater is installed in one frame. A horizontal LNG storage tank can be installed next to it. Three sizes of these plants can cover wide range of applications. For regasification compact stations has developed ATEX and non-ATEX version of control system assembled on the frame as well which requires just main power supply from customer. In terms of LNG as alternative fuel, skidded fuelling with LNG pump and LNG dispenser are a solution, which can help building alternative fuel infrastructure in Europe easily and rapidly. The system might be extended with additional high pressure pump and vaporizer for fuelling CNG vehicles. Boil-off gas utilization equipment is an optional part of the solution. © 2017 International Institute of Refrigeration.

One of the methods to store the solar energy is the borehole thermal energy storage (BTES), where the thermal energy is stored in the rock mass using borehole heat exchangers. This study presents preliminary results of numerical predictions for an in situ experiment of underground thermal energy storage in the research tunnel under Otaniemi campus. The in-situ experiment site consists of two horizontal boreholes of 5 m length drilled into granitic rock. One borehole is equipped with a single U-tube heat exchanger, and the hot water is circulated through it to heat up the rocks, while the second hole is used for temperature measurement of the rock. The in situ experiment set-up is modelled numerically using finite element method to investigate the influencing factors and predict its long-term thermal performance. The three-dimensional problem is solved with the transient heat conduction equations and the temperature distribution in the subsurface is obtained during 21 days of operation. A parametric study is performed to find the optimal operating conditions. The results of the numerical predictions are used for a detailed plan of the experiment. The simulated results will be later compared to the measured values obtained in the experiment. © 2017 International Society for Rock Mechanics.

The proposed system along with the controller is tested for different transient R, R-L loads operating in an intermittent mode using MATLAB/SIMULINK modelling. The aftermath of the associated control action is a stabilized grid voltage (48V) with required power flow among microgrid participants in order to suffice the transient power requirements of the grid loads even after respecting the operating constraints associated with the microgrid participants. © 2017 IEEE.","Current controller; DC microgrid; fuel cell stack; SOC; supercapacitor bank","Adaptive control systems; Controllers; DC-DC converters; Electric current control; Electric energy storage; Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; MATLAB; Power quality; Supercapacitor; System-on-chip; Bidirectional converter (BDC); Clean energy generation; Current controller; Dc micro-grid; DC-DC boost converters; Fuel cell stack; Operating characteristics; Power electronic interface; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045886362

In this study, the CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) and Mg doped CCTO ceramic samples (Ca1- xMgxCu3Ti4O12) were synthesized by the traditional solid-state reaction method using CaC03, CuO, MgO, and TiO2. This was achieved in a shorter time compared to conventional ceramic methods. The precursors were calcined at 950 C in air for 12 h to obtain nanocrystalline powders of CCTO and Mg doped CCTO samples and then the samples were sintered at 10000C in air for 12h. The sintered CCTO and Mg doped CCTO samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD results indicate that all the sintered samples have a typical perovskite CaCu3Ti4O12 structure and small amounts of CuO and Rutile. From the FTIR spectra, the modes observed at 606, 525 and 463 cm-1 were assigned to vibration modes of Ca–O, Cu–O and Ti–O–Ti, respectively. The dielectric constant of x=0 at 1 kHz is about 12734 increasing to 18381 with higher Mg2+ (x= 0.4) content. However, the dielectric constant for the x=0.08 sample shows different behavior leading to a decrease in the dielectric constant. The dielectric loss of CCTO samples can be reduced with the addition of Mg dopant. © 2017 by The American Ceramic Society.",,"Copper oxides; Dielectric losses; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Magnesia; Nanocrystalline powders; Nanocrystals; Perovskite; Sintering; Solid state reactions; Titanium dioxide; X ray diffraction; CaCu3Ti4O12; CCTO ceramics; Ceramic methods; FT-IR spectrum; Sintered samples; Solid state reaction method; Spectroscopic property; Vibration modes; Magnesium metallography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044284872

It has reignited calls for the nation to achieve ""energy independence. There is no doubt a surge in the domestic natural gas production with tremendous opportunities. Driven by innovations in drilling and completion techniques, development of oil and natural gas reserves is one of the most rapidly growing trends in the world. Gas is used extensively for electricity generation and with the increasing demand, it is always a challenge to bridge the supply and demand gap. Maximizing the daily gas production rates and ensuring continuous supply of gas to the downstream industry is critical for the economy. Unlike crude oil, the biggest challenge in the gas production it that it cannot be stored in storage tanks. Also a huge infrastructure is required to transport this gas from the source to the required destination where it has to be processed for utilization. Meanwhile carrying out the periodic preventive maintenance activities on the gas wells, production facilities, flow lines and various instrumentations is essential too. Furthermore, some downhole reservoir data is needed periodically for reservoir management purposes to estimate wells potentials. During all these routine maintenance or reservoir monitoring activities, wells and plants are shut-in which results in production or injection loss hence translating in an extensive loss of cash and revenue due to the wells or facilities unavailability. This paper highlights the work progress and then the lessons learned during each step of the development of the software in order to meet and maximize the gas production demand considering all the hidden factors which are adversely affecting the overall production performance. © 2017, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Crude oil; Digital storage; Economics; Gases; Natural gas; Natural gas well drilling; Natural gas well production; Oil tanks; Petroleum engineering; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Preventive maintenance; Reservoir management; Well stimulation; Drilling and completion; Electricity generation; Energy independence; Natural-gas production; Periodic preventive maintenance; Production facility; Production performance; Reservoir monitoring; Proven reserves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044246189

Temperature of the melt exhibited an important role on the nature of compounds formed by anodic oxidation. On the samples anodized at 280 and 300 °C stoichiometric NiO is formed. Samples anodized in the temperature range of 150-200 °C gave very high maximum currents in CV measurements indicating the formation of electroactive nickel compounds on them. The nature of these compounds is determined as alpha nickel oxy-hydroxide (a-Ni(OH)2) by micro Raman, XRD and FT-IR measurements. Other property that determines the capacity of these electrodes is the morphology of the electroactive layer, which is controlled mainly by the duration of the treatment. 30 minutes of anodic oxidation time is determined as the optimum value. Areal capacity of the samples anodically oxidized at 200 °C for 30 min using 0.8 V cell voltage are determined as 2.73 F.cm-2 and 1.58 F.cm-2 for 1 mA.cm-2 and 20 mA.cm-2 discharge current densities respectively.

However, increased coal-based generation contributes to increased CO2 emissions. This study aims to define and evaluate the conditions under which coal-based generation could be deemed as carbon capture and storage ready. It considers the technical and economic implications of CO2 capture and storage for two candidate coal power plants in South Sumatera and West Java. A carbon capture storage of a couple of scenarios are evaluated for each power plant based on separation of 90%, 45% and 22.5% of CO2 from the power plant flue gas with an amine scrubbing process, supported by flue gas cleaning processes, and liquefaction of the captured CO2 for transportation to geological storage locations. The carbon capture storage operation would also run for 20 years, 15 years and 10 years, while the power plant design life is 25 years.

A new generation active tag control Sliding sleeve Fracture tool is developed. This fracture tool is composed of vacuum energy storage system, electric control direction valve, sliding sleeve, microcomputer control system, battery group, RFID antenna and active tag. The vacuum energy storage system provide power for the open and close of the sliding sleeve, the operating pressure is the union of the surface fracture pressure and the head of the liquid, which can be controlled on the ground. Electric control direction valve controls the oil flow direction and control the opening and closing of the sliding sleeve. The antenna works only in low power mode and picks the signal from the active tag. The active tag ball contains micro battery inside and signal producing system, it will be wake up by a special instrument before lower into the well, the battery will sustain the tag work for at least 30 minutes. The active tag signal can be picked up by the antenna at 100% success ratio and without speed limitation. During the fracturing process, the active tag will be dropped in the well to control the opening and closing of the sliding sleeve in any specific fractured interval. After fracturing, pressure wave is applied to open all the sliding sleeves and the production operation begins. Compared to the first generation RFID control sliding sleeve, the Active tag control sliding sleeve has relative simpler structure, more compact dimension, longer battery service life, more reliability and control flexibility, which is more suitable for the oil field fracture application. The active tag signal transfer mechanism improve signal transfer reliability greatly and without speed limitation, which lowers the power consumption of the antenna and will provide long battery service life, the vacuum energy storage system simplify the structure greatly and the sleeve active pressure can be controlled on the ground. © 2017 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

The study is based on data for the Copenhagen region. The heat sources were prioritized based on the coefficient of performance calculated for each hour. Groundwater, seawater and air heat sources were compared with each other as well as to a scenario consisting of a combination of these heat sources. In addition, base load and peak load units were included. Characteristic parameters were the coefficient of performance, the number of full load hours and the covered demand of each heat source as well as required peak unit capacity. The results showed that heat pumps using different heat sources yield better performance than a heat pump based on a single one. The performance was influenced by the composition of the different heat sources. It was found that 78% groundwater, 22% seawater and 0% air resulted in highest COP of 3.33 for the given heat demand. Furthermore, the implementation of rule based short term storage made peak units redundant. The variation in base load capacity showed that heat pumps utilizing the analyzed heat sources could perform very efficiently without the presence of base load with a COP of 3.43. © 2017 IMEKO","District heating; Heat pumps; Low temperature heat sources","Digital storage; District heating; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Groundwater; Heat pump systems; Pumps; Seawater; Coefficient of Performance; Heat demands; Heat pumps; Heat sources; Low temperature heat sources; Short term storage; Theoretical study; Unit capacity; Temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043520043

But the majority of the literatures focus on the issue for improving the efficiency of piezoelectric energy harvesters and optimizing electric circuits for power storage and utilization. The transformations of dynamics of the system after being attached harvesters often are neglected. In this paper, some significant changes brought by energy harvesters are investigated. By means of analytic and numerical methods, frequency responses of the vibration system before and after equipping the energy harvesting devices are compared. For linear energy harvesters, the vibration system is still linear with an extra freedom. When the load circuit is connected to a pure resistive element, the stiffness and damping of energy harvester change due to converse piezoelectric effect. Another different characteristic is that linear energy harvesters also can perform as vibration absorbers of which resonant frequency shift to higher regions after selecting the optimal resistance rather than at the permanent point. As for system attached nonlinear energy harvester, its behavior become much more complex. Bi-stable energy harvesters have higher energy transfer efficiencies than linear harvesters in a wide range of the external excitation frequency. But the dynamics of fundamental structure also change significantly. The energy harvester perform as an amplifier when the structures vibrate in high energy orbits and chaos. © 2017 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.

Pilot projects are now exploring how to mitigate these challenges as well as seeking novel opportunities that open up through data fusion and recent advances in machine learning.

This implies that the Danish energy system will experience a remarkable transformation in the future, heading towards energy production based on renewable energy sources (RES). Facing the challenging future, a smart integration of gas in the Danish energy system may - in an effective and cost-efficient way - contribute to a sustainable transition. The FutureGas research project addresses these issues considering a smart integration of gas, which includes a development of: 1) flexible production of power and heat to support integration of fluctuating renewables, 2) decentralised production and collection of renewable gases, 3) transmission and storage at national and international levels, 4) distribution of gas to transport, power and heat as well as to the industrial sector. To investigate the transition of the Danish energy system, a system perspective is needed, which allows assessment of possible synergies across different sectors. Development of energy system models, which can facilitate integrated modelling of the entire energy system including the power, district heating, gas, and transport systems are therefore a central part of the project. In this paper, a conceptual model of the gas system as an integrated part of the future energy system is developed. The conceptual model is developed to ensure that all important aspects of modelling the gas system are represented in a sufficiently detailed way to properly analyze the potential future interaction between the gas sector and the remaining energy system. The modelling framework will comprise a detailed representation of the power, district heating and gas systems, while sectors such as the transport and industry will be partially represented through exogenously specified demands. Specifically, the conceptual model of the future gas system includes production, conditioning, transmission, storage, trade and use. The conceptual model highlights the important variables and parameters as well as necessary restrictions. The conceptual model will at a later stage be implemented in the existing energy system optimization model Balmorel, which currently has a detailed representation of the electricity and district heating sectors as well as in the spatiotemporal optimization model OptiFlow. The conceptual model will in the end, improve the current state of modelling integrated energy systems by combining the above-mentioned features with: 1) Investment optimization along with operation optimization. 2) High geographic resolution, which facilitates modelling the restrictions related to e.g. supply of district heating. 3) High temporal resolution. 4) Option to optimize with unit commitment. 5) Decommissioning of existing plants, making it possible to model the pathway towards future scenarios with high shares of RES. © 2017, International Gas Union.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041398706

The metal cladding is heated by the solar radiation from the sun and ventilation fans create negative pressure in the cavity, extracting the solar heated air through the perforated panel.

Paraffin is used as a PCM and water was used as the heat transfer fluid (HTF). The equations for the HTF and the PCM during the solid and liquid phase were obtained using the logarithmic mean temperature difference method. It has been concluded that, in the solid phase, the outlet temperature of the HTF increases because the energy that is being transferred from HTF to paraffin becomes lower over time. On the same principle as in the solid phase, during the liquid phase of the paraffin the outlet temperature of the HTF increases. Another conclusion was drawn regarding the heat exchange coefficient. The highest value was obtained during the melting phase, which was generated by the high value of the paraffin enthalpy of fusion.

The main objective is to supply constant and ample heat energy to the ejector refrigeration system. Since solar thermal energy is intermittent, it is best to store thermal energy in a storage facility to have flexible energy source to operate a heat driven system. Biomass gasifier provides additional heat energy at night or during stormy weather or cloudy sky condition. Majority of studies related to this technology connects an auxiliary heat source, directly to the vapor generator. Then, the pair is connected in series with the thermal storage. The drawback for this type of connection is the underutilized heat from the gasifier to the vapor generator, since much of it needed by the latter is just as much of that with the amount of heat given by the solar thermal source. The excess heat will only be exhausted as a waste heat by the refrigeration system. An average annual solar fraction of 60% was set corresponding to using an evacuated tube solar collector in the calculation. Ambient temperature of 28°C was. The condenser temperature was set at 33°C, which is 5°C above the ambient. The thermal capacity of the gasifier was at 10 kW, while the area of the solar collector was 9.21 m2 and the volume of the thermal storage was set at 1 m3. The evaporator temperature was set at 15°C intended for comfort cooling. Using an algorithm, the solar collector efficiency was calculated at 0.67. The simulation resulted to an average system thermal ratio at around 0.265 and an ejector refrigeration subsystem with COP of 0.30. The higher thermal ratio and COP of the proposed setup with parallel connections of biomass gasifier-boiler and solar thermal collector indicated that this alternative system could be used to attain higher energy efficiency in utilizing the sustainable heat sources. This research also necessitates further investigation of the function and role of the gasifier in using 3D CFD modelling and experimental validation of the system.","Evacuated tube; Gasifier; Heat-driven refrigeration system; Overall heat loss coefficient; Thermal energy storage","Biomass; Ejectors (pumps); Electric connectors; Energy efficiency; Gas generators; Heat losses; Heat storage; Refrigeration; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar heating; Thermal energy; Waste heat; Ejector refrigeration systems; Evacuated tube solar collector; Evacuated tubes; Experimental validations; Gasifiers; Heat loss coefficients; Optimization and design; Refrigeration system; Collector efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041200664

The thermal load curve flattening, in hot and intermediate seasons, is possible due to the accumulation of heat during the periods of time when the heat consumption is low and its utilization during the thermal load peak periods. The paper analyzes the integration of heat accumulation using water sensible heat in a Combined Heat and Power Plant (CHPP) from Romania, with Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) and hot water boilers (HWB). The solution selected presupposes the adaption of an existing heavy fuel oil tank. Utilization of heat accumulation in the CHPP makes it possible both to diminish the time of HWB utilization and the increase in the energy produced in cogeneration, and the utilization of the RGE at maximum continuous load.

Phase change materials (PCMs) and the latent heat accompanying the phase change can be utilized to accumulate, store, are release the thermal energy when needed. The latent heat of the phase change allows for a storage of a relatively large amount of heat in a narrow temperature interval. The solid-liquid phase transition is widely utilized in such LHTES applications. Computer simulation tools are usually applied in the optimal design and real-time control of LHTES devices as the simulations are fast, relatively easy to perform and not expensive. Different numerical methods exist for modeling of heat transfer problems with phase changes. The methods can be assessed in several ways- A ccuracy, mathematical and programming complexity, demands for computational time and hardware, robustness etc. The wellknown enthalpy method, the effective heat capacity method and the temperature recovery method are widely utilized as they are simple and easy to implement. These so-called domain or front capturing methods suffer from a low accuracy in the vicinity of the phase interface and they are quite sensitive to the size of the time step. On the other hand, front tracking methods allow for very precise results near the phase interface, but they are more complex and computationally quite demanding. An important point is also the sensitivity and robustness of a method in relation to the thermal conditions and properties. In particular, the large heat flux at the boundary and the high thermal conductivity often cause numerical difficulties and instabilities. © 2017 ASME.",,"Energy conservation; Heat flux; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Latent heat; Numerical methods; Phase interfaces; Real time control; Reboilers; Specific heat; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Thermal pollution; Front Tracking method; High thermal conductivity; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Model of heat transfers; Programming complexity; Solid-liquid phase transitions; Temperature intervals; Temperature recovery; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041006285

In this regard, cellulose nanocrystals (CN), which are needle-shaped nanostructure derived from cellulose-rich resources, are extracted by sulfuric acid hydrolysis of biomass and used as both template and binder for the construction of electrochemical capacitors electrodes. A composite material is synthetized comprising CN and a conjugated electroactive polymer (CEP) to overcome the electrical insulating properties of cellulose as well as to exploit enhanced electrochemical activity by increased electrode surface-area. A one-step in-situ film synthesis protocol is evaluated by performing simultaneous polymerization and film deposition. The effect of proportion of starting components are evaluated through statistical Response Surface Methodology towards optimizing the electrochemical performance. Depending on the mass proportion of the starting components, a conducting network could be created by surface coating of the CEP on the whiskers during polymerization. Electrochemical measurements suggest an increase in specific surface area by at least a factor of two relative to bare CEP as a consequence of the template role of cellulose. Therefore, adjustment of the proposed one-step synthesis parameters allows tuning the material properties to meet specific application requirements regarding electrochemical performance.

For low concentration ratios (CRs), up to 20, a larger PCM thickness is needed to absorb much more heat and prolong the thermal regulation time of CPV systems. As a result, the heat absorbed in the PCM is not released efficiently to the ambient during the night time. Therefore, active heat dissipation from the CPV-PCM system is required during that time to attain full transition to solid state at the starting of each period of insolation. Thus, a hybrid CPVPCM water system including various designs of the PCM heat sink is proposed. Such system provides a high-energy storage density during the daytime and enhances the heat extraction from PCM during the night time. To predict the thermal and electrical performance of the hybrid CPV-PCM water system, a comprehensive 2-D model for CPV layers integrated with both PCM, and water flow is developed. The model couples thermal models for CPV layers and thermo-fluid model that considers the phase-change phenomenon and water flow. Numerical simulations of the developed models are performed to determine the instantaneous liquid-solid interface evolution and the transient temperature distribution within the hybrid CPVPCM water system. Results indicate that the hybrid CPV-PCM water system achieves a significant reduction in the CPV temperature during the daytime and improves the heat dissipation from PCM during the night time. © 2018 ASME.",,"Flow of water; Heat sinks; Hydraulics; Phase change materials; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Waterworks; Active heat dissipations; Concentrated photovoltaic (CPV); Electrical performance; High energy storage densities; Liquid-solid interfaces; Phase change phenomena; Solar conversion efficiencies; Transient temperature distributions; Phase interfaces",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040915117

Ghauri is a single completed well flowed with 22 API gravity from the Sakessar Formation. Because the well is a solution gas drive reservoir, the initial production rate declined quickly. The use of jet pump was motivated by the need to revive the well without a work-over. Based on initial testing data, jet pump was selected as a preferred artificial lift method. SSD was installed as a part of initial completion. The downhole jet pump was designed per the SSD dimensions. The pump was operated to enhance/ restore the production of well. During operations, real-time monitoring was conducted to optimize the parameters of the pump, such as the nozzle/throat combination or horsepower. In addition, the life of the jet pump was calculated in relation to the economic limits of the production. Based on the results, the jet pump was found to be the most economical and cost-effective artificial-lift method for Ghauri. SSD jet pump deployment achieved the expected performance and reliability. It has allowed the operator to save the cost of a workover. The cumulative production with jet lift is twice the cumulative production using natural energy. When the well production declined, the jet pump was easily re-optimized by using slickline to pull the pump and change the nozzle and/or throat. The rest of the pump was unchanged to keep the CAPEX at low. In addition, further production of 200,000 BBLS is expected through the jet pump.",,"Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Fighter aircraft; Jet pumps; Nozzles; Oil fields; Oil well completion; Oil well flooding; Petroleum engineering; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Pumps; Artificial lift methods; Cumulative production; Performance and reliabilities; Production enhancement; Production rates; Real time monitoring; Sliding sleeves; Solution-gas drive reservoirs; Well stimulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040537427

Plasma technology offers a very effective way of treating this waste with a high volume reduction factor (VRF), free from organics, liquids and moisture, and meets without a doubt the acceptance criteria for safe storage and disposal. By means of a plasma beam of approximately 5000°C, the inorganic materials are melted into a glassy slag, containing most of the radioactive isotopes while the organic material is gasified and afterwards oxidized in an afterburner and purified in an off-gas cleaning system. This paper describes the principles of plasma, the different waste feed systems, offgas treatment and operational experience and future plasma plants. More specifically, it presents the new full-scale plasma facility for the treatment of radioactive waste at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria for which construction and assembly was finalized end of August 2016.

The potential chemical reactions caused by heating the Gassum Sandstone Formation to up to 150°C is investigated by core flooding experiments combined with petrographic analysis and geochemical modelling. Synthetic formation water is injected into two sets of Gassum Formation samples at 25°C, 50°C (reservoir temperature), 100°C and 150°C with a velocity of 0.05 PV/hr and 0.1 PV/hr, respectively. A significant increase in the aqueous concentration of silicium and iron with increasing temperature is observed due to dissolution of silica and siderite. Increasing the reservoir temperature from 50°C to 100°C enhanced the naturally occurring weathering of Na-rich feldspar to kaolinite. Dissolution of quartz increased sharply above 100°C and was the dominating process at 150°C. At temperatures ≤100°C, the silicium concentration was controlled by a dynamic equilibrium between feldspar dissolution and kaolinite precipitation while the concentration was kinetically controlled by quartz dissolution at 150°C. The results imply that storage of excess heat in the Gassum Formation in the Stenlille area may be possible provided operational precautions are taken.",,"Aquifers; Chemical analysis; Dissolution; Feldspar; Heat storage; Hydrogeology; Kaolinite; Quartz; Reservoirs (water); Sandstone; Aqueous concentrations; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Geochemical modelling; Increasing temperatures; Kinetically controlled; Petrographic analysis; Reservoir temperatures; Sandstone formations; Weathering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040186921

Posiva Ltd. (Posiva) submitted the construction license application (CLA) in the end of 2012 and Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority of Finland (STUK) made its' review of the CLA within next two year and gave the statement and safety evaluation report to Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE) in February 2015. The construction license for Posiva was granted by the Government in November 2015. STUK started planning the regulatory oversight of construction activities after finishing the CLA review. Regulatory oversight of encapsulation plant construction will follow mainly standard principles for nuclear facilities taking into account the graded approach. Oversight of construction of the underground disposal facility will require novel approach since excavating safety classified rooms in bedrock keeping in mind the long term safety aspects differs from traditional nuclear facility construction. Posiva has constructed underground rock characterization facility, Onkalo, at the facility site during 2004-2016. STUK has regulated the construction of Onkalo as it would have been a nuclear facility because it was planned from the very beginning to expand the Onkalo in the future for the disposal facility. The gained experience will be used for the future regulatory oversight concept but it will require more development for the central tunnels, disposal tunnels and disposal holes which are the safety classified parts of the disposal facility. Article will give an overview on the regulatory oversight of spent nuclear fuel encapsulation plant and underground disposal facility during the construction period and licensing of these nuclear facilities.

The 54 mm fixed piston sampler was used, and the samples were stored in stainless steel tubes. When comparing the preliminary results on fall-cone and triaxial tests performed shortly after sampling and the following months, it is observed that there is a decrease in the undisturbed shear strength. In addition, storage reduces the measured preconsolidation pressure together with the constrained modulus. It is therefore recommended to carry out the triaxial and oedometer testing as soon as possible after the sampling. However, determination of the remoulded strength, water content and Atterberg limits may be delayed, assuming that the sample is properly sealed in the tube.","Disturbance; Piston sample; Sensitive clay; Storage","Energy storage; Geotechnical engineering; Pistons; Soil mechanics; Tubular steel structures; Atterberg limits; Disturbance; Laboratory test; Low plasticities; Oedometer testing; Preconsolidation pressure; Sensitive clays; Stainless steel tube; Stainless steel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040029382

A DC includes thousands of servers, communication and storage equipment and a support system including an air conditioning system, security, monitoring equipment and electricity regulator units. Data center operators face the challenges of meeting exponentially increasing demands for network bandwidth without unreasonable increases in operation and infrastructure cost. In order to meet the requirements of moderate increase in operation and infrastructure cost technology, a revolution is required. One way to overcome the shortcomings of traditional static (wired) data center architectures is use of a hybrid network based on fiber and optical wireless communication (OWC) or free space optics (FSO). The OWC link could be deployed on top of the existing cable/fiber network layer, so that live migration could be done easily and dynamically. In that case the network topology is flexible and adapts quickly to changes in traffic, heat distribution, power consumption and characteristics of the applications. In addition, OWC could provide an easy way to maintain and scale up data centers. As a result total cost of ownership could be reduced and the return on investment could be increased. In this talk we will review the main OWC technologies applicable for data centers, indicate how energy could be saved using OWC multichannel communication and discuss the issue of OWC pointing accuracy for data center scenario. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

However, due to its unique features which are typically associated with difficulty in handling (ultra-thin thickness and hydrophobic surface, to name a few), synthesis and subsequent deposition processes are thus critical to the material properties of the prepared graphene films. While existing synthesis approaches such as chemical vapor deposition and epitaxial growth can grow graphene with high degree of order, the costly high temperature and/or high vacuum process prohibit the widespread usage, and the subsequent graphene transfer from the growth substrates for deposition proves to be challenging. Herein, a low-cost one-step synthesis and deposition approach for preparing few-layer graphene (FLG) on flexible copper substrates based on dry ball-free milling of graphite powder is proposed. Different from previous reports, copper substrates are inserted into the milling crucible, thus accomplishing simultaneous synthesis and deposition of FLG and eliminating further deposition step. Furthermore, while all previously reported high energy milling processes involve using balls of various sizes, we adopt a ball-free milling process relying only on centrifugal forces, which significantly reduces the surface damage of the deposition substrates. Sample characterization indicates that the process yields FLG deposited uniformly across all tested specimens. Consequently, this work takes graphene synthesis and deposition a step closer to full automation with simple and low-cost process.

Depleted zones are located along grain boundaries and their width is not only determined by irradiation temperature and damage dose, but also by migration of point defects and dislocations integrity, that makes it more difficult to interpret experimental results of this phenomenon. At present, denuded zones are still objects for investigation as they influence both operation characteristics of reactor materials and their safe long-term storage. In this work, denuded zones in hexagonal ducts of spent fuel assemblies constructed from 0.08C-16Cr-11Ni-3Mo and 0.12C-18Cr-10Ni-Ti stainless steels from BN-350 fast nuclear reactor were investigated by TEM.

As its main objective, this paper considers various forms of renewable energy, examines their strengths and weaknesses, considers future opportunities for them to be used more keenly as productive servants and also highlights the threats which their development and exploitation may pose to future human progress. The sun is human kind's major future energy source. Hydropower portends immense capabilities which need to be hugely exploited all over the world. Wind energy still possesses smaller potential for exploitation. Bioenergy and biogas will be much more usable as technologies for their production, storage and distribution are improved significantly Geothermal energy is the least readily available. The study concludes that renewable energy holds the greatest potential as energy form that future human civilizations can depend on, but technologies for its exploitation need to be much more quickly developed and deployed to be most beneficial. This will help slow down the rapid rate of use and exhaustion of fossil fuels.","Biomass; Geothermal; Hydropower; Renewable energy; Solar; Wind","Biomass; Fossil fuels; Hydroelectric power; Renewable energy resources; Wind; Wind power; Future energies; Geothermal; Human civilization; Hydropower; Problems and Solutions; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Solar; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035356276

Therefore, using renewable energy, such as solar energy, for heating is the trend in recirculation aquaculture. However, the existing solar collector system in aquaculture has problems of high initial investment and slow cost recovery. This paper presents a low-cost solar collector system for supplying a hot water for an aquaculture system. The system consisted of solar collector, circulating piping system, pump, a solar power supply device and storage tank. A solar battery was adopted for power of the system, driving the pump to work. A double black plastic film acted as the heat collecting material. The system uses water flow between two layers of black film to absorb the heat generated by the solar radiation. And the heat was stored in the storage tank through the circulation water. The cost of the collector is about a quarter of the flat plate collect o r, significantly reduces the system cost. The experiment results indicated that the average daily collector efficiency of the system could reach 49.6%.","Energy conservation; Environmental protection; Recirculation aquaculture; Solar collector system; Solar energy","Aquaculture; Costs; Depreciation; Energy conservation; Environmental protection; Flow of water; Investments; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Tanks (containers); Thermoelectricity; Aquaculture systems; Collector systems; Cost recovery; Large amounts; Power supply devices; Recirculations; Renewable energies; Storage tank; Collector efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035335110

The architectural and technical design of the building has to be drafted with a targeted orientation of the glazed windows, exclusion of thermal bridges, controlled ventilation and heat recovery in order to use heat gains efficiently and so to reduce pointless heat losses. The energy efficiency of residential buildings is today mostly improved by upgrading the energy performance of the building envelope and facilities. However, huge energy reductions can also be achieved by a focus on the development of new systems enabling to cover natural energy fall-outs resulting from generation much excess heat during the peak time (summer, day) which is almost not possible to use during periods of excessive energy consumption (winter, night). This main drawback of the solar energy can be very efficiently solved by storing and later evolving of accumulated heat according to the day-night as well as the seasonal, i.e. summer-winter cycle (Fig. 1). This contribution deals with the system of thermo-active aluminium foam cladding for pitched roofs of the buildings covered by innovative coating sufficiently resistant to weathering, frost, intense solar radiation, summer heat, chemicals presented in the air, chemically polluted water vapor and to mechanical damage caused by adverse weather conditions (e.g. heavy rainfall, groats, etc.).

A reversible pump turbine (RPT) is the vital component of a PSP, and whether a PSP can operate safely and stably mainly depends on the characteristics of the RPT. However, the existence of S-shaped characteristics of a RPT usually leads to severe water hammer and pressure pulsations during the transient processes of load rejection. Therefore, hydraulic transient analysis in a PSP is one of the most important issues for the prevention of undesirable pressure fluctuations in waterways. Theoretically, the most accurate method is to conduct on-site measurements of all possible load cases to obtain the extreme values of pressure. However, extreme operating conditions such as 2-stage load rejection pose serious threats to the safety of the water conveyance system, making it impossible to carry out field trials under such conditions. This paper gives the numerical prediction of extreme and critical load case scenarios from the simultaneous load rejection field test on a double unit of a PSP in China. The dynamic transient numerical model for load rejection of the PSP is developed by introducing the method of characteristics. The boundary conditions, such as the real adopted wicket gate closure law and parameters of the water conveyance system, are calibrated according to the field test data. Considering the large pressure pulsations in the PSP during load rejection, a proper pressure pulsations amendment is proposed as well. Eventually, the hydraulic behavior of the critical load cases are numerically investigated by the modified model. And the results are amended by the proposed pressure pulsations processing approach to predict whether the hydraulic parameters can satisfy the design criteria, which can ensure safe operation of the PSP in the future. The achievements of the study can serve as a reference for similar PSP projects. © Copyright 2017 ASME.","Critical load case scenarios; Numerical prediction; Pressure pulsation; Reversible pump turbine; S-shaped characteristics","Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Engines; Fluid mechanics; Forecasting; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Hydraulic turbines; Machinery; Numerical models; Plant shutdowns; Pumped storage power plants; Pumps; Transient analysis; Turbines; Critical load; Numerical predictions; Pressure pulsation; Reversible pump-turbine; S-shaped; Numerical methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033606090

The quick response to load changes as well as the ability to store energy makes it essential to the stability of power grid. When a pump-turbine works in different condition, flow-induced instabilities occur, including Rotor Stator Interaction (RSI) between the runner and vanes, vortex formations and back flow regions. To understand these complicated flow dynamics, experimental and numerical investigations have been conducted by many researchers. Among these researches, many experiments on model test rigs are mainly focused on steady state, and knowledge for instabilities during transients is still lacking. In this paper, power failure experiments with constant guide van opening are conducted on an open-loop test rig. During the process, the operating point of the pump-turbine in the 4 quadrant characteristics moves from pump region through the brake region, turbine region to turbine brake region. Finally the pump-turbine settled down at runaway rotational speed. In our experiments, flow rate, rotational speed, torque, pressure in the spiral casing and the draft tube inlet are measured. Especially, dynamic pressure sensors mounted in the guide vane channels are used to measure transient pressure pulsations. Measured data are analyzed in both time domain and frequency domain. Results indicate that during power failure pressure pulsations in the vane channels vary significantly with the operating conditions. In the pump region, pressure pulsations are mainly composed of RSI. In the brake region, intensive stochastic noises occur, and the amplitude of RSI rises. In the turbine region, the magnitude of pressure pulsations drops sharply as the noise intensity goes down. In the turbine brake region, significant noises appear, and the amplitude of RSI increases dramatically. © Copyright 2017 ASME.","Instability; Power failure; Pump turbine","Brakes; Electric power transmission networks; Engines; Fluid mechanics; Frequency domain analysis; Hydraulic machinery; Machinery; Outages; Plasma stability; Pumped storage power plants; Safety engineering; Stochastic systems; Transient analysis; Turbines; Noise intensities; Numerical investigations; Operating condition; Power failure; Pressure pulsation; Pump-turbines; Rotor-stator interactions; Transient pressures; Hydraulic turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033602361

The NMPAM are prepared by Focused Ion Beam lithography (FIB), a nanoscale fabrication tool. The NMPAM can be used to remarkably enhance the strength of the surface evanescent and lead to the excitation of several SPP modes on the metal surface. The interaction of different SPPs result in unique near-field optical properties for imaging and optical storage, so as to focus light into a nano-size point and thus enhance the light power greatly. The energy flow and electromagnetic field distribution is calculated by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The nano-spot position and intensity is experimentally shown to be controlled by the array of the apex. In our experiments, we fabricate a 10×10 array by FIB, and then the scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) is used to observe the optical power distribution in nano-scale at the air-metal interface in the infrared region. we find that the light can be focus into ∼100nm-scale and consequently enhance the light power up to several times than before common focusing method. The principle of nano-focusing based on nano-planar-apex is theoretically explained. The NMPAM can be utilized for coupling with infrared pixels to enhance the incident light converging so as to improve signal to noise ratio of infrared detection. © 2017 SPIE.","metamaterial; nano-focusing; planar apex array; plasmon","Characterization; Electromagnetic fields; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Fabrication; Finite difference time domain method; Focusing; Ion beam lithography; Ion beams; Light; Metals; Metamaterials; Nanotechnology; Optical properties; Photonics; Plasmons; Signal to noise ratio; Surface plasmon resonance; Time domain analysis; Electromagnetic field distribution; Infrared detection; Infrared regions; Nano-focusing; Nano-scale fabrication; Optical power distribution; planar apex array; Surface plasmon polaritons; Near field scanning optical microscopy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033556593

As a case study was elected the Vidraru dam located in Arges County, being one of the most important dams in Romania. The Vidraru dam, built on the Arges River, is an “arch” dam with double curvature, being the highest concrete dam in Romania. The storage lake formed has a volume of 465 mil m3 of water, being the second largest on inland rivers in the country. The dam allows operation of the Corbeni underground power station (located approx. 160m, underground) with an output of 220 MW in installation and an average energy of 400 Wh/ year. Field measurements were conducted during September-December 2016, after which the data were processed at the office with software specifically developed for this purpose. For levelling measurements were used levels Leica Sprinter 250M, 3m staffs with special codes and a set of two levelling foot plate of 6 kg each. Determining heights using this level is achieved with a standard deviation of 0.7 mm per double km of levelling. The measurement method for detecting vertical displacements has been the middle geometric levelling, with 2 horizons. The high precision geometric levelling traverses was carried out on the basis of technical requirements of the 0 order geometric levelling. © SGEM2017.

LTD., Wuhan, Hubei, China","With the continuous running of the nuclear power plants, a great deal of unavailable spent fuel associated assemblies were and will be produced in the aggregates of the nuclear power plants, which are usually stored in the spent fuel storage pool and occupy lots of spent fuel storage racks, making the spent fuel storage facility of the nuclear power plants face the risk of being filled up. Therefore, it drives the nuclear power plants to seek a new method to increase the spent fuel storage capacity. In order to increase the storage capacity of the spent fuel storage racks, a shearing device is proposed to shear the rods and base plates (or spider assemblies) of the spent fuel associated assemblies, reducing the storage volume of the spent fuel associated assemblies and reducing the amount of the occupied spent fuel storage racks. The technology of waterhydraulic shear is applied to carry the shear process through underwater cold extrusion, effectively ensuring the integrity of the rod structure and avoiding the pollution caused by radioactive substances. Besides, no swarf would be produced to pollute the spent fuel storage pool. Through the finite element calculation and confirmation on the spot, it is verified that the bearing requirement of the fixed blade (the key assembly unit) of the shearing device is met during the relevant disassembling process. Currently, the shearing device has been successfully applied to reducing the storage volume of the spent fuel associated assemblies in LingAo Nuclear Power Plant. Therefore, the shearing device is of certain promoting and reference value. © Copyright 2017 ASME.",,"Digital control systems; Fuels; Life cycle; Materials handling; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Plant life extension; Radioactive waste storage; Shearing; Shearing machines; Spent fuels; Storage (materials); Warehouses; Water pollution; Assembly units; Cold extrusion; Disassembling process; Radioactive substances; Reference values; Shear process; Storage capacity; Storage volumes; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032578013

Several industrial facilities have been built and used to this aim across the time. Following those decades and with the more and more precise monitoring of the impact of those installations, precise data and lessons-learned have been collected that can be used for the stakeholders of potential new facilities. China has expressed strong interest in building such facilities. As a matter of fact, the issue of accumulation of spent fuel is becoming serious in China and jeopardizes the operation of several nuclear power plants, through the running out of space of storage pools. Tomorrow, with the extremely high pace of nuclear development of China, accumulation of spent fuel will be unbearable. Building reprocessing and recycling installations takes time. A decision has to be taken so as to enable the responsible development of nuclear in China. Without a solution for the back end of its nuclear fuel cycle, the development of nuclear energy will face a wall. This is what the Chinese central government, through the action of its industrial CNNC, has well understood. Several years of negotiations have been held with AREVA. Everybody in the sector seems now convinced. However, now that the negotiation is coming to an end, an effort should be done towards all the stakeholders, sharing actual information from France's reference facilities on: safety, security, mitigation measures for health protection (of the workers, of the public), mitigation measures for the protection of the environment. Most of this information is public, as France has since years promulgated a law on Nuclear transparency.

In recent years it has been widely used in nuclear power system for its good maneuverability. The working fluid flows once through the heat transfer tube forced by the pressure head of the feedwater pump. The water is heated by the coolant of primary side as it flows along the heat transfer tube. After preheating, evaporating and overheating, steam of required temperature is then produced. In addition, flow instability may occur in OTSG because of the present of two-phase flow. Once-through steam generation system is a typical nonlinear multi-variable coupling system, the water/heat storage capacity of secondary side is small, and the steam pressure is very sensitive to the load fluctuation. Various disturbances such as the change of feed water flow, the change of heat transfer rate from the primary side and the change of the secondary side load, will lead to the variety of the parameters in the heating channel. A more complex and precise water control system is therefore needed. An accurate system model is very important to optimize the control strategy and improve the control quality. Obtaining the dynamic mathematical model of the once-through steam generation system is the basis for its effective control. At present, the dynamic modeling of once-through steam generation system mainly adopts mechanism modeling method. By analyzing the inherent mechanism of steam generation process and using the basic conservation equation to derive the relationship between model variables. However, due to the complexity of OTSG and the feedwater system structure and the two-phase heat transfer mechanism, the mechanism modeling is very difficult and the model is not precise enough and very complex. Many nonlinear equations are included, which makes it difficult to determine an effective numerical method for real-time simulation. System identification is based on the actual measurement of input and output information of the process. The system model can be estimated without having to study its internal mechanism. In this paper, the dynamic model of once-through steam generation system in nuclear power plant is identified. Ensuring the stability of the steam outlet pressure during the operation of the system is very important to the safety of steam turbine. Therefore a three-input, two-output coupling system is obtained by analyzing the influence factor of the once-through steam generation system. The pseudo-random sequences are used as the input signal, and the Prediction-Error Minimization (PEM) method is used to identify the system. Dynamic state space models of the system are obtained. The multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) system are identified at different power levels, and the model verification are carried out by simulate the step response output. The results show that the state space model of the once-through steam generation system identified by PEM method is of high precision. The step response of the model and the output of the actual system are in good agreement with each other. The identification scheme proposed in this paper provides a new method and idea for the modeling of nuclear power plant system. The model can provide foundation and technical support for the research of high precision and high quality control system. © Copyright 2017 ASME.",,"Chemical contamination; Control systems; Digital control systems; Dynamic models; Dynamics; Flow of fluids; Flow of water; Heat transfer; Life cycle; Nonlinear equations; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Numerical methods; Plant life extension; Quality control; State space methods; Steam; Steam generators; Steam power plants; Steam turbines; Step response; Conservation equations; Dynamic mathematical model; Multi-input and multi-output system; Once through steam generator; Prediction error minimizations; Pseudorandom sequences; Steam generation system; Two-phase heat transfer; Two phase flow",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032566573

Common causes of water hammer are sudden valve closing at the end of a pipeline system, pump failure, check valve slam etc. The steam transportation pipeline system may also be vulnerable to water hammer when it confronts with the situation where liquid and steam co-exist. Water hammer often occurs when steam condenses into water in a horizontal section of steam piping. Then steam ""picks up"" water to form a highvelocity ""slug"" and create extra stress to pipe. When steam is trapped into sub-cooled water, the collapse of vapor cavity can lead to collision of two columns of liquid, resulting in a large rise in pressure which will damage pipes, supporting structures and hydraulic machinery. Nuclear power plant is composed of complex equipments and piping systems, lots of which contain both liquid and steam. Hence, there is a potential threat of occurrence of water hammer to the normal operation of systems. Thus, this phenomenon needs to be well investigated and prevented with some effective methods. For the purpose of overpressure relief under severe accidents, the spent fuel pool cooling system of CAP1000 series nuclear power plant provides a discharge passage from containment to spent fuel pool. When the containment pressure exceeds the control value, valve is opened to discharge hightemperature and high-pressure steam until the pressure drops to a safety value. During this process, serious water hammer happens, causing pressure rise beyond the design pressure and further leading to damages to pipes and structures. Therefore, water hammer of overpressure discharge pipeline in CAP1000 plant is studied in this work. On the basis of verification of the capabilities of computational code RELAP5/MOD3.3, hydraulic transient of water hammer is simulated under different conditions. It is indicated that after steam discharge stops, residual steam in pipe condenses because of contact with subcooled water in spent fuel pool. Subsequently, the rapid backflow and vapor cavity lead to a severe water hammer. The detailed analysis has shown that water temperature of spent fuel pool has a decisive influence on the mechanism of water hammer phenomenon, including collision of liquid column to valve disc and cavity collapse in the horizontal pipe. The collision and separation of liquid column result in relatively lower pressure amplitude. © 2017 ASME.",,"Failure (mechanical); Fuels; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulics; Lakes; Liquids; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Pipelines; Piping systems; Plant shutdowns; Radioactive waste storage; Spent fuels; Steam; Water hammer; Water pipelines; Computational codes; High-pressure steam; Horizontal section; Hydraulic transients; Supporting structure; Transportation pipelines; Water hammer phenomenon; Water temperatures; Steam power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032512271

Anti-nuclear movements continue in many places, although the nuclear power plants have good operating records. It has some factors, and the first factor that the public knows little about nuclear industry, results in regarding the nuclear power plant mysterious. This condition relates to destructive scene by nuclear weapon with nuclear industry, deeming it unacceptable to take this risk. Secondly, construction of nuclear power plant and off site emergency may occupy large land. The public hopes to be rewarded more to offset the risk by their imagination. Last, it relates to the political environment of one country. Every country has its own situation, so the strategies of developing nuclear power plant are widely different. The public is not familiar with other nuclear engineering projects except nuclear power plants, and hence the boycott happens more frequently. Sino-French cooperation on nuclear fuel cycle project is the first large-scale commercial spent fuel reprocessing plant, which is the biggest cooperative project between China and France until now. AREVA is responsible for technology, and CNNC is responsible for building. Spent fuel reprocessing is the most important part of nuclear fuel cycle back end, which separates uranium and plutonium from spent fuel, and manufactures MOX fuel with recycled resources for using in nuclear reactor again. This will make the best use of the uranium resources. After that process, the fission products needed to be disposed reduce significantly. And it is good for environmental protection. The public protest happened in one of the candidate sites, when CNNC carried out the preliminary work of site selection. For meeting the enormous energy demands, the fossil energy may be exhausted in the future due to the greenhouse gases emission. Chinese government speeds up the development of new energy. Nuclear energy is the only technology with no emission of greenhouse gases and will be rapidly developed. Along with the nuclear power units continuing to increase, they become the critical factors in restricting the sustainable development of nuclear energy. That is efficient utilization of uranium resources, spent fuel intermediate storage, reprocessing, and geologic disposal of high level radioactive waste. To this project, it not only has a great current demand, but also closely relates to transition of energy structure. The public has different views in the project progressing, which results in wide concern and discussion. The article took this event for example, and analyzed the reason from all directions.

As an important component of the claw part in CRDM, the nonmagnetic shim materials have big influence on the movable latch lock plunger releasing current of CRDM. When cutting off the coil power, the nonmagnetic shim materials can block the magnetic circuit between the pole and latch lock plunger effectively and reduce the remanence suction force between magnetic pole and latch lock plunger, which can promote a quick latch lock plunger's action and finish the step-jump and rod-release. In this paper, we introduce the background of nonconformance of the movable latch lock plunger releasing current of CRDM of PWR plant simply, and then we analyze the reasons of the non-conformance in detail, including a comprehensive analysis of various factors and a series of retest conclusions. Through specific analysis, the important role of nonmagnetic shims in CRDM and its big influence on movable latch lock plunger releasing current are proved. Based on research and test results, we show our optimized measures on the movable latch lock plunger releasing current in detail, from the perspective of technical specification for raw materials and improved processing technology during production. At last, one latch unit which occurred the movable latch lock plunger releasing current non-conformance and experienced a 1.7 million steps performance test is used in the following performance verification test. Being installed in this latch mechanism, our nonmagnetic shims finished an integral series of cold test, hot test and cold test after hot test. All of the test results meet our design requirements and all of the releasing current under cold condition is better than the results of 1.7 million steps performance test. Especially, the independently developed nonmagnetic shims improved the movable latch lock plunger releasing current significantly. In addition, other current results of hot test are equal to that of 1.7 million steps performance test.

The exploitaition of this types of aquifers it is significant because, among other things, this aquifers are easily accessible (in general we don’t need complex systems of capture and in most cases are enough wells ans/or drilling between 10-100m depth). Must of the aquifers structures from the south part of Romania are usually, under pressure or with free surface.The ground is composed by horizontal strata of different permeability. Principal part in many projects and studies dealing with groundwater exploitation, protection and remediation. The pumping test is one of the most useful tools available in the evoluation groundwater producing formations. Pumping tests are an important part of any groundwater investigation or groundwater scheme feasibility study. They provide essential information which can affect the planning and build of a project and often required to allow an application of an abstraction license for water supply wells and open-loop ground source energy systems. Pumping test gives the best information on the drawdown level, flow rates and unforeseen factors generated upon pumping. There are two main objectives of pumping tests: ▪ A pumping test may be performed in order to determine the hydraulic characteristic of aquifers or water bearing layers. Such a test is often called an aquifer test because it is the aquifer rather than the pump or well which is tested. Properly planned and carefully conducted ‘aquifer-test’ may provide basic information for the solution of many regional as well as local ground water flow problems; ▪ A pumping test may provide information about the yield and drawdown of the well. These data can be used for determining the specific capacity or the discharge drawdown ratio of the well, for selecting the type of the pump and for estimating the cost of pumping. The specific capacity gives a measure of the effectiveness or productive capacity of the well. Such a pumping test is sometimes called a ‘well-test’ because it is the well, rather then the aquifer, which is tested. The principle of a pumping test involves applying a stress to an aquifer by extracting groundwater from a pumping well and measuring the aquifer response to that stress by monitoring drawdown as a function of time. These measurements are then incorporated into an appropriate well-flow equation to calculate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifers. The experimental pumping follow the establishment of relationships between the pumped debits and drawdown recorded in the central drilling and in the observation one, relations wich allow the determination of the hydrogeological parameters of the aquifers layers. The hydrogeological parameters wich can be calculated with the measures data during experimental pumping are: o Hydraulic conductivity: k (m/zi); o Transmissivity: T (m2/zi); o Radius of influence: R (m).

This paper initiates and proposes a principle design framework from technical view in qualification requirements for this neutron absorber material so as to guide the practical engineering application. Aiming at neutron absorber materials supplied under practical manufacturing condition in engineering delivery, the qualification requirements define B4C content, matrix chemistry, 10B isotope, bulk density, 10B areal density, mechanical property and microstructure as key criteria for material performance. The uniformity assessment as to different locations of this material is also required from at least three lots of material. Only qualified material meeting all of the qualification requirements should proceed to be verified by lifetime testing such as irradiation, corrosion and thermal aging testing. Systematic and comprehensive performance assessments and verification for process stabilization could be achieved through the above qualification. The long-term service for this neutron absorber material in reliable and safe way could be convincingly expected in spent fuel storage application in China. © Copyright 2017 ASME.","Life-time verification; Neutron absorber plate; Performance; Qualification; Spent fuel rack; Uniformity","Boron carbide; Fuels; Manufacture; Materials handling; Neutron absorption; Neutrons; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Particle reinforced composites; Plates (structural components); Radioactive waste storage; Spent fuels; Storage (materials); Thermal aging; Warehouses; Life-times; Neutron absorbers; Performance; Qualification; Uniformity; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032461806

TCD phenomenon influences fuel average temperature and fuel storage energy under steady state condition before loss of coolant accident (LOCA) and further influences peak cladding temperature (PCT) during large break LOCA process. In this study, sensitivity study on double ended guillotine break of cold leg in CAP1000 at different burnup conditions was performed, using large break LOCA analysis code WCOBRA/TRAC and PCTs under different conditions were obtained. The modified NFI (Nuclear Fuels Institute) TCD model was adopted to model fuel conductivity after degradation in analysis and decrease of peaking factors including FQ and FΔh after 30GWD/MTU was also considered. Sensitivity analysis showed that: After considering the influence of TCD and peaking factor burndown, the PCT limiting case did not occur in low burnup range again, but occurred at burup of about 29GWD/MTU. Compared to other burnup points, the first and second peak values of PCT at that burnup point were all at the highest level. Performing of this study could prefer reference for analysis and estimation of large break LOCA of passive nuclear power plants under high burnup conditions. © 2017 ASME.","High burnup; Large break loca; Peak cladding temperature; Thermal conductivity degradation","Accidents; Coolants; Factor analysis; Fuel storage; Fuels; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Reactor cores; Sensitivity analysis; Thermal conductivity; Conductivity degradations; Double-ended guillotine breaks; Fuel thermal conductivity; High-burn up; Large break loss of coolant accidents; Peak cladding temperature; Sensitivity studies; Steady-state condition; Loss of coolant accidents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032461351

For this purpose, the experimental vehicle was fitted with fuel cell NEXA with nominal power of 198 Watts. During fuel cell operation we focused on minimization of hydrogen system leakage. The risks of hydrogen leakage out of fuel cell circuit were determined by FTA method. During analysis of the hydrogen drive, one of the parameter of the MTBF (Mean-Time-Between-Failures) theory was used. Information source for MTBF values was NPRD – 95 database (Non-electronic Parts Reliability Data). Consequently, the probability of hydrogen leakage and risks matrix was defined to determine its scale.

It requires, special services for safety and corresponding additional expenses on security and ecology. Same time, they are energetic materials and attractive for chemical and mining industry. One of the main directions for solving the above-mentioned problems is application of utilized ammunition for development of new industrial explosives for mining industry. Implementation of new explosives needs stable energetic and technological characteristics: full energy, detonation velocity, brisance, workability, etc. In most cases, explosives prepared on the base of utilized ammunition are characterized with low sensitivity on detonator-generated impulse and for stable initiation of detonation requires additional energy from outside sources (so called immediate detonators). Because, conventional methods and schemes not reliable and unusable in particular cases for determination of energetic and technological characteristics.

The SHPPs are a particular form and case of hydroelectric power plants (HPP) and are having a maximum capacity of 10 MW. Since the green certificate (GC) promotion scheme was awarded in Romania (2008), a considerable number of SHPP were constructed and commissioned in the last years. These projects have the same philosophy as a large hydro, but their impact on the environment is considered to be less due to the dimensions of their structures. Also the dimensions of units below 10 MW are much reduced than bigger units. The entire technical parameters are different in SHPP than regular HPP therefore we find higher speeds of the machines, simple construction of hydraulic structures, less equipment and auxiliary systems, reduced dimensions of turbines, generators or inlet valves that are having an important influence in their complexity. Comparing to a 55 MW Francis unit that has a nominal speed of 375 rpm, a 400 kW Francis unit could reach easily 1000 or 1500 rpm. This will reduce the number of electromagnetic pols of generator and therefore its dimensions and more important the manufacturing cost. However, the maintenance requirements of the other components remain the same as in large project or even higher. As an example, the bearings of the turbine are subject to a higher speed and wear, the water has a higher speed through turbine and guided vanes. Also a SHPP that is built on a derivation layout, does not have a large reservoir that allows the regulation of discharge in order to limit the number of start-ups per day. The SHPP will start depending on the water availability in the forebay tank and will shut down when the minimum level its achieved. This is causing higher stress of material, fatigue and additional wear of mechanical equipment. Most of the SHPP that were built are subject to maintenance works as they exceeded warranty period. It is very important to plan the maintenance during periods with low hydrology, especially in summer. The limitation in water storage capability of any SHPP generates significant energy losses when maintenance is required. It is very important to know and understand the actual state of the machines in order to optimize maintenance in order to maximize energy generation and minimize any losses. Therefore, it might be the case of establishing a limitation in operation until maintenance conditions are met. This article aims to presents the results in the field of SHPP maintenance by using vibrations measurements and numerical simulation in order to determine the actual state of the units and for their components, and to obtain enough knowledge to properly organize the entire maintenance program. © SGEM2017 All Rights Reserved.","Maintenance; Simulation; Small hydropower plants; Vibrations","Auxiliary equipment; Construction equipment; Energy dissipation; Hydraulic motors; Hydroelectric generators; Hydroelectric power; Laws and legislation; Maintenance; Manufacture; Reservoirs (water); Small power plants; Wear of materials; Impact on the environment; Maintenance programs; Maintenance requirement; Mechanical equipment; Simulation; Small hydro-power plants; Small hydroelectric power plants; Vibrations; Hydroelectric power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032451283

Complex geological investigation must be performed to evaluate the thermal conductivity of a geological structure. It is a process that demands time and money. An assessment of the mutual influence between the thermal conductivity of the borehole heat exchanger and the geological structure allows us to predict the thermal conductivity faster and cheaper than performing a complex geological investigation. Seventeen test borehole heat exchangers (BHE) were installed during the research. A determination of the thermal conductivity of the geological structure was performed by the Thermal Response Test (TRT) using data collected in-situ from a BHE. Geological conditions were interpreted from the gathered soil samples and the geophysical investigation data collected in the borehole. The thermal conductivity of the separate geological layers with different lithological compositions is calculated using the weight method. The generalized thermal conductivity values of Quaternary sandy layers is 2,35 W/m*K, clayey sediments - 1,57 W/m*K, Cretaceous and Jurassic clayey rocks buried from the 80m to 110m depth is 2,27 W/m*K and 2,06 W/m*K accordingly, Devonian dolomite - 2,86 W/m*K. The classified thermal conductivity values for separate geological bedrocks allow us to predict the thermal conductivity for the whole geological structure from the geological data alone.

Recycling - part of the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) in the hierarchy of waste – helps to reduce the consumption of raw materials and to reduce energy consumption, air pollution (in phase of combustion waste) and water (in phase of waste storage). Among the recyclable materials such as glass, paper, plastic, metal, textiles are used tires. These tires are a source of waste because of the high volume of products - requires large storage space, enhanced tire durability and the fact that the ecological tire components is a big problem – they are non-biodegradable materials. Often the tires are burnt to the detriment of environment but there are concerns constantly using them as recyclable material. Thus, between the uses of recycled tire it is crumb rubber modifier that used in asphalt mixture leads to a Rubber Modified Asphalt Mixture type. In this context fits this paper that shows a possibility of using rubber asphalt mixture used in the wearing course of pavement. It is studied in the laboratory the mix of aggregate, filler and bitumen (AC12.5 asphalt mixture type) together with an addition of Road+ additive (containing crumb rubber) and Gilsonite additive (pure bitumen) compared to the mixture without additives.

However, evoked by the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident, it has been widely recognized that a complete site risk profile should not be confined to the reactor units, but should cover all the radiological sources in a site, e.g. spent fuel storage facilities. During the operation of the reactor units, the used fuel assemblies will be unloaded from the reactor core to the storage facilities in a continuous or periodical manner. Accident scenarios involving such facilities can occur with nonnegligible frequencies and significant consequences, posing threat to public safety. Hence, the risk contributions from such scenarios should be carefully estimated and integrated into the safety goal evaluations. The spent fuel storage facilities can be categorized as two types: pool storage units and dry cask storage facilities. In the former type, spent fuel assemblies are stored in large pools inside or outside the reactor building, with the residual heat removed by natural or forced water circulation. The latter type, where air or inert gas circulation plays an important role, appear mostly as a complementary method, along with the pool storage units, to expand the plant's storage capacity. For instance, at the Daiichi plant, there are several fuel pool units holding some fresh fuel and some used fuel, the latter awaiting for its transfer to the dry cask storage facilities on site. Note that, as well as in a joint manner, both storage facilities can be designed to serve the NPPs independently. As a fully developed method to identify potential risk in a logical and quantitative way, the framework of PRA can be generally applied to the spent fuel storage facilities with some special considerations. This paper is aimed at giving recommendations for the spent fuel storage facility PRAs, including (1) clarifying the analysis scope of risk from spent fuel storage facilities; (2) illustrating four key issues that determines such risk; (3) presenting three essential considerations when conducting PRAs to evaluate such risk. Also, this paper integrates the insights obtained from two representative case studies involving two NPP sites with different types of both fuel elements and storage facilities. © Copyright 2017 ASME.","Nuclear power plant; Probabilistic risk assessment; Spent fuel storage facility","Accidents; Facilities; Fuels; Inert gases; Lakes; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Radioactive waste storage; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Spent fuels; Storage (materials); Accident scenarios; Complementary methods; Essential considerations; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Radiological sources; Representative case; Spent fuel assemblies; Storage facilities; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032434214

However, the temperature distribution with depth is somewhat uncertain, and this is often assumed to be a linear approximation from the mudline to the bottom of the well. During drilling, the circulating temperature may significantly affect the rheology of the drilling fluids and the cement setting processes. Therefore, erroneous estimates of the wellbore temperature may affect the overall performance of the drilling phase and subsequent well operations. Further, it is important to know the accurate temperature distribution within the formation for assessment of the petroleum prospectivity through source rock maturation and reservoir quality. This paper presents a numerical methodology to estimate the undisturbed geothermal gradient while drilling in offshore wells. This methodology may also be applied to onshore wells by simplification. The new approach is based on an in-house axisymmetric wellbore transient thermal model, in which the equations are solved using the finite difference method. The model computes the heat transfer between the well and riser system with the surroundings. However, other computational codes may also be used following the framework presented in this study. The computer code should provide a detailed representation of the geometry of the wellbore, the physical properties of the drilling fluid and formation, the suitable thermal boundary conditions and temporal discretization. The temperatures of the fluid at the inlet of the drillstring and at the bottom hole assembly (BHA), in the annulus A, are used as input to the numerical model that iteratively adjusts the undisturbed geothermal gradient, which generated the temperature recordings while drilling. The paper comprises cases studies of hypothetical wells drilled in relevant offshore areas in the world, each with their distinctive and variable geothermal gradient, defined by the different rock formations encountered. Uncertainties regarding the thermal properties of the rock were also considered to ascertain the robustness of the code. The water depth of the drilling site was also observed to impact the convergence of the algorithm. The results obtained by the numerical approach are in good agreement with the expected values of the undisturbed formation temperatures. The novelty of the numerical framework is the ability to provide reliable and satisfactory estimates of the undisturbed geothermal gradient for wellbores with any configuration, lithology and rock properties. These estimates are based on temperature measurements of the circulating drilling fluid at the BHA and account for uncertainty in rock thermal properties; in reasonable time using standard engineering computers. © 2017 ASME.",,"Arctic engineering; Boreholes; Bottom-hole assembly; Codes (symbols); Digital storage; Drilling fluids; Finite difference method; Geothermal energy; Heat transfer; Heating; Iterative methods; Lithology; Offshore drilling; Offshore gas wells; Oil field equipment; Oil wells; Petroleum geology; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Rock drilling; Rocks; Setting; Temperature distribution; Temperature measurement; Thermodynamic properties; Uncertainty analysis; Well drilling; Formation temperature; Heat transfer process; Numerical methodologies; Petroleum prospectivity; Temperature recording; Temporal discretization; Thermal boundary conditions; Transient thermal models; Offshore oil wells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032181785

This paper presents a new concept to integrate compressed air energy storage (CAES) in floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) structures. The FOWT support structures will serve a dual purpose: to provide the necessary buoyancy to maintain the entire wind turbine afloat and stable under different met-ocean conditions and to act as a pressure vessel for compressed air energy storage on site. The proposed concept involves a hydro-pneumatic accumulator installed on the seabed to store pressurized deep sea water that is pneumatically connected to the floating support structure by means of an umbilical conduit. The present study investigates the technical feasibility of this concept when integrated in tension leg platforms (TLPs). The focus is on the impact of the additional floating platform weight resulting from the CAES on the dynamic response characteristics and loads when exposed to irregular waves. A simplified model for sizing the TLP hull for different energy storage capacities is initially presented. This is then used to evaluate the dynamic response of nine different TLP geometries when supporting the NREL1 5MW baseline wind turbine model. Numerical simulations are carried out using the marine engineering software tool ANSYS Aqwa ©. The work provides an insight on how TLP structures supporting wind turbines may be optimised to facilitate the integration of the proposed CAES concept. It is shown that it is technically feasible to integrate CAES capacities on the order of Megawatt- Hours within TLP structures without compromising the stability of the floating system; although this would involve a substantial increase in the total structure weight. © 2017 ASME.",,"Arctic engineering; Buoyancy; Compressed air; Computer aided software engineering; Dynamic response; Energy storage; Ground supports; Marine engineering; Oceanography; Offshore wind farms; Offshore wind turbines; Pressure vessels; Seawater; Tension-leg platforms; Wind power; Wind turbines; Compressed air energy storages (CAES); Dynamic response characteristics; Energy storage capacity; Energy storage technologies; Engineering software; Floating offshore wind turbines; Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT); Wind turbine modeling; Compressed air energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031998484

In addition, the limitation of performance as an input energy constraint needs to be considered to prevent the system stability degradation as well. This paper focuses on the design of H∞ mixed sensitivity based on structural PID controller for high accuracy hard disk drive servo system which examines the input saturation constraint. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is utilized in the proposed design to maximize the system stability index called stability margin (), which consists of three norms of H∞ mixed sensitivity control. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed controller, full order H∞ mixed sensitivity, the proposed PID design with considering the input constraint and trial-error tuning based PID are compared in the simulation section. It is clearly illustrated that the considering input saturation constraint is important to design the controller for sustaining the system performance. Moreover, the results confirm the robustness and performance of three controllers under the repeatable runout (RRO) disturbance. The structure of the proposed PID controller based on PSO is more simple and appropriate to apply into the actual application than the conventional H∞ mixed sensitivity full order. In addition, the results of the proposed PID controller and conventional H∞ are quite similar which can reduce the effect of RRO by 50 times and gains 50% more effective than the normal PID in terms of output error.","Hard disk drive; H∞ robust loop shaping; Input saturation; Servo actuator; Structural PID","Actuator disks; Controllers; Electric control equipment; Hard disk storage; Intelligent systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Proportional control systems; Robust control; System stability; Three term control systems; Hard Disk Drive; Input saturation; Loop-shaping; Servoactuator; Structural PID; Control system stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031711419

Major costs are typically associated with the procurement, transportation, storage, and processing of materials. Environmental concerns include emissions, wastes, and the consumption of precious resources such as energy and water. However, less attention is paid to material management in services supply chains compared to that of manufacturing firms. This paper aims to develop a cost-based optimization model for sustainable material management in a hotel supply chain. The model combines the key costs of materials within the supply chain including those associated with green decisions and environmental impacts. The pilot model is developed based on empirical data collected from a small sample of 4 and 5-stars hotels in the UAE. The model can be expanded and utilized by hotels and service companies in general as a platform to reduce the total cost of material management and to support sustainability practices across the supply chain. This is particularly important for hospitality sector which is under a growing pressure from stakeholders and regulators to increase its operational and cost-effectiveness while maintaining high environmental, safety, and quality standards.","Hotel management; Linear programming; Material management; Supply chain sustainability","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Digital storage; Engineers; Environmental impact; Hotels; Linear programming; Materials handling; Optimization; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Cost-based optimization; Effective materials; Environmental concerns; Hotel managements; Manufacturing firms; Material management; Sustainability practices; Sustainable materials; Supply chain management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031005568

However, the existing combined heat and power (CHP) system has limited adjustability because of being controlled in the ""heat-led"" mode, which, consequently, hinders the development of the RESs. A solution of the problem is to introduce the heat storage (HS), which decouples heat supply from heat load. Although a number of researchers have studied in the design and the planning optimization of such CHP systems with RESs and HS, few people have paid attention to the seasonal variation of the heat load, which may vary the daily optimal planning of the systems. In this dissertation, we set up the model and optimize the planning of a CHP system with RESs and HS, with the consideration of the seasonal variation of the heat load. We find that in the beginning/ending of the heating season, the HS should store heat when the wind power is being abandoned and release heat in the rest of the days, while in the middle of the heating season, the HS should release heat when the wind power is being abandoned and store heat in the rest of the days.

Especially, the supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2cycles are very interesting for these ap- plications. This is due to many advantages of the S-CO2cycles over the other cycles such as a steam-water cycle or helium cycle. On the other hand, S-CO2 cycles have also disadvantages. One of the disadvantages is presence of impurities in the cycles. The big question is the e ect of these impurities in the CO2, which can occur as impu- rities or can be suitably added to the pure CO2. From the previous research, it is obvious that binary mixtures a ect the cycle as they inuence cycle component design and thus the overall effciency of the power cycle. The biggest e ect of mixtures is on the heat exchangers and compressor, which operate close to the critical point. The positive e ect of the binary mixtures is observed in the recuperative heat exchanger. On the other hand, negative e ects occurs in the cooler. Therefore, the Czech Tech- nical University in Prague (CTU) conducted research on supercritical carbon dioxide cycles, which is focused on the e ect of the gaseous admixtures in S-CO2 on the dif- ferent cycle components. The main goal of this paper is to describe the e ect of gaseous admixtures on the effciency of the cycles and their e ect on each component. The rst part of the study is focused on the calculation of the basic cycles for binary mixtures and description of the e ect on the compressor and the cycle efficiency. The second part of the study is focused on the calculation of the basic cycles for multicomponent mixtures. In this part, the e ect of the mixtures for di erent compositions and amounts of the individual mixture components will be pre- sented. The calculations are performed for pure CO2 and then for selected multicomponent mixtures. A basic mul- ticomponent mixture includes mixtures from technology of carbon capture and storage. Other multicomponent mix- tures are combinations of previously investigated gaseous admixtures such as He, CO, O2, N2, H2, CH4 and H2S. The last part of the study is focused on the optimization of individual basic cycles for di erent amount of admixtures in CO2. The result of this study defines the optimum com-position of multicomponent mixtures and describes their e ect on the cycle efficiency for the particular utilization of S-CO2 cycle.

Once reached its erasing limit, the data on the storage blocks will become unreliable. In order to improve the endurance of flash memory, this paper proposed a progressive group-based wear-leveling algorithm which can notably reduce the consumption of RAM space required by wear leveling algorithm while maintaining the wear leveling performance. Our algorithm also provides a new way to identify the cold data more accurately which dramatically minimize the performance overheads due to data migration. The evaluation results reveal that our progressive group-based wear-leveling algorithm consumes only 8% of memory space compared to the previous scheme that manages per-block information, while showing roughly the same wear-leveling performance.","Endurance; Memory consumption; Performance overheads; Wear-leveling","Digital storage; Durability; Energy utilization; Flash-based SSDs; Random access storage; Evaluation results; Low energy consumption; Memory consumption; Performance overheads; Shock resistance; Solid state drives; Wear leveling; Wear-leveling algorithms; Flash memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027841519

Improvements in materials and manufacturing processes have enabled larger tank volume capacity, leading to increased material performance requirements as well. 12MnNiVR is a material typically used in the fabrication of large-scale atmospheric tanks. However, serious tank bottom corrosion can occur, not only from the medium inside the tank, but also from soil erosion of the tank foundation. Testing of corrosion on the tank floor is usually conducted using nondestructive methods such as magnetic flux leakage (MFL) to determine an equivalent bottom corrosion indication, but this requires cleaning of the tank and access to a large area for inspection, which is costly. In recent years, acoustic emission (AE) testing methods have been frequently used to determine the qualitative corrosion condition of the tank floor. However, according to researchers, only a few simple parameters of AE signals, tank bottom corrosion severity grade, the lack of concrete storage tank under the conditions of material effect, corrosion materials research AE signal spectrum and characteristic parameters, and thus the corrosion status of materials for quantitative analysis and assessment. This study simulates corrosion conditions for 12MnNiVR, a typical material used in the construction of atmospheric tanks. The Devanathan–Stachurski technique is used, with electrolytic hydrogen charging corrosion on one side of the surface material and simulated soil solution soaking on other. AE signals were collected and analyzed over time under corrosive conditions, and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) methods of signal processing were used to obtain AE signal characteristics from the beginning to various stages of corrosion, providing an experimental basis for online AE measurement and qualitative assessment of large atmospheric tanks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",,"Corrosion; Electrolytic cleaning; Floors; Magnetic leakage; Mathematical transformations; Nondestructive examination; Signal processing; Soil moisture; Tanks (containers); Corrosive conditions; Electrolytic hydrogen charging; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Magnetic flux leakage; Manufacturing process; Nondestructive methods; Qualitative assessments; Tank bottom corrosions; Acoustic emission testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019721541

Energy storage system smoothens the stochastic nature of renewable energy, allows for increased access to renewable energy in remote areas, increase the reliability of micro-grids, plays a major role in the development of hybrid vehicles and serves as energy conservation system in green buildings. The need for increased access to reliable and sustainable energy in developing countries requires more deployment of energy storage technologies, particular, battery technologies. This study provides a review of the technical characteristics and costs comparison of various battery technologies. A single battery technology may not meet all the specification of a system and a wrong application will reduce the potentially derivable value.

FLEX builds on earlier safety steps by providing an effective and efficient way to make U.S. nuclear energy facilities even safer, by addressing nuclear regulatory commission (NRC) recommendations. These recommendations include systems such as additional layers of backup power by generators, battery packs, pumps, and air compressors in multiple on-site and off-site locations, to be available if all plant backup equipment is insufficient. A 21,000 gallon frac tank will supply backup water storage to reactors at a Nuclear Power Plant during a beyond design basis event. This paper presents methodology for seismic structural analysis of the frac tank for two times the operating basis earthquake (OBE) and safe shutdown earthquake (SSE) response spectra including the Lindley-Yow method of analysis to properly account for the rigid response component. We performed fluid-structure interaction analysis using the computer program NASTRAN. Multiple tank fill conditions were considered, and evaluation was performed to ensure all component stresses were below allowable values per ANSI/AISC N690-12 and 350-10. The tank was evaluated for global stability using nonlinear sliding and overturning provisions of Appendix A of ASCE 43-05. © ASCE.",,"Earthquake engineering; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Plant shutdowns; Seismic design; Seismology; Tanks (containers); Fluid structure interaction analysis; Fukushima dai-ichi nuclear power plants; Method of analysis; Nuclear energy facilities; Nuclear energy industries; Nuclear regulatory commission; Operating basis earthquakes; Response spectra; Fluid structure interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018412780

In rhoCentralFoam, the central-upwind scheme of Kurganov and Tadmor (Kurganov-Tadmor scheme) is applied to capture the flow discontinuity, whose dissipation is too strong to resolve turbulence under finite resolution. The low-dissipation solver adopts a new hybrid scheme, which combines the dissipative Kurganov-Tadmor scheme with the nondissipative central scheme through the shock sensor, where the dissipative scheme is used to capture the flow discontinuity near shock wave and the central scheme is used to resolve the turbulence structure in the smooth flow area. In the framework of unstructured mesh algorithm, the central scheme is extended from linear order to forth order, which greatly reduces the dispersion error and weakens the oscillations near flow discontinuity. To keep the numerical stability of the central scheme, we adopt the skew-symmetric form of the convective term, which could be able to preserve the local kinetic energy and help keep the self-stability of central scheme without adding an explicit dissipative term. In addition, a low-storage TVD Runge-Kutta method for third order temporal discretization is newly implemented in the low-dissipation solver to make the time marching in order to meet the requirement of large eddy simulation. A series of benchmark problems, such as Sod shock tube test, Shu-Osher problem, Green-Taylor vortex evolution, and wall-bounded turbulence generation based on synthetic eddy method, are computed and compared to examine the low-dissipation solver’s ability of capturing flow discontinuity as well as resolving turbulence structure. The accuracy and stability of the low-dissipation solver are further validated against experimental data when the supersonic airstream flows past the flame holder structure in the scramjet model. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, cooling using reversible air conditioners systems pollutes the environment and consumes a significant amount of energy. With global warming that experiences our environment, the large consumption of electrical energy and the operating instructions for reversible air conditioners, there is a need to find alternatives to those cooling systems. Hence this research project aims to investigate an air storage system, a microsystem reversible ventilation system using natural atmospheric air (renewable energy) for cooling at low consumption of energy.
