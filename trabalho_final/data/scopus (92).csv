Capturing variable renewable power requires the use of energy storage to shift generation and load demand. The integration of plug-in electric vehicles, however, impacts the load demand profile and therefore the capacity of energy storage required to meet renewable utilization targets. This study examines how the intelligence of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) integration impacts the required capacity of energy storage systems to meet renewable utilization targets for a large-scale energy system, using California as an example for meeting a 50% and 80% renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in 2030 and 2050. For an 80% RPS in 2050, immediate charging of PEVs requires the installation of an aggregate energy storage system with a power capacity of 60% of the installed renewable capacity and an energy capacity of 2.3% of annual renewable generation. With smart charging of PEVs, required power capacity drops to 16% and required energy capacity drops to 0.6%, and with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging, non-vehicle energy storage systems are no longer required. Overall, this study highlights the importance of intelligent PEV charging for minimizing the scale of infrastructure required to meet renewable utilization targets. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Battery electric vehicle; Energy storage; Renewable energy; Smart charging; Vehicle-to-grid","Battery electric vehicles; Crashworthiness; Drops; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy resources; Energy storage; Plug-in electric vehicles; Reinforcement; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Vehicles; Electric vehicle charging; Energy storage systems; Environmental concerns; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); Renewable energies; Renewable portfolio standard; Smart charging; Vehicle to grids; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992163042

Yet the capacity decay due to permeation of vanadium and water makes their commercialization very difficult. Inspired by the forward osmosis (FO) mechanism, the VRFBNM battery capacity decrease was alleviated by adding a soluble draw solute (e.g., 2-methylimidazole) into the catholyte, which can counterbalance the osmotic pressure between the positive and negative half-cell. No change of the electrolyte volume has been observed after VRFBNM being operated for 55 h, revealing that the permeation of water and vanadium ions was effectively limited. Consequently, the Coulombic efficiency (CE) of nanoporous TiO2 vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) was enhanced from 93.5% to 95.3%, meanwhile, its capacity decay was significantly suppressed from 60.7% to 27.5% upon the addition of soluble draw solute. Moreover, the energy capacity of the VRFBNM was noticeably improved from 297.0 to 406.4 mAh remarkably. These results indicate balancing the osmotic pressure via the addition of draw solute can restrict pressure-dependent vanadium permeation and it can be established as a promising method for up-scaling VRFBNM application. © 2016 American Chemical Society","2-methylimidazole; capacity decay; osmotic pressure; vanadium redox flow batteries; water transfer","Electric batteries; Electrolytes; Osmosis; Permeation; Vanadium; 2-methylimidazole; Capacity decay; Coulombic efficiency; Nanoporous membrane; Permeation of waters; Pressure dependent; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Water transfers; Flow batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007569754

For successfully operating the chemical looping, the cyclic material must meet a variety of criteria, such as high dispersion of the cyclic phase on the support, large external surface area, and small crystallite size, etc. in attempt to better activity and stability. In this paper, we applied a colloidal crystal templated sol–gel synthesis route to produce materials for chemical looping with hydrogen storage. To understand the role of template in the sol–gel process, two samples prepared with or without template were investigated by various characterization techniques. The results showed the template could not only promote the homogeneity of the metallic precursors, but also efficiently control the material morphology. The resulting high dispersion and confinement effects endowed this material better activity and stability in chemical looping multicycles. Our current experiments demonstrated this strategy can be used as a platform for convenient incorporation of a variety of structural features, and we anticipated it can be extended to synthesis more chemical looping materials. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Chemical looping; Hydrogen storage; Iron oxides; Sol–gel","Carbon dioxide; Characterization; Chemical stability; Colloids; Crystallite size; Energy conversion; Hydrogen storage; Iron oxides; Sols; Stability criteria; Storage (materials); Characterization techniques; Chemical looping; Colloidal crystals; Confinement effects; External surfaces; Metallic precursor; Nano-structured Fe; Structural feature; Dispersions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003944995

Starting from pentadiene C5H8 and pure A5H8 (A = B, Al, and Ga) clusters we energetically analyzed C replacement by A (so called metalation) in pentadiene and A replacement C (so called carbonation) in the A5H8 clusters. Moreover, since the release of industrial carbon dioxide is an increasing threat to the environment, compounds which capture and treat CO2 are urgently needed now. However, CO2 treatment and capture requires an energy cost that must be considered in any economic assessment. The CO2 reduction to Methanol CH3OH, widely studied seems to be the perfect way for its recycling but it is not energetically free. That is, the reaction needs to be activated by heating for example. Atomic hydrogen involved in this process also requires an energy input to be produced from natural hydrogen which is in molecular form (H2). Taking all these processes into account, the pure hydrogenated A5H8 cluster composed of group 13 elements seems to be favored for low CO2 release. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Clusters of group 13 elements; CO2 emission; Combustion; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation","Carbon; Chemical elements; Combustion; Gallium alloys; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Atomic hydrogen; Ecological property; Economic assessments; Energetic analysis; Energy productions; Group 13 elements; Natural hydrogen; Oxidation process; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003944836

Nanoporous carbons (NPCs) have recently emerged as a class of electrode materials with the potential to dramatically improve the capacitance of these devices by leveraging ion confinement. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such enhancements are a clear departure from EDL theory and remain an open question. In this paper, we present the concept of ion reorganization kinetics during charge/discharge cycles, especially within highly confining subnanometer pores, which necessarily dictates the capacitance. Our molecular dynamics voltammetric simulations of ionic liquid immersed in NPC electrodes (of varying pore size distributions) demonstrate that the most efficient ion migration, and thereby largest capacitance, is facilitated by nonuniformity of shape (e.g., from cylindrical to slitlike) along nanopore channels. On the basis of this understanding, we propose that a new structural descriptor, coined as the pore shape factor, can provide a new avenue for materials optimization. These findings also present a framework to understand and evaluate ion migration kinetics within charged nanoporous materials. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","constant potential; ion migration kinetics; ionic liquid; molecular dynamics; pore size factor; subnanometer confinement","Amorphous materials; Capacitance; Capacitor storage; Carbon; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Ionic liquids; Ions; Kinetics; Molecular dynamics; Pore size; Porous materials; Charge/discharge cycle; Constant Potential; Electric double layer; Electrochemical double-layer capacitors; High power energy storage devices; Ion migration; Sub nanometers; Voltammetric simulations; Nanopores",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006952941

To date, conventional methods, such as tuning absorption and emission bands based on electron or resonance energy transfer mechanisms in well-known organic photochromic molecules or compounds, have routinely been adopted to tune luminescent switching behavior. However, these strategies and mechanisms are not effectively applied to luminescence switching in inorganic materials because their crystal structures differ strongly from those of organic materials. In this paper, we report a new method to significantly tune the luminescent switching contrast by modifying the excitation energy of luminescent centers in a newly synthesized photochromism material: Na0.5Bi4.5Ti4O15:Re (Re = Sm, Pr, Er). A significant enhancement of luminescence switching contrast was achieved when the luminescent centers were excited by low energy photons at a given irradiation wavelength, intensity, and time, compared with high excitation energy photons. The trend ""the lower the excitation energy, the higher the luminescence switching contrast"" is universal in different rare earth ion-doped Na0.5Bi4.5Ti4O15 ferroelectrics. The changes in the luminescent switching contrast based on excitation energy are ascribed to nonradiative energy transfer from the luminescent center to the color center by dipole-dipole interactions according to Dexter theory. This possible utilization of excitation energy at lower energy levels is usually less destructive to both information recording and the recording material itself during luminescent readout processes while achieving higher luminescence switching contrast. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","luminescent readout; luminescent switching contrast; nonradiative energy transfer; optical data storage; photochromism","Chromogenics; Color centers; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Energy transfer; Erbium; Excitation energy; Light; Metal ions; Optical data storage; Optical switches; Photochromism; Photons; Switching; Virtual storage; Absorption and emissions; Dipole dipole interactions; High density optical data storage; luminescent readout; Nonradiative energy transfer; Photo-chromic materials; Resonance energy transfer; Switching contrast; Luminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006900827

Although it has been well-known that the Na-ions can be co-intercalated in graphite in some ether-based electrolytes, a number of important questions related to the Na-ion intercalation remain unclear. In order to better understand the sodium intercalation in graphite, Na-ions were intercalated in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) by immersing the latter in a sodium-biphenyl-monoglyme (Na-BP-DME) solution. The staging behavior that often occurs during Li-ion intercalation in graphite was observed in the Na-intercalated HOPG, on the basis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization. The chemical formula of the DME-Na co-intercalated HOPG was determined to be Na(DME)2C26 by a combination of Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and the above structural characterizing techniques. The negligible impact of co-intercalation on the structural integrity of HOPG demonstrates that HOPG can be a promising anode material of the Na-ion batteries. The lower coordination number between the Na+ ions and DME and the interaction between DME and the graphite layers are believed to be responsible for the structural stability of the co-intercalated graphite. Finally the chemical stability of the ternary graphite intercalation compounds in air was evaluated. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","chemical sodiation; co-intercalation; graphite intercalation compounds; solvated","Anodes; Chemical compounds; Chemical stability; Electric batteries; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Graphite; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Intercalation compounds; Ions; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal ions; Scanning electron microscopy; Stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Cobalt compounds; Co-intercalation; Coordination number; Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite; Intercalated graphite; Scanning transmission electron microscopy; solvated; Stationary energy storages; Structural stabilities; Solvated; Intercalation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027938769

However, they are still limited by low mass loading and poor areal capacitance during charge-discharge process. Here, freestanding conductive film is designed and prepared by PPY/bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibers in combination with graphene (RGO) through a simple in situ polymerization and filtering method. The porous and flexible BC nanofiber is used as a substrate and template for successive polymerization of PPY, which is responsible for such a large areal mass of 13.5 mg cm−2. Thus, the high areal capacitance of 3.66 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and 2.59 F cm−2 at 50 mA cm−2 are achieved. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor by coupling of two freestanding electrodes delivers high areal capacitance of 1.67 F cm−2, high areal energy density of 0.23 mWh cm−2 and a maximum power density of 23.5 mW cm−2.

The EV fleet is described by an aggregate battery model, which is parameterised by using recorded driving cycle data of a delivery vehicle fleet. The EV fleet model is used within the inner level of the bi-level optimisation framework, where the aggregate charging power is optimised by using the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. At the superimposed optimisation level, the final State-of-Charge (SoC) values of individual EVs being disconnected from the grid are optimised by using a multi-objective genetic algorithm-based optimisation. In each iteration of the bi-level optimisation algorithm, it is generally needed to recalculate the transport demand sub-model for the new set of final SoC values. In order to simplify this process, the transport demand is modelled by using a computationally efficient response surface method, which is based on naturalistic synthetic driving cycles and agent-based simulations of the EV model. When compared to the single-level charging optimisation approach, which assumes the final SoC values to be equal to 1 (full batteries on departure), the bi-level optimisation provides a degree of optimisation freedom more for more accurate techno-economic analyses of the integrated transport-energy system. The two approaches are compared through a simulation study of the particular delivery vehicle fleet transport-energy system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Aggregate battery; Charging optimisation; Dynamic programming; Electric vehicle fleet; Genetic algorithm; Modelling","Aggregates; Algorithms; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Dynamic programming; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Electric vehicles; Genetic algorithms; Iterative methods; Models; Optimization; Secondary batteries; Vehicles; Agent based simulation; Computationally efficient; Dynamic programming algorithm; Integrated transport; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Optimisations; Response surface method; Techno-Economic analysis; Fleet operations; economic analysis; electric vehicle; energy use; genetic algorithm; optimization; storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998890725

Detailed numerical simulations were performed to investigate the different local heat generation rates and the temperature as functions of time and cycling current. Numerical predictions showed good qualitative agreement with the limited experimental data available in the literature. Such numerical simulations can be used to physically interpret experimental measurements. Indeed, the present results suggest that a distinctive endothermic peak observed in the experimental heat generation rate resulted from cation starvation in the electrolyte reducing the faradaic current density. In addition, heating due to EDL formation significantly affected the local temperature and must be accounted for.

Pumped hydro storage (PHS) and electric boilers (EBs) are two of the strongest technological options under discussion in China to address this challenge, but rigorous quantitative analyses of their effectiveness rooted in actual system data are lacking. An improved unit-commitment based power system chronological simulation is applied to evaluate potential benefits from PHS and EBs in West Inner Mongolia (WIM), where CHP capacity is projected to increase to 33.8 GW by 2020. A business-as-usual (BAU) reference model assumes deployment of 20 GW of wind capacity. Compared to BAU, expanding wind capacity to 40 GW would allow for a reduction in CO2 emissions of 33.9 million tons, but at a relatively high cost of US$25.3/ton, reflecting primarily high associated curtailment of wind electricity (20.4%). A number of scenarios adding PHS and/or EBs combined with higher levels of wind capacity are evaluated. The best case indicates that a combination of PHS (3.6 GW) and EBs (6.2 GW) together with 40 GW of wind capacity would reduce CO2 emissions by 43.5 million tons compared to BAU and at a lower cost of US$16.0/ton. Achieving this outcome will require a price-incentive policy designed to ensure the profitability of both PHS and EB facilities. © 2015 The Authors","CO2 emission; Combined heat and power generation; Electric boiler; Pumped hydro storage; Wind power","Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power systems; Wind power; Business-as-usual; CO2 emissions; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power generation; Critical challenges; Potential benefits; Reference modeling; Wind electricity; Cost reduction; alternative energy; carbon emission; combined heat and power; economic analysis; electricity generation; equipment; heating; hydroelectric power; pump; storage; technological development; wind power; China; Nei Monggol; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962894037

The study presented here considers all energy carriers, however, only the electricity carrier is modeled in detail, with notion taken for the heating demand that is covered but without proper modeling of storage. A proposed two-level approach with multi-objective optimization on the global level, was used to design a Croatian Energy System (CES), where electric vehicles (EVs) are integrated to serve as battery storage in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) mode, for a scenario between 2015 and 2050. In addition, case study includes nine aggregated hydro power plants, one for each river basin in Croatia. Also, case study includes solar and wind power plants modeled for six locations in Croatia: Osijek, Zagreb, Rijeka, Sibenik, Split and Dubrovnik. The resulting Pareto front suggests that with assumed future costs of fuels and technology certain level of conventional energy sources will have to remain in the energy system to take into the account unfavourable weather conditions and to cover heating demand, which also results in significantly lower load factors for those power plants. Also, variants with more RES share have lower total energy system load factor and significantly higher installed capacity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Long-term design of energy system; Multi-objective optimization; Renewable energy sources; Vehicle to grid","Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Hydroelectric power plants; Multiobjective optimization; Natural resources; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Wind power; Conventional energy sources; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy systems; Installed capacity; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Two-level approach; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Electric power system planning; design; electric vehicle; electricity generation; energy planning; heating; long-term change; optimization; power plant; renewable resource; river basin; smart grid; wind power; Croatia; Dubrovnik; Osijek; Rijeka; Sibenik; Split; Zagreb",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962023334

To address this problem, a novel asymmetrical supercapacitor (ASC) of battery-type MnCo2O4 nanofibers (NFs)//N-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogel (N-rGOAE) was fabricated in this work. The MnCo2O4 NFs at the positive electrode store the negative charges, i.e., solvated OH-, while the N-rGOAE at the negative electrode stores the positive charges, i.e., solvated K+. An as-fabricated aqueous-based MnCo2O4//N-rGOAE ASC device can provide a wide operating potential of 1.8 V and high energy density and power density at 54 W h kg-1 and 9851 W kg-1, respectively, with 85.2% capacity retention over 3000 cycles. To understand the charge storage reaction mechanism of the MnCo2O4, the synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) technique was also used to determine the oxidation states of Co and Mn at the MnCo2O4 electrode after being electrochemically tested. The oxidation number of Co is oxidized from +2.76 to +2.85 after charging and reduced back to +2.75 after discharging. On the other hand, the oxidation state of Mn is reduced from +3.62 to +3.44 after charging and oxidized to +3.58 after discharging. Understanding in the oxidation states of Co and Mn at the MnCo2O4 electrode here leads to the awareness of the uncertain charge storage mechanism of the spinel-type oxide materials.

Here, nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber networks/reduced graphene oxide/bacterial cellulose (N-CNFs/RGO/BC) freestanding paper is first designed as a high-performance, mechanically tough, and bendable electrode for a supercapacitor. The BC is exploited as both a supporting substrate for a large mass loading of 8 mg cm-2 and a biomass precursor for N-CNFs by pyrolysis. The one-step carbonization treatment not only fabricates the nitrogen-doped three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured carbon composite materials but also forms the reduction of the GO sheets at the same time. The fabricated paper electrode exhibits an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 2106 mF cm-2 (263 F g-1) in a KOH electrolyte and 2544 mF cm-2 (318 F g-1) in a H2SO4 electrolyte, exceptional cycling stability (∼100% retention after 20000 cycles), and excellent tensile strength (40.7 MPa). The symmetric supercapacitor shows a high areal capacitance (810 mF cm-2 in KOH and 920 mF cm-2 in H2SO4) and thus delivers a high energy density (0.11 mWh cm-2 in KOH and 0.29 mWh cm-2 in H2SO4) and a maximum power density (27 mW cm-2 in KOH and 37.5 mW cm-2 in H2SO4).

One typical approach to improve cycling stability of the LDH-derived TMOs is to introduce one- and two-dimensional conductive carbonaceous supports, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. We herein demonstrate an effective approach to improve the electrochemical performances of well-dispersed biactive NiCo2S4/Ni0.96S as anode nanomaterials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), by introducing a three-dimensional graphene aerogel (3DGA) support. The resultant 3DGA supported NiCo2S4/Ni0.96S (3DGA/NCS) composite, obtained by sulfuration of NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) precursor in situ grown on the 3DGA support (3DGA/NiCo-LDH). Electrochemical tests show that the 3DGA/NCS composite indeed delivers the greatly enhanced electrochemical performances compared with the NiCo2S4/Ni0.96S counterpart on two-dimensional graphene aerogel, i.e., a high reversible capacity of 965 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1 and especially a superlong cycling stability of 620 mA h g-1 after 800 cycles at 1 A g-1. The enhancements could be ascribed to the compositional and structural advantages of boosting electrochemical performances: (i) well-dispersed NiCo2S4/Ni0.96S nanoparticles with interfacial nanodomains resulting from both the dual surface confinements of the 3DGA support and the crystallographic confinement of NiCo-well-arranged LDH crystalline layer, (ii) an appropriate specific surface area and a wide pore size distribution of mesopores and macropores, and (iii) highly conductive 3DGA support that is measured experimentally by using electrochemical impedance spectra to underlie the enhancement. Our results demonstrate that the tunable LDH precursor-derived synthesis route may be extended to prepare various transition metal sulfides and even transition metal phosphides for energy storage with the aid of tunable cationic type and molar ratio. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","graphene aerogel; layered double hydroxide precursor; lithium-ion batteries; transition metal sulfide; triple confinement effects","Aerogels; Carbon; Energy storage; Graphene; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Metals; Phosphorus compounds; Pore size; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Yarn; Confinement effects; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical impedance spectra; Electrochemical performance; Graphene aerogels; Hydrotalcite-like anionic clays; Layered double hydroxides; Transition metal sulfides; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003009923

The as-prepared HEBLCs possess unique egg-box-like frameworks, high surface area, and interconnected porosity as well as the doping of heteroatoms (oxygen and nitrogen), endowing its excellent electrochemical performances (superior capacity, high rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability). Therefore, the resultant HEBLC manifests a maximum specific capacitance of 355 F g-1 at current density of 0.5 A g-1 and remarkable rate performance. Moreover, 95% of capacitance retention of HEBLCs can be also achieved after 20 000 charge-discharge cycles at an extremely high current density (20 A g-1), indicating a prominent cycling stability.

The present work discusses the possibility of generating solar hydrogen in southern Algeria. This region is among the areas with an average annual considerable Solar Energy in the world. The hydrogen has been produced with experimentation by electrolysis of water; the dissociation water energy is supplied by a photovoltaic module. The average production per square meter of solar panel is studied with both Seasonal factors and geographical areas, which is gives a very important hydrogen production especially in the south. The purpose of this work is to store the hydrogen as energy in the long term. Indeed, the hydrogen can be stored as gas material without significant loss regardless of the duration of storage, and then converted into electricity in a fuel cell (FC). This system, known as Solar-Hydrogen or PV -Hydrogen has many advantages such as, no moving parts, the electrolyzer and the fuel cell will produce without noise.

The wind generator used is based on a double fed induction generator (DFIG) where the stator is linked directly with the network and the rotor is connected to the network through the power converter. The flywheel energy storage system (FESS) based on a flywheel, an induction machine (IM) and an electronic power converter is associated with the wind generator via the DC bus. The two converters side DFIG and the (FESS) are controlled by the DTC. The three-level converter side electricity grid which ensures constant DC bus voltage is controlled by the DPC, in order to mitigate the wave quality problems. In the literature, this control strategy has been frequently used for the two levels converter.

The energy storage system by using battery–supercapacitor combination is an interesting solution. However, batteries have a high energy storage ratio but are limited in the power. In the other hand, supercapacitors can provide high levels of power while they have a much lower energy storage ratio. Moreover, the SC can act as a buffer against large magnitudes and rapid fluctuations in power. In this paper, supercapacitors are used to reduce stresses on batteries and improve their life cycle. In this context, the performance of the RMS current gain in battery, the gain in energy losses, the total energy efficiency and the elimination rate of surge load power are explored, in different operating state conditions. These parameters are also investigated versus the SCs cost.

Based on the given configuration and the different characteristics of the main components in the micro-grid, an overall control and a power management strategy are proposed for this system. This strategy consists in charging the BBs and producing hydrogen from the water electrolyzer in the case of excess power from the WT-DFIGs and PV generators. Therefore, the FC and the BBs will be used as a backup generator to supply the demand required power, when the WT-DFIGs and the PV energy are deficient.

In this study, a low-cost biological waste-stiff silkworm was first used as precursor for the synthesis of well-developed microporous carbon (SSMC) material by simple steps of carbonization and further activation. The SSMC was endowed with ultra-high SSA (2523 m2 g−1), large pore volume (1.37 m3 g−1), and high content of heteroatom functionalities (∼3.5 at% N and ∼5.1 at% O).

Uniform NiO formation on the metallized TMV nanoscaffolds is characterized by XPS and STEM-EELS analysis and the electrochemical performance was characterized in 2 M KOH solution.

The subsequent compressed NG/CNT-OH papers possess high electrical conductivity and good flexibility, thus generating high-performance flexible counter electrodes (CEs) with transparent conducting oxide free (TCO-free) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The flexible NG/CNT-OH electrodes show good stability and the DSSCs with the optimized NG/CNT-OH CE had higher short-circuit current density (13.62 mA cm−2) and cell efficiency (6.36%) than DSSCs using Pt CE, whereas those of the DSSCs using Pt CE were only 12.81 mA cm−2 and 5.74%, respectively.

In this paper we introduce the concept of an energy storage based on adiabatic compressed air energy storage (A-CAES) combined with packed bed thermal energy storage (PBTES) system. First, the system thermodynamic performance of a typical single cycle is discussed and the effect of PBTES heights is analyzed. The results show that an overall efficiency in excess of 49% is achievable and the PBTES heights have significant influence on the thermal behavior of PBTES, as well as the overall efficiencies. Because there is still heat energy remaining in the packed bed until the discharge process is terminated, an improved A-CAES system with a heat recuperator is further proposed. It is found that this improved system shows a promotion of ∼5% compared with the first present A-CAES system. The cycle efficiency of the improved system increases with the increase of continuous cycles, and then reaches a stable value of 56.74% after around 25 cycles.

However, significant amount of hydrogen is required in the DCL process due to the low H/C ratio in coal. As a result, DCL processes are usually associated with a high level CO2 emission from hydrogen production units. Hence, direct coal biomass to liquids (CBTL) processes with CO2 capture and storage (CCS) and shale gas utilization are proposed in this work as an option for reducing CO2 emission. In this study, the focus is on process simulation and calculation of material and energy balances of novel direct CBTL plants, which can be used as a basis for further studies, such as optimization, techno-economic analysis and life-cycle analysis. In this process, coal with moderate amount of biomass is converted into syncrude through reaction with H-donor solvent and gaseous hydrogen in a catalytic two-stage liquefaction unit. Hydrogen required for the liquefaction and product upgrading unit is produced from the liquefaction residue partial oxidation unit and the shale gas steam reforming unit or from the coal/biomass/residue co-gasification unit. Different CCS technologies are evaluated to achieve 90% overall carbon capture if high extent of CO2 capture is considered. Results of individual plant sections are validated with the existing data, if available. Sensitivity studies have been conducted to analyze the effects of key operating parameters and design parameters, such as the sources of hydrogen, CCS technologies, extent of CCS, and biomass/coal ratio.

In particular, molten alkali nitrates are being used as heat transfer/storage fluids in concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies. These kind of technologies operate in ranges of temperature for which molten salts are particularly adequate, due to its main characteristics: stability at high temperatures, low vapor pressure, liquid state in a large range of temperatures, ability to dissolve many inorganic and organic compounds, viscosity generally low (as ions are mutually independent) and high heat capacity per unit volume. For the proper design and dimensioning of heat exchangers and other ancillary equipment's it is decisive to have accurate data for the thermophysical properties of the employed fluids. This paper reviews the available data for the relevant properties that are important to a salt system for storage and heat transfer applications. Those are the melting point, density, viscosity, heat capacity and thermal conductivity. The chosen fluids were the pure molten lithium, sodium and potassium nitrates and relevant mixtures, like the solar salt (NaNO3/KNO3: 60/40), HITEC® (a ternary mixture of NaNO3, KNO3 and NaNO2) and some new quaternary mixtures. Review reveals that there are still large discrepancies between different sets of data for the same salt systems and that it is impossible currently to recommend reference data/measuring methods that can guide the reader for a selection of the best systems. The impact of that and the potential applications are briefly discussed. The reviewed fluids have great potential for actual and future applications in renewable processes for energy storage and transformation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Alkali nitrates; Concentrated solar power; Energy storage; Molten salts; Thermophysical properties","Catalytic oxidation; Coal storage; Energy storage; Fused salts; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Heat transfer; High temperature applications; Mixtures; Nitrates; Potash; Potassium Nitrate; Sodium nitrate; Solar energy; Specific heat; Thermal conductivity; Thermodynamic properties; Viscosity; Alkali nitrates; Concentrated solar power; Future applications; Heat transfer applications; Molten salt; Molten salt oxidation; Mutually independents; Sensible heat storages; Digital storage; alkalinity; energy conservation; fluid; high temperature; nitrate (inorganic salt); physical property; renewable resource; solar power; technological change; thermal conductivity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990217101

Increasing renewable energy penetration depends on both technical and economic factors. Distribution system consumers can contribute to grid stability by controlling residential electrical device power consumed by water heaters and battery storage systems. Coupled with dynamic supply pricing strategies, a comprehensive system for demand response (DR) exist. Proper DR management will allow greater integration of renewable energy sources partially replacing energy demand currently met by the combustion of fossil-fuels. An enticing economic framework providing increased value to consumers compensates them for reduced control of devices placed under a DR aggregator. Much work has already been done to develop more effective ways to implement DR control systems. Utilizing an integrated approach that combines consumer requirements into aggregate pools, and provides a dynamic response to market and grid conditions, we have developed a mathematical model that can quantify control parameters for optimum demand response and decide which resources to switch and when. In this model, optimization is achieved as a function of cost savings vs. customer comfort using mathematical market analysis. Two market modeling approaches—the Cournot and SFE—are presented and compared. A quadratic function is used for presenting the cost function of each DRA (Demand Response Aggregator) which will be used for settling down the DR market. Contribution of each aggregator and the final price are presented. Finally, we have also performed sensitivity analysis on the house cost function's coefficients for one of the aggregators. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response market; Demand response scheduling","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Cost functions; Costs; Electric power system stability; Fossil fuels; Heating; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Sensitivity analysis; Battery storage system; Comprehensive system; Demand response; Demand response scheduling; Distribution systems; Integration of renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy penetrations; Electric power system control; demand analysis; distribution system; fossil fuel; market system; numerical model; optimization; pricing policy; quality control; renewable resource; savings; supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989913614

For a typical medium-size gas field, the recoverable geothermal energy can be equivalent to over 10 million tons of standard coal. The injection of CO2 can improve the heat mining rate, and it can also enhance gas recovery at the early stage of the process and achieve geological storage of CO2. However, a big concern in the injection of CO2 is the salt precipitation induced by the interactions between the injected CO2 and the formation water, which might cause reservoir damage and subsequently affect the flow behavior and the heat mining rate. In this paper, a comprehensive model of geothermal exploitation from gas reservoirs via CO2 injection was established, in which the processes of formation water evaporation, salt dissolution and precipitation, and their effects on formation porosity and permeability were incorporated. The influences of various parameters on geothermal recovery and salt precipitation were investigated by using this model, including the saturation and salinity of formation waters, injection-production pressure difference, and the permeability and porosity of the gas reservoirs. The results show that, for the gas reservoir studied at a temperature of 130 °C (i.e. with a volume of 1000 m × 500 m × 50 m), the heat mining rate of one injector-producer pair can be maintained at about 5 MW with a CO2 recycling rate of 3000 t/day for 30 years. The effect of salt precipitation is moderate, and it is dependent on the reservoir conditions. Especially, salt precipitation occurs severely in the near well region when the remaining water saturation is higher than the irreducible water saturation. Meanwhile, water evaporation induced by CO2 injection may cause a back flow of formation water due to the effects of gravity and capillarity, which can intensify the evaporation and increase the salt precipitation and enrichment in the region. This can cause a reduction of permeability which therefore decreases the heat mining rate. Different methods for reducing salt precipitation was proposed and evaluated accordingly, including injection of low salinity water prior to CO2 injection and co-injection of CO2 and fresh water. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Back flow of formation water; Depleted gas reservoir; Geothermal exploitation; Supercritical CO2; Water evaporation and salt precipitation","Carbon dioxide; Evaporation; Gas industry; Gases; Geothermal energy; Mechanical permeability; Natural gas; Natural gas fields; Natural gas well production; Natural gas wells; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Porosity; Precipitation (chemical); Recycling; Water injection; Depleted gas reservoir; Formation water; Geothermal exploitation; Salt precipitation; Supercritical CO; Water recycling; carbon dioxide; crustal recycling; dissolution; formation water; gas production; geothermal energy; high temperature; natural gas; precipitation (chemistry); reservoir; salt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988369302

In this study, adding nanomaterial to enhance paraffin's low thermal conductivity and its performance parameters is examined. Three cases have been investigated and compared to each others, case 1 without PW, case 2 with PW, and case 3 with copper-PW nanocomposite (NCPW). The results showed apparent advantage of nanocomposite on thermal conductivity of PW and that enhanced the heat energy storage and water productivity. The productivity increased by about 125% and 119% for cases 3 and 2, respectively, compared to case 1.

Ideally, the 3D geometry maximizes the volume of active material per unit area, while keeping its thickness small to allow for fast Li diffusion. In this paper, we describe experimental testing and simulation of 3D SSLIBs fabricated using materials and thin-film deposition methods compatible with semiconductor device processing. These 3D SSLIBs consist of Si microcolumns onto which the battery layers are sequentially deposited using physical vapor deposition. The power performance of the 3D SSLIBs lags significantly behind that of similarly prepared planar SSLIBs. Analysis of the experimental results using finite element modeling indicates that the origin of the poor power performance is the structural inhomogeneity of the 3D SSLIB, coupled with low electrolyte ionic conductivity and diffusion rate in the cathode, which lead to highly nonuniform internal current density distribution and poor cathode utilization. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","experiment and modeling; inhomogeneity; solid-state battery; thin film; three-dimensional","Cathodes; Deposition; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Finite element method; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Materials testing; Physical vapor deposition; Semiconductor device testing; Semiconductor devices; Solid electrolytes; Solid state devices; Thin films; Three dimensional computer graphics; Vapor deposition; Current density distribution; Energy-density storage; Experimental testing; Inhomogeneities; Power performance; Solid state batteries; Structural inhomogeneities; Thin-film depositions; Thin film lithium ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999808833

Thermochemical energy storage based on metal hydrides represents a very appealing prospect for low cost and high efficient solar storage systems. The objective of the paper is to assess the properties required by the metal hydride systems to achieve the U.S. Department of Energy's SunShot techno-economic targets. A simplified model has been developed to evaluate the cost and the exergetic efficiency of hydride-based storage systems. Results demonstrate that metal hydride materials, operating at temperatures higher than 650 °C, with reaction enthalpy on the order of 95–110 kJ/molH2, raw material cost on the order of 1.4–2 $/kg, weight capacities on the order of 3–4% and operating pressures on the order of tens of bars have the potential to closely approach the targets. Selected sensitivity analyses have also been carried out showing that the raw material cost, the material weight capacity and the metal hydride reaction enthalpy are the properties that strongly affect the performance of the storage system. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Concentrating solar power plants; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydride materials; Techno-economic analysis; Thermal energy storage","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Data storage equipment; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power plants; Energy storage; Enthalpy; Heat storage; Hydrogen storage; Metals; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Concentrating solar power plant; Exergetic efficiency; Metal hydride systems; Metal hydrides; Techno-Economic analysis; Thermal energy storage systems; Thermochemical energy storage; U.S. Department of Energy; Hydrides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995633313

However, seldom work has investigated impact of graphene size on its energy storage performance. In this work we have tailored size of graphene oxide from micrometers to tens of nanometers via sonochemical approach. The converted graphene by thermal annealing graphene oxides of different size have been used as electrode materials for constructing supercapacitor with electrolyte of ionic liquid. Electrochemical analysis indicates that there is no obviously positively correlation between energy storage performance and structure characters (specific surface area and electrochemical active edge sites) of graphene, which is contrary to our common knowledge. Based on structure and electrochemical analysis of graphene electrodes, we proposed that reducing the size of graphene results in low edge activity of it for the disrupted aromatic structure on the edges with enriched sp3-carbon defects, where electrical charge is hard to transfer to and through. The practical available area for double layer capacitance setup does not include these electrical charge inaccessible edge regions if the size of graphene is very small. And thus increasing edges of small size graphene has no positive impact on its capacitance enhancement. Furthermore, structure of graphene has shown key influence on equivalent series resistance of bulk electrode.

The challenge for adopting idle elimination on gasoline engine is the high emissions during restart because rich mixtures have to be used at starting. This paper tries to start the engine with pure hydrogen at the restart for gasoline vehicles which adopt idle elimination. The investigation was done based on models built on AVL CRUISE. In the model, the vehicle was run under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The hydrogen used on the vehicle was online produced and stored by an on-board hydrogen production and storage system. The energy for producing hydrogen is taken into account in the total fuel consumption. The simulation results showed that, with the adoption of gasoline start-idle elimination strategy, the vehicle fuel consumption during NEDC was reduced by 0.69 L/100 km, and NOx emissions were decreased by 5.5% compared with the original vehicle without idle elimination. However, HC and CO emissions at the restart were respectively increased by 87.5% and 18.1% for the gasoline vehicle due to the adoption of rich mixtures. Comparatively, with the adoption of hydrogen start-idle elimination strategy, the vehicle fuel consumption during NEDC was reduced by 0.79 L/100 km, HC and CO emissions were decreased by 70.8% and 13.6%, respectively. This shows a good capability of hydrogen combustion on reducing HC and CO emissions at the restart.

In these HSCs, however, the anodes (negative electrodes) are almost carbon-based materials that exhibit limited capacitance, leading to relatively low energy density of the device. Herein, we report a novel dual-ion HSC concept, that is, utilizing anion and cation in the electrolyte, respectively, by the two electrodes for charge storage, to promote the device's performance. Based on this, it is possible to exploit cation-consumed metal oxide as a capacitive anode to couple with a cobalt/nickel oxide cathode. As a demonstration, a 1.8 V MoO2-C/LiOH electrolyte/NiCo2O4 HSC device is established. In such a design, NiCo2O4 cathode and MoO2-C anode react with OH- and Li+, respectively, to store energy.

Development of a supercapacitor capable of simultaneously storing as much energy as a battery, along with providing sufficient power and long cycle stability would be valued for energy storage applications and innovations. Differing from commonly studied reduced graphene oxides, in this work we identified an inexpensive heteroatom polymer (polyaniline-PANI) as a carbon/nitrogen precursor, and applied a controlled thermal treatment at elevated temperature to convert PANI into 3D high-surface-area graphene-sheet-like carbon materials. During the carbonization process, various transition metals including Fe, Co, and Ni were added, which play critical roles in both catalyzing the graphitization and serving as pore forming agents. Factors including post-treatments, heating temperatures, and types of metal were found crucial for achieving enhanced capacitance performance on resulting carbon materials. Using FeCl3 as precursor along with optimal heating temperature 1000 °C and mixed acid treatment (HCl+HNO3), the highest Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1645 m2g-1 was achieved on the mesopore dominant graphene-sheet-like carbon materials. The unique morphologies featured with high-surface areas, dominant mesopores, proper nitrogen doping, and 3D graphene-like structures correspond to remarkably enhanced electrochemical specific capacitance up to 478 Fg-1 in 1.0 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. Furthermore, in a real two-electrode system of a symmetric supercapacitor, a specific capacitance of 235 Fg-1 using Nafion binder is obtained under a current density of 1 Ag-1 by galvanostatic charge-discharge tests in 6.0 M KOH. Long-term cycle stability up to 5000 cycles by using PVDF binder in electrode was systematically evaluated as a function of types of metals and current densities. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","carbonization; graphene-sheet; heteroatom polymers; high-surface-area carbon; supercapacitors","Adsorbents; Binders; Bins; Capacitance; Carbonization; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Hydrophilicity; Nitric acid; Polyaniline; Polymers; Transition metals; Brunauer-emmett-teller surface areas; Energy storage applications; Galvanostatic charge discharges; Graphene sheets; Heteroatoms; High surface area; Optimal heating temperature; Super capacitor; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994762961

Carbon nanomaterials, especially graphene, have been studied as supercapacitor electrodes and can achieve high gravimetric capacities affording high gravimetric energy densities. However, most nanocarbon-based electrodes exhibit a significant decrease in their areal capacitances when scaled to the high mass loadings typically used in commercially available cells (∼10 mg/cm2). One of the reasons for this behavior is that the additional surface area in thick electrodes is not readily accessible by electrolyte ions due to the large tortuosity. Furthermore, the fabrication of such electrodes often involves complicated processes that limit the potential for mass production. Here, holey graphene electrodes for supercapacitors that are scalable in both production and areal capacitance are presented. The lateral surface porosity on the graphene sheets was created using a facile single-step air oxidation method, and the resultant holey graphene was compacted under ambient conditions into mechanically robust monolithic shapes that can be directly used as binder-free electrodes. In comparison, pristine graphene discs under similar binder-free compression molding conditions were extremely brittle and thus not deemed useful for electrode applications. The coin cell supercapacitors, based on these holey graphene electrodes exhibited small variations in gravimetric capacitance over a wide range of areal mass loadings (∼1-30 mg/cm2) at current densities as high as 30 mA/cm2, resulting in the near-linear increase of the areal capacitance (F/cm2) with the mass loading. The prospects of the presented method for facile binder-free ultrathick graphene electrode fabrication are discussed. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","areal capacitance; dry processing; graphene; holey graphene; supercapacitors","Binders; Bins; Capacitance; Carbon; Compression molding; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Graphite electrodes; Lithium compounds; Carbon nano-materials; Commercial applications; Dry processing; Gravimetric capacitance; Gravimetric capacity; Gravimetric energy densities; Super capacitor; Supercapacitor electrodes; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994462372

While many BCP compositions have been developed for these applications, perpendicular orientation of these BCP domains is still very challenging to achieve. Herein we report on a new, integration-friendly approach in which small amounts of a phase-preferential, surface active polymer (SAP) was used as an additive to a polycarbonate-containing BCP formulation to obtain perpendicularly oriented domains with 19 nm natural periodicity upon thermal annealing. In this work, the vertically oriented BCP domains were used to demonstrate next generation patterning applications for advanced semiconductor nodes. Furthermore, these domains were used to demonstrate pattern transfer into a hardmask layer via commonly used etch techniques and graphoepitaxy-based directed self-assembly using existing lithographic integration schemes. We believe that this novel formulation-based approach can easily be extended to other applications beyond nanopatterning. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","aliphatic polycarbonates; block copolymers; directed self-assembly; hexafluoroalcohol; high- χ; surface active polymers; thin film self-assembly","Additives; Electronics packaging; Membrane technology; Polycarbonates; Polymers; Self assembly; Thin films; Aliphatic polycarbonate; Directed self-assembly; Emerging technologies; Film nanostructures; hexafluoroalcohol; Perpendicular orientation; Separation membranes; Surface active; Block copolymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994414405

That may cause some confusions with another paper “The potentials of capacitive deionization regeneration method for absorption air-conditioning system” [Energy Convers. Manage. 114 (2016) 303–311]. The main purpose of the paper “Capacitive deionization regeneration as a possible improvement of membrane regeneration method for absorption air-conditioning system” [Appl. Energy 171 (2016) 405–414] is to derive the original idea of “capacitive deionization regeneration method” in comparison with the emerging membrane regeneration method. The main purpose of the paper “The potentials of capacitive deionization regeneration method for absorption air-conditioning system” [Energy Convers. Manage. 114 (2016) 303–311] is to introduce the theoretical and experimental advancement of the “capacitive deionization regeneration method”. The two papers are deeply related but focus on different phases, and they together present an overview of the new idea. For the integrity of paper, similar parts appeared in the system introduction and other places, which may cause confusion between the papers. To better present the paper, amendments have been made in this corrigendum. Some text, tables and figures have been improved as follows, the major parts of amendments are in bold style: Page 2, “Introduction” section The text at the end of paragraph 1 “To improve, we propose … better performance” should read: “Obviously, the existence of membranes comes to be the bottleneck, is it possible to regenerate the absorbent without membranes? An answer could be the capacitive deionization (CDI) regeneration method. Like ED, CDI is also a desalination technique driven by electrical energy. Differently, it replaces membranes with electrode pairs, which adsorbing the ions from saline water (deionization) when charged and releasing the ions to saline water (regeneration) when uncharged [24–29]. Based on this principle, a CDI regeneration system is presented in this paper, it consists of two CDI units alternating their roles as regenerator and deionizer to get both strong absorbent solution and pure water. Compared with the membrane regeneration method, the CDI has some advantages. First is the regeneration process may have a better performance. With no membranes and under a voltage below 1.23 V [29], it avoids the energy loss from membrane resistance and electrochemical reactions. Second is the CDI method improves efficiency with energy storage strategy. The CDI unit operates like a capacitor storing energy that can be reused during the regeneration process [24–29]. The third is it greatly reduces the cost and improves the convenience of maintenance, also an advantage from no membranes. Theoretical analysis and experimental work are presented in this paper to compare these two methods. In general, the CDI method could be a better successor of the membrane regeneration method.” Page 8, “3.2. Performance analysis of the CDI regeneration based system” section To better compare the two regeneration methods, Table 1 and Fig. 10 should be switched as follows: The text related to Fig. 10 on Page 7 and 8 “Provided the solution is LiCl … energy driven system.” should read: “Provided the solution is LiCl and choose some typical parameters in Table 1, the COP of the CDI and membrane regeneration systems can be calculated and compared. The results are presented in Fig. 10. Conor is the concentration of the strong solution after regeneration. For the CDI system, the COP increases as Conor decreases. If the cooling load is equal, less input energy means higher COP. In CDI method, energy is used to transfer the absorbent solutes from the electrodes to solution. The regeneration is like turning the newly absorbed water into newly strong solution by adding more solutes. The mass ratio between the absorbed water and adding solutes is exactly equal to that between the water and solute in the strong solution. Therefore, if the regenerated strong solution has lower concentration, less solutes are needed when the same amount of water is absorbed (same cooling load). The energy consumption is consequently reduced and the coefficient of performance is higher. The results are estimated with a conservative assumption of ζ and η, so the CDI based system would have a better performance than the traditional thermal energy driven system. Assume the applied voltage 30 V, the COP of the membrane regeneration system is lower than that of the CDI system when N (the number of membrane pairs) is 30 and it is higher when N is 80. When the applied voltages are same, more membrane pairs enhances the performance of the membrane regeneration system. However, this performance is influenced by two parameters, making it not convenient for comparison. As CDI method can be seen as a parallel connected edition of the membrane regeneration method, it will be better to use (U/N) for the membrane regeneration system to conduct the comparison. Page 8, “3.2. Performance analysis of the CDI regeneration based system” section The contents about Fig. 11 (the second paragraph on Page 8) should exchange the place with that about Fig. 12 (the third paragraph). Tables 2 and 3, Figs. 11 and 12 should also change their places. The new Tables 2 and 3 and Fig. 11 should be switched as follows: The text of the second paragraph on Page 8 “Energy recovery is a good characteristic … an ideal charge efficiency” should read: “The COP of the CDI and membrane regeneration methods are respectively calculated under different applied voltages. U axis stands for (U/N) for the membrane regeneration method. Take LiBr solution (Conor is 50%) as the absorbent. The used parameters are listed in Table 2. The calculation results are displayed in Fig. 11. It shows lower voltage gives better performance for both methods. However, lower voltage also has side effect in that it reduces the force of mass transfer. It is especially true for the membrane regeneration system. Lower voltage (lower (U/N)) means lower whole applied voltage or more membrane pairs, which lead to insufficient moving force and stronger resistance in regeneration. Also, the cost will greatly rise if increasing the membrane number. Review the results in Fig. 10, though the performance of the membrane regeneration is higher with more membrane pairs, it pays a big price. When the unit voltage and efficiency are equal, the CDI system has a much better performance, this is mainly due to the energy recovery strategy. Page 8 and 9, “3.2. Performance analysis of the CDI regeneration based system” section The text of the third paragraph on Page 8 and the first paragraph on Page 9 “Voltage should … together” should read: “ Energy recovery is a good characteristic of the CDI regeneration method. Take LiCl solution (Conor is 25%) as the absorbent, Fig. 12 presents the COP of the CDI based system under different energy recovery ratios. The parameters are listed in Table 3. When the recovery ratio is 0%, the COP of the CDI system is equal to that of the membrane regeneration system (blue line in Fig. 12) with the same efficiency. With the ratio rising, the COP of the CDI system becomes higher. When it reaches 40%, the COP is about 2. If the ratio exceeds 60%, the COP will rise sharply and the value is as competitive as the vapor compression system. It is just a conservative predicted result without an ideal charge efficiency.” Page 9, “3.2. Performance analysis of the CDI regeneration based system” section Table 4 and Fig. 13 should be switched as follows: The text about Fig. 13 on Page 9 “The kind of the absorbent solution … high performance.” should read: “The kind of the absorbent solution is also important for the performance. The values of COP are respectively evaluated for both CDI and membrane regeneration systems with three common used absorbent solutions: LiCl, CaCl2 and LiBr. The used parameters are presented in Table 4. The calculation results are displayed in Fig. 13, in which MR means membrane regeneration method. For both methods, LiCl has the optimal performance within its typical working concentration ranges [4–6,37,38]. LiCl may be a more favourable choice in this sense, but it is complicated when considering the cost. In the Chinese market, LiBr is the most expensive absorbent of the three, about 41 dollars/kg; LiCl is about 28 dollars/kg; CaCl2 is the cheapest one, only about 2.5 dollars/kg [19,20]. Define the cost-effectiveness as the ratio of the regeneration effect to the cost, CaCl2 has better cost-effectiveness than LiBr and LiCl. Nevertheless, that's a simple evaluation assuming the absorbents has the same amount of solutes. To ensure the absorption performance, more CaCl2 may be needed for its smaller absorption capability, and thus the total cost increases. Meanwhile, the cost of the absorbent is included in the initial investment. With the time going, the operative cost is much more considerable. To pursue the best plan, a comprehensive analysis is needed by considering all this factors.

Owing to the unique characteristics featuring high power delivery and long-term cycling stability, electrochemical capacitors (ECs) have emerged as one of the most attractive electrochemical storage systems since they can complement or even replace batteries in the energy storage field, especially when high power delivery or uptake is needed. This review aims to summarize recent progress on core-shell nanostructures for advanced supercapacitor applications in view of their hierarchical architecture which not only create the desired hierarchical porous channels, but also possess higher electrical conductivity and better structural mechanical stability. The core-shell nanostructures include carbon/carbon, carbon/metal oxide, carbon/conducting polymer, metal oxide/metal oxide, metal oxide/conducting polymer, conducting polymer/conducting polymer, and even more complex ternary core-shell nanoparticles. The preparation strategies, electrochemical performances, and structural stabilities of core-shell materials for ECs are summarized. The relationship between core-shell nanostructure and electrochemical performance is discussed in detail.

Our nondimensionalized quasi-steady (Stefan number ≲ 0.1) solution indicates that the average charge (discharge) rate in a spatially-enhanced PCM outperforms the uniformly-enhanced case by maximizing the enhancement near the heat source and therein reducing the time averaged thermal resistance to melting (solidifying). Relative to a uniformly-enhanced thermal conductivity, the optimal charge/discharge rate enhancement is a modest 12% in one-dimensional Cartesian coordinates but as high as 140% in one-dimensional cylindrical coordinates.

The uniqueness of this innovation is that the inexpensive (non-platinum) cathode catalysts, based on strongly coupled transition-metal-oxide nanocrystals and nano-structured carbon materials (e. g., NiCo2O4 nano-particles on a nitrogen-doped graphene and MnNiCoO4 nano-particles on a nitrogen-doped multi-wall carbon nanotube), exhibit high activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) but without activity for the anode fuel oxidation reaction (FOR). Therefore, operation of the DLFCs allows the anode fuel to freely enter the cathode. This strategy avoids the reliance on expensive or difficult-to-develop cation- or anion-exchange membranes and circumvents the scalability concerns of the conventional membraneless DLFCs that are operated under a laminar-flow principle. With proper catalyst selectivity, a variety of organic liquids can be used as anode fuels. The high power density delivered by the membraneless DLFCs with inexpensive components and safe fuels can enable the development of not only small-scale portable power sources but also large-scale energy generation systems for transportation and stationary storage. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Alkaline fuel cell; Catalyst selectivity; Membraneless direct liquid fuel cell; Nano-structured carbon materials; Transition-metal-oxide nano crystals","Alkaline fuel cells; Anodes; Carbon nanotubes; Catalysts; Cathodes; Doping (additives); Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Ion exchange membranes; Laminar flow; Liquid fuels; Liquids; Metallic compounds; Metals; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanoparticles; Nanostructures; Nitrogen; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Yarn; Anion exchange membrane; Carbon material; Membraneless; Nitrogen doped graphene; Oxygen reduction reaction; Portable power sources; Selective strategies; Transition-metal oxides; Catalyst selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987936795

However, the understanding of different capacitive performances of MoS2 with different phases is still limited. Herein, the pseudocapacitive and electrical double layer characters in T and H phases of MoS2 monolayer are systematically studied, by using first-principles calculations and molecular dynamic simulations. The electronic levels referenced to the vacuum level are utilized to discuss the intrinsic pseudocapacitive characters. The large density of states of T-MoS2 located at 0.25 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode indicates possible redox pseudocapacitance. Contrastively, the large band gap of H-MoS2 limits its pseudocapacitive behavior. Furthermore, the reaction with the Li atom is employed to shed more light on the possible redox behavior. The different shifts of Fermi levels in H and T phase confirm their different capacitive properties. Moreover, the electrical double layer capacitances character of MoS2 in aqueous solution is also investigated. The H-MoS2 exhibits similar double layer character with T-MoS2. The calculated double layer capacitances of MoS2 are comparable with graphene, and can reach 9.07 μF/cm2 and 7.42 μF/cm2 for anode and cathode, respectively.

Here we report on the growth of single carbon tubular nanostructures with hierarchical structure (hCTNs) through a simple method based on direct conversion of carbon dioxide. Resorting to in-situ transformation and self-assembly of carbon micro/nano-structures, the obtained hCTNs are blood-like multichannel hierarchy composed of one large channel across the hCTNs and plenty of small branches connected to each other. Due to the unique pore structure and high surface area, these hCTN-based flexible supercapacitors possess the highest areal capacitance of ∼320 mF cm−2, as well as good rate-capability and excellent cycling stability (95% retention after 2500 cycles). It was established that this method can control the morphology, size, and density of hCTNs and effectively construct hCTNs well anchored to the various substrates. Our work unambiguously demonstrated the potential of hCTNs for large flexible supercapacitors and integrated energy management electronics. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Capacitive performance; Carbon tubular nanostructures; Flexible energy storage technologies; Hierarchical structure; Supercapacitors","Capacitance; Carbon dioxide; Nanostructures; Self assembly; Capacitive performance; Carbon tubular nanostructures; Energy storage technologies; Hierarchical structures; Super capacitor; Flexible electronics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987808214

The present study deals with an in-situ experiment on a borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) from combined heat and power production (CHP), which has been in operation on the site of Green Gas DPB in Paskov (the Czech Republic) for more than three years. This experimental BTES was monitored through six monitoring boreholes, and the temperatures were measured at various depths up to 80 m under the ground. The maximum temperatures measured at the centre of the BTES at the depths of 2–60 m under the ground ranged from 69.0 °C to 78.5 °C. The data acquired from the BTES operation was then used to set up and calibrate a heat transport model in the rock environment by means of the FEFLOW code. The calibrated numerical model contributed to optimisation of the BTES operation by simulation of various cycles of injection and exploitation of heat with an objective to minimise the loss of heat due to dissipation to the ground. The long-term feasibility of 65-percent recovery of heat stored underground in the BTES in Paskov was predicted, and recommendations concerning efficient operation of this BTES were provided. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Borehole heat exchanger (BHE); Borehole thermal energy storage (BTES); BTES; Finite Element subsurface FLOW system (FEFLOW); Monitoring; Numerical modelling; Optimisation; Simulation; Temperature distribution","Boreholes; Digital storage; Energy storage; Geothermal fields; Heat storage; Monitoring; Numerical models; Temperature distribution; Thermal energy; Borehole heat exchangers; Borehole thermal energy storage; BTES; Optimisations; Simulation; Subsurface Flow; Finite element method; borehole; calibration; combined heat and power; data acquisition; energy conservation; energy dissipation; experimental study; finite element method; geothermal power; heat transfer; monitoring; numerical model; optimization; subsurface flow; temperature profile; Czech Republic; Paskov",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983507511

The compassion of CAESA and CAESC (compressed air energy storage in caverns) can help on understanding the performance of CAESA, since there is no on running CAESA project. In order to investigate the detail thermodynamic process, integrated wellbore-reservoir (cavern or aquifer) simulations of CAES (compressed air energy storage) are carried out based on parameters of the Huntorf CAES plant. Reasonable matches between monitored data and simulated results are obtained for the Huntorf cavern systems in the wellbore and cavern regions. In this study, the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic behaviors of CAES in cavern and aquifer systems are investigated, such as pressure and temperature distribution and variation in both the wellbore and cavern regions of the CAES systems. Performances of CAESA are investigated with numerical models and compared with the performances of CAESC. The comparisons of CAESC and CAESA indicate that the pressure variation in CAESA shows a wider variation range than that in CAESC, while the temperature shows a smooth variation due to the large grain specific heat of the grains in the porous media. The simulation results confirm that the CAES can be achieved in aquifers, and further that the performance of energy storage in aquifers can be similar to or better than CAESC, if the aquifers have appropriate reservoir properties, which means the gas bubble can be well developed in an aquifer with such properties and the aquifer should have closed or semi-closed boundaries. The impacts of gas-bubble volume, formation permeability, and aquifer boundary permeability on storage efficiency are investigated and the simulation results indicate that the increase of gas bubble volume and permeability can improve the efficiency, but the effect is not significant. The gas bubble boundary permeability has a small effect on the energy efficiency of the sustainable daily cycle but can significantly affect total sustainable cycle times. The analysis of thermodynamic behaviors in CAESA suggests that more attention should be paid to the heat storage, reservoir properties and two-phase flow processes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Aquifer; CAES; Cavern; Compressed air energy storage; Thermodynamic process","Aquifers; Bubbles (in fluids); Caves; Compressed air; Computer aided engineering; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Gas permeability; Groundwater resources; Heat storage; Hydrogeology; Oil field equipment; Porous materials; Pressure vessels; Specific heat; Thermodynamics; Two phase flow; Boundary permeability; Cavern; Formation permeability; Pressure and temperature; Pressure variations; Reservoir property; Thermodynamic behaviors; Thermodynamic process; Compressed air energy storage; air bubble; aquifer; comparative study; compressed air; energy efficiency; hydrodynamics; numerical model; performance assessment; permeability; porous medium; reservoir; temperature effect; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983428976

However, the mismatch between the demand and the photovoltaic generation profiles leads to high power flows between the household and the grid. The appearance of tariffs that foster the self-consumption and penalize the injection of energy into the electrical grid increases the need to provide cost-effective solutions to enable the matching between electric generation and consumption. Used EV batteries are unsuitable for vehicles, but can be used in secondary applications, such as residential PV energy storage.

Electrolyte material costs constitute a sizeable fraction of the redox flow battery price. As such, this work develops a techno-economic model for redox flow batteries that accounts for redox-active material, salt, and solvent contributions to the electrolyte cost. Benchmark values for electrolyte constituent costs guide identification of design constraints. Nonaqueous battery design is sensitive to all electrolyte component costs, cell voltage, and area-specific resistance. Design challenges for nonaqueous batteries include minimizing salt content and dropping redox-active species concentration requirements. Aqueous battery design is sensitive to only redox-active material cost and cell voltage, due to low area-specific resistance and supporting electrolyte costs. Increasing cell voltage and decreasing redox-active material cost present major materials selection challenges for aqueous batteries. This work minimizes cost-constraining variables by mapping the battery design space with the techno-economic model, through which we highlight pathways towards low price and moderate concentration. Furthermore, the techno-economic model calculates quantitative iterations of battery designs to achieve the Department of Energy battery price target of $100 per kWh and highlights cost cutting strategies to drive battery prices down further. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Electrolyte; Energy storage; Redox flow battery; Techno-economic model","Costs; Design; Electric batteries; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Redox reactions; Area-specific resistances; Department of Energy; Electrolyte material; Energy storage applications; Moderate concentration; Redox active materials; Supporting electrolyte; Techno-economic model; Flow batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986893455

In this work, we focused on the transformation of natural biomass, such as cotton, into more stable porous carbonaceous forms for energy storage in practical applications. Biomorphic cotton fibers are pretreated under the effect of NaOH/urea swelling on cellulose and are subsequently used as a biomass carbon source to mold the porous microtubule structure through a certain degree of calcining. As a merit of its favorable structural features, the hierarchical porous carbon fibers exhibit an enhanced electric double layer capacitance (221.7 F g-1 at 0.3 A g-1) and excellent cycling stability (only 4.6% loss was observed after 6000 cycles at 2 A g-1). A detailed investigation displays that biomass-swelling behavior plays a significant role, not only in improving the surface chemical characteristics of biomorphic cotton fibers but also in facilitating the formation of a hierarchical porous carbon fiber structure. In contrast to traditional methods, nickel foams have been used as the collector for supercapacitor that requiring no additional polymeric binders or carbon black as support or conductive materials. Because of the absence of additive materials, we can further enhance capacitance. This remarkable capacitive performance can be due to sufficient void space within the porous microstructure. By effectively increasing the contact area between the carbon surface and the electrolyte, which can reduce the ion diffusion pathway or buffer the volume change during cycling.

In this work, we report the synthesis, structural characterization and electrocatalytic water oxidation performances of mesoporous NiO/NiFe2O4 nanorods. It is found that different calcination temperature of NiFe-based coordination polymer leads to various structural composites and completely preserves the original nanorod-like morphology of coordination polymer precursor. The nanorods obtained at 350 °C identified as NiO/NiFe2O4 have the largest surface area of 191.5 m2 g−1 with an average pore size of 6.4 nm. When used as oxygen evolving catalyst in water splitting, NiO/NiFe2O4 nanorods are found to exhibit the highest electrocatalytic water oxidation activity in basic media compared to the composites obtained at other temperatures, even much better than those of individual NiO or NiFe2O4 as well as commercial RuO2 and IrO2. The current density of 10 mA cm−2 is met at an overpotential of 302 mV with a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec−1. The excellent electrocatalytic performance could be attributed to the synergetic benefits of biphasic NiO/NiFe2O4 mesoporous structure and large surface area, which offer pathways for easy accessibility of electrolytes and fast mass/charge transportation. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Electrocatalyst; Mesoporous; NiO/NiFe2O4; Oxygen evolving; Water splitting","Catalysts; Electrocatalysts; Hydrogen; Mass transportation; Mesoporous materials; Metals; Oxygen; Pore size; Solar energy; Calcination temperature; Coordination Polymers; Electrocatalytic performance; Mesoporous; NiO/NiFe2O4; Oxygen evolving catalysts; Structural characterization; Water splitting; Nanorods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992436642

It was found that MgH2–Ni@C composites exhibited relatively lower sorption temperature, faster sorption kinetics, and more stable cycling performance than that of pure-milled MgH2. The desorption peak temperature was lowered down to 283 °C, i.e. of more than 74 °C, with respect to pure Mg hydride.

However, its high dehydrogenation temperature resulted from the unfavorable thermodynamic and kinetic barriers limits its practical applications. Herein, we first propose an efficient strategy for remarkably enhancing the dehydrogenation properties of MgH2 by sequential-doping of nickel (Ni) and graphene (G) via mechanical milling. This method can not only accelerate the refinement of MgH2 grains and particles, but also significantly decrease its dehydrogenation temperature relative to G single-doping and Ni/G simultaneous-doping systems. First-principles calculations indicate that the excellent dehydrogenation properties of Ni/G sequential-doped MgH2 system are closely associated with the dual effects involving Ni solid-solution in MgH2 lattice and interfacial catalysis between G-supported Ni catalysts and MgH2 matrix. Upon these effects, the dehydrogenation enthalpy and dehydrogenation activation energy of MgH2 are remarkably decreased.

However, small volumetric capacity and low operating voltage limit their practical application for large energy storage applications. Herein, a facile and novel nanofoaming process was demonstrated to boost the volumetric electrochemical capacitance of the devices via activation of Ni nanowires to form ultrathin nanosheets and porous nanostructures. The as-designed free-standing Ni@Ni(OH)2 film electrodes display a significantly enhanced volumetric capacity (462 C/cm3 at 0.5 A/cm3) and excellent cycle stability. Moreover, the as-developed hybrid supercapacitor employed Ni@Ni(OH)2 film as positive electrode and graphene-carbon nanotube film as negative electrode exhibits a high volumetric capacitance of 95 F/cm3 (at 0.25 A/cm3) and excellent cycle performance (only 14% capacitance reduction for 4500 cycles). Furthermore, the volumetric energy density can reach 33.9 mWh/cm3, which is much higher than that of most thin film lithium batteries (1-10 mWh/cm3).

The B40 cage contains two B6 cavities (diameter: 3.36 Å) and four B7 holes (diameter: 3.68 Å). It is calculated that the structures with the Sc atom outside the hollow sites of these cavities are the most stable. The calculated binding energy of the Sc atom to the B6 and B7 cavities on the surface of B40 are 4.61 and 5.24 eV, much larger than the experimental cohesive energy of bulk Sc (3.90 eV/atom). Moreover, the distance between the neighboring two Sc atoms (5.61 Å) is considerably larger than that of the Sc2 dimer (3.20 Å), therefore, the problem of Sc atoms aggregative to form the Scn cluster is expected to be overcome. The average adsorption energies and consecutive adsorption energies reveal that each Sc atom can most adsorb five H2 molecules. The calculated average hydrogen adsorption energies per H2 for B40(Sc–nH2)6 (n = 1–5) are in the energy range from 0.33 to 0.58 eV, which is suitable for hydrogen storage under near-ambient conditions. The Dewar–Kubas interaction dominates the adsorption of H2 by B40Sc6. The calculated desorption temperature and molecular dynamic simulation indicate that the B40(Sc–5H2)6 structure is easy to desorb H2 molecules. The HGD of the bulk [B40(Sc–5H2)4]4 is 6.18 wt%, a little smaller than that for B40(Sc–5H2)6 (8.3%), however still exceeding the 5.5 wt% at 2017 specified by the US department of energy (DOE). Therefore, the stable B40 structure decorated by the Sc atoms can be applied as one candidate for hydrogen storage materials under near-ambient conditions. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","B6; Density functional theory; Fullerene; Hydrogen storage","Adsorption; Atoms; Binding energy; Boron; Density functional theory; Dimers; Fullerenes; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Scandium; Storage (materials); Transition metals; Adsorption energies; Ambient conditions; Density-functional methods; Desorption temperatures; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen storage capacities; Kubas interactions; US Department of Energy; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995955688

AlH3 vacancy tends to exist on the (001) surface rather than in the interior of NaAlH4. The migration of AlH3 vacancy from the subsurface layer to the surface layer is an exothermic process, with an energy barrier of 0.33 eV. The result suggests that enhancing the mobility of AlH3 vacancy along the surface (001) is a feasible approach to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction of NaAlH4. AlH63− anion is observed in this work by importing two AlH3 vacancies, which exists stably at T = 300 K, but decomposes when the temperature increases to 400 K. The formation mechanism of AlH63− is that two neighboring AlH4− units form two AlH3 vacancies and two remaining H− anions firstly, and then the two remaining H− anions are attracted to AlH4− unit to form AlH63− anion. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","AlH3 vacancy; Dehydriding mechanism; First-principles calculations; Hydrogen storage","Calculations; Dehydrogenation; Hydrogen storage; Ions; Negative ions; Sodium compounds; Dehydriding; Dehydrogenation reactions; Exothermic process; First-principles calculation; First-principles study; Formation mechanism; Subsurface layer; Temperature increase; Vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995872834

The strategy is robust enough to synthesize NiSe–CoSe nanoparticles with different NiSe to CoSe ratios but with a similar hollow structure. Co ions in the NiSe–CoSe nanoparticles play decisive role for formation of the hollow structure; otherwise, the nanoparticles become solid for the NiSe sample. When used as the positive electroactive materials for energy storage, the NiSe–CoSe samples show excellent electrochemical activity in alkaline electrolyte. Using the synergistic effect between NiSe and CoSe, the electrochemical performance of NiSe–CoSe can be tuned by varying the NiSe to CoSe ratios.

These two alternatives have a trade off: cooling tower evaporative cooling systems use water, which is a scarce resource in the desert environments where CSP is implemented, but air-cooling results in decreased power plant performance. In this paper, a radiation-enhanced cooling system for thermal power plants is analyzed with a detailed heat transfer model and shown to be feasible for CSP. The proposed system consumes no water and has the potential to out-perform air-cooling. Heat transfer occurs by convection and radiation to the cold night temperatures of desert environments. The radiators are uncovered black panels with tubes of cooling fluid circulated to a cold storage system. The radiators’ performance is modeled using a two-dimensional finite difference model and the complete power plant system is modeled on an hourly basis using a standard power plant with thermal energy storage. If the night sky cooling system is the same size as the solar collector field, annual simulation shows that the system can provide over 90% of the required cooling. In addition, performance is improved compared to traditional air-cooling because the parasitic load for circulating water in the radiator system is about 1% of gross energy production while the parasitic load for an air-cooled power plant is about 4%. The night sky cooling system is a potential solution to the water issues that face CSP power plants and other power plants located in desert environments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Air-cooling; Concentrating solar; Heat rejection; Night sky; Radiation; Water","Cold storage; Cooling; Cooling towers; Economic and social effects; Evaporative cooling systems; Heat radiation; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Landforms; Radiators; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectric power plants; Water; Air cooling; Concentrating solar; Concentrating solar power; Concentrating solar power plant; Heat rejection; Night sky; Power plant performance; Two-dimensional finite difference models; Cooling systems; air temperature; convection; cooling; equipment component; heat transfer; power plant; solar power; solar radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982694791

Four representative power plants onshore (with 2.3 and 3.2 MW turbines) and offshore (4.0 and 6.0 MW turbines) with 2015 state-of-the-art technology data provided by Siemens Wind Power were assessed. The energy payback time was found to be less than 1 year for all technologies. The emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to less than 7 g CO2-eq/kWh for onshore and 11 g CO2-eq/kWh for offshore. Climate change impacts were found to be a good indicator for overall hotspot identification however attention should also be drawn to human toxicity and impacts from respiratory inorganics. The overall higher impact of offshore plants, compared to onshore ones, is mainly due to larger high-impact material requirements for capital infrastructure. In both markets the bigger turbines with more advanced direct drive generator technology is shown to perform better than the smaller geared ones. Capital infrastructure is the most impactful life cycle stage across impacts. It accounts for more than 79% and 70% of climate change impacts onshore and offshore respectively. The end-of-life treatment could lead to significant savings due to recycling, ca. 20–30% for climate change. In the manufacturing stage the impacts due to operations at the case company do not exceed 1% of the total life cycle impacts. This finding highlights the shared responsibility across multiple stakeholders and calls for collaborative efforts for comprehensive environmental management across organizations in the value chain.

The feasibility, energy savings, and economics of such systems have been assessed and proven in data centers and commercial buildings, but the outcomes are still uncertain for the residential sector. In this work, we assess the technical and economic feasibility of DC circuits using data for 120 traditionally-wired AC homes in Austin, Texas to understand the effect of highly variable demand profiles on DC-powered residences, using appliance-level use and solar generation data, and performing a Monte Carlo simulation to quantify costs and benefits. Results show site energy savings between 9% and 20% when solar PV is distributed to all home appliances. When battery storage for excess solar energy is considered, these savings increase to 14–25%. At present DC equipment prices, converting all equipment to DC causes levelized annual costs of electricity to homeowners to roughly double. However, by converting only homes’ air conditioning condensing units to DC, the costs of direct-DC are greatly reduced and home site energy savings of 7–16% are generated. In addition to quantifying savings, we find major nontechnical barriers to implementing direct-DC in homes. These include a lack of standards for such systems, a relatively small market for DC appliances and components, utility programs designed for AC power, and a workforce unfamiliar with DC. Experience with DC is growing in other sectors, and with time this will be transitioned to a broader audience of engineers, electricians, and building inspectors to ensure that not only are the systems themselves safe, but that the image of direct current circuits becomes less foreign over time. Direct current may very well have a place in the residential sector, and research and development should continue to explore other potential benefits that might make a stronger case for a more widespread transition to what now appears a promising technology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Direct current; Economics; Energy efficiency; Residential","Air conditioning; Buildings; Costs; Digital storage; Domestic appliances; Economics; Energy efficiency; Equipment; Housing; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Office buildings; Reconfigurable hardware; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Commercial building; Direct current; Direct current circuits; Economic feasibilities; Non-technical barriers; Research and development; Residential; Residential sectors; Energy conservation; air conditioning; building; demand analysis; economics; electricity supply; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy market; feasibility study; Monte Carlo analysis; research and development; residential energy; Austin; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979896400

In the modified FSPCM, myristic acid (MA) was used as a solid–liquid phase change material (PCM), high density polyethylene (HDPE) acted as supporting material to prevent the leakage of the melted MA. Nano–Al2O3 (NAO) and nano–graphite (NG) were the additives for thermal conductivity enhancement. Scanning electronic microscope (SEM), Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT–IR) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) were used to analyze the microstructure, chemical structure and crystalline phase of the samples, respectively. Furthermore, the specific latent heat and phase transition temperature, thermal conductivity and thermal reliability were investigated using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), thermal conductivity meter and thermo–gravimetric analyzer (TGA). The results showed that the MA was uniformly absorbed in the HDPE matrices and there was no leakage during the melting process when the mass fraction of the MA in the MA/HDPE composite was less than 70%.

In recent years, there has been growing research in thermal management of lithium-ion battery modules. However, there is little information available on the minimum cell-to-cell spacing limits for indirect, liquid cooled modules when considering heat release during a single cell failure. For this purpose, a generic four-cell module was modeled using finite element analysis to determine the sensitivity of module temperatures to cell spacing. Additionally, the effects of different heat sink materials and interface qualities were investigated. Two materials were considered, a solid aluminum block and a metal/wax composite block. Simulations were run for three different transient load profiles. The first profile simulates sustained high rate operation where the system begins at rest and generates heat continuously until it reaches steady state. And, two failure mode simulations were conducted to investigate block performance during a slow and a fast exothermic reaction, respectively. Results indicate that composite materials can perform well under normal operation and provide some protection against single cell failure; although, for very compact designs, the amount of wax available to absorb heat is reduced and the effectiveness of the phase change material is diminished. The aluminum block design performed well under all conditions, and showed that heat generated during a failure is quickly dissipated to the coolant, even under the closest cell spacing configuration. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Liquid cooling; Lithium-ion batteries; Phase change materials; Propagating failure; Thermal management; Thermal runaway","Aluminum; Electric batteries; Finite element method; Heat sinks; Interfaces (materials); Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Phase change materials; Temperature control; Thermal variables control; Cell-to-cell spacing; Energy storage systems; Failure conditions; Fast exothermic reaction; Heat sink materials; Liquid cooling; Module temperature; Thermal runaways; Lithium-ion batteries; absorption; aluminum; cation; composite; cooling; energy balance; equipment; finite element method; liquid; lithium; operations technology; phase transition; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979642485

The net residential load profile is created for a single home using BEopt and then scaled to assess technical and economic impacts to the utility for a market segment of 10,000 homes modeled in HOMER. Emphasis is given to intraday load profiles, ramp rate requirements, peak capacity requirements, load factor, revenue loss, and revenue recuperation as a function of the number of ratepayers with solar PV. Increases in solar PV penetration reduced the annual system load factor by an equivalent percentage yet had little to no impact on peak power requirements. Ramp rate requirements were largest for Chicago in October, Phoenix in July, and Seattle in January. Net metering on a monthly or annual basis had a negligible impact on optimal solar PV capacity, yet optimal solar PV capacity reduced by 20–50% if net metering was removed altogether. Technical and economic data are generated from simulations with solar penetration up to 100% of homes. For the scenario with 20% homes using solar PV, the utility would need a 16%, 24%, and 8% increase in time-of-use electricity rates ($/kW h) across all ratepayers to recover lost revenue in Chicago, Phoenix, and Seattle, respectively. The $15 monthly connection fee would need to increase by 94%, 228%, or 50% across the same cities if time-of-use electricity rates were to remain unchanged. Batteries were found to be cost-effective in simulations without net metering and at cost reductions of at least 55%. Batteries were not cost-effective—even if they were free—when net metering was in effect. As expected, Phoenix had the most favorable economic scenario for residential solar PV, primarily due to the high solar insolation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity rates; Energy economics; Net metering; Residential solar; Solar photovoltaic (PV); Techno-economic optimization","Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric batteries; Housing; Solar concentrators; Energy economics; Net metering; Residential solar; Solar photovoltaics; Techno-economics; Solar power generation; economics; electricity supply; energy market; energy planning; optimization; photovoltaic system; price dynamics; renewable resource; residential energy; solar power; Arizona; Chicago; Illinois; Phoenix; Seattle; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979626571

However, most plasmonic biosensors and conventional bioassays rely on natural antibodies, which are susceptible to elevated temperatures and nonaqueous media. Hence, an expensive and cumbersome ""cold chain"" system is necessary to preserve the labile antibodies by maintaining optimal cold temperatures during transport, storage, and handling. Herein, we introduce a facile approach to preserve the antibody activity on a biosensor surface even at elevated temperatures. We show that silk fibroin film could be used as a protective layer to preserve the activity of a model antibody (Rabbit IgG) and cardiac troponin antibody at both room temperature and 40 °C over several days. Furthermore, a simple aqueous rinsing process restores the biofunctionality of the biosensor. This energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method represents a novel approach to eliminate the cold chain and temperature-controlled packing of diagnostic reagents and materials, thereby extending the capability of antibody-based biosensors to different resource-limited circumstances such as developing countries, an ambulance, an intensive care unit emergency room, and battlefield. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","biopreservation; gold nanorods; localized surface plasmon resonance; plasmonic biosensor; silk","Bioassay; Biochips; Biosensors; Chains; Developing countries; Energy efficiency; Food preservation; Intensive care units; Microarrays; Nanorods; Plasmons; Silk; Surface plasmon resonance; Biopreservation; Cold temperatures; Elevated temperature; Gold nanorod; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Plasmonic biosensors; Protective layers; Silk fibroin films; Antibodies; gold; nanotube; silk; animal; chemistry; genetic procedures; Leporidae; surface plasmon resonance; temperature; Animals; Biosensing Techniques; Gold; Nanotubes; Rabbits; Silk; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991736238

Inspired by supramolecular chemistry, the supramolecular hydrogel is prepared by linking β-cyclodextrin to graphene oxide (GO). The carbon nanoparticles-anchored graphene nanosheets are then assembled after the hydrothermal reduction and carbonization of the supramolecular hydrogels; here, the β-cyclodextrin is carbonized to carbon nanoparticles that are uniformly anchored on the graphene nanosheets. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that carbon nanoparticles with several nanometers are uniformly anchored on both sides of graphene nanosheets, and X-ray diffraction spectra demonstrate that the interlayer spacing of graphene is enlarged due to the anchored nanoparticles among the graphene nanosheets. The as-prepared carbon nanoparticles-anchored graphene nanosheets material (C/r-GO-1:3) possesses a high specific capacitance (310.8 F g-1, 0.5 A g-1), superior rate capability (242.5 F g-1, 10 A g-1), and excellent cycle stability (almost 100% after 10000 cycles, at the scan rate of 50 mV s-1). The outstanding electrochemical performance of the resulting C/r-GO-1:3 is mainly attributed to (i) the presence of the carbon nanoparticles, (ii) the enlarged interlayer spacing of the graphene sheets, and (iii) the accelerated ion transport rates toward the interior of the electrode material.

Polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorofluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)) with ultrahigh ϵr of &gt;50 is considered promising in achieving high Ue of polymer dielectrics. However, P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) only exhibits moderate Ue due to the early saturation of electrical polarization at low electric field. In this contribution, we show that, by blending P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), the early saturation of P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) is substantially suppressed, giving rise to concomitant enhancement of dielectric permittivity and breakdown strength. An ultrahigh energy density of 19.6 J/cm3 is thus achieved at ∼640 kV/mm, which is 1600% greater than Ue of the benchmark biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP, 1.2 J/cm3 at 640 kV/mm). Results of phase field simulations reveal that the interfaces between PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) play a critical role by not only suppressing early saturation of electrical polarization in P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) but also inducing additional interfacial polarization. Binary phase diagram of P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)/PVDF blends is also systematically explored with their dielectric and energy storage behavior studied. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","dielectric; electric displacement; energy density; ferroelectricity; polymer blends","Blending; Electric breakdown; Electric fields; Energy storage; Ferroelectric materials; Ferroelectricity; Fluorine compounds; Permittivity; Polarization; Polymer blends; Polypropylenes; Bi-axially oriented polypropylenes; Dielectric permittivities; Electric displacement; Energy density; Energy storage applications; Ferroelectric hysteresis; Interfacial polarization; Low dielectric constants; Dielectric materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991628940

Under a negative reduction potential, graphene oxide nanosheets lose oxygen-containing functional group to become GNS, simultaneously MnO2 derived from KMnO4 is also electrochemically deposited on the electrode. The characterizations of scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscopy show that MnO2 nanoflakes are homogenously dispersed on the surfaces of GNS, such microstructure can effectively enlarge the contact area of MnO2 with electrolyte. The electrochemical measurements indicate that the introduction of GNS significantly enhances the supercapacitive performance of MnO2 electrode. Notably, the resulting MnO2/GNS hybrid exhibits a high specific capacitance of 413.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is higher than the recently reported MnO2/GNS hybrids prepared by different methods including electrochemical deposition.

Here, a new design is reported to acquire an asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by all free-standing metal oxides. The positive electrode is made of 3D NiO open porous nanoribbons network on nickel foam and the negative electrode is composed of SnO2/MnO2 nanoflakes grown on carbon cloth (CC) substrate. The combination of two metal oxide electrodes which replaced the traditional group of carbon materials together with metal oxide has achieved a higher energy density. The self-supported 3D NiO nanoribbons network demonstrates a high specific capacitance and better cycle performance without obvious mechanical deformation despite of undergoing harsh bulk redox reactions. The SnO2/MnO2 nanoflakes as the pseudocapacitive electrode exhibit a wide range of voltage window (-1 to 1 V), which is conducive to electrochemical energy storage. The (CC/SnO2/MnO2)(-)//(NiO/Ni foam)(+) asymmetric supercapacitor device delivers an energy density of 64.4 Wh kg-1 (at a power density of 250 W kg-1) and two devices in series are applied to light up 24 red LEDs for about 60 s.

Many of these materials are synthesized in solution and there often exists a significant barrier to transition them into the solid state in an efficient manner. Here, we develop a methodology employing an electrodepositable copolymer consisting of small functional molecules for applications in solar energy harvesting and storage. We employ azobenzene solar thermal fuel polymers and functionalize them to enable deposition from low concentration solutions in methanol, resulting in uniform and large-area thin films. This approach enables conformal deposition on a variety of conducting substrates that can be either flat or structured depending on the application. Our approach further enables control over film growth via electrodepsition conditions and results in highly uniform films of hundreds of nanometers to microns in thickness. We demonstrate that this method enables superior retention of solar thermal fuel properties, with energy densities of ∼90 J/g, chargeability in the solid state, and exceptional materials utilization compared to other solid-state processing approaches. This novel approach is applicable to systems such as photon upconversion, photovoltaics, photosensing, light emission, and beyond, where small functional molecules enable solid-state applications. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","azobenzene; electrodeposition; polymers; solar thermal fuels; thin-films","Azobenzene; Deposition; Electrodeposition; Electrodes; Energy harvesting; Film growth; Fuels; Molecules; Polymers; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solid state devices; Colloidal nanomaterials; Conducting substrates; Conformal deposition; Functional molecules; Low concentrations; Photon up conversions; Solar thermal; Solid-state processing; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990048305

Currently, pumped-storage hydroelectricity and compressed air energy storage are used for grid-scale energy storage, and batteries are used at smaller scales. However, prospects for expansion of these technologies suffer from geographic limitations (pumped-storage hydroelectricity and compressed air energy storage), low roundtrip efficiency (compressed air energy storage), and high cost (batteries). Furthermore, pumped-storage hydroelectricity and compressed air energy storage are challenging to scale-down, while batteries are challenging to scale-up. In 2015, a novel compressed gas energy storage prototype system was developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In this paper, a near-isothermal modification to the system is proposed. In common with compressed air energy storage, the novel storage technology described in this paper is based on air compression/expansion. However, several novel features lead to near-isothermal processes, higher efficiency, greater system scalability, and the ability to site a system anywhere. The enabling features are utilization of hydraulic machines for expansion/compression, above-ground pressure vessels as the storage medium, spray cooling/heating, and waste-heat utilization. The base configuration of the novel storage system was introduced in a previous paper. This paper describes the results obtained from a transient, analytical, physics-based thermodynamic system model used for the system design and evaluation of three design configurations (including base configuration). The system model captures real gas effects and all loss mechanisms. The model demonstrates an energy storage roundtrip efficiency of 82% and energy density of 3.59 MJ/m3.

In developing countries, potable water supply is unreliable due to increasing demand, forcing end-users to seek alternative strategies such as pumping and storage in rooftop tanks to reliably meet their water demand. However, this is at an increased cost of energy cost. In this paper, the open loop optimal control model and the closed-loop model predictive control (MPC) model, both with disturbances, are compared while minimizing the maintenance cost of the pump. The open loop optimal model is suitable in instances where only random disturbances due to measurement errors are present. However, in case the demand pattern changes for reasons such as occupancy change in the house, the closed-loop MPC model is suitable as it robustly minimizes the pumping cost while meeting the customer demand. Further, MPC proves its robustness as it is able to overcome the turnpike phenomenon. Each of these two models has their own strengths. The open loop model is cost effective and easy to implement for customers that have a steady demand pattern while the closed-loop MPC model is more robust against demand pattern changes and external disturbances. It is recommended that these two models are adopted according to the specific application. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Demand management; Energy-water nexus; Model predictive control; Optimal control; Time-of-use (TOU)","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Developing countries; Electric load management; Potable water; Predictive control systems; Pumps; Random errors; Water management; Water supply; Closed loop models; Cost of energies; Energy-water nexus; External disturbances; Open loop optimal control; Optimal controls; Random disturbances; Time of use; Model predictive control; building; control system; demand-side management; developing world; drinking water; electricity; energy efficiency; error analysis; household energy; optimization; pump; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989898760

However, development of an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for selective FA decomposition for ultraclean H2 gas in the absence of any alkalis or additives under mild conditions remains a major challenge. Based on our previous work on Au/ZrO2 as a robust and efficient catalyst for FA dehydrogenation in amine system, we report here ZrO2 with different nanocrystal polymorphs supported Au nanoparticles can achieve near completion of FA dehydrogenation in base-free aqueous medium. Of significant importance is that an excellent rate of up to 81.8 L H2 gAu−1 h−1 in open system and highly pressurized gas of 5.9 MPa in closed one can be readily attained at 80 °C for Au/m-ZrO2. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) and CO2-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) techniques revealed that Au/m-ZrO2 exhibits a higher density of surface basic sites than Au/t-ZrO2 and Au/a-ZrO2. Basic sites in surface can substantially facilitate crucial FA deprotonation process which appears to be a key factor for achieving high dehydrogenation activity. The H/D exchange between solvent of H2O and substrate of FA was observed by the kinetic isotope effect experiments. © 2016","Base-free; Formic acid; Gold catalysis; Hydrogen; Zirconia polymorphs","Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Dehydrogenation; Formic acid; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Temperature programmed desorption; Zirconia; Base-free; Deprotonation process; Efficient catalysts; Gold catalysis; Heterogeneous catalyst; Hydrogen generations; Kinetic isotope effects; Zirconia polymorphs; Gold",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982189606

With Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) representing most of the world's energy storage installed capacity and given its maturity and simplicity, the question stands as to whether this technology could be used on a smaller scale, namely in buildings. In this paper, the feasibility of such an installation is analysed by modelling each one of its components and applying it to several installation scenarios. Proposed and existing installations are also reviewed, including a first-time analysis of an installation in France, which is presumably the only existing building with an integrated PHES system. It was found that the economies of scale that render large PHES installations competitive are not present in small installations. This limitation, associated to other important disadvantages, such as the large volume required, seem to point out PHES as an ill-suited solution for energy storage in buildings, an important finding for building design and energy policy. Nevertheless, if synergies with existing reservoirs could be found (for example for a building on a riverside), costs could be significantly lowered. Further research on possible synergies with other building systems as well as a life-cycle assessment analysis are recommended. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy storage; Energy storage in buildings; Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE); Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES)","Buildings; Economics; Energy storage; Life cycle; Building systems; Distributed energy storages; Economies of scale; In-buildings; Installed capacity; Levelised cost of energies; Life cycle assessment analysis; Pumped-hydro energy storages; Architectural design; architectural design; cost analysis; energy planning; feasibility study; hydroelectric power; installation; pump; storage; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981276080

This profile is used to simulate naval pulsed power loads planned for deployment aboard future vessels. The LFP cells studied experienced an exponential drop in their usable high-rate recharge capacity within sixty cycles due to a rapid rise in their internal resistance. Differential capacitance shows that the voltage window for charge storage is pushed outside of the recommended voltage cutoff limits. Investigation into the state of health of the electrodes shows minimal loss of active material from the cathode to side reactions. Post-mortem examination of the anodic surface films reveals a large increase in the concentration of reduced salt compounds indicating that the pulsed profile creates highly favorable conditions for LiPF6 salt to break down into LiF. This film slows the ionic movement at the interface, affecting transfer kinetics, resulting in charge buildup in the bulk anode without successful energy storage. The results indicate that the use of these cells as a power supply for high pulsed power loads is hindered because of ionically resistant film development and not by an increasing rate of active material loss. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; High rate cycling; Lithium-ion; Pulsed power systems; Surface films","Capacitance; Electric power systems; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrodes; Lithium alloys; Lithium-ion batteries; Naval vessels; Differential capacitance; Favorable conditions; High rate; Internal resistance; Lithium ions; Lithium iron phosphates; Pulsed power systems; Surface films; Interfaces (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980614256

Therefore, this paper develops a sort of new phase change composites (PCC) with double-layer network to enhance the thermal conductivity and thermal stability. Different mass fractions of expanded graphite (EG) as heat transfer promoter were added in the spindle microencapsulated phase change materials (MicroPCM). The relationship between the PCC thermal conductivity and carbon network structure was investigated. The thermal conductivity was measured by transient plane source method. The carbon network structure of PCC was detected by energy dispersive spectroscopy. Temperature-regulated property was captured by infrared imager. As a result, distinct carbon network structure in PCC was observed with 20% mass fraction of EG, the corresponding thermal conductivity was increased up to 7.5 times of the pristine paraffin. Negligible change in thermal properties of the PCC was confirmed after 100 times thermal cycling and 7 days serving durability tests. The enhancement on thermal properties of the PCC is a promising route to achieve high energy storage efficiency targets of numerous thermal applications. © 2016","Network structure; Phase change composites; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy storage; Thermal stability","Durability; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Network layers; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Storage (materials); Structural properties; Thermal energy; Thermodynamic properties; Thermodynamic stability; Energy storage efficiencies; Heat transfer rate; Microencapsulated phase change material; Network structures; Phase Change; Phase change microcapsules; Thermal applications; Transient plane sources; Thermal conductivity; calcium carbonate; carbon; composite; encapsulation; energy conservation; energy dissipation; energy efficiency; graphite; heat transfer; latent heat flux; network analysis; phase transition; temperature; thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978862953

Two BCHP systems (one with TES and the other without TES) are compared with the conventional system in a super high-rise building in Shanghai city. The design and operation of both BCHP systems are optimized with the linear programming tool. The results show that natural gas price is the most important factor regarding the economic performance of the BCHP plants, followed by electricity utility price and the price of the prime motor. In this case study, both BCHP options show higher energy use efficiency and better economic performance than the conventional solution. Compared with the BCHP system without TES, the one with TES has similar energy efficiency level, but lower operation cost due to its load shifting capability.

A sensitivity analysis is performed to optimize the performance of the proposed novel cold production process. Results show that the cold energy output of the novel process is increased by about 36.5%, compared with that of the conventional cold production process via direct LNG evaporation. The off-design performance of the gas turbine combined cycle under different ambient conditions is also analyzed to identify the effect of the cold production process for inlet air cooling on a combined cycle power plant. The results indicated that by applying the novel cold production method for inlet air cooling, the combined cycle relative power output increment varies from 1.6% to 11.6%, when air humidity changes from 90% to 30%, compared with that without inlet air cooling.

In this paper, we present a procedure for the design of a near-optimal power management strategy for the hybrid battery and ultracapacitor energy storage system (HESS) in a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. The design procedure starts by defining a cost function to minimize the electricity consumption of the HESS and to optimize the operating behavior of the battery. To determine the optimal control actions and power distribution between two power sources, a dynamic programming (DP)-based novel analysis method is proposed, and the optimization framework is presented accordingly. Through analysis of the DP control actions under different battery state-of-health (SoH) conditions, near-optimal rules are extracted. A rule based power management is proposed based on the abstracted rules and simulation results indicate that the new control strategy can improve system efficiency under different SoH and different SoC conditions.

The windows shutters were applied into two similar compartments that were tested and the thermal behavior was analyzed.

A need exists for archetypal redox couples, with well-defined electrochemical properties, high solubility in relevant electrolytes, and broad availability, to serve as probe molecules.

Changes in conductivity, viscosity, and UV–vis absorbance as a function of state-of-charge are quantified. Cyclic voltammetry investigates the redox potential, reversibility, and diffusion coefficients of dilute solutions, while symmetric flow cell cycling determines the stability of the AcNH-TEMPO redox pair over long experiment times.

Despite these attractive features, NAqRFBs are still at an early stage of development and innovative design techniques are necessary to improve performance and decrease costs. In this work, we investigate multi-electron transfer, common ion exchange NAqRFBs. Common ion systems decrease the supporting electrolyte requirement, which subsequently improves active material solubility and decreases electrolyte cost. Voltammetric and electrolytic techniques are used to study the electrochemical performance and chemical compatibility of model redox active materials, iron (II) tris(2,2′-bipyridine) tetrafluoroborate (Fe(bpy)3(BF4)2) and ferrocenylmethyl dimethyl ethyl ammonium tetrafluoroborate (Fc1N112-BF4). These results help disentangle complex cycling behavior observed in flow cell experiments. Further, a simple techno-economic model demonstrates the cost benefits of employing common ion exchange NAqRFBs, afforded by decreasing the salt and solvent contributions to total chemical cost. This study highlights two new concepts, common ion exchange and multi-electron transfer, for NAqRFBs through a demonstration flow cell employing model active species. In addition, the compatibility analysis developed for asymmetric chemistries can apply to other promising species, including organics, metal coordination complexes (MCCs) and mixed MCC/organic systems, enabling the design of low cost NAqRFBs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Common ion; Energy storage; Metal coordination complex; Multi-electron; Non-aqueous redox flow battery; Rocking chair","Coordination reactions; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Design; Electric batteries; Electrolytes; Electron transitions; Electrons; Energy storage; Flow batteries; Ions; Iron compounds; Redox reactions; Secondary batteries; Common ions; Metal coordination; Multi-electron; Non-aqueous; Rocking chair; Ion exchange",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980344074

Herein, we report a simple and reproducible double-surfactant assembly-directed method to prepare monodisperse mesoporous TiO2 nanospheres. A double-surfactant system of n-dodecylamine (DDA) and Pluronic F127 was adopted to control the hydrolysis and condensation rates of tetrabutyl titanate in a mixture of water and alcohol at room temperature. In this process, the diameter size of mesoporous TiO2 nanospheres can be simply tuned from ∼50 to 250 nm by varying the concentration of H2O and surfactants. The double-surfactant system of DDA and F127 plays an effective role in determining the size, morphology, and monodispersity of mesoporous TiO2 nanospheres to reduce agglomeration during the sol-gel process. The resultant mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanospheres after solvothermal treatment at 160 °C are built of interpenetrating nanocrystals with a size of ∼10 nm, which are arranged to obtain a large number of connecting mesopores. Mesoporous TiO2 nanospheres with a small diameter size of around 50 nm possess a high surface area (∼160 m2/g) and mesopores with sizes of 4-30 nm. The small diameter size, high crystallinity, and mesoporous structure of TiO2 nanospheres lead to excellent performance in cycling stability and rate capability for lithium-ion batteries. After 500 cycles, the monodisperse mesoporous TiO2 nanospheres exhibit a charge capacity as high as 156 mAhg-1 without obvious fade, and the Coulombic efficiency can reach up to 100%. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","lithium storage; mesoporous materials; nanospheres; sol-gel process; surfactant assembly; synthesis; titania colloids","Energy conversion; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanospheres; Sol-gel process; Storage (materials); Surface active agents; Synthesis (chemical); Titanium dioxide; Energy conversion and storages; Hydrolysis and condensation; Lithium storages; Mesoporous anatase tio; Mesoporous structures; Solvothermal treatment; Surfactant assemblies; Titania; Mesoporous materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989252491

The resultant LiCoO2 has a well-built hierarchical structure, consisting of secondary micrometer-sized chains and sub-micrometer-sized primary flakes, while these primary LiCoO2 flakes have specifically exposed fast-Li+-diffused active {010} facets. Owing to this unique hierarchical structure, the chainlike LiCoO2 serves as a stable cathode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) operated at a high cutoff voltage up to 4.5 V, enabling highly reversible capacity, remarkable rate performance, and long-term cycle life. Specifically, the chainlike LiCoO2 can deliver a reversible discharge capacity as high as 168, 156, 150, and 120 mAh g-1 under the current density of 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 C, respectively, while about 85% retention of the initial capacity can be retained after 200 cycles under 1 C at room temperature. Moreover, the chainlike LiCoO2 also shows an excellent cycling stability at a wide operating temperature range, showing the capacity retention of ∼73% after 200 cycles at 55 °C and of ∼68% after 50 cycles at -10 °C, respectively.

Inspired by theoretical predictions, we herein validated the existence of a strong electrostatic affinity between polymeric carbon nitride (p-C3N4) and LiPSs, that can not only stabilize the redox cycling of LiPSs, but also enhance their redox kinetics. As a result, utilization of p-C3N4 in a Li-S battery has brought much improved performance in the aspects of high capacity and low capacity fading over prolonged cycling. Especially upon the application of p-C3N4, the kinetic barrier of the LiPS redox reactions has been significantly reduced, which has thus resulted in a better rate performance. Further density functional theory simulations have revealed that the origin of such kinetic enhancement was from the distortion of molecular configurations of the LiPSs anchored on p-C3N4. Therefore, this proof-of-concept study opens up a promising avenue to improve the performance of Li-S batteries by accelerating their fundamental electrochemical redox processes, which also has the potential to be applied in other electrochemical energy storage/conversion systems. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","adsorption; carbon nitride; graphene; lithium polysulfide; redox kinetics","Adsorption; Carbon nitride; Density functional theory; Electric batteries; Graphene; Kinetics; Lithium; Nitrides; Polymers; Polysulfides; Redox reactions; Secondary batteries; Sulfur; Density functional theory simulations; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical redox; Kinetically enhanced; Lithium sulfur batteries; Molecular configurations; Rate performance; Redox kinetics; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989238642

However, the energy consumption of gas cycling test is high. In order to reduce energy consumption, an optimization gas cycling test system was designed based on multi-stage storage and self-pressurized method in this paper. A dynamic simulation model which considers the process of refueling, pressure control, pre-cooling and discharging was also established to calculate the energy consumption. Using the model, the energy consumption of different system with different storage stages, different pressure, and different volumes was calculated. The results show that with the increase of gas storage stages, total energy consumption of the system decreases, but taking into account the complexity of the system, the stages should be less than three; In the range of 20–50 MPa and 1–4 m3, lower pressure and smaller volume of low pressure tank can not only reduce the gas the construction cost, but also reduce the energy consumption; In the range of 45–60 MPa and 1–3 m3, the effect of medium pressure tank on the energy consumption is not significant.

NiCo2S4@PPy-50/NF obtained under 50 s PPy electrodeposition shows a low charge-transfer resistance (0.31 ω) and a high area specific capacitance of 9.781 F/cm2 at a current density of 5 mA/cm2, which is two times higher than that of pristine NiCo2S4/NF (4.255 F/cm2). Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled using NiCo2S4@PPy-50/NF as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode. The resulting NiCo2S4@PPy-50/NF//AC device exhibits a high energy density of 34.62 Wh/kg at a power density of 120.19 W/kg with good cycling performance (80.64% of the initial capacitance retention at 50 mA/cm2 over 2500 cycles). The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the combined contribution of both component and unique core-shell heterostructure.

Herein, we demonstrate an efficient strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of a dominant commercial cathode material (LiCoO2) by constructing 3D hierarchical LiNixCoyO2 (h-LNCO). The h-LNCO presents porous spherical-shaped morphology at mesoscale while comprises interconnected primary nanoparticles at nanoscale. Such a unique morphology endows the h-LNCO with porous structure for easy penetration of electrolyte, relatively small size of primary particles with short Li+ ions diffusion length and abundant exposed surface in favor of Li+ intercalation/deintercalation. The synergism of these merits makes the h-LNCO exhibit superior electrochemical properties with high capacity, superior cyclability and rate capability, much better than the solid granular LNCO counterparts and commercial LiCoO2. This strategy of constructing porous hierarchical mesostructures could be extended to other electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cathode materials; Layered compounds; LiNixCoyO2; Lithium ion batteries; Mesostructures","Cathodes; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Cath-ode materials; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical performance; Layered compound; LiNixCoyO2; Mesostructures; Primary nanoparticles; Unique morphologies; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977630483

With a novel packed-bed configuration proposed recently, multi-layered solid-PCM (MLSPCM) thermocline TES is regarded as a more cost-effective alternative for current TES due to its lower thermocline degradation, which results in a higher energy utilization during the cyclic operation of the system comparing to other thermocline TES patterns. Thermal performance of several MLSPCM thermocline TES system with specific packed-bed configurations have been numerically evaluated both on pilot and practical scale. In this work, transient thermal behaviors of charging and discharging process in a cyclic operating state of a practical scale MLSPCM thermocline TES is investigated using a modified one-dimensional dispersion-concentric (D-C) model, while a comprehensive cost model is adopted to estimate capital cost of TES system. The influence of packed-bed configuration on several evaluation indexes of system performance such as cyclic operating time duration, total capacity factor and capital cost per kW ht are explored based on parametric studies. Optimum design configurations are identified to minimize capital cost per kW ht on the specific operating requirements. A cost comparison among different thermocline TES patterns as well as the two-tank TES are presented. The results show that the MLSPCM thermocline TES with an optimum packed-bed configuration is more cost-competitive than the two tank TES and any other thermocline TES systems. Overall, this study illustrates a methodology for packed-bed configuration optimization of a practical-scale MLSPCM thermocline TES and provide a design reference on cost-effective TES system for current CSP tower plants. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrating solar power; Cost optimization; Encapsulated phase change material; Multi-layered solid-PCM thermocline; Packed-bed configuration; Thermal energy storage","Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Packed beds; Phase change materials; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Stream flow; Tanks (containers); Thermal energy; Bed configuration; Concentrating solar power; Cost optimization; Encapsulated phase change materials; Multi-layered; Cost benefit analysis; cost analysis; encapsulation; energy conservation; energy market; energy use; optimization; performance assessment; phase transition; solar power; thermal power; thermocline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976530393

Some of these caverns, defined as abandoned caverns under adverse geological conditions (AGC), are expected to store hydrocarbon energies (natural gas or crude oil) to reduce the risk of potential disasters and simultaneously support the national strategic energy reserve of China. Herein, a series of investigations primarily related to the tightness and suitability of the caverns under AGC is performed. Laboratory measurements to determine the physical and mechanical properties as well as porosity and permeability of bedded salt cores from a near target cavern are implemented to determine the petro-mechanical properties and basic parameters for further study. The results show that the mechanical properties of the bedded rock salts are satisfactory for the stability of caverns. The interface between the salt and interlayers exhibits mechanical properties that are between those of rock salt and interlayers and in particular is not a weak zone. The silty mudstone interlayers have relatively high porosity and permeability, likely due to their low content of clay minerals and the presence of halite-filled cracks. The conditions for evaluating the tightness and suitability of a cavern for storing hydrocarbons are proposed, including “No tensile stress,” “Factor of Safety” and “A threshold of leakage amount”. Three-dimensional numerical geomechanical models are developed to indicate how gas seepage evolves around the caverns. The results show that the permeability of the interlayers is a key factor in influencing gas seepage in the vicinity of the caverns and that interlayers form primary channels for gas migration. By evaluating the fluid seepage around the cavern by the above conditions, the upper-threshold permeability of the interlayers is suggested to be no more than 10−16–10−17 m2 to guarantee tightness when storing natural gas and no more than 10−16 m2 when storing oil. In principle, this work provides references for alternate uses of abandoned caverns for hydrocarbon storage under adverse geological conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Abandoned salt caverns; Adverse geological conditions (AGC); Gas seepage; Hydrocarbon energies storage; Permeability; Tightness","Caves; Crude oil; Gases; Geology; Hydrocarbons; Mechanical properties; Natural gas; Porosity; Proven reserves; Safety engineering; Safety factor; Salt deposits; Seepage; Adverse geological; Gas seepage; Geological environment; Laboratory measurements; Physical and mechanical properties; Salt caverns; Suitability evaluation; Tightness; Mechanical permeability; cavern; clay mineral; energy budget; gas seepage; halite; hydrocarbon migration; hydrocarbon resource; mechanical property; mudstone; natural gas; permeability; physical property; porosity; tensile stress; three-dimensional modeling; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976470727

A smart solution has emerged in which the wasted energy in a vehicle's shock absorber is converted to an alternative energy for the cars themselves, and this is called an energy regenerative shock absorber. Whereas existing regenerative shock absorbers mainly focus on the methods of energy harvesting, there is no such regenerative shock absorber for use in extended range EVs. In this paper, we present a novel high-efficiency energy regenerative shock absorber using supercapacitors that is applied to extend the battery endurance of an EV. A renewable energy application scheme using regenerative shock absorbers for range extended EVs is designed and proposed for the first time. This system collects the wasted suspension power from the moving vehicle by replacing the conventional shock absorbers as these energies are normally dissipated through friction and heat. The proposed system consists of four main components: the vibration of the suspension input module, transmission module, generator module and power storage module. The suspension vibration induced by the road roughness acts as the system excitation to the energy regenerative shock absorber. The vibration is then transmitted through the mechanical transmission module, which changes bidirectional vibration into unidirectional rotation based on gears and a rack to drive the generator module. The power storage module stores the regenerative energy of the shock absorber in the supercapacitor, which is applied to the EV to improve the cruising mileage. Higher efficiency up to 54.98% at most and 44.24% on average were achieved in the simulation and bench tests is proof that the energy regenerative shock absorber is beneficial and promising in generating energy used for renewable energy applications in extended range EVs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Range extended electric vehicle; Regenerative; Renewable energy; Shock absorber; Supercapacitors","Automobile suspensions; Electric automobiles; Electric generators; Energy harvesting; Light transmission; Renewable energy resources; Supercapacitor; Suspensions (components); Vibrations (mechanical); Electric Vehicles (EVs); Mechanical transmission; Range extended electric vehicles; Regenerative; Renewable energies; Renewable energy applications; Renewable energy technologies; Unidirectional rotation; Shock absorbers; absorbance; alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; friction; nonrenewable resource; power generation; roughness; vibration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974851170

Unfortunately, most of the studies from smart building perspective only target on a single building with elaborated energy forecasting models. Few of them addresses the effects of multiple buildings on power grid operation. On the other hand, a few studies from smart grid area focus on multiple buildings and their influence on power grid, they usually, however, use simplified linear energy forecasting models, which are hard to guarantee the findings reflecting the cases in real fields. As a result, this research proposes to bridge this research gap, through developing and validating high fidelity energy forecasting models for a building cluster with multiple buildings and distributed energy systems, as well as creating a collaborative operation framework to determining the optimal operation strategies of this building cluster. The operation framework utilizes multi-objective optimizations to determine the operation strategies: building temperature setpoints, energy storage charging and discharging schedules, etc., using particle swarm optimization. Pareto curves for energy cost saving and thermal comfort maintaining are also derived with different thermal comfort requirements.

The developed approach is focused on support for decision making process on community level. Proposed approach includes mapping of biomass potential with defining both potential primary storage locations and potential locations of plant using geographic information system technologies. Also, it includes determining the optimal amount of biomass that can be justifiably used for energy purposes under current conditions by using the mathematical optimization with objective function related to maximizing net present value quotient.

In view of this issue, an innovator mini-reactor (9 cm3) with an ovoid geometry and a capability to generate and store hydrogen up to eight successive injections of fuel was designed. Hydrogen was generated from the catalytic hydrolysis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4), and both single and successive loadings were performed with excess of water (x = 16), at room temperature, in the presence of a powder unsupported Ni–Ru reused catalyst. The obtained results give emphasis to the importance of the reactor geometry and reveals the aptitude of the catalyst to be reused during successive loads of fuel without any treatment and minor loss of activity.

Light metal hydrides have attracted significant attention as potential candidates for energy storage. Remarkably, Al-containing hydrides, namely AlH3and M(AlH4)n, are among the most fascinating classes of materials, able to cycle up to 5.5 wt% of hydrogen at moderate temperatures. This review covers the recent research on the families of Al-based complex hydrides involving other light elements such as B and N. They were classified according to the charge of the Al-based complexes, as anionic, molecular, cationic or “autoionized” where Al is centering both the cation and the anion. The factors influencing the stability and the hydrogen purity of the series of anionic aluminium amides M[Al(NH2)4]n, borohydrides M[Al(BH4)4] and amidoboranes M[Al(NH2BH3)4], as well as molecular [Al(L)(BH4)3] (L = molecular ligands) and cation [Al(NH3)6]3+-based complexes are discussed. In particular, the ability of the strong Lewis acid Al3+to coordinate both the initial hydrogenated species as well as their dehydrogenation products makes it a good template for chemical transformations involving light chemical and complex hydrides. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Aluminium; Complex hydrides; Crystal structure; Hydrogen storage; New materials",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027922617

Key to their efficient operation is the use of a conductive additive which allows for volumetric charging and discharging of the electrochemically active species contained within the electrodes. Carbon black is commonly used for this purpose due to the relatively low concentrations needed to maintain electrical percolation. While carbon black supplies the desirable electrical properties for the application, it contributes detrimentally to the rheology characteristics of these concentrated suspensions. In this work, we develop a synthesis protocol to produce inorganic oxide particles with electrostatically adsorbed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxithiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). Using a combination of small angle neutron scattering (SANS), electron microscopy, and thin-film conductivity, we show that the synthesis scheme provides a flexible platform to form conductive PEDOT:PSS-SiO2 nanoparticle dispersions. Based on these measurements, we demonstrate that these particles are stable when dispersed in propylene carbonate. Using a combination of rheology and dielectric spectroscopy, we show that these stable dispersions facilitate electrical percolation at concentrations below their mechanical percolation threshold, and this percolation is maintained under flow. These results demonstrate the potential for strategies which seek to decouple mechanical and electrical percolation to allow for the development of higher performance conductive additives for slurry based flow batteries. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","composite; flow battery; nanoparticle; rheology; small angle neutron scattering","Additives; Carbon black; Composite materials; Conducting polymers; Dispersions; Elasticity; Electric batteries; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Flow batteries; Nanoparticles; Neutron scattering; Rheology; Secondary batteries; Solvents; Synthesis (chemical); Concentrated suspension; Conductive additives; Electrical percolation; Mechanical and electrical; Mechanical percolation threshold; Nano-particle dispersions; Polystyrene sulfonate; Rheology characteristics; Suspensions (fluids)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987804409

Several transition-metal vanadates, which can in situ form an elastic buffer to adapt the volume expansion during lithium uptake/removal, have recently attracted much attention as anode materials, since they have high capacity and superior cycling stability. Herein, Zn2(OH)3VO3 nanostructures are successfully fabricated for the first time by a facile hydrothermal method and also first studied as lithium ion anode material. The ultrathin Zn2(OH)3VO3 nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity close to 900 mAh g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 over 100 cycles. Even at a high current rate of 5 A g-1, capacity retention as high as 83% (by compared with the second discharge capacity) is still obtained after 500 cycles, showing a high-rate capability. Moreover, we also carefully investigated the lithium-storage mechanism of Zn2(OH)3VO3, and corresponding results reveal that the Zn2(OH)3VO3 nanosheets have in situ transformed into ZnO nanoparticles anchoring on lithiated vanadium oxides matrix. The synergistic effect of zinc and vanadium oxides upon lithium ions intercalation and the stable conductive skeleton of amorphous lithiated vanadium oxides matrix both contribute to the excellent battery performance of Zn2(OH)3VO3 nanosheets. Finally, a full cell composed of lithiated Zn2(OH)3VO3/LiFePO4 with a high energy density of 293 Wh kg-1 (vs total mass of active materials) at the current density of 100 mA g-1 was successfully assembled, which could cycle well over 100 cycles with 79% capacity retention and also exhibit good rate stability.

Exploring the simple and low cost production of anodes with excellent electrochemical performance remains a great challenge. Here, we used natural flower spikes of Typha orientalis as the bio-templates and organizers to prepare a novel two-dimensional (2D) porous print fabric-like α-Fe2O3 sheet with thickness of about 30 nm. The prepared large-area sheets were orderly assembled by many nanosheets or nanoparticles, and two kinds of pore structures, such as pores with average diameter of about 50 nm or pore channels with aspect ratio of ca. 4, presented between adjacent nanosheets. The pre-treatment by ammonium for flower spikes has a great effect on the microstructure and electrochemical performance of the products. As the anode material for lithium ion battery (LIB), the as-obtained porous print fabric-like α-Fe2O3 sheets show an initial discharge capacity of 2264 mA h g−1 and the specific capacity of 1028 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1, which is higher than the theoretical capacity of α-Fe2O3 (1007 mA h g−1).

It is attempted to illustrate the role of Pd[sbnd]Ag coating on hydrogenation performance of Zr-based alloys against gaseous impurities. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations along with energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) give evidences that the Pd[sbnd]Ag coating has been uniformly deposited on the surface of experimental alloys. Activation behavior and hydrogenation kinetics in pure H2 and mixture gases (H2 containing 1 vol.% air) are evaluated by using a Sieverts-type apparatus. The Pd[sbnd]Ag coating accelerates the hydrogenation kinetics and slightly decreases the hydrogen storage capacity of experimental Zr-based AB2 alloys. The poisoning effect of air gaseous impurities mainly deteriorates the hydrogen absorption capacity of experimental Zr-based alloys with Pd[sbnd]Ag coating at room temperature. The Pd[sbnd]Ag coated Zr0.9Ti0.1V2 preserves the fastest hydriding reaction rate at 303 K and 673 K among three experimental alloys. The slope value in the rapid absorbing stage (ka1) in mixture gases at each temperature of Pd[sbnd]Ag coated Zr-based AB2 alloys is quite higher than that of the corresponding bare alloy which indicates the uniform Pd[sbnd]Ag coating evidently improves the poison resistance capability of alloys in a wide temperature range.

To date there has been limited progress in implementing these systems due to the challenge of finding a high voltage high capacity cathode that is compatible with an electrolyte that can plate and strip the elemental metal. In order to accelerate the discovery of such a system, model systems are needed that alleviate some of the issues of incompatibility. This report demonstrates the ability of nickel hexacyanoferrate to electrochemically intercalate Mg, Ca and Zn ions from a nonaqueous electrolyte. This material has a relatively high insertion potential and low overpotential in the electrolytes used in this study. Furthermore, since it is not an oxide based cathode it should be able to resist attack by corrosive electrolytes such as the chloride containing electrolytes that are often used to plate and strip magnesium. This makes it an excellent cathode for use in developing and understanding the complex electrochemistry of multivalent ion batteries. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Calcium battery; Magnesium battery; Nickel hexacyanoferrate; Nonaqueous; XANES","Calcium; Cathodes; Chlorine compounds; Electric batteries; Ions; Magnesium printing plates; Plate metal; Strip metal; Corrosive electrolytes; High capacity cathodes; Insertion potential; Magnesium batteries; Nickel hexacyanoferrate; Non-aqueous; Non-aqueous electrolytes; XANES; Electrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997023971

The methoxy and phenolic functional groups in Lig can convert to quinone groups through the redox process and function for energy storage. However, it is difficult to directly utilize Lig's electroactivity, because of its insulativity. Herein, a composite of Lig/graphene hydrogel (Lig-GH) was fabricated from a mixture of Lig and graphene oxide (GO) via convenient hydrothermal process. It was found that the hydrothermal process temperature played a significant role in forming Lig-GH. In the present work, the effect of the mass ratio of Rm (GO: Lig) on the electrochemical properties of composite hydrogels was discussed. The results disclosed that the Lig-GH prepared at a mass ratio of Rm = 3:4 and temperature of 180 °C exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. The as-prepared hydrogel possessed high specific capacitance of 549.5 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte.

The properties of the assembled forms of the CuS nanosheets are determined by using the concentration of H2SO4 employed in the dealloying process. Spherical clusters composed of CuS nanosheets were fabricated by this process. These clusters have the highest specific surface areas provided by the nanosheets and exhibit high electrochemical and charge storage-release performances. The CuS spherical clusters showed a high specific capacitance of ∼276 F g−1 (at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in cyclic voltammetry tests) and ∼713 F g−1 (at a charge-discharge current of 1.0 A g−1). The high pseudocapacitive performance can be attributed to the highest specific surface area in our case and absence of volume change of the nanosheets.

More importantly, the H-TiO2 electrode exhibits a higher rate capability and better reversibility.

In this paper, nanoparticles-constructed LTO with extra surface lithium storage capability is successfully prepared in air at 600 °C via employing TiOSO4·2H2O as Ti source. The newly prepared nanoparticles-constructed LTO displays enhanced electrochemical performances, demonstrating ultrahigh reversible capacity of 173 mAh g-1 at 0.5C and superior rate performance of more than 145 mAh g-1 at 30C between 1.0 and 2.5 V vs. Li+/Li. The influences of specific surface area and crystallinity on the extra surface lithium storage capability of the sintered samples for LIBs are investigated in detail in terms of reversible capacity, cyclability and rate capability.

The stainless steel units were 1.5 m high cylinders with internal heat exchangers of tubes with fins. One unit was tested with 116 kg SAT with 6% extra water. Another unit was tested with 116.3 kg SAT with 0.5% Xanthan rubber as a thickening agent and 4.4% graphite powder. The heat exchange capacity rate during charge was significantly lower for the unit with SAT and Xanthan rubber compared to the unit with SAT and extra water. This was due to less convection in the thickened phase change material after melting. The heat content in the fully charged state and the heat released after solidification of the supercooled SAT mixtures at ambient temperature was higher for the unit with the thickened SAT mixture. The heat discharged after solidification of the supercooled SAT with extra water decreased over repeating charge and discharge cycles while the heat discharged from the SAT with Xanthan rubber remained stable. In both units, the solidification started spontaneously in the majority of the test cycles.

The wind power that cannot be directly injected in the power grid is usually curtailed. In addition, some islands need to desalinate seawater to produce fresh water, increasing the pressure on the power system, because desalination needs electricity. Nevertheless, the water scarcity problem of an island can be part of the solution of the problem of its integration of intermittent renewable energy sources. To tackle this issue, a system was proposed to use the excess wind power in desalination units and in a pumped hydro storage, resulting in an integrated power and water supply system that would minimize the wind power curtailed. This paper proposes a methodology to optimize the size and operational strategy of this wind powered desalination and pumped hydro storage system. The objective is to minimize the total annualized production costs, maximize the percentage of renewable energy sources in the total power production and minimize the wind power curtailed. To solve this optimization problem, a derivative free multiobjective optimization method (Direct MultiSearch) is used. This methodology is applied to the integrated power and water supply system proposed for the island of S. Vicente, in Cape Verde.

Considering the arbitrage capability of ESSs, their behaviors would be remarkably different from those of conventional generators, impacting the market equilibrium. These impacts would vary with the type of ESSs and the generation mix. Therefore, this paper formulates a multi-period market equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) to study the strategic behaviors of different types of ESSs and their impacts on the market outcomes, assuming that ESSs behave as price-makers. The EPEC model is established within a general framework, which considers the individual profit-maximization behaviors of different ESSs and generators, including thermal units, hydro units and renewable units.

In addition, driving cycles serve as a standardised measurement procedure for the certification of a vehicle's fuel economy and driving range. They also facilitate the evaluation of the economic and lifecycle costs of emerging vehicular technologies. However, discrepancies between existing driving cycles and real-world driving conditions exist due to a number of factors such as insufficient data, inadequate driving cycle development methodologies and methods to assess the representativeness of developed driving cycles. The novel aspect of the work presented here is the use of real-world data from electric vehicles, over a six month period, to derive a driving cycle appropriate for their assessment. A stochastic and statistical methodology is used to develop and assess the representativeness of the driving cycle against a separate set of real world electric vehicle driving data and the developed cycle performs well in that comparison. Although direct comparisons with internal combustion engine driving cycles are not that informative or relevant due to the marked differences between how they and electric vehicles operate, some discussion around how the developed electric vehicle cycle relates to them is also included. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery range; Driving cycle; Electric vehicle","Digital storage; Electric vehicles; Fuel economy; Internal combustion engines; Stochastic systems; Battery range; Development methodology; Driving cycle; Energy storage systems; Measurement procedures; Real-world drivings; Statistical methodologies; Vehicular technologies; Vehicles; certification; combustion; design; electric vehicle; energy use; engine; life cycle analysis; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969543156

To compensate for prediction error, a control strategy is accordingly designed to operate a standby energy storage element (ESE) to avoid energy imbalance within HES. The proposed operations optimizer allows systematic control of energy conversion for maximal economic value. Simulation results of two specific HES configurations illustrate the proposed methodology and computational capability. Economic advantages of such operations optimizer and associated flexible operations are demonstrated by comparing the economic performance of flexible operations with that of constant operations.

In this study, another 2-D nanosheet, that is a borophene layer, has been predicted to be utilized as a promising anode material for high-performance Li ion battery based on density functional theory calculations. Our study has revealed that Li atom can combine strongly with borophene surface strongly and easily, and exist as a pure Li+ state. A rather small energy barrier (0.007 eV) of Li diffusion leads to an ultrahigh diffusivity along an uncorrugated direction of borophene, which is estimated to be 104 (105) times faster than that on MoS2 (graphene) at room temperature. A high Li storage capacity of 1239 mA·h/g can be achieved when Li content reaches 0.5. A low average operating voltage of 0.466 V and metallic properties result in that the borophene can be used as a possible anode material. Moreover, the properties of Li adsorption and diffusion on the borophene affected by Ag (111) substrate have been studied. It has been found that the influence of Ag (111) substrate is very weak. Li atom can still bind on the borophene with a strong binding energy of a2.648 eV. A small energy barrier of 0.033 eV can be retained for Li diffusion along the uncorrugated direction, which can give rise to a high Li diffusivity. Besides, the performances of borophene-based Na ion battery have been explored. Our results suggest that an extremely high rate capability could be expected in borophene-based Li ion battery. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","borophene; energy barrier; Li diffusion; Li ion battery; Li storage capacity","Anodes; Binding energy; Bins; Density functional theory; Diffusion; Diffusion barriers; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Energy barriers; Graphene; Ions; Lithium alloys; Lithium-ion batteries; Molybdenum compounds; Product design; Secondary batteries; Substrates; borophene; Charging/discharging; High rate capability; High-performance lithium-ion batteries; Li diffusion; Li-storage; Metallic properties; Two Dimensional (2 D); Lithium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985914787

Among the class of TMDs, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is perhaps the most studied because of its natural abundance and use in optoelectronics, energy storage and energy conversion applications. Understanding the fundamental structure-property relations is key for tailoring the enhancement in the above-mentioned applications. Here, we report a controlled powder vaporization synthesis of MoS2 flower-like structures consisting of vertically grown layers of MoS2 exhibiting exposed edges. This growth is readily achievable on multiple substrates, such as graphite, silicon, and silicon dioxide. The resulting MoS2 flowers are highly crystalline and stoichiometric. Further observations using contact angle indicate that MoS2 flowers exhibit the highest reported contact angle of ∼160 ± 10°, making the material super hydrophobic. This surface wettability was further tuned by changing the edge chemistry of the MoS2 flowers using an ozone etching treatment. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) measurements indicate that the surface treated with UV-ozone showed a reduction in the Tafel slope from 185 to 54 mV/dec, suggesting an increase in the amount of reactive surface to generate hydrogen. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","contact angle; HERs; MoS2; nano flowers; transition metal dichalcogenides","Contact angle; Energy conversion; Hydrophobicity; Nanoflowers; Ozone; Transition metals; Wetting; Flower-like structures; Fundamental structures; HERs; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Molybdenum disulfide; Multiple substrates; Surface wettability; Transition metal dichalcogenides; Molybdenum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985894827

The encapsulation of sulfur in porous nanocarbons is expected to benefit the Li+ migration, yet the e- conduction is still to be improved due to a low graphitization degree of a conventional carbon substrate, especially that pyrolyzed from carbohydrates or polymers. Aiming at facilitating the e- conduction in the cathode, here we propose to use ketjen black, a highly graphitized nanocarbon building block to form a conductive network for electrons in a biomass-derived, hierarchically porous carbon sponge by a easily scaled-up approach at a low cost. The specifically designed carbon host ensures a high loading and good retention of active sulfur, while also provides a faster electron transmission to benefit the lithiation/delithiation kinetics of sulfur. The sulfur cathode prepared from the carbon network shows excellent cycling and rate performance in a Li-S battery, rendering its practicality for emerging energy storage opportunities such as grids or automobiles. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","electronic conductivity; ketjen black; lithium-sulfur battery; porous carbon; sodium alginate; sulfur cathode","Cathodes; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Graphitization; Lithium; Porous materials; Secondary batteries; Sodium alginate; Sulfur; Electronic conductivity; Ketjen black; Lithium sulfur batteries; Porous carbons; Sulfur cathodes; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984973137

The physicochemical characterizations show that the viscosity increases with the increasing concentration of VOSO4 and H2SO4, and the conductivity increases with the increasing concentration of H2SO4 while decreases with the increasing concentration of VOSO4. Both CV and EIS results demonstrate that the electrolyte with 1.6 mol L−1 VOSO4 and 2.8 mol L−1 H2SO4 presents the best electrochemical performance because of the coupling effect of the viscosity, conductivity and electrochemical activity. Different with the half-cell electrochemical tests, the battery performance of VFB is not only dependent on the electrochemical activity of electrode/electrolyte interface, but also closely related to the conductivity of electrolyte and diffusion rates of the active particles between anolyte and catholyte. Taking the battery efficiencies and capacity into consideration, VFB with 1.6 mol L−1 VOSO4 and 2.8 mol L−1 H2SO4 exhibits the optimal electrochemical performance.

One of the challenges of CHS materials is addressing the energy barriers required to break the chemical bonds and release the hydrogen. Coupling CHS reactions that are endothermic and exothermic during dehydrogenation can improve onboard energy efficiency and thermal control for the system, making such materials viable. Acceptable coupling between reactions requires both thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. In this work, models were developed to predict the reaction enthalpy and rate required to achieve high conversions for both reactions based on experimental measurements. Modeling results show that the coupling efficiency of exothermic and endothermic reactions is more sensitive to the ratio of the exothermic and endothermic enthalpies than to the ratio of the rates of the two steps. Modeling results also show that a slower endothermic step rate is desirable to permit sufficient heating of the reactor by the exothermic step. We look at two examples of a sequential and parallel reaction scheme and provide some of the first published insight into the required temperature range to maximize the hydrogen release from 1,2-BN cyclohexane and indoline. © 2016","Chemical hydrogen storage; Fuel cell; Kinetic modeling; Reaction coupling","Bond strength (chemical); Energy efficiency; Enthalpy; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydrogen; Hydrogen bonds; Storage (materials); Chemical hydrogen storage; Compressed hydrogens; Endothermic enthalpy; Endothermic reactions; High storage density; Hydrogen for fuel cells; Kinetic modeling; Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021637980

However, the power density is relatively low, leading to significant increase in the system cost. Apart from the kinetic and electronic conductivity improvement, the mass transport enhancement is also necessary to further increase the power density and reduce the system cost. To better understand the mass transport limitations, in the research, the space-varying and time-varying characteristic of the mass transport polarization is investigated based on the analysis of the flow velocity and reactant concentration in the bulk electrolyte by modeling. The result demonstrates that the varying characteristic of mass transport polarization is more obvious at high SoC or high current densities. To soften the adverse impact of the mass transport polarization, a new rectangular plug flow battery with a plug flow and short flow path is designed and optimized based on the mass transport polarization regulation (reducing the mass transport polarization and improving its uniformity of distribution). The regulation strategy of mass transport polarization is practical for the performance improvement in VFBs, especially for high power density VFBs. The findings in the research are also applicable for other flow batteries and instructive for practical use. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Flow field design; High power density; Mass transport polarization; Modeling; Plug flow battery; Vanadium flow battery","Electric batteries; Electrolytes; Flow fields; Flow velocity; Integrated circuit design; Models; Polarization; System-on-chip; Vanadium; Electronic conductivity; Energy storage applications; Flow-field design; High current densities; High power density; Mass transport limitation; Reactant concentrations; Time-varying characteristics; Flow batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977160036

Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology could provide a new strategy for water wave energy harvesting. In this work, we investigated the charging characteristics of utilizing a wavy-structured TENG to charge a capacitor under direct water wave impact and under enclosed ball collision, by combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies. The analytical equations of the charging characteristics were theoretically derived for the two cases, and they were calculated for various load capacitances, cycle numbers, and structural parameters such as compression deformation depth and ball size or mass. Under the direct water wave impact, the stored energy and maximum energy storage efficiency were found to be controlled by deformation depth, while the stored energy and maximum efficiency can be optimized by the ball size under the enclosed ball collision. Finally, the theoretical results were well verified by the experimental tests.

Using the object oriented Modelica language, a new library providing component models such as photovoltaic (PV) cells, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, electrolyzers, hydrogen storage tanks, batteries and electronic converters is developed and used to build different HRES models. Since the components are represented under realistic assumptions, the resulting models exhibit frequent discontinuities, strong non-linearities and combinations of slow and fast dynamics (i.e. stiffness). As these features impose severe limitations to classic numerical simulation solvers, we analyze the use of a new family of numerical algorithms called Quantized State Systems (QSS) that overcome most of those difficulties. The results obtained show that these algorithms applied to realistic HRES are more than one order of magnitude faster than the most efficient classic solvers, allowing to simulate these systems in reasonable times. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems; Modelica; Quantized State System simulation","Algorithms; Digital libraries; Energy efficiency; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydrogen storage; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Efficient simulation; Electronic converters; Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES); Hybrid renewable energy systems; Hydrogen storage tank; Modelica; Numerical algorithms; Quantized state systems; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978468750

Herein, a general and scalable one-pot hydrogel-derived route has been developed for the construction of nanoporous multinary alloy networks via facile coordination-reduction processes using novel cyano-bridged coordination polymer hydrogels (cyanogels) as precursors. The formation of nanoporous Sn-In-Ni ternary alloy network has been illustrated as an example by using a Sn(IV)-In(III)-Ni(II)-Co(III) quaternary metallic cyanogel as a precursor. Meanwhile, nanoporous Sn-Ni binary alloy and metallic In networks have also been synthesized through coordination-reduction routes using Sn(IV)-Ni(II) and In(III)-Co(III) cyanogels as precursors, respectively. Moreover, the anodic performance of the nanoporous Sn-In-Ni ternary alloy network has been examined as a proof-of-concept demonstration of its structural and compositional superiorities toward lithium storage. Compared with separate Sn-Ni and In networks, the Sn-In-Ni ternary alloy network manifests markedly enhanced lithium-storage performance in terms of reversible capacities, cycling stability, and so forth, making it an ideal anodic candidate for advanced LIBs with long cycle life and high energy/power densities. Moreover, the proposed hydrogel-derived coordination-reduction strategy would open up new opportunities for constructing nanoporous multinary alloy networks as advanced anodes for LIBs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The natural and renewable biomass material, leonardite fulvic acid (LFA) is used as the carbon source. The hierarchical porous structures are composed of numerous nanospheres with interconnected 3D carbon architectures which are in favor of enhancing the electrical conductivity and facilitating ion transport by providing small resistances and short diffusion pathways. The resultant PCAs are advantageous as electrodes for electrochemical energy storage. For example, the PCAs2 sample exhibits a superior high specific capacitance of 368 F g-1 at a current density of 0.05 A g-1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte, which can still remain 228 F g-1 when the current density increases to 100 A g-1.

Li-S batteries have been attracted increasing attention owing to the high theoretical capacity of element sulfur (S, 1672 mAh g-1). Nevertheless, the insulation nature of the S element and polysulfide shuttle effect, resulting in low S utilization and poor cycling stability, are the main obstacles to widespread practical utilization of Li-S batteries. To tackle these issues, a well-designed hybrid cathode, consisted of S-infused activated carbon fiber (ACF) cloth and a thin TiO2 wrapping layer (TiO2-ACF/S), is developed in this work with the TiO2 wrapping layer as a polysulfide chemisorption layer, while the ACF cloth being a conductive network. Compared to the pure S and ACF/S cathodes, the TiO2-ACF/S hybrid cathode, with a high S loading of about 3.0 mg cm-2, displays an improved initial specific capacity (915 mAh g-1 at 0.2C), cycle stability (capacity retention of 77% after 100 cycles, 702 mAh g-1), and rate ability (438 mAh g-1 at 5C). The enhanced electrochemical performances of TiO2-ACF/S hybrid cathode are attributed to the synergistic effects from TiO2 (polysulfide chemisorption material), ACF (electronically conductive material) and S (high hosting capacity of Li ions). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thus the waste resources from power could be sustainably recycled for new energy storage devices. The SBP containing manganese dioxide (MnO2) and graphite powder was obtained from the spent zinc-carbon battery, in which MnO2 was utilized for the oxidative polymerization of pyrrole. The binary graphite/polypyrrole (G/PPy) and ternary MnO2/graphite/polypyrrole (MnO2/G/PPy) nanocomposites were obtained under different reaction conditions, such as hydrochloric acid concentration, MnO2/pyrrole molar ratio, sodium p-toluene sulfonate (p-TSNa)/pyrrole molar ratio, and acid solution volume. The results showed that the electrochemical properties of the G/PPy nanocomposites were better than those of the MnO2/G/PPy. Under the optimized preparation condition (100 mL of 1.5 mol/L HCl with 0.03 mol/L pyrrole, and MnO2/pyrrole/p-TSNa molar ratio of 1:1:1), the G/PPy nanocomposite possessed a relatively high Coulombic efficiency, a high electrical conductivity of 20.0 S/cm, and the highest specific capacitance of 212.4 F/g at 1 mV/s scan rate tested by CV, as well as a retention of 89.5% of its original capacitance after 1000 cycles. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Poly (sodium-p-styrene-sulfonate) (PSS) plays a key role in efficiently controlling the morphology. Moreover a model that explains the formation mechanism of rosette-type Ni-Al LDH is proposed. The model is verified by a series of experiments. SEM images reveal that the three-dimensional (3D) structure of Ni-Al LDH consists of individual nanosheets that form a rosette-type morphology thus improving its mechanical stability. The electrochemical properties of the material were studied by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Owing to the greatly improved faradaic redox reaction and mass transfer, the 3D Ni-Al LDH structure exhibits excellent energy storage performance. This positive electrode material shows a high specific capacity of 788 C/g (the corresponding area-normalized capacity is 23.64 C/cm2) at a charge/discharge current density of 1 A/g and retains 82.9% of its capacity after 1000 cycles at current densities of 2 A/g.

In this paper, femtosecond pulses are used to study the reversible phase transition processes of Cr-doped Sb2Te3 films with different initial states. The SET processes are all induced by multiple pulses and relate to the increase of crystallized partial in the irradiated spot. When the Cr concentration is 5.3 at % or 10.5 at %, the crystallization mechanism is still growth-dominated as Sb2Te3, which is beneficial for high speed and high density storage, whereas the necessary crystallization energy increases with more Cr-dopants, leading to higher amorphous thermal stability. RESET results by multiple pulses show that Cr-dopants will not increase the power consumption, and the increase in Cr-dopants could greatly increase the antioxidant capacity. Single-pulse experiments show that the RESET process involves the competition of melting/amorphization and recrystallization. The reversible SET/RESET results on different initial states are quite different from each other, which is mainly due to the different surroundings around the irradiated spot. Crystalline surroundings provide higher thermal conductivity and lead to easier crystallization, whereas amorphous surroundings were the reverse. All in all, Cr-doped Sb2Te3 films with suitable composition have advantages for storage with high density, better thermal stability, and lower power consumption; and the suitable initial states could ensure better reversible phase transition performances. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","Cr-doped; femtosecond pulse; initial state; phase change; Sb2Te3","Doping (additives); Electric power utilization; Electromagnetic pulse; Optical disk storage; Phase change materials; Storage (materials); Thermal conductivity; Thermodynamic stability; Transients; Ultrafast lasers; Ultrashort pulses; Antioxidant capacity; Cr-doped; Crystallization energy; Crystallization mechanisms; Initial state; Lower-power consumption; Phase Change; Reversible phase transition; Phase change memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983372210

For the moment, the studies still concentrate on the preparation of new electrode materials for SIBs to meet the applicability. Herein, one new P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn5/9Al1/9O2 (NMA) cathode material is successfully prepared via a simple and facile liquid-state method. The prepared NMA is layered transition metal oxide, which can keep stable crystal structure during sodiation/desodiation as demonstrated by the ex situ X-ray diffraction, and its electrochemical properties can be further enhanced by connecting the cake-like NMA microparticles with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) using a ball milling method. Electrochemical tests show that the formed RGO-connected NMA (NMA/RGO) can deliver a higher reversible capacity of up to 138 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and also exhibit a superior high-rate capabilities and cycling stability in comparison to pure NMA. The much improved properties should be attributed to the reduced particle size and improvement of electrical conductivity and apparent Na+ diffusion due to RGO incorporation, which is comprehensively verified by the electrochemical technologies of galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at various scan rate as well as ex-situ X-ray diffraction studies. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","cathode; diffusion coefficient; layered transition metal oxide; reduced graphene oxide; sodium ion batteries","Aluminum; Ball milling; Cathodes; Crystal structure; Cyclic voltammetry; Diffusion; Electric batteries; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrodes; Graphene; Ions; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Manganese; Metal ions; Metallic compounds; Metals; Nickel; Particle size; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; X ray diffraction; Electrical conductivity; Electrochemical technology; Electrochemical test; Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Techniques; Reduced graphene oxides; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Sodium ion batteries; Transition-metal oxides; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983371852

Formic acid is a safe and sustainable hydrogen storage medium with many advantages, including high hydrogen content, nontoxicity, and low cost. In this work, a series of highly active catalysts for hydrogen production from formic acid are successfully synthesized by controllably depositing Pd onto Ag nanoplates with different Ag nanofacets, such as Ag{111}, Ag{100}, and the nanofacet on hexagonal close packing Ag crystal (Ag{hcp}). Then, the Pd-Ag nanoplate catalysts are supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon black to prevent the aggregation of the catalysts. The research reveals that the high activity is attributed to the formation of Pd-Ag alloy nanofacets, such as Pd-Ag{111}, Pd-Ag{100}, and Pd-Ag{hcp}. The activity order of these Pd-decorated Ag nanofacets is Pd-Ag{hcp} &gt; Pd-Ag{111} &gt; Pd-Ag{100}. Particularly, the activity of Pd-Ag{hcp} is up to an extremely high value, i.e., TOF{hcp} = 19 000 ± 1630 h-1 at 90 °C (lower limit value), which is more than 800 times higher than our previous quasi-spherical Pd-Ag alloy nanocatalyst. The initial activity of Pd-Ag{hcp} even reaches (3.13 ± 0.19) × 106 h-1 at 90 °C.

The results indicate that due to the formation of non-hexagonal rings in the defective BNNT model arising from the removal of a B[sbnd]N bond, the TM preferentially occupies the nitrogen over the boron site of the defect. Among nanotubes doped with TMs, Titanium and Vanadium exhibits qualities appropriate to act as a media for hydrogen storage. Hybridization of the 3d of both Ti and V orbital with the H-1s orbital contributes to the hydrogen adsorption. Ti and V clustering was suppressed by preferential binding of Ti/V atoms on BNNT defects.

It is a great challenge to recycle tons of waste printed circuit boards (PCB) produced every year for clean environment while creating values. In this work, low cost, high quality activated carbons (ACs) were synthesized from non-metallic fractions (NMF) of waste PCB to offer a great potential for applications of electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). After recovering metal from waste PCB, hierarchical porous carbons were produced from NMF by carbonization and activation processes. The experimental results exhibit that some pores were formed after carbonization due to the escape of impurity atoms introduced by additives in NMF. Then the pore structure was further tailored by adjusting the activation parameters. Roles of micropores and non-micropores in charge storage were investigated when the hierarchical porous carbons were applied as electrode of EDLCs. The highest specific capacitance of 210 F g-1 (at 50 mA g-1) and excellent rate capability were achieved when the ACs possessing a proper micropores/non-micropores ratio.

The so-called ""Solid Dispersion Redox Couple"" incorporates solid electroactive materials dispersed in organic lithium-ion battery electrolyte as its flowing suspension. In this work, a unique and systematic characterization approach has been used to study the flow battery redox couple in half cell demonstrations relative to a lithium electrode. An electrolyte laden with Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) has been characterized in multiple specially designed lithium half cell configurations. The flow battery redox couple described in this report has relatively low viscosity, especially in comparison to other flow batteries with solid active materials. The lack of carbon additive allows characterization of the electrochemical properties of the electroactive material in flow without the complication of conductive additives and unambiguous observation of the electrorheological coupling in these dispersed particle systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Results indicated that the restack behavior of the NSs of EG which is easy to be induced by solvent removal was effectively avoided by this solution-free route. Well-crystallized Fe3O4-NPs with a dimension of &lt;5 nm were observed to be homogeneously anchored on these NSs.

After 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1, the charge capacity still reached 728 mA h g-1, which was 283% higher than that of pure EG.

The size of the filament was estimated at about 1 nm in diameter. Hot filament increases the temperature of the surrounding high resistivity oxide, causing it to conduct and carry a significant fraction of the total current. The current spreading results in slowing down the filament temperature increase at higher power. The results of thermometry have been corroborated by HRTEM analysis of the as-fabricated and switched RRAM devices. The functional HfAlOx layer in as-fabricated devices is amorphous. In devices that were switched, we detected a small crystalline region of 10-15 nm in size. The crystallization temperature of the HfAlOx was determined to be 850 K in an independent annealing experiment.

However, designing the metal oxide/supports interfaces with highly enhanced conductivity and cycle durability remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate an in-situ growth technique to synthesize a Sn/SnO2@C composite with nano-Sn species attached on surface of carbon spheres (denoted as Sn/SnO2@C) during the carbonization of a sol-gel precursors of tin (IV) tetrachloride pentahydrate (SnCl4·5H2O) and Resorcinol-Formaldehyde (Sn4+-RF) in N2. We investigate the nucleation and crystal growth of Sn/SnO2 from Sn4+-RF precursor to Sn/SnO2@C composite with the variation of the concentration of acid value and heat-treatment temperature. Sn/SnO2@C-(1.0, 800) composite as supercapacitor electrode achieves a maximum specific capacitance of 906.8 F g-1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1 in 6 M KOH solution, and an excellent cycle durability of 2000 cycles at 5 A g-1. The electrochemical performances demonstrate that charge storage occurs in Sn/SnO2@C mainly due to redox reactions between the binary oxidation states: Sn→Sn(OH)62-(IV) in basic electrolyte, hierarchical porosity and Sn/SnO2@C distinct structure, which is formed in situ.

In this work, these issues are significantly relieved by introducing polar SnO2 or SnS2 species into the S/C composite. SnO2- or SnS2-stabilized sulfur in porous carbon composites (SnO2/S/C and SnS2/S/C) have been obtained through a baked-in-salt or sealed-in-vessel approach at 245 °C, starting from metallic tin (mp 231.89 °C), excess sulfur, and porous carbon. Both of the in situ-formed SnO2 and SnS2 in the two composites could ensure chemical interaction with lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates proven by theoretical calculation. Compared to SnO2/S/C, the SnS2/S/C sample affords a more appropriate binding effect and shows lower charge transfer resistance, which is important for the efficient redox reaction of the adsorbed LiPS intermediates during cycling. When used as cathodes for Li-S batteries, the SnS2/S/C composite with sulfur loading of 78 wt % exhibits superior electrochemical performance. It delivers reversible capacities of 780 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. When further coupled with a Ge/C anode, the full cell also shows good cycling stability and efficiency. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","chemical interaction; energy storage; lithium sulfur batteries; tin dioxide; tin disulfide","Carbon carbon composites; Cathodes; Charge transfer; Energy storage; IV-VI semiconductors; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Lithium sulfur batteries; Porous materials; Reaction intermediates; Redox reactions; Semiconducting tin compounds; Sulfur dioxide; Tin dioxide; Charge transfer resistance; Chemical interactions; Composite cathode; Electrochemical performance; Physical confinement; Reversible capacity; Theoretical calculations; Tin disulfides; Phosphorus compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982711382

Carbonization of these fiber mats at 800 °C generates metallic Ni-encapsulated NiO/MnOx/carbon composite fibers with average BET surface area (150 m2/g) almost 3 times higher than those reported for nonporous metal oxide nanofibers. The average diameter (∼900 nm) of these fiber composites is nearly invariant of chemical composition and can be easily tuned by the dope concentration and electrospinning conditions. The metallic Ni nanoparticle encapsulation of NiO/MnOx/C fibers leads to enhanced electrical conductivity of the fibers, while the block copolymers template an internal nanoporous morphology and the carbon in these composite fibers helps to accommodate volumetric changes during charging. These attributes can lead to lithium ion battery anodes with decent rate performance and long-term cycle stability, but performance strongly depends on the composition of the composite fibers. The composite fibers produced from a dope where the metal nitrate is 66% Ni generates the anode that exhibits the highest reversible specific capacity at high rate for any composition, even when including the mass of the nonactive carbon and Ni0 in the calculation of the capacity. On the basis of the active oxides alone, near-theoretical capacity and excellent cycling stability are achieved for this composition. These cooperatively assembled hierarchical composites provide a platform for fundamentally assessing compositional dependencies for electrochemical performance. Moreover, this electrospinning strategy is readily scalable for the fabrication of a wide variety of nanoporous transition metal oxide fibers. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","block copolymer; electrochemical energy storage; electrospinning; nanofibers; ordered mesopores; self-assembly","Anodes; Block copolymers; Carbonization; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Electrospinning; Fibers; Lithium alloys; Metallic compounds; Metals; Nanofibers; Nickel; Nitrates; Secondary batteries; Self assembly; Spinning (fibers); Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Amphiphilic block copolymers; Electrical conductivity; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical performance; Lithium-ion battery anodes; Nanoporous morphologies; Ordered mesopores; Reversible specific capacity; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982706299

Yet, the future cost of energy storage technologies is uncertain, and the value that they can bring to the system depends on multiple factors. Moreover, the marginal value of storage diminishes as more energy storage capacity is deployed. To explore the potential value of energy storage in deep decarbonization of the electricity sector, we assess the impact of increasing levels of energy storage capacity on both power system operations and investments in generation capacity using a generation capacity expansion model with detailed unit commitment constraints. In a case study of a system with load and renewable resource characteristics from the U.S. state of Texas, we find that energy storage delivers value by increasing the cost-effective penetration of renewable energy, reducing total investments in nuclear power and gas-fired peaking units, and improving the utilization of all installed capacity. However, we find that the value delivered by energy storage with a 2-hour storage capacity only exceeds current technology costs under strict emissions limits, implying that substantial cost reductions in battery storage are needed to justify large-scale deployment. In contrast, storage resources with a 10-hour storage capacity deliver value consistent with the current cost of pumped hydroelectric storage. In general, while energy storage appears essential to enable decarbonization strategies dependent on very high shares of wind and solar energy, storage is not a requisite if a diverse mix of flexible, low-carbon power sources is employed, including flexible nuclear power. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Capacity planning; Climate change; Decarbonization; Energy storage; Renewable energy integration","Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Decarbonization; Electric energy storage; Electric industry; Energy storage; Nuclear energy; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Capacity planning; Electrical energy storages; Energy storage capacity; Large-scale deployment; Operational flexibility; Power system operations; Renewable energy integrations; Variable renewable energies; Investments; climate change; cost analysis; electricity generation; electricity industry; expansion; nuclear power; renewable resource; solar power; spatiotemporal analysis; storage; utility sector; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966397549

It first estimates bare minimum requirements for these homes to start emerging from energy poverty. Guidance is given on optimal selection of the most important device for such homes: the light bulb. Along with other essential devices, this gives a daily electrical load of 500 W h, 42 A h at 12 V DC. Building on earlier experimental work on validating TRNSYS in Cape Town, it extends usage of the software to the rest of SSA, aiming to recommend panel and balance of system component sizes to meet the above load all year round. Use is made of panel slopes derived in a related piece of work to formulate an optimisation model for selecting panel-battery-charge controller combinations. A survey of South Africa-made panels and components is done. Then, a method of solving the model is demonstrated by an example in Uganda which selects from the surveyed components to satisfy two alternative technical objectives of 'least battery storage' and 'smallest panel size'. At each of the other 151 stations in SSA, the model is solved only for the first objective. The overall results are then mapped using MATLAB®. It is concluded that from a 'smallest battery storage' perspective, usable battery storage capacities in the region range between 70 and 360 A h, with the biggest being in equatorial/tropical rain forest areas of Congo basin and along the mid-western coastal areas. Panel sizes range between 160 and 275 Wp. The dominant recommendation on charge controllers is 15 A. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery selection; Charge controller; Energy poor; Mapping sub-Sahara Africa; PV panel; Rural electrification","Controllers; Electric batteries; Incandescent lamps; Mapping; MATLAB; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Rural areas; Surveys; Battery selection; Charge controllers; Energy poor; PV panel; Rural electrification; Sub-Sahara Africa; Secondary batteries; coastal zone; electricity; equipment; model validation; optimization; photovoltaic system; rainforest; residential energy; rural area; rural electrification; software; tropical region; Cape Town; Congo Basin; South Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Uganda; Western Cape",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965136404

We find that all these compounds studied are dynamically stable. For LaNi3.8Al1.2−xMnxH (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) hydrides, Al only substitutes Ni at 3g0 site, H occupies 12n tetrahedral site. The structural optimizations indicate that Mn prefers to substitute Ni at 3g1 site. Mn substitutions for Ni and Al decrease their stabilities. A detailed analysis of bonding interactions reveals that the covalent bonds of H with one Ni or Mn at 3g1 site and two Ni at 2c site are mainly responsible for the stabilities of these compounds. We also present a comprehensive investigation of phonon spectra and vibrational thermodynamics of LaNi5−xAlxH (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1) and LaNi3.8Al1.2−xMnxH (x = 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6). We find that all phonon vibrations have contribution to their vibrational enthalpies; in contrast, the low-frequency phonon vibrations mainly dominate their vibrational entropies. The calculated accuracy of low-frequency phonon vibrations is closely related to crystal symmetry, supercell size and atomic distribution in selected supercell. Generally, calculated enthalpies are more accurate than calculated entropies with respect to their experimental values. We present in the current research a first-principles method to predict the variation of enthalpy with hydrogen content at hydrogenation or dehydrogenation plateau and then to identify the so-called plateau enthalpy of each La–Ni based hydrogen storage alloy. By using this method, we find that the partial substitutions of Ni by Al decrease the so-called plateau enthalpy but impair the hydrogen storage capacity obviously, while Mn and Al substitutions for Ni not only decrease the so-called plateau enthalpy but also extend the plateau length. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Bonding interactions; Formation energy; Stability; Thermodynamic properties",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028266995

The design stage includes determination of the topology of the electrical system, energy flow analysis, and a determination of the energy-storage system. Due to the markedly changing loads, supercapacitors with high specific power and high durability seem the best choice. A control strategy based on Pontryagin's minimum principle is proposed considering hydrogen consumption, the state of charge of the supercapacitors, and fuel cell durability in the cost functions. With the selected design and proposed strategy, we propose a power source sizing methodology, and its economic influence is evaluated for both present and future FCHCVs. This study was performed with a system-level model of an FCHCV in MATLAB environment. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed strategy.

Effects of Ni content and milling time on the gaseous hydrogen storage thermodynamics and kinetics of alloys were investigated systematically. The structures of as-cast and milled alloys were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The pressure-composition isotherms (P-C-T) and the hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics of the as-milled alloys were measured by an automatically controlled Sievert's apparatus and a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (SDT-Q600) with a H2detector. Thermodynamic parameters (ΔH and ΔS) for the hydrogen absorption and desorption of alloys were calculated from Van't Hoff equation. Hydrogen desorption activation energy of alloy hydride was also estimated by using Arrhenius and Kissinger methods. It is found that the variation of Ni content brings on a slight effect on the thermodynamic properties of the alloys, but it significantly improves the hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics. The improved gaseous hydrogen storage kinetics of alloys are considered to be ascribed to a decrease in hydrogen desorption activation energy caused by increasing Ni content and prolonging milling time. © 2016","Activation energy; Hydrogen storage; Kinetics; Mechanical milling; NdMg12alloy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027919514

Recent years have witnessed many advances in the direct synthesis of single-crystalline MoS2 flakes or their polycrystalline aggregates on numerous diverse substrates, such as SiO2-Si, mica, sapphire, h-BN, and SrTiO3, etc. In this work, we used the dual-temperature-zone atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition method to directly synthesize large-scale monolayer MoS2 on fused silica, the most ordinary transparent insulating material in daily life.

To improve the electrochemical catalytic performance in the lithium-oxygen batteries, the NiCo2O4 nanoparticles (NCONPs) are firmly anchored onto the surface of the N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) by the hydrothermal method followed by low-temperature calcination. Compared with the pure metallic oxide, the introduction of the rGO can create the high surface area, which give a good performance for ORR (oxygen reduction reaction), and improve the electrical conductivity between the NCONPs. The high-loading NCONPs also ensure the material to have great catalytic activity for OER (oxygen evolution reaction), and the rGO can be protected by the nanoparticles coating against the side reaction with the Li2O2. The as-synthesized NCO@N-rGO composites deliver a specific surface area (about 242.5 m2 g-1), exhibiting three-dimensional (3D) porous structure, which provides a large passageway for the diffusion of the oxygen and benefits the infiltration of electrolyte and the storage of the discharge products. Owing to these special architectures features and intrinsic materials, the NCO@N-rGO cathode delivers a high specific capacity (6716 mAh g-1), great rate performance, and excellent cycling stability with cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g-1 (112 cycles) in the lithium-oxygen batteries.

It is hence appealing to design a material with at the same time a good capacity and maintaining crystalline morphology upon multiple battery operation cycles. We investigated using electronic structure the capacity of a recently synthesized framework of silicon c-Si24 as an anode material and showed that the breaking of some Si-Si bonds leads to the formation of two new more flexible allotropes.

The Co3O4@Ni3S2 electrode exhibited an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1710 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 1474 F g-1 at 10 A g-1.

However, phenanthrene (PHE) for the deeply hydrogenation reaction and hydrogen storage capacity can be used as a promising liquid organic hydrogen carrier. The hydrogenation of phenanthrene over the NiMo/Al2O3catalysts was carried out in the 30 mL tubing-bomb micro-reactor. The catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation and characterized by X-ray diffraction(XRD), Scanning electronic microscopy coupled with Energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS), N2physical adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of H2. The results show that the interaction between the NiMo and the support increase with the calcination temperature and that Ni and Mo were present as Ni2+and Mo4+on the support. The hydrogenated products were analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). The results show that the catalyst calcinated at 600 °C, exhibits excellent high activity performance and the hydrogenation conversion of phenanthrene over the catalyst can reach above 70% at 400 °C. The selectivity of octahydrophenanthrene (OHP), octahydroanthracene (OHA), tetrahydrophenanthrene (THP) and dihydrophenanthrene (DHP) are 9.07%, 34.84%, 18.36% and 32.85%.

This study finds out the minimum life cycle cost (LCC) of thermal energy storage over the period of 20 years by observing different temperature set points (55-95 °C) and sizes (0.3-1.5 m3) of a hot water storage tank with developed DR control algorithms. Three different control algorithms were studied: (A) a momentary DR control algorithm based on real-time hourly electricity price (HEP), (B) a backwards-looking DR control algorithm based on previous HEPs and (C) a predictive DR control algorithm based on future HEPs. This research was carried out with the validated dynamic building simulation tool IDA Indoor Climate and Energy. The results show that by using the predictive DR control algorithm the maximum annual savings in total delivered energy and cost are about 12% and 10%, respectively. The minimum LCC can be achieved by the smallest studied storage tank size of 0.3 m3 with 60 °C as the temperature set point, but the effect of storage tank size on LCC is relatively small. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Building; Control algorithm; Demand response; Energy; LCC; Thermal storage tank","Buildings; Costs; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Geothermal heat pumps; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Housing; Life cycle; Tanks (containers); Thermal energy; Cost-optimal solutions; Demand response; Energy; Hot water storage tanks; Life cycle costs (LCC); Residential building; Thermal energy storage systems; Thermal storage; Algorithms; algorithm; building; cost analysis; demand analysis; energy resource; pump; residential location; storage tank; temperature effect; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84967076041

However, it has become more and more challenging to meet stringent vehicle emissions standards due to fluctuating exhaust temperatures and high temperature exhaust gas caused by the regeneration of diesel particulate filters (DPFs). Therefore, a novel design for exhaust temperature control, based on controllable heat pipes and latent thermal energy storage, is proposed to realize more durable and efficient NOx emissions reduction. By adopting the concept of peak load shifting, the excess thermal energy of exhaust gas can be stored in phase change materials (PCMs), and released to maintain a relatively stable temperature if a temperature difference exists between the working fluid inside the heat pipes and the PCMs. In order to investigate the feasibility of our novel design, theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are combined to fully describe the dynamic behavior of temperature control. The exhaust temperature effects on NOx emissions reduction is evaluated by an accurate SCR model which is validated by the relevant experiments. The results indicate that the fluctuation of exhaust temperature is limited to 30 K after finishing the preheating process during the European transient cycle (ETC) test with an objective temperature of 563 K. However, stable exhaust temperatures require an additional 400 s for the PCMs to be prepared for an adequate supply of thermal energy. Compared with bare emissions, the improved elimination efficiency of NOx emissions can reach more than 90% in ETC testing, which satisfies the severe emission regulations with more sustainable and environmentally friendly practical application. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","NOx emissions reduction; Selective catalyst reduction (SCR); Temperature control","Catalysts; Diesel locomotives; Emission control; Exhaust gases; Gases; Heat pipes; Heat storage; Nitrogen oxides; Phase change materials; Temperature control; Thermal energy; Vehicles; Diesel particulate filters; Efficient technology; Exhaust temperature control; Experimental confirmation; Latent thermal energy storages; NOx emissions; Selective catalyst reduction; Temperature differences; Gas emissions; catalyst; diesel; emission control; energy efficiency; exhaust emission; experimental study; filter; high temperature; nitrogen oxides; sustainable development; temperature effect; traffic emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964596730

Here, we demonstrate a new and flexible strategy for the preparation of hollow Ni-Co-O microspheres with optimized Ni/Co ratios, controlled shell porosity, shell numbers, and shell thickness.

Here, a series of porous metal oxide (e.g., vanadium oxides, molybdenum oxides, manganese oxides) foams with/without nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) coating have been synthesized via a general surfactant-assisted template method, involving the formation of porous metal oxides coated with 1-hexadecylamine (HDA) and a subsequent thermal treatment. The presence of HDA is of importance for the formation of a porous structure, and the successive pyrolysis of such a nitrogen-containing surfactant generates nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) coated on the surface of metal oxides, which also provides a facile way to adjust the valence states of metal oxides via the carbothermal reduction reaction. When used as electrode materials, the highly porous metal oxides with N-C coating exhibited enhanced performance for lithium ion storage, thanks to the unique 3D structures associated with highly porous structure and thin N-C coating. Typically, the porous metal oxides (V2O5, MoO3, MnO2) exhibited discharge capacities of 286, 303, and 463 mAh g-1 at current densities of 30 and 100 mA g-1, respectively. In contrast, the metal oxides with low valences and carbon coating (VO2@N-C, MoO2@N-C, and MnO@N-C) exhibited improved capacities of 461, 613, and 892 mAh g-1. The capacity retentions of about 87.5, 80.2, and 85.0% for VO2@N-C, MoO2@N-C, and MnO@N-C were achieved after 600 cycles, suggesting the acceptable cycling stability.

Here we have investigated the adsorption of TM (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) on benzoquinone (BQ), by using the first-principles methods. It is found that Sc or Ti (Sc/Ti) atom is energetically favored to bind with ortho-BQ (OBQ) to form OBQ-Sc/Ti complex when compared to their bulk structures. Notably, the coordination number of Sc/Ti is only two, thereby providing enough empty d orbitals for H2 storage without geometrical blocking. Four H2 molecules can be accommodated by each OBQ-Sc complex via Kubas-like interaction, with the adsorption energy of 0.20 eV/H2 and the H2 storage capacity of ∼5.0 wt%. For practical application, two types of structures have been proposed for H2 storage using BQ molecule as building block, which would guarantee the dispersing of Sc atom and avoid clustering of OBQ-Sc complexes. In particular, for Sc-decorated oxygen-terminated zigzag graphene nanoribbons, the capacity of H2 storage reaches up to 6.0 wt%. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.","First-principle calculations; H2 storage; Kubas-like interaction","Calculations; Dispersions; Manganese; Molecules; Nanoribbons; Transition metals; Adsorption energies; Coordination number; First principle calculations; First principles method; Kubas-like interaction; Metal dispersions; Theoretical investigations; Zigzag graphene nanoribbons; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969916179

The effect of the prepared CsH on the hydrogen storage properties of the Mg(NH2)2-2LiH system was systematically investigated. The Mg(NH2)2-2LiH-0.08CsH composite exhibited optimal hydrogen storage properties because it reversibly stores approximately 4.62 wt% hydrogen with a dehydrogenation onset temperature of 70 °C via a two-stage reaction. At 150 °C, approximately 80% of the reversible capacity was quickly released from the Mg(NH2)2-2LiH-0.08CsH composite within 100 min. The fully dehydrogenated CsH-containing sample began to absorb hydrogen at 55 °C and took up approximately 4.58 wt% hydrogen at 130 °C. A cycling analysis indicated that the CsH-containing Mg(NH2)2-2LiH system exhibited good reversible hydrogen storage abilities. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that during the initial heating process, CsH gradually reacted with Mg(NH2)2 to afford CsMg(NH)(NH2), and CsH acted as a catalyst to reduce the activation energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step. As the operating temperature increased, CsMg(NH)(NH2) as a reactant participated in a second dehydrogenation step to decrease the desorption enthalpy change. This behavior reasonably explains the significantly improved hydrogen storage properties of the CsH-containing Mg(NH2)2-2LiH system. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.","Additives; Amides; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage properties","Activation energy; Additives; Amides; Ball milling; Cesium; Dehydrogenation; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Lithium alloys; Desorption enthalpy; Hydrogen atmosphere; Hydrogen storage properties; Mechanistic studies; Onset temperature; Operating temperature; Reversible capacity; Two-stage reactions; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964584515

In this work, we successfully converted commercial cotton threads (CT) into electrically conductive and electrochemically active threads by introducing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) using a large-scale producible method (dip-coating combined with low-temperature vapour reduction). The rGO coated CT (rGO-CT) has impressive conductivity which is attributed to the wrapped rGO nanosheets and it is steady enough to tolerate washing process for a long time. After coated with CNPs, the conductivity of CNPs/rGO composites coated CT (CNPs/rGO-CT) has been enhanced tremendously. Meanwhile, the rGO nanosheets with implanted CNPs form the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nanostructures which provide abundant ion transmission channels. Furthermore, we have prepared the CNPs/rGO-CT based FSC, which exhibits high volumetric capacitance (3.79 mF cm-3 at 50 mV s-1), well cycling stability (95.23% capacitance retention after 10000 charge-discharge cycles), and excellent electrochemical stability (92.30% capacitance retention after 2000 bending cycles).

SiOx is a very attractive anode material for lithium-ion batteries, but both low electronic conductivity and volume effect severely hamper its practical application. In this work, multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and N-doped carbon are combined to improve the electrochemical properties of SiOx. The synthesized composite (labeled as SiOx/MWCNT/N-doped C) has a network structure, in which MWCNT serves as a highly conductive and porous scaffold facilitating electron and ion transport, while N-doped C improves electric contact between SiOx/MWCNT particles and prevents the physical and electrochemical agglomeration of SiOx. The electrochemical measurement shows that the SiOx/MWCNT/N-doped C exhibits excellent cyclic stability and rate capability. At a current density of 100 mA g-1, a stable discharge capacity of about 620 mAh g-1 is achieved and the capacity can be preserved up to 450 cycles.

However, the poor stability of MoS2 due to the weak interaction with conductive support and current collector significantly hinders its performance in LIBs. In this work, the Ni3S2 interlayer was successfully in-situ formed between MoS2 and Ni foam by decomposing MoS2 precurors ((NH4)2MoS4) on Ni foam (denoted as MoS2/Ni3S2/Ni). The presence of Ni3S2 interlayer significantly enhanced the interaction between MoS2 and Ni foam support, resulting in excellent stability in lithium-ion batteries. In addition, the foam structure facilitates the ion diffusion and electron transport properties of the electrode materials, leading to high-rate and highly durable performance.

To obtain the optimum activation procedures, the influences of temperature and hydrogen pressure on the activation behavior of ZrCo were systematically investigated. Experimental results showed that fast and efficient activation of ZrCo could be achieved by optimizing the temperature and hydrogen pressure conditions of the activation procedures including initial evacuation, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. It was found that initial evacuation at temperature higher than 300 °C was clearly beneficial to the subsequent hydrogenation process. Hydrogen absorption rate of ZrCo during the activation process could be enhanced by increasing the hydrogenation temperature, whereas hydrogen pressures had an indiscernible impact on the hydrogenation process. Compared with other temperatures and hydrogen pressures, 100 °C and 0.8 bar H2 was a preferred condition for hydrogenation of ZrCo. In addition, it was demonstrated that dehydrogenation at high temperature over 500 °C was favorable to enable activated ZrCo to own high hydrogen capacity. As a result, optimum procedures composed of initial evacuation at 500 °C, hydrogenation at 100 °C under 0.8 bar H2 and dehydrogenation at 500 °C under vacuum were highly recommended for fast and efficient activation of ZrCo. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Activation; Fusion energy; Hydrogen isotopes storage; ITER; ZrCo","Activation energy; Chemical activation; Dehydrogenation; Hydrogen; Hydrogenation; Isotopes; Temperature; Effects of temperature; Fusion energy; Hydrogen absorption rate; Hydrogen isotope; Hydrogenation process; Hydrogenation temperature; ITER; ZrCo; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971617633

When without E-field, the binding energy (Eb) of the Li atoms to the hollow site of the heptatomic ring is 2.89 eV, which is larger than that at the hollow sites of the hexatomic ring and the pentatomic ring, indicating the Stone-Wales defect on the graphene surface can effectively enhance the binding strength of the Li atom. When the upward +0.01 au E-field is imposed, the Eb of the Li atom on the hollow site of the heptatomic ring increases to 3.41 eV, which is larger than the double of the experimental cohesive energy of bulk Li (1.63 eV), consequently allowing the dispersion of Li atoms without clustering, which is the basis for large amount hydrogen storage. The maximum number of H2 molecules adsorbed by each Li on the surface of the SW defective graphene under the upward 0.01 au E-field is 5, one more than that without E-field. The average adsorption energies of molecular hydrogen around Li in the presence of upward 0.01 au E-field are in the range of 0.21–0.46 eV, which are larger than that in the field-free case and intermediate between physisorbed and chemisorbed states (0.1–0.6 eV). The SW defective graphene adsorbs hydrogen molecules mainly through the polarization interaction. The calculated desorption temperature and molecular dynamic simulation indicate that the H2 molecules are easier to be desorbed under the downward E-field. Therefore, the Li decorated graphene with SW defects is appropriate for hydrogen storage under near-ambient conditions with the application of an E-field. Keeping five H2 molecules adsorbed per Li and stabilizing the dispersion of individual Li atoms under the upward E-field, the structure can serve as better building blocks of polymers. These findings suggest an effective route to control the hydrogen storage abilities of nanomaterials. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Density functional theory; Electric field; Graphene; Hydrogen storage; Stone-Wales","Atoms; Binding energy; Binding sites; Bins; Density functional theory; Desorption; Dispersions; Electric fields; Flow of solids; Graphene; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Point defects; Surface defects; Adsorption energies; Desorption temperatures; Electric field induced; Hydrogen storage capacities; Molecular hydrogen; Polarization interactions; Stone-Wales; Stone-Wales defects; Lithium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970003858

CDI electrodes are mainly made up of carbon materials, of which the deionization performance is closely related to their physical properties and structures. Hence, a rational design of electrode material structure is essentially significant. Functionalized graphene (fG) in particular has recently been regarded as characteristic CDI electrode material. However, preparation of fG based on graphene oxide usually results in serious secondary pollution due to usage of highly poisonous chemicals, and thus still cannot meet the demand of practical application. It is feasible that environmentally-friendly activated carbon (AC) and small amounts of fGs can be combined rationally, and used as CDI electrodes. Here, sono-assembled AC/m-phenylenediamine (mPEA) or p-phenylenediaminefG inter-connected network architecture has been constructed for the first time successfully. The specific capacitances of the AC/fG composites were found to be significantly higher than that of the AC electrode owing to mesoporous generation. Also, among all the samples, the AC composite with 5 wt % mPEA-fG exhibited an ultrahigh electrosorption capacity of 12.58 mg/g (or 0.22 mmol/g) in NaCl solution. These observations indicate that fG can serve as an efficient conductive bridge to decrease the aggregation of AC particles, and improve the electron transfer with the composite electrode. This work provides an effective strategy for the environmental and economical electrode architectures for general applications in CDI and energy storage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a significant portion of electricity input is consumed to overcome a large oxygen potential gradient between the electrodes in conventional solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). In this study, we present a novel and efficient syngas generator integrating carbon gasification and solid oxide co-electrolysis to improve the system efficiency. The feasibility of this new system is demonstrated in La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 (LSGM) electrolyte-supported SOECs. Both thermodynamic calculation and experimental results show that the potential barrier for co-electrolysis can be reduced by about 1 V and the electricity input can be saved by more than 90% upon integration of SOECs with carbon gasification. On the anode side, ""CO shuttle"" between the electrochemical reaction sites and solid carbon is realized through the Boudouard reaction (C + CO2 = 2CO). Simultaneous production of CO on the anode side and CO/H2 on the cathode side generates syngas that can serve as fuel for power generation or feedstock for chemical plants. The integration of carbon gasification and SOECs provides a potential pathway for efficient utilization of electricity, coal/biomass, and CO2 to store electrical energy, produce clean fuel, and achieve a carbon neutral sustainable energy supply. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon gasification; Solid oxide electrolysis cell; Syngas production","Anodes; Carbon dioxide; Chemical plants; Electric energy storage; Electrodes; Electrolysis; Electrolytes; Electrolytic cells; Fuels; Gas generators; Gasification; Renewable energy resources; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Synthesis gas; Carbon gasification; Electricity storages; Electrochemical reactions; Oxygen potential gradients; Renewable energy source; Sustainable energy supply; Syngas production; Thermodynamic calculations; Regenerative fuel cells; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; electrical power; electricity; electrode; electrokinesis; electrolyte; energy resource; equipment; fuel cell; high temperature; performance assessment; power generation; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962719950

In this study, Si nanoparticles and expanded graphite (EG) are treated by combining high-energy wet ball-milling in sucrose solution with subsequent pyrolysis treatment to produce this Si@C/G composite. To achieve better overall electrochemical performance, the carbon content of the composites is also studied systematically.

Consequently the modeling of the solubility of polar organic compounds like Ortho Hydroxy benzoic acid (o-HBA), and Para Hydroxy benzoic acid (p-HBA), Dichloro diphenyl Trichloro ethane (DDT) and 2,4-Dichloro phenoxyacetic acid (usually referred to by its abbreviation, (2,4-D) as well as their mixtures, in supercritical fluids such as carbon dioxide, is presented. For the two binary systems i.e. o-HBA-CO2, DDT-CO2the model combining the cubic Redlich Kwong (RK) equation of state (EOS) with the van der Walls (VW) mixing rule (MR) at constant temperature of 313 K and a pressure range of 120-220bar, showed quite good results compared to the experimental values. However the model Redlich-Kwong-Soave (RKS)-Wong-Sandler (WS) provided a better correlation. Similarly the model RK-WS gave better results for the solubility of o-HBA in CO2and for the mixture o-HBA-2,4-D in CO2. The obtained solubilities of p-HBA in supercritical carbon dioxide were found to be higher than that of o-HBA. This can be explained by the differences in the intermolecular interactions which are relatively weak for the case of o-HBA.

However its storage is a major concern and means has to be developed for this purpose and where processes based on the technique of adsorption can be regarded as promising ways, particularly when using natural and with no cost solid materials. The retention capabilities of this technique are shown through the present study which concerns the retention of a pharmaceutical compound, namely Diclofenac from aqueous solutions by adsorption onto activated carbon prepared from olive stones. The first stage consisted of the preparation and determination of the physical and chemical characteristics of this material such as pHPZC, porosity and specific area using known techniques of characterization. The functional groups present on the surface of this material were also determined by using Boehm method and by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). The effects of contact time, pH, initial concentration of Diclofenac and adsorbent dose were investigated experimentally. The results showed that the retention of the pollutant was rapid during the first minutes and then slowed down to reach equilibrium after 30 min. The maximum adsorption was reached at pH = 2. Diclofenac adsorption kinetic was of the pseudo-second order controlled by the intraparticular diffusion phenomenon but is not the limiting step.

However, synthesizing high-performance Si-based materials at large scale and low cost remains a huge challenge. Here, we for the first time report the preparation of an interconnected three-dimensional (3D) porous Si-hybrid architecture by using a spray drying method. In this unique structure, the highly robust C-CNT-RGO cages not only can improve the conductivity of the electrode and buffer the volume expansion but also suppress the Si nanoparticles aggregation. As a result, the 3D Si@po-C/CNT/RGO electrode achieves long-life cycling stability at high rates (a reversible capacity of 854.9 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 after 500 cycles and capacity decay less than 0.013% per cycle) and good rate capability (1454.7, 1198.8, 949.2, 597.8, and 150 mA h g-1 at current densities of 1, 2, 4, 10, and 20 A g-1, respectively). Moreover, this novel electrode could deliver high reversible capacities and long-life stabilities even with high mass loading density (764.9 mA h g-1 at 1.0 mg cm-2 after 500 cycles and 472.2 mA h g-1 at 1.5 mg cm-2 after 400 cycles, respectively). This cheap and scalable strategy can be extended to fabricate other materials with large volume expansion (Sn, Ge, transition-metal oxides) and 3D porous carbon for other potential applications. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","cross-linked cage; large-scale; long cycle life; Si/C; spray-drying","Anodes; Carbon; Electrodes; Germanium; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Porous materials; Porous silicon; Spray drying; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; cross-linked cage; High reversible capacities; Hybrid architectures; large-scale; Long cycles; Reversible capacity; Threedimensional (3-d); Transition-metal oxides; Silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976447255

However, more than 300% volume variation of SnO2 during the charge/discharge process results in dramatic degradation of electrochemical performance and thus poor cyclic stability, which has hindered its application in LIBs. Here, a new strategy is proposed to suppress this volume change via anchoring mesoporous SnO2 on robust polypyrrole nanotubes (PPy NTs) to fabricate nanoarchitectured SnO2 composite. Benefiting from this nanoarchitecture design, the anode presents outstanding rate performance with a reversible specific capacity of about 770 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1 and remarkable cyclability accompanied by a high specific capacity of about 790 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1 after 200 cycles. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","anodes; electrochemical energy storage; lithium-ion batteries; nanoarchitecture; tin dioxide","Anodes; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Nanotubes; Polypyrroles; Secondary batteries; Tin; Tin dioxide; Yarn; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical performance; High specific capacity; ITS applications; Microwave assisted synthesis; Nano-architecture; Polypyrrole nanotubes; Reversible specific capacity; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975887103

The stress generation and formation of microcracks are caused by the solid state diffusion of lithium in the active particles. In this work, scaling relations are constructed for diffusion induced damage in intercalation electrodes based on an extensive set of numerical experiments with a particle-level description of microcrack formation under disparate operating and cycling conditions, such as temperature, particle size, C-rate, and drive cycle. The microcrack formation and evolution in active particles is simulated based on a stochastic methodology. A reduced order scaling law is constructed based on an extensive set of data from the numerical experiments. The scaling relations include combinatorial constructs of concentration gradient, cumulative strain energy, and microcrack formation. The reduced order relations are further employed to study the influence of mechanical degradation on cell performance and validated against the high order model for the case of damage evolution during variable current vehicle drive cycle profiles. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We explore whether creation of localized bioenergy markets near existing military installations in the southeastern U.S. could simultaneously address military renewable energy generation objectives while reducing urban encroachment. We model the use of public-private partnerships to stimulate the creation of these markets, in which stable installation demand is paired with stable supply from surrounding landowners. We employ two economic models - the SubRegional Timber Supply (SRTS) model and the Forest and Agricultural Sector Model with Greenhouse Gases (FASOMGHG) - to assess how markets influence forest and agriculture land use, renewable energy production, and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation at the regional and national levels. When all selected installations increase bioenergy capacity simultaneously, we find increased preservation of forest land area, increased forest carbon storage in the region, and increased renewable energy generation at military installations. Nationally, however, carbon stocks are depleted as harvests increase, increasing GHG emissions even after accounting for potential displaced emissions from coal- or natural gas-fired generation. Increasing bioenergy generation on a single installation within the southeast has very different effects on forest area and composition, yielding greater standing timber volume and higher forest carbon stock. In addition to demonstrating the benefits of linking two partial equilibrium models of varying solution technique, sectoral scope, and resource detail, results suggest that a tailored policy approach may be more effective in meeting local encroachment reduction and renewable energy generation objectives while avoiding negative GHG mitigation consequences. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Economic modeling; Forest carbon; Military installation; Southeast U.S; U.S. Department of Defense","Agriculture; Biomass; Commerce; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Military bases; Renewable energy resources; Timber; Economic modeling; Forest carbons; Military installations; Southeast U.S; U.s. department of defense; Forestry; bioenergy; biomass; carbon sequestration; economic planning; emission inventory; forest; government; greenhouse gas; land use; landowner; military intervention; policy approach; public-private partnership; renewable resource; urban area; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962157622

Accurate modelling of buoyancy effects and mixing inside the storage tank as a result of direct inflows is key to obtain valid results. The use of one-dimensional storage tank models is common practice in building simulations, but as buoyancy and mixing are three-dimensional phenomena they cannot be incorporated directly in such a model and special formulations must be used. This paper presents a novel method for incorporating buoyancy and mixing in one-dimensional stratified storage tank models. The model parameters are derived from a series of computational fluid dynamics simulations and correlated with the appropriate non-dimensional parameters. The model is validated against an independent set of charging and discharging experiments. The model is found to represent buoyancy and mixing in the storage tank in a realistic way and to correspond well to experimental results. To allow researchers to assess the uncertainty on performance indicators in building energy simulations, an effective storage capacity ratio is defined and its variation within the model parameter uncertainty range is calculated and compared to other models. The results show a discrepancy between models commonly used in the literature and the presented validated model. When the influence of storage capacity on parameters of interest is known, the effective storage capacity ratio can also be used to estimate the uncertainty on these parameters caused by the storage tank model. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Buoyancy; Experimental validation; Inflow mixing; One-dimensional model; Stratified hot water storage","Buoyancy; Computational fluid dynamics; Mixing; One dimensional; Settling tanks; Uncertainty analysis; Water; Water tanks; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Experimental validations; Hot water storage; Hot water storage tanks; Model parameters; Non-dimensional parameters; One-dimensional model; Performance indicators; Tanks (containers); building; buoyancy; computational fluid dynamics; energy planning; experimental study; inflow; mixing; model validation; storage tank; water storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962026556

Carbon capture and increased utilization of renewable energy sources are viable approaches to reduce CO2 emissions from the power industry. Cryogenic carbon capture considered in this study is a post-combustion CO2 removal system that separates CO2 from the flue gas by desublimation. In this investigation, a hybrid system of cryogenic carbon capture and a baseline fossil-fueled power generation unit are optimized with a framework to mathematically represent this hybrid system. Optimization of this hybrid system results in meeting the electricity demand through a combination of coal, gas, and wind power sources with a priority given to wind power for utilization. A comparison of the cost associated with operating the steam turbine as a baseline or load-following unit is also made. A significant decrease in the cycling cost associated with load-following of the coal-fired power plant is observed when it operates as a baseline unit. The decrease in the cycling costs is 82% and 85%, respectively, for when wind power is utilized in meeting the electricity demand and when it is not.

Thermal properties of the composites and bulk polyols are studied thoroughly with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal conductivity analyzer. Significant differences in heat storage properties of microstructured and bulk PCM are observed. The heat release of microstructured erythritol is more controlled than that of bulk PCM, making the novel microengineered PCMs particularly interesting for STES. In the case of bulk PCM, the heat release may occur spontaneously due to crystallization by surface roughnesses or impurities, whereas these factors have only little impact on the crystallization of microstructured erythritol, making the novel composite more reliable for long-term heat storage purposes. In addition, microstructured polyol-polystyrene composites show anomalous enhancement in the specific heat as compared to bulk polyols.

The ReSOC systems operate sequentially between fuel-producing electrolysis and power-producing fuel-cell modes with intermediate tanking of reactants and products. Maintaining the high conversion efficiencies seen in laboratory-scale cell tests at the system-level requires careful system design to integrate storage and electrochemical conversion functions. By leveraging C-O-H reaction chemistry and operating at intermediate temperature, the ReSOC is mildly exothermic in both operating modes, which simplifies balance-of-plant integration and thermal management. System configurations explored herein range from a simple system with minimal balance-of-plant components to more complex systems including turbine expansion for increased electrical efficiency, and separating water for higher energy density storage. The efficiency, energy density, and capital cost tradeoffs of these configurations are quantified through computational modeling. Results indicate that a roundtrip efficiency of nearly 74% is achieved with relatively low tanked energy density (~20 kWh/m3) for systems configured to store water-vapor containing gases. Separately storing condensed water increases energy density of storage, but limits efficiency to 68% based on the energetic cost of evaporating reactant water during electrolysis operation. Further increases in energy density (to 90 kWh/m3) require higher storage pressures (e.g., 50-bar nominal) which lower roundtrip efficiency to about 65%. Cost of energy storage is strongly influenced by stack power and system energy densities because the storage tanks and stack comprise a majority of the system capital cost. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Distributed generation; Energy storage; Reversible fuel cells; Solid oxide cell; Techno-economic analysis; Thermal management","Costs; Density of gases; Distributed power generation; Economic analysis; Electrolysis; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Plant expansion; Reaction intermediates; Regenerative fuel cells; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Temperature control; Thermal variables control; Distributed energy storages; Electrochemical conversion; High conversion efficiency; Intermediate temperatures; Reversible fuel cells; Reversible solid oxide cells; Solid-oxide cells; Techno-Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; cost analysis; design method; economic analysis; electrochemical method; electrokinesis; energy budget; energy efficiency; equipment; fuel cell; operations technology; performance assessment; storage tank; temperature effect; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961872516

However, few of the theoretical models take this factor into account in the study of kinetic mechanisms. In the present work, the modified Chou model with considering the volume change by Pilling-Bedworth Ratio (PBR) β is applied to interpret the kinetic mechanisms of hydriding and dehydriding reactions in La-Mg-Ni ternary hydrogen storage alloys. The calculation results agree well with the experimental data, indicating that the modified Chou model can well describe the kinetic behaviors of La-Mg-Ni alloys. Diffusion is determined to be the rate-controlling step of hydriding and dehydriding for the examples in this work. The activation energies are calculated to be 39.4 kJ/mol for hydriding reaction (β = 1.29) and 93.1 kJ/mol for dehydriding reaction (β = 0.78) of Mg-10.6La-3.5Ni nanoparticles at 453-623 K. For the hydrogen absorption kinetics of La2Mg16Ni alloy under 0.5-3 MPa at 598 K, β is 1.25 and the equilibrium hydrogen pressure is calculated to be 0.332 MPa. For the hydrogen desorption kinetics of Mgx(LaNi3)100-x alloys at 623 K, the characteristic times increase in the order of tc(x = 70, β = 0.79) &lt; tc(x = 60, β = 0.79) &lt; tc(x = 40, β = 0.97) &lt; tc(x = 50, β = 0.85). The value of β is 0.77 and the hydrogen desorption rate of Mg-5La-10Ni alloy prepared by the ultrahigh pressure (UHP) method is faster than that of the alloy prepared by the as-cast method, whose characteristic times are 7428 s and 4651 s, respectively.

These properties are particularly attractive for supercapacitor applications. The ion gels are prepared by codissolution of PYR14TFSI and MC in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which after heating and subsequent cooling form a gel. Evaporation of DMF leave thin, flexible, self-standing ion gels with up to 97 wt % PYR14TFSI, which have the highest combined moduli and ionic conductivity of ion gels to date, with an excellent electrochemical stability window (5.6 V). These favorable properties are attributed to the immiscibility of PYR14TFSI in MC, which permits the ionic conductivity to be independent of the MC at low MC content, and the in situ formation of a volume spanning network of semicrystalline MC nanofibers, which have a high glass transition temperature (Tg = 190 °C) and remain crystalline until they degrade at 300 °C. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","energy storage materials; ion gels; ionic liquids; nanostructures; renewable polymers; supercapacitors","Capacitors; Cellulose; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Gels; Glass transition; Ionic conduction in solids; Ionic conductivity; Ionic liquids; Ionic strength; Ions; Nanostructures; Organic solvents; Polymers; Solid electrolytes; Electrochemical stabilities; High-glass transition temperatures; Ion gels; N ,N-Dimethylformamide; Solid polymer electrolytes; Subsequent cooling; Super capacitor; Supercapacitor application; Polyelectrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973382080

Desert sands, igneous and other rocks are being intensively tested for heat storage at high temperature. This paper focuses on the study of several candidate rocks for heat storage. Thirteen samples are collected from diverse places in Morocco and thermally cycled between 20 °C and 650 °C. The chemical and thermo-physical properties influencing the lifetime of rocks are identified. Vickers hardness test has been used to evaluate the compressive strength of the samples and the effect of thermo-mechanical stress during thermal cycling. The obtained results show that quartz and calcite are the principal minerals controlling rock physical properties. Limestone, marble and granite have not withstood thermal cycling. Their hardness decreases after each cycle. Rhyolite and quartzitic sandstone show excellent ability during thermal cycling.

The samples having solid contents ranging from 20 wt.% to 35 wt.% were prepared and successfully impregnated with paraffin without using a surfactant. SEM images showed that the prepared PTFs had three-dimensional interpenetrating structures with good porosities. The pore structure and morphology of PTF was markedly influenced by the solid content. With increase in solid content, porosity decreased, along with a decrease in the homologous encapsulation ratio of paraffin. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) evaluated the thermal properties of the paraffin/PTF (PTFP) composites. DSC results showed that with a solid content of 20 wt.%, the paraffin adsorption reached 62 vol.% and latent heat of the composite PCM was 94.05 J/g after 200 melting/freezing cycles. TGA results showed that the form-stable composite PCMs had good thermal stabilities. In order to further enhance the thermal conductivity and improve the adsorption capacity of PTF, sucrose was added to the emulsion and carbonized in situ to form carbon/PTF (PTFC). This could also be successfully impregnated with paraffin to obtain the form-stable composite paraffin/PTFC (PTFCP). The TEM images and results of XPS analysis confirmed that the surfaces of TiO2 particles were covered with a 2 nm thick carbon film (C/TiO2). The thermal conductivity of PTFCP increased from 0.302 W/m K to 1.059 W/m K compared to PTFP, along with a further improvement in adsorption capacity. Furthermore, the results of FT-IR analysis and thermal cyclic tests showed that the form-stable composite PCMs had good chemical stability and thermal reliability after 200 melting/freezing cycles. Therefore, the prepared form-stable composite PCMs having excellent pore structures, thermal properties, thermal reliabilities, and chemical stabilities are promising PCM candidates for heat energy storage applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon; Form-stable composite PCM; Paraffin; Particle-stabilized emulsions; Porous TiO2 foam","Adsorption; Carbon; Carbon films; Chemical analysis; Chemical stability; Differential scanning calorimetry; Emulsification; Melting; Paraffins; Pore structure; Porosity; Reliability analysis; Thermodynamic properties; Titanium dioxide; Adsorption capacities; Encapsulation ratio; Enhanced thermal conductivity; Form-stable composite PCM; Particle-stabilized emulsions; Porous TiO; Structure and morphology; Thermal cyclic tests; Thermal conductivity; adsorption; carbon; chemical compound; composite; emulsion; encapsulation; energy budget; foam; oxide; porosity; surfactant; thermal conductivity; wax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960929666

However, wide-range adoption of HPC for practical application is largely shadowed by its extremely complex synthesis process with considerably low production efficiency. Herein we reported a simple template-free, one-step sintering method, to massively produce the HPCs for high-performance EDLCs. Resorting to the 3D structure modification of the wide pore size distribution, high surface area of HPCs (up to 3000 m2 g-1) was achieved. By using 1 M Na2SO4 as electrolyte, the as-fabricated HPCs based EDLCs can be operated reversibly over a wide voltage window of 1.6 V with superior specific capacitance of 240 F g-1 under a current density of 0.5 A g-1. In the meanwhile, the EDLCs exhibit excellent rate capability (high power density of 16 kW kg-1 at 10.2 Wh kg-1) and long-term cycling stability with 9% loss of its initial capacitance after 2000 cycles. This output performance distinguished itself among most of the carbon-based EDLCs with neutral aqueous electrolyte.

Importantly, interlayer Ni serves as a nanostructured current collector and electronic conductor, playing an important role in rate capability. By virtue of structure features, the self-support NixCo2x(OH)y@Ni@ZnO/ITO as binder-free electrode for supercapacitors manifests higher specific capacitance (124 mF cm-2 at 0.1 mA cm-2, the mass of active material per square centimeter is typically in 100s micrograms).

The temporary shape was quickly fixed by cooling in ice water for 30 s after deformation at 80 °C for 10 s. Shape recovery started in 10 s under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation and almost completed within 60 s depending on the curling angle. A small amount of GO in the hydrogels (≤1.5 mg/mL) played a key role in NIR energy absorption and transformation into thermal energy. The hydrogel without GO showed no response to the NIR irradiation and cannot recover to its permanent shape by NIR irradiation. Temperature sweep was conducted in the cycle of 20 °C → 80 °C → 20 °C, and the structure change in the hydrogels with temperature was investigated according to the storage modulus G′ and tangent of the loss angle tan as a function of the hydrogel composition. The shape-memory capability was confirmed as the contribution from the triple-helix cross-linking network of gelatin. High mechanical toughness (strength > 400 kPa and broken strain > 500%) was achieved by the double-network with the sacrificial gelatin network and GO bridging to dissipate deformation energy. The optimized composition of the hydrogel was found to be a key point to realize stable temporary shape and rapid recovery to the permanent shape controlled by NIR irradiation with reasonable strength. The facile preparation and noncontact gentle stimulus of the present hydrogel hold great potential to be used in soft actuator materials. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","gelatin; graphene oxide; near-infrared trigger; shape memory; tough hydrogel","Associative storage; Computer system recovery; Deformation; Graphene; Infrared devices; Irradiation; Polyacrylates; Recovery; Shape optimization; Cross-linked gelatins; gelatin; Graphene oxides; High mechanical strength; Hydrogel composition; Mechanical toughness; Near Infrared; Shape memory; Hydrogels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971282422

Moisture variation affects the energy storage and therefore the energy gains/losses through buildings. To this effect the decrement factor and time lag are determined for three types of concrete layers and one of solid clay-bricks masonry layer. Their consideration is essential to enhance the design of building elements, from a thermal point of view, when exposed to varying moisture content conditions. Moisture content and relative humidity variations of each analysed layer, as defined by specific moisture storage functions, are shown to interrelate non-linearly with the layer resistor-capacitor circuit section parameters (thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity) showing notable consequences on the thermal inertia parameters. The dynamic thermal analysis is accomplished by using the thermal-circuit modelling approach and the nodal solution method. The deterioration of decrement factor and time lag due to moisture content are illustrated by appropriate metrics. Computer results for the studied layers with thicknesses varying from 10 cm to 50 cm show the influence of the variation of relative humidity and thickness on the decrement factor and time lag. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Decrement factor; Material properties; Moisture content; Relative humidity; Time lag","Atmospheric humidity; Brick; Building materials; Materials properties; Moisture determination; Reconfigurable hardware; Specific heat; Thermal conductivity; Thermoanalysis; Walls (structural partitions); Appropriate metrics; Decrement factor; Design of buildings; Dynamic thermal analysis; Moisture variation; Resistor capacitors; Time lag; Volumetric heat capacity; Moisture; building; concrete; construction material; dynamic analysis; inertia; masonry; moisture content; numerical method; relative humidity; thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962237753

BECCS, like other bioenergy facilities, will likely exhibit economies of scale in capital costs, but diseconomies of scale in biomass transportation and supply costs. In this paper we develop a spatially explicit optimization framework to characterize the drivers of optimal sizing for potential BECCS facilities in Illinois. The approach leverages county-level biomass supply data, detailed road transportation networks, existing technology cost estimates, and previous geologic characterizations of long-term CO2 storage. Optimal scales are an order of magnitude larger than proposed scales found in existing literature. Biomass supply, scaling exponents, and technology costs are large drivers of optimal scale, while facility location, pretreatment options, and transportation costs are less important. When choosing between multiple facility locations, economies of scale support a centralized BECCS infrastructure. Deviations from optimal scaled size have little effect on overall systems costs - suggesting that other factors, including regulatory, political, or logistical considerations, may ultimately have a greater influence on plant size than the techno-economic factors we consider here. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS); Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR); Carbon-negative energy; Optimal scale; Optimization","Biomass; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Cost estimating; Costs; Digital storage; Economics; Optimization; Transportation; Bio-energy; Biomass transportations; Carbon dioxide removal; Geologic characterization; Optimal scale; Optimization framework; Road transportation networks; Transportation cost; Cost benefit analysis; bioenergy; carbon dioxide; electricity generation; operations technology; pollutant removal; transportation economics; Illinois; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960915691

In the recent years, the concept of power-to-gas, where the excess energy is converted into hydrogen and/or further methanized into renewable methane, is gaining high popularity among researchers. In this study, we assess the power-to-renewable methane system as the potential technology for power grid balancing. For the assessment, a mathematical model has been developed that assists in understanding of whether a power-to-renewable methane system can be developed in a region with specific installed and planned capacities of wind energy and biogas plants. Considering the varying amount of excess power available for H2 production and the varying biogas quality, the aim of the model is to simulate the system to determine, if wind power generation meets the needs of biogas plants for storing the excess energy in the form of methane via the methanation process. For the case study, the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) have been selected, as the region is characterized by high dependence on fossil energy sources and electricity import. The results show that with the wind power produced in the region it would be possible to increase the average CH4 content in the methanized biogas by up to 48.4%. Yet, even with a positive H2 net production rate, not in all cases the maximum possible quality of the renewable methane would be achieved, as at moments the necessary amount of H2 for methanation would not be readily available, and the reaction would not be possible. Thus, in the region, the wind power capacities would not meet the biogas plant capacities nor now, nor until 2020. For the system's development, two potential pathways are seen as possible for balancing the regions' power grid. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Excess power; Methanation; Power-to-gas; Power-to-methane; Renewable methane; Stochastic energy","Biogas; Electric power generation; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Methane; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Electricity imports; Excess power; Fossil energy sources; Potential technologies; Renewable resource; Stochastic energy; Technological solution; Wind power capacity; Electric power transmission networks; biogas; electricity; fossil fuel; hydrogen; methane; numerical model; power generation; renewable resource; wind power; Baltic States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960491441

In this work, macroporous structured graphene thin films (MGTFs) are fabricated on various substrates including flexible graphene papers (GPs) through an ice-crystal-induced phase separation process. The MGTFs prepared on GPs (MGTF@GPs) are recognized with remarkable features such as interconnected macroporous configuration, sufficient exfoliation of the conductive RGO sheets, and good mechanical flexibility. As such, the flexible MGTF@GPs are demonstrated as a versatile conductive platform for depositing conducting polymers (CPs), e.g., polyaniline (PAn), polypyrrole, and polythiophene, through in situ electropolymerization. The contents of the CPs in the composite films are readily controlled by varying the electropolymerization time. Notably, electrodeposition of PAn leads to the formation of nanostructures of PAn nanofibers on the walls of the macroporous structured RGO framework (PAn@MGTF@GPs): thereafter, the PAn@MGTF@GPs display a unique structural feature that combine the nanostructures of PAn nanofibers and the macroporous structures of RGO sheets. Being used as binder-free electrodes for flexible supercapacitors, the PAn@MGTF@GPs exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, in particular a high areal specific capacity (538 mF cm-2), high cycling stability, and remarkable capacitive stability to deformation, due to the unique electrode structures. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","conducting polymers; electropolymerization; flexible supercapacitors; graphene papers; macroporous structured graphene thin films","Capacitors; Composite films; Conducting polymers; Conductive films; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytic capacitors; Electropolymerization; Graphene; Nanofibers; Nanostructures; Phase separation; Polyaniline; Polymer films; Polypyrroles; Conducting polymer nanostructures; Electrochemical performance; Graphene papers; Graphene-based composites; Macroporous; Macroporous structures; Phase-separation process; Super capacitor; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974603919

It presents an economically attractive possible solution for the continuously increasing energy demand of Lebanon. However, the stochastic behavior of wind speed leads to significant disharmony between wind energy production and electricity demand. Hence, the prospect of creating a combined wind-hydro energy station is found to be a vital issue. This paper is an attempt to analyze the design of a pumping station and the performance of a hybrid wind-hydro power plant, in two dams in Lebanon (Quaraoun and Chabrouh), in order to choose the most suitable dam to store the energy surplus produced by wind power at night. An evaluation of the amount of water that could be pumped in both dams and the energy that could be produced from the stored electricity surplus are carried out in this paper, in order to select the most suitable dam to implement the hydro pumped storage power plant and store the electricity surplus. It is shown that the energy that could be produced in the dam of Chabrouh varies between 17 MWh and 698 MWh, while in the dam of Quaraoun is between 17 MWh and 768 MWh. An analysis of the cost of the energy produced by wind turbines per kWh and the produced water per m3 are carried out in this paper as well.

Recently, a new strategy to design flexible, binder-, and additive-free three-dimensional electrodes with nanoscale surface engineering has been exploited in boosting the storage performance of electrode materials. In this paper, we design a new type of free-standing carbon quantum dot coated VO2 interwoven nanowires through a simple fabrication process and demonstrate its potential to be used as cathode material for lithium and sodium ion batteries. The versatile carbon quantum dots that are vastly flexible for surface engineering serve the function of protecting the nanowire surface and play an important role in the diffusion of electrons. Also, the three-dimensional carbon cloth coated with VO2 interwoven nanowires assisted in the diffusion of ions through the inner and the outer surface. With this unique architecture, the carbon quantum dot nanosurface engineered VO2 electrode exhibited capacities of 420 and 328 mAh g-1 at current density rate of 0.3 C for lithium and sodium storage, respectively.

Herein, we report a facile, general, one-step synthetic method that leads to a family of non-noble metal hydrogen-evolving electrocatalysts that composed of metal phosphide nanoparticles embedded within nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. The synthesis of the materials is achieved via a facile one-step thermal treatment in inert atmosphere of homogeneously mixed urea, diammonium hydrogen phosphate and metal salts (e.g., ammonium molybdate for the synthesis of MoP). The use of inexpensive urea is crucial in the synthesis as it helps the deoxygenation-reduction of some metal salts and phosphor source (i.e., diammonium hydrogen phosphate) and undergoes in situ carbonization, leading to the formation of a composite material containing metal phosphide nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) in one pot. Furthermore, we show that the resulting composite nanomaterials can serve as highly active, stable, noble metal-free electrocatalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In particular, the MoP@NC material exhibits the best electrocatalytic activity in our study. This material affords a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at a low overpotential of 135 mV, exhibits excellent catalytic stability as long as 20 h, and gives nearly 100% Faradaic yield towards HER. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study quantifies the economic and environmental benefits of an ISCC power plant relative to a stand-alone CSP with energy storage, and a NGCC plant. The corresponding levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and the Cost of Carbon Abatement (CoA) are estimated by simulating hourly operations for five U.S. locations with different solar resources and ambient temperature, under varying assumptions regarding natural gas prices, tax incentives, capacity factors, and capital costs. Results show that integrating the CSP into an ISCC reduces the LCOE of solar-generated electricity by 35-40% relative to a stand-alone CSP plant, and provides the additional benefit of dispatchability. An ISCC also outperforms a CSP with energy storage in terms of LCOE and CoA. The current LCOE of an ISCC is lower than that of a stand-alone NGCC when natural gas prices reach 13.5 $/MMBtu, while its CoA is lower at a fuel price of 8.5 $/MMBtu. Although, under low to moderate natural gas price conditions, a NGCC generates electricity and abates carbon emissions at a lower cost than an ISCC; small changes in the capacity factor of an ISCC relative to the NGCC, or capital cost reductions for the CSP components significantly tilt the balance in the ISCC's favor. Hence, this technology should be seriously considered as a cost-effective baseload electricity generation alternative to speed up the transition to sustainable energy systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Concentrating Solar Power (CSP); GHG emissions; Integrated Solar Combined Cycle; Levelized cost of electricity; Natural gas combined cycle power plants; Solar thermal power plants","Carbon; Combined cycle power plants; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Natural gasoline plants; Solar energy; Taxation; Thermoelectric power plants; Concentrating solar power; GHG emission; Integrated solar combined cycles; Levelized cost of electricities; Natural gas combined cycles; Solar thermal power plants; Fossil fuel power plants; carbon emission; cost analysis; electricity generation; energy resource; fossil fuel; integrated approach; natural gas; power plant; solar power; tax incentive; technological development; thermal power; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959485837

The operational lifetime of these battery packs is still a cost concern for end users and limits long distance applications. The battery storage devices currently dominate onboard energy storage fields via slow electrochemical reactions. The battery pack experiences an extra burden when absorbing bursts of energy or releasing the required energy to facilitate quick acceleration. The dynamic operation under thermal and mechanical stresses especially during severe weather conditions has adverse effects on the battery operating life due to chemical compounds and electrode materials degradation. To overcome these limitations, an ultracapacitor can quickly polarize electrolyte solutions and accumulate energy via rapid electrostatic charges at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The ultracapacitor combines advantages including long cycle life and high power density of a conventional capacitor with enhanced energy storage capability due to high electrode surface area and low internal resistance. A hybrid ultracapacitor can be designed by using both a double-layer capacitor electrode and a battery electrode. This hybrid structure increases energy conservation and capacitance. It is also recognized as an asymmetric ultracapacitor. A power module consisting of 10 asymmetric ultracapacitors with 300 F at an operating window from 4.0 V to 14.5 V was tested for studying of these unique features. These 10 electrochemical capacitors were connected in series and performed electrical characterizations including Ragone plots, self-discharge, features at high current loads, working voltage, and related energy storage performance. The ultracapacitor module was then operated together with a Pb-acid battery as a hybrid power device. Performance of the hybrid power system was characterized by using an adjusted cold cranking and a modified hybrid pulse power profile. The irreplaceable structures on energy storage and power delivery serve as a potential to further reduce the cyclic burden and thermal stress in advanced battery packs for onboard energy storage applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Asymmetric ultracapacitor; Energy conservation; Energy conversion; Hybrid power device; Regenerative energy; Renewable energy","Capacitance; Capacitors; Chemical compounds; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electric power transmission; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrostatics; Energy conservation; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Land vehicle propulsion; Lead; Lead acid batteries; Lithium-ion batteries; Nickel metal hydride batteries; Secondary batteries; Storage (materials); Stresses; Virtual storage; Electrical characterization; Electrochemical capacitor; Electrochemical reactions; Electrode-electrolyte interfaces; Hybrid power; Regenerative energy; Renewable energies; Ultracapacitors; Capacitor storage; asymmetry; electricity generation; electrode; electrolyte; electronic equipment; energy conservation; energy efficiency; fuel cell; renewable resource; severe weather; storage; surface area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958793977

However, the intrinsically low thermal conductivity of phase-change materials (PCMs) is the major shortage, leading to low energy charging and discharging rate. An experimental setup was designed to investigate the dynamic thermal behavior of a shell-and-tube latent heat thermal storage unit. Paraffin wax was employed as the PCM, of which the thermal properties, including that of melting temperature and latent heat, were detected by Differential Scanning Calorimetry. In order to improve the heat transfer performance, copper foam and a bottom fin were compounded to the PCM. High temperature water flowed through the copper tube as the heat transfer fluid (HTF). The temperature variations of the selected detected points inside PCM and the solid-liquid interface evolution in axial plane of symmetry for three samples, including that of pure paraffin, paraffin-copper foam composites without and with the bottom fin, were recorded under the different heating temperatures and flow rates of HTF. The experimental results indicate that completely melting the PCM in composite takes over 1/3 less time than that of pure paraffin under the same operating conditions. The total charging time consumption of the composite with a bottom fin is the least, as well as the heat transfer rate is the largest among the three samples.

FeSOy nanosheets with a lateral size of 400 nm and a thickness of 20 nm were first grown on a CFC substrate by a hydrothermal method, and were then converted to FeOx nanosheets without an obvious change in the morphology and size through a rapid and in situ electrochemical oxidation desulfurization process. After the electrochemical activation process, the 3D self-supported electrodes exhibited superior OER activity to previously reported iron oxide films, and were even comparable to some state-of-the-art OER catalysts such as cobalt oxides. Furthermore, the 3D self-supported electrodes showed excellent stability toward the OER process even at a high current density. Surprisingly, the activity of the 3D self-supported electrode was enhanced significantly after the long-term OER process. In addition, the direct growth of the active catalysts on the CFC substrate can avoid the use of other conductive agents and binders, which ensures good electrical connection and improves the electrical conductivity of the electrode. The superior activity and long-term stability as well as the facile fabrication process demonstrated that the 3D self-supported electrode has promising application in large-scale water splitting. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Amorphous carbon; Carbon fibers; Catalysts; Cobalt deposits; Electric connectors; Electrochemical oxidation; Electrodes; Iron; Iron oxides; Nanosheets; Oxidation; Oxide films; De-sulfurization process; Electrical conductivity; Electrical connection; Electrochemical activation; High current densities; Threedimensional (3-d); Water oxidation catalysts; Water splitting system; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84967221948

The incorporation of OVs into TiO2 is demonstrated to render considerably enhanced-rate performances, higher initial capacities, and an accelerated electrochemical activation process during cycling, derived from the boosted intrinsic electric conductivity and improved kinetics of Na uptake. Bestowed with the integrated merits of OVs and shortened Na ion diffusion length in the nanostructure, black titania delivers a reversible specific capacity of 207.6 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, retains 99.1% over 500 cycles at 1 C stably, and still maintains 91.2 mAh g-1 even at the high rate of 20 C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the lower sodiation energy barrier of anatase with OVs enables a more favorable Na intercalation into black anatase. Thus, it is of great significance to introduce OVs into TiO2 to stimulate ultrafast and durable sodium-storage properties, which also offers a potential strategy to project more superior electrodes, utilizing internal defects. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","anode; black anatase; oxygen vacancies; rate performances; sodium-ion batteries","Anodes; Density functional theory; Electrodes; Ions; Metal ions; Oxygen; Secondary batteries; Titanium dioxide; Electrochemical activation; Internal defects; Nano-structured; Rate performance; Reversible specific capacity; Sodium ion batteries; Storage performance; Storage properties; Oxygen vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964896371

The hybrid material possesses a hierarchical structure with 20-30 nm V2O5 nanoparticles uniformly grown on rGO nanosheets, leading to a high surface area with mesoscale porosity. Such hybrid materials present significantly improved electronic conductivity and fast electrolyte ion diffusion, which synergistically enhance the electrical energy storage performance. Symmetrical electrochemical capacitors with two rGO-V2O5 hybrid electrodes show excellent cycling stability, good rate capability, and a high specific capacitance up to ∼466 F g-1 (regarding the total mass of V2O5) in a neutral aqueous electrolyte (1.0 M Na2SO4). When used as the cathode in lithium-ion batteries, the rGO-V2O5 hybrid demonstrates excellent cycling stability and power capability, able to deliver a specific capacity of 295, 220, and 132 mAh g-1 (regarding the mass of V2O5) at a rate of C/9, 1C, and 10C, respectively. The value at C/9 rate matches the full theoretical capacity of V2O5 for reversible 2 Li+ insertion/extraction between 4.0 and 2.0 V (vs Li/Li+). It retains ∼83% of the discharge capacity after 150 cycles at 1C rate, with only 0.12% decrease per cycle.

The gaseous hydrogen ab/desorption properties of the alloy were measured by an automatically controlled Sieverts apparatus. The results indicate that the as-cast alloy consists of two phases, major phase Sm5Mg41 and secondary phase SmMg3. The MgH2 and Sm3H7 phases form after hydrogen absorption, while Mg and Sm3H7 phases exist after hydrogen desorption at 340 °C. Field Emission Transmission Electron Microscopy (FETEM) observation reveals the microstructure and phase distribution of Mg-based Sm5Mg41 alloy before and after hydrogen absorption and the hydriding and dehydriding reaction pathways as follow: Sm5Mg41 + SmMg3 + H2 → Sm3H7 + MgH2 Sm3H7 + Mg + H2. The hydrogen storage thermodynamics and kinetics of the Mg-based Sm5Mg41 alloy are improved as a result of the formation of the Sm3H7 nanoparticles. Consequently, the starting dehydrogenation temperature of the alloy hydride is about 270 °C. The dehydrogenation and hydrogenation activation energies of the alloy are estimated to be 135.28 and 77.802 kJ/mol, which suggests that the Sm3H7 nanoparticles play a beneficial role to reduce the total potential barrier that the hydrogen absorption or desorption reaction must overcome. The hydrogenation enthalpy of the alloy was determined to be -76.52 kJ/mol H2, indicating that adding Sm can slightly alter the hydrogen absorption thermodynamic property of Mg-based alloy. The desorption property improved by alloying Sm is attribute to the enhanced kinetics rather than the variation in the thermodynamics. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

However, its practical application into energy storage devices is often hindered by the bad electronic conductivity (from 10-5 to 10-6 S cm-1). As is widely known, doping with hetero elements is an efficient way to enhance the electronic conductivity of metal oxides. Herein, a novel and simple molten-salt method is developed to achieve a large-scale preparation of 1D MnO2 nanowires. Such an approach also realizes the easy tuning of electrical properties through doping with different transition metal ions. On the basis of first-principle calculation as well as four-probe measurement, we determined that the conductivity of the doped MnO2 nanowires can be promoted efficiently by utilizing such protocol. Meanwhile, a possible doping route is discussed in detail. As a result, a superior electrochemical performance can be observed in such metal ions (M+)-doped nanowires.

It is found that the rhombohedral Fe2O3 can transform to the cubic Fe3O4 via a calcination treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere, and lithium-ion storage performances of Fe3O4 get an obvious improvement due to its structural advantages. On the basis of data calculated by X-ray diffraction, the larger unit cell volume as well as the higher void fraction of cubic Fe3O4 provides lithium-ions with more transport channels for Li ions diffusion and storage without serious volume change, and thus the cubic Fe3O4 delivers an excellent reversible capacity of 921.1 mAh g-1 after 15 cycles at the current density of 50 mA g-1, which is much higher than 328.3 mAh g-1 for the rhombohedral Fe2O3.

To this end, a simple, accurate, and efficient energy consumption model is needed to develop real-time eco-driving and eco-routing systems that can enhance the energy efficiency of EVs and thus extend their travel range. Although numerous publications have focused on the modeling of EV energy consumption levels, these studies are limited to measuring energy consumption of an EV's control algorithm, macro-project evaluations, or simplified well-to-wheels analyses. Consequently, this paper addresses this need by developing a simple EV energy model that computes an EV's instantaneous energy consumption using second-by-second vehicle speed, acceleration and roadway grade data as input variables. In doing so, the model estimates the instantaneous braking energy regeneration. The proposed model can be easily implemented in the following applications: in-vehicle, Smartphone eco-driving, eco-routing and transportation simulation software to quantify the network-wide energy consumption levels for a fleet of EVs. One of the main advantages of EVs is their ability to recover energy while braking using a regenerative braking system. State-of-the-art vehicle energy consumption models consider an average constant regenerative braking energy efficiency or regenerative braking factors that are mainly dependent on the vehicle's average speed. In an attempt to enhance EV energy consumption models, the proposed model computes the regenerative braking efficiency using the instantaneous vehicle operational variables. The proposed model accurately estimates the energy consumption, producing an average error of 5.9% relative to empirical data. The results also demonstrate that EVs can recover a higher amount of energy in an urban driving environment when compared to high speed highway driving using the proposed model.

However, because of the complex nature of power systems, adding energy storage-based reserves to the power system may not necessarily benefit the environment. In this paper, we analyze these impacts in a test system and identify important drivers that affect the environmental outcomes. Dispatch results are obtained by solving an optimal power flow (OPF) problem and are used to determine emissions. We find that the impacts of adding energy storage are highly case-dependent. In systems with high renewable penetration levels and significant renewable curtailment, adding energy storage reduces emissions; in other systems, the impacts on emissions could be positive, neutral, or negative. The analyses presented in this paper show that policies to procure energy storage as a means to reduce emissions may actually lead to increased system-wide emissions if current dispatch algorithms are used. We also explore the impacts of modifying the dispatch algorithm to ensure system emissions with energy storage are no worse than system emissions without energy storage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Emissions; Energy storage; Operating reserves; Optimal power flow","Acoustic generators; Electric load flow; Energy storage; Particulate emissions; Complex nature; Dispatch algorithms; Environmental outcome; Operating reserve; Optimal power flow problem; Optimal power flows; Penetration level; System emission; Electric load dispatching; algorithm; emission control; fuel cell; power generation; storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957803892

Vehicle to Grid systems are promising substitutes for traditional gas turbine generators, which are relatively inefficient and have high emissions impacts. The purpose of this study is to predict the future net revenue and life cycle emissions savings of Vehicle to Grid technologies for use in ancillary (regulation) services on a regional basis in the United States. In this paper, the emissions savings and net revenue calculations are conducted with respect to five different Independent System Operator/Regional Transmission Organization regions, after which future EV market penetration rates are predicted using an Agent-Based Model designed to account for various uncertainties, including regulation service payments, regulation signal features, and battery degradation. Finally, the concept of Exploratory Modeling and Analysis is used to estimate the future net revenue and emissions savings of integrating Vehicle to Grid technology into the grid, considering the inherent uncertainties of the system. The results indicate that, for a single vehicle, the net revenue of Vehicle to Grid services is highest for the New York region, which is approximately $42,000 per vehicle on average. However, the PJM region has an approximately $97 million overall net revenue potential, given the 38,200 Vehicle to Grid-service-available electric vehicles estimated to be on the road in the future in the PJM region, which is the highest among the studied regions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Agent-Based Modeling; Emissions; Exploratory Modeling and Analysis; Net revenue; Planning and forecasting; Vehicle to Grid","Autonomous agents; Battery electric vehicles; Charging (batteries); Computational methods; Crashworthiness; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Grid computing; Life cycle; Particulate emissions; Turbogenerators; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicles; Agent-based model; Electric power demands; Independent system operators; Life cycle emissions; Model and analysis; Net revenue; Regulation services; Vehicle to grids; Secondary batteries; electric vehicle; electrical power; forecasting method; industrial emission; numerical model; planning method; technological development; turbine; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957088452

The study was performed using one-year hourly demand data of California's electricity grid together with the hourly-simulated output of various solar and wind technologies distributed throughout the state. The result shows that wind-solar complementarities carry significant multidimensional benefits to the future grid as compared to a stand-alone wind/solar based grid. Specifically at 20% total energy loss, it was shown that their optimal complementarities lead to very high renewable penetration with smaller storage and backup requirement. Our study of system dispatch shows that storage provides flexible dispatch strategy, which makes it applicable for various services depending on season of the year including reduction of summer backup capacity need. We have also found that the existing peak load based long term planning reserve criteria may no longer be applicable to very high renewable grid. Finally, comparing our result to literature data, we conclude that some of the pessimistic views of storage technology are borne out of our lack of understanding about its role and design requirement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Grid penetration; Grid reliability; Resource complementarities; Solar energy; Wind energy","Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Solar energy; Wind power; Electricity grids; Grid penetration; Grid reliability; Long term planning; Resource complementarities; Storage requirements; Storage technology; Supply reliability; Electric power transmission networks; design; energy efficiency; instrumentation; literature review; optimization; renewable resource; solar power; storage; wind power; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956855428

However, the unsatisfactory rate performance of NiCo2O4 may prove to be a major hurdle to its commercial usage. Herein, we report the development of NiCo2O4@TiN core-shell nanostructures for all-solid-state supercapacitors with significantly enhanced rate capability. We demonstrate that a thin layer of TiN conformally grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on NiCo2O4 nanofiber arrays plays a key role in improving their electrical conductivity, mechanical stability, and rate performance. Fabricated using the hybrid NiCo2O4@TiN electrodes, the symmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor exhibited an impressive stack power density of 58.205 mW cm-3 at a stack energy density of 0.061 mWh cm-3. To the best of our knowledge, these values are the highest of any NiCo2O4-based all-solid-state supercapacitor reported. Additionally, the resulting NiCo2O4@TiN all-solid-state device displayed outstanding cycling stability by retaining 70% of its original capacitance after 20,000 cycles at a high current density of 10 mA cm-2.

In northern latitudes the problem is especially significant, as the difference between solar availability in winter and summer is very large. Cooling needs do not increase electricity demand in summer as much as in southern locations, while there is a high demand for heating in the winter when solar power is not available. This study looks into the economics and energy matching of photovoltaic (PV) systems for single-family houses in Finland. It also introduces the concept of zero energy level of buildings (ZEL), which can be used as a policy tool for renewable energy support schemes. PV self-consumption is compared between cases with district heating (DH), heat pump (HP) and direct electric heating (EH). Because the price of buying electricity is much higher than selling it, any excess PV power after meeting appliance loads was fed to a thermal storage to be stored as heat. Analysis was done for a single building and a community of ten similar buildings. Excess solar power provided part of the space heating (SH) needs in spring and autumn and most domestic hot water (DHW) needs in summer. Self-consumption was increased by 15. . .70% with EH and by 20. . .40% with HP, when a PV system was used for space and DHW heating during summer and midseasons. Thermal storage increased energy matching, but high storage capacities did not provide a significant improvement over lower ones. Levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for PV electricity in a single building almost reached grid parity (11 c/kWh) using EH, but the generation cost for HP and DH remained higher (13 and 17 c/kWh, respectively). Investment incentives reduced the LCOE below grid prices for electrically heated systems. In the community, the economies of scale lowered LCOE, such that in many cases grid parity was reached even without incentives. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Finland; On-site energy matching; Photovoltaic system; Renewable energy support; Self-consumption; Solar heating","Buildings; Costs; Economics; Electric heating; Electric power transmission networks; Heat storage; Image matching; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Finland; On-site energy; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energies; Self-consumption; Heating; building; commodity price; consumption behavior; cooling; economic analysis; electricity generation; energy policy; energy resource; heating; household energy; incentive; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; season; solar power; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961589259

In the process of carbonization, nano-CaCO3 template decomposes and releases CO2 to form micropores and mesopores. Macropores are generated by removing the CaO nanoparticles using acid subsequently. The hierarchical pores are fairly well distributed because the nano-CaCO3 particles are highly dispersed in the fiber due to the better wettability in binary solvent. The obtained HPCNFs attain high specific surface area without physical and chemical activation. The HPCNF mats, possessing free-standing architecture, are used as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitor. Because of high specific surface area, rational pore diameter distribution and binder-free characterization of electrodes, the HPCNFs display a high capacitance of 251 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 as well as excellent rate capability and outstanding cycling stability (over 88% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at the current density of 1 A g-1). These results demonstrate that the binary solvent method is effective to achieve high-performance electrode materials and it has a promising prospect on applications of energy storages. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, the charging/discharging dynamics in MXene (Ti3C2(OH)2) electrode featuring intrinsic slit nanopore with room temperature ionic liquid are investigated by molecular dynamic simulation. The galvanostatic cycling is modeled to help to understand the dynamic charge storage mechanism. The simulation results show that the electrolyte ions spontaneously wet the Ti3C2(OH)2 slit nanopore in the absence of external potential, even at 0.7 nm layer distance pore case. An intriguing electroneutrality breakdown and faster diffusion property is observed inside the nanopore. During charge/discharge process, the charge storage takes place by a fast counter-ion insertion and counter-ion/co-ion exchange. Besides, the spatial distribution of ions and the orientation of the cation dipoles inside the pore vary cyclically alone with the charge/discharge process, which helps to screen the external electric potential. Having elucidated the charge mechanism, we investigate the layer distance factor and show that the ions exhibit more significantly acceleration and more ordered dipole orientation inside the narrower pore. This will help Ti3C2(OH)2 electrode with narrower pore exhibit better power performance. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Molecular dynamics; MXene; Slit Nanopore; Supercapacitor","Dynamics; Electric potential; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Ion exchange; Ionic liquids; Ions; Molecular dynamics; Charging/discharging; Diffusion properties; Electrochemical performance; Energy storage systems; Galvanostatic cycling; MXene; Room temperature ionic liquids; Super capacitor; Nanopores",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960125981

The practical application of these materials relies on the in-depth understanding of the crystal structures and reaction mechanisms during the electrochemical processes to overcome the potential decay issue. In this work, in-situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy has been developed and used to investigate the structural evolution of the Li-rich layered material (0.5LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2·0.5Li2MnO3). An electrochemical Raman spectroscopic cell with an excellent air-tightness and optical signal collection efficiency has been designed and used for in-situ investigation of the NM Li-rich material during the very first two electrochemical cycles. We found that the reactions of Ni2+ to Ni3+ and Ni3+ to Ni4+ appearing in the potential range of from 3.70 V to 4.45 V show a good reversibility. The in-situ Raman spectra after the first two electrochemical cycles also indicate the activation of Li2MnO3 changes the ionic local coordination structure and increases the ionic disorder of the pristine NM Li-rich layered material. This structural change has a great impact on the subsequent electrochemical cycles. The in-situ Raman spectroscopy results can help to improve the performance of NM Li-rich layered materials. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Integrating thermal energy storage (TES) device with BCHP system proves to be an effective way to improve the performance of the whole system. In this paper, the applicability of TES-BCHP system is investigated according to the relationship between user load demands and system energy supply. Based on the supply thermal power ratio of the prime mover and the required one of users, a new parameter, the degree of mismatch (DM), is defined. Moreover, the analytical relationship between primary energy saving ratio (PESR) of TES-BCHP system and DM is established, under following thermal load (FTL) and following electrical load (FEL) respectively for three typical working conditions. The results show that the more DM approaches to unity, the higher PESR of TES-BCHP will be, and that the exportability of the co-generated electricity is favorable for energy saving. It also indicates that TES-BCHP is more applicable for those where the heating demand is dominant.

The strategy employs a two-stage adjustable robust formulation to minimize the system operation cost, wherein a parameter is introduced to adjust the level of conservatism of the robust solution against the modeled uncertainty. Then a column and constraint generation algorithm with modified initialization strategy is adopted to solve this optimization model along with mixed-integer linear programming. Further, we evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy by hourly simulating the system operation of a practical project with Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical results show that the robust scheduling with a proper parameter can be superior to the deterministic strategy in all the studied cases. Additionally, the proposed strategy has similar results with the model-based predictive control strategy while the former only needs to be implemented once.

Fast charge/discharge rates of film capacitors on the order of microseconds are not achievable with slower charging conventional batteries, supercapacitors and related hybrid technologies. However, the current energy densities of polymer film capacitors fall short of rising demand, and could be significantly enhanced by increasing the breakdown strength (EBD) and dielectric permittivity (ϵr) of the polymer films. Co-extruded two-homopolymer component multilayered films have demonstrated much promise in this regard showing higher EBD over that of component polymers. Multilayered films can also help incorporate functional features besides energy storage, such as enhanced optical, mechanical, thermal and barrier properties. In this work, we report accomplishing multilayer, multicomponent block copolymer dielectric films (BCDF) with soft-shear driven highly oriented self-assembled lamellar diblock copolymers (BCP) as a novel application of this important class of self-assembling materials. Results of a model PS-b-PMMA system show ∼50% enhancement in EBD of self-assembled multilayer lamellar BCP films compared to unordered as-cast films, indicating that the breakdown is highly sensitive to the nanostructure of the BCP. The enhancement in EBD is attributed to the ""barrier effect"", where the multiple interfaces between the lamellae block components act as barriers to the dielectric breakdown through the film. The increase in EBD corresponds to more than doubling the energy storage capacity using a straightforward directed self-assembly strategy. This approach opens a new nanomaterial paradigm for designing high energy density dielectric materials.

However, for TiO2/graphene composites, impermeability across the graphitic basal plane for electrolytes, metal ions, and gas molecules hinders their practical applications. Herein we report a simple, environmentally friendly synthetic route for mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanospindles, and successfully apply this method to obtain in situ grown TiO2 nanospindles/graphene oxide composite. After a thermal reduction at 400 °C, holes are created in the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets through a photocatalytic oxidation mechanism. The formation of holes in RGO is promoted by photogenerated hydroxyl radicals that oxidize and subsequently decarboxylate the graphitic surface of RGO. The proposed mechanism was supported by photocatalytic electrochemical properties of the nanomaterials. The resulting TiO2/holey RGO composites may overcome the original impermeability of graphene sheets and find applications in catalysis, energy conversion/storage devices, and sensors. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","carbon nanotubes; catalysis; graphene; oxidation; oxygen reduction reaction; titanium dioxide","Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Catalysis; Electrolytic reduction; Energy conversion; Graphene; Metal ions; Metals; Oxidation; Oxides; Reduction; Titanium; Yarn; Formation of hole; Mesoporous anatase tio; Organic contaminant; Oxygen reduction reaction; Photocatalytic oxidations; Reduced graphene oxides; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Thermal reduction; Titanium dioxide; graphite; nanomaterial; titanium; titanium dioxide; chemistry; oxidation reduction reaction; photochemistry; Graphite; Nanostructures; Oxidation-Reduction; Photochemical Processes; Titanium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962128623

However, the severe aggregation and disordered alignment of graphene sheets hamper the maximum utilization of its surface area. Here we report an optimized structure for supercapacitor electrode, i.e., the vertical graphene sheets, which have a vertical structure and open architecture for ion transport pathway. The effect of morphology and orientation of vertical graphene on the performance of supercapacitor is examined using a combination of model calculation and experimental study. Both results consistently demonstrate that the vertical graphene electrode has a much superior performance than that of lateral graphene electrode. Typically, the areal capacitances of a vertical graphene electrode reach 8.4 mF/cm2 at scan rate of 100 mV/s; this is about 38% higher than that of a lateral graphene electrode and about 6 times higher than that of graphite paper. To further improve its performance, a MnO2 nanoflake layer is coated on the surface of graphene to provide a high pseudocapacitive contribution to the overall areal capacitance which increases to 500 mF/cm2 at scan rate of 5 mV/s. The reasons for these significant improvements are studied in detail and are attributed to the fast ion diffusion and enhanced charge storage capacity. The microscopic manipulation of graphene electrode configuration could greatly improve its specific capacitance, and furthermore, boost the energy density of supercapacitor. Our results demonstrate that the vertical graphene electrode is more efficient and practical for the high performance energy storage device with high power and energy densities. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","ion diffusion; morphology; orientation; supercapacitor; surface area; vertical graphene","Agglomeration; Capacitance; Capacitors; Crystal orientation; Electrodes; Graphene; Graphite electrodes; Ions; Manganese oxide; Morphology; Charge storage capacity; Ion diffusion; Ion transport pathways; Large specific surface areas; Optimized structures; Super capacitor; Supercapacitor electrodes; Surface area; Electrolytic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962081970

In this paper, a mathematical model was developed for MHTES systems. The charging and discharging processes of thermal energy were numerically analyzed. As shown in the simulation results, the temporal profiles of the average reacted fraction, the fluid outlet temperature and the hydrogen pressure appear to be repeated in a cyclic manner. The mean value of true temperature boost during the discharging process increases as the flowrate of the heat transfer fluid decreases. When the concept called multi-step charging/discharging operation modes was adopted instead of the conventional one-step reaction operation mode, the outlet temperature fluctuation of the heat transfer fluid of the MHTES system can be weakened.

The gravimetric hydrogen density of 12.68 wt.% is reached when Ca is adsorbed on both sides of the boron sheet. The mechanism for binding the attached H2 molecules comes from not only the polarization mechanism but also the orbital hybridization.

The utilization of an emerging ionic-derivatived ferrocene compound, ferrocenylmethyl dimethyl ethyl ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Fc1N112-TFSI), has recently overcome the issue of solubility in the supporting electrolyte. In this work, 13C, 1H and 17O NMR investigations were carried out using electrolyte solutions consisting of Fc1N112-TFSI as the solute and the mixed alkyl carbonate as the solvent. It was observed that the spectra of 13C experience changes of chemical shifts while those of 17O undergo linewidth broadening, indicating interactions between solute and solvent molecules. Quantum chemistry calculations of both molecular structures and chemical shifts (13C, 1H and 17O) are performed for interpreting experimental results and for understanding the detailed solvation structures. The results indicate that Fc1N112-TFSI is dissociated at varying degrees in mixed solvent depending on concentrations. At dilute solute concentrations, most Fc1N112+ and TFSI- are fully disassociated with their own solvation shells formed by solvent molecules. At saturated concentration, Fc1N112+-TFSI- contact ion pairs are formed and the solvent molecules are preferentially interacting with the Fc rings rather than interacting with the ionic pendant arm of Fc1N112-TFSI. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, Li-air cells that employ room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolytes exhibit poor performance due to limited oxygen solubility and low reactant species mobility. To circumvent these aforementioned drawbacks, we investigated the electrical performance of a Li-air cell with ionic liquid electrolytes operating at high temperature. A continuum based model is used to quantify the performance of the Li-air cell, with an ionic liquid (MPPY-TFSI) electrolyte, as a function of operating temperature. Simulations at the atomistic scale, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to obtain key properties for the continuum model. These properties include electron transfer reaction rate constant, species diffusivity and oxygen solubility. The MD simulations indicate that oxygen solubility in ionic liquid increases with temperature, which is very favorable for high temperature operation. The continuum based cell level simulation results show that the battery performance can be improved significantly by increasing operating temperature. For instance, specific capacity as high as 3000 mAh/g can be achieved at 110°C operating temperature, which is almost 25 times higher than its counterpart at room temperature. Simulation results also reveal that by increasing the operating temperature, the specific capacity can be improved significantly for high load current density, which is one of the most critical drawbacks in RTIL based Li-air battery. We also studied the effect of cathode thickness on the performance of Li-air battery at different operating temperatures. The transport limitation of oxygen and lithium ions can be alleviated at higher operating temperatures, suggesting that even thicker cathode materials can be used to enhance the cell capacity at elevated temperature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The chronoamperometric response of coral-like CoSe electrocatalyst can remain 98% of its initial current density after 10000 s at the overpotential of 350 mV in 1 M KOH. The prepared coral-like CoSe electrode exhibits a low overpotential of 295 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 40 mV dec-1, which exceeds previously reported state-of-art RuO2 electrocatalyst and is much better than CoSe nanoparticles (CoSe NPs) and precursor Co(OH)2 electrocatalysts.

It is common for SLMs to experience temperature shifts from manufacture, processing, storage, and transport to operation. In this work, we studied the thermal adaption of the supported membranes on silica substrates. Homogenous SLMs with little defects were formed through the vesicle fusion method. The mass and fluidity of the bilayers were found to deteriorate from a heating process but not a cooling process. Fluorescence characterizations showed that the membranes initially budded as a result of heating-induced lipid lateral area expansion, followed by the possible fates including maintenance, retraction, and fission, among which the last contributes to the irreversible compromise of the SLM integrity and spontaneous release of the interlipid stress accumulated. Based on the mechanism, we developed a strategy to protect SLMs from thermal disruption by increasing the solute concentration in medium. An improved preservation of the membrane mass and fluidity against the heating process was observed, accompanied by a decrease in the retraction and fission of the buds. Theoretical analysis revealed a high osmotic energy penalty for the fission, which accounts for the depressed disruption. This osmotic-based protection strategy is facile, solute nonspecific, and long-term efficient and has little impact on the original SLM properties. The results may help broaden SLM applications and sustain the robustness of SLM-based devices under multiple thermal conditions. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","fission; fluidity; lipid lateral area; osmotic stress; supported lipid membrane; thermal stability","Fluidity; Lipids; Liquid membrane electrodes; Membranes; Osmosis; Processing; Thermodynamic stability; Environmental conditions; fission; Lipid membranes; Osmotic stress; Protection strategy; Solute concentrations; Spontaneous release; Supported membrane; Liquid membranes; lipid bilayer; sodium chloride; atomic force microscopy; chemistry; confocal microscopy; fluorescence microscopy; lipid bilayer; osmosis; photon correlation spectroscopy; quartz crystal microbalance; temperature; thermodynamics; Dynamic Light Scattering; Lipid Bilayers; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Microscopy, Confocal; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Osmosis; Quartz Crystal Microbalance Techniques; Sodium Chloride; Temperature; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960532545

However, the poor cycle life owing to structural instability remains as the major hurdle for its practical application; hence, making the structure-to-performance design on the PANI-based supercapacitors is highly desirable. In this work, unique core-shell NiCo2O4@PANI nanorod arrays (NRAs) are rationally designed and employed as the electrode material for supercapacitors. With highly porous NiCo2O4 as the conductive core and strain buffer support and nanoscale PANI layer as the electrochemically active component, such a heterostructure achieves favorably high capacitance while maintaining good cycling stability and rate capability. By adopting the optimally uniform and intimate coating of PANI, the fabricated electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 901 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte and outstanding capacitance retention of 91% after 3000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g-1, which is superior to the electrochemical performance of most reported PANI-based pseudocapacitors in literature. The enhanced electrochemical performance demonstrates the complementary contributions of both componential structures in the hybrid electrode design.

These TMs are either from the same period or the same group of the periodic table. Our calculations are performed using all-electron full-potential local-orbital minimum-basis scheme (FPLO9.00-34) within the generalized gradient approximation. Based on our results, we observe a reduction of the heat of formation ΔH and also of the desorption temperature Td which reflects the improvement of hydrogen storage properties of most TMs doped MgH2 systems. In particular, Nb appears to be the best substitution, with an ideal heat of formation that equals to -40.96 kJ/mol, and a desorption temperature Td = 313.40 K. Our findings demonstrated that, the decrease of ΔH and Td is, mainly, related to the weakening of the bond between Mg and H.

It is found that the performance of graphite electrode is significantly affected by PC content in the CsPF6-containing electrolytes. An optimal PC content of 20% by weight in the solvent mixtures is identified. The enhanced electrochemical performance of graphite electrode can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the PC solvent and the Cs+ additive. The synergistic effects of Cs+ additive and appropriate amount of PC enable the formation of a robust, ultrathin, and compact solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the surface of graphite electrode, which is only permeable for desolvated Li+ ions and allows fast Li+ ion transport through it. Therefore, this SEI layer effectively suppresses the PC cointercalation and largely alleviates the Li dendrite formation on graphite electrode during lithiation even at relatively high current densities. The presence of low-melting-point PC solvent improves the sustainable operation of graphitea||NCA full cells under a wide temperature range.

Nitrogen-doped graphene acts as a template to induce the growth of layered δ-MnO2 and improves the electronic conductivity of the composite. The NGMn composite exhibits a large specific capacitance of about 305 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. We also create a cheap and highly conductive flexible current collector using Scotch tape. Flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors are fabricated with NGMn cathode, activated carbon anode, and PVA-LiCl gel electrolyte. The device can achieve a high operation voltage of 1.8 V and exhibits a maximum energy density of 3.5 mWh cm-3 at a power density of 0.019 W cm-3.

However, most of the Prussian blue compounds obtained from the conventional synthetic routes contain large amounts of Fe(CN)6 vacancies and coordinated water molecules, which leads to the collapse of cyano-bridged framework and serious deterioration of their Na-storage ability. Herein, we propose a facile citrate-assisted controlled crystallization method to obtain low-defect Prussian blue lattice with greatly improved Na-storage capacity and cycling stability. As an example, the as-prepared Na2CoFe(CN)6 nanocrystals demonstrate a reversible 2-Na storage reaction with a high specific capacity of 150 mAh g-1 and a ∼ 90% capacity retention over 200 cycles, possibly serving as a low cost and high performance cathode for Na-ion batteries.

The mechanism of desorption and the apparent activation energy for desorption were investigated by applying isoconversional kinetic analysis of DTA spectra, while desorbed species were followed by TPD coupled with mass spectroscopy. It has been demonstrate that the addition of rutile TiO2 significantly decrease the apparent activation energy for desorption (Edesa), while addition of anatase titania has negligible influence on Edesa.

The top and the bottom are steam Rankine cycle (SRC) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC). Particulary, screw expander (SE), which is characterized by good applicability in power conversion with steam-liquid mixture, is employed in the SRC. Steam is generated directly in the parabolic trough collectors (PTC) and expands in the SE. The heat released by steam condensation is used to drive the ORC. This type of SEGS has the advantages of avoidance of superheated steam, moderate operating temperature and pressure, low technical requirements in heat collection and storage, and suitableness for distributed power generation. Simulation of the system performance is conducted on the use of ten ORC fluids. Four hot/cold side temperatures of 473/313 K, 473/293 K, 523/313 K and 523/293 K are exemplified. The results indicate the ORC evaporation temperature corresponding to theoretical maximum solar power efficiency fails to provide a pressure ratio (PR) that matches the SE built-in PR. Off-design operation of the SE is recommended for the purpose of higher system efficiency and simpler ORC turbine. Efficiency of 13.68-15.62% for the proposed system can be achieved. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Organic Rankine cycle; Pressure ratio; Screw expander; Solar electricity generation system; Steam Rankine cycle","Efficiency; Electric power generation; Screws; Solar energy; Steam; Steam condensers; Evaporation temperature; Operating temperature; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Organic Rankine cycles; Parabolic trough collectors; Pressure ratio; Screw expanders; Solar electricity; Rankine cycle; electricity generation; performance assessment; solar power; thermodynamics; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953225187

However, the performances of PCMs in LTES and TM systems are seriously limited by their low thermal conductivities and poor heat transfer performances, which consequently stimulates intensive experimental and theoretical investigations on improving the thermal conductivities and heat transfer performances of PCMs by using different methods. The present paper reviews the recent progresses of the investigations and applications of the composite PCMs with the enhanced performance. The focuses are placed on the composite PCMs fabricated by using the metal foams and carbon materials, which have been proved to be the most promising approaches for thermal conductivity and heat transfer promotion on PCMs. The fabrication processes of the composite PCMs are first introduced in the present paper followed by the thermal characterization. The measurement of the effective thermal conductivities of the composite PCMs is discussed in detail by comparing different measuring methods, and the theoretical models to predict the effective thermal conductivities of the composite PCMs are also presented. The mathematical models describing the phase change heat transfer characteristics of the composite PCMs which are very important for system modeling and design are also addressed and discussed in the present review. Furthermore, the applications of the composite PCMs to LTES and TM systems are introduced and summarized by illustrating the typical examples. It can be understood that the composite PCMs can effectively improve the performances of LTES and TM systems, which therefore calls for the further investigation in this research field. Finally, the future research topics are suggested. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Mathematical modeling; Performance enhancement; Phase change material; Porous structure; Thermal energy storage","Carbon; Characterization; Energy storage; Fabrication; Foams; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Metals; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Composite phase change materials; Effective thermal conductivity; Heat transfer performance; Latent thermal energy storages; Performance enhancements; Phase change heat transfer; Porous structures; Theoretical investigations; Phase change materials; carbon; composite; heat transfer; metal; numerical model; porous medium; thermal conductivity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952909872

Prior modeling approaches to perovskite redox processes do not provide exact closure of the energy balance or thermodynamic consistency for calculating enthalpies and exergies of multiphase solid-gas flows needed in system-level process analysis. The approach documented here implements solid species thermodynamic functions derived from the enthalpies and entropies of reactions including oxidation/reduction and additional point defect reactions. The approach is fundamentally different than the typical approach of using partial molar properties to perform process flow modeling. Coupling process flow modeling to point defect reactions captures complex trends observed for oxygen non-stoichiometry and varying specific heat capacities during reduction and oxidation, maintains thermodynamic consistency between the solid and gas phase species, and thereby enables modeling of flow conservation equations for both the solid and gas phases. The thermodynamic model is fit to reported measurements for a highly reducible perovskite, strontium-doped calcium manganite (Ca0.6Sr0.4MnO3-δ), and then demonstrated through equilibrium thermodynamic calculations in process energy and exergy balances. Energetic and exergetic analyses for Ca0.6Sr0.4MnO3-δ redox cycles are presented for thermochemical energy storage and chemical-looping combustion systems where component exergy destructions are calculated. The model predicts roundtrip thermochemical energy storage efficiencies with Ca0.6Sr0.4MnO3-δ as high as 89% and 63% by first and second law analyses, respectively. The chemical-looping combustion of methane using Ca0.6Sr0.4MnO3-δ indicates first and second law efficiencies up to 90% and 66%, respectively. The modeling approach is used to explore trends in performance with operating conditions for both redox cycles thereby enabling new insight regarding design trade-offs for these emerging energy storage and conversion cycles. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Chemical looping; Exergy; Perovskite; Point defect model; Redox cycles; Thermochemical energy storage","Calcium; Chemical analysis; Combustion; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Enthalpy; Exergy; Flow control; Gas dynamics; Gases; Manganese oxide; Point defects; Specific heat; Thermodynamics; Chemical looping; Energetic and exergetic analysis; Energy conversion and storages; Energy storage and conversions; Flow conservation equations; Point defect model (PDM); REDOX cycles; Thermochemical energy storage; Perovskite; combustion; energy balance; enthalpy; exergy; oxidation; perovskite; thermochemistry; thermodynamics; Polygala incarnata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952845520

However, the thermal performance of these materials is hindered by typically low thermal conductivity-on the order of 1 W/m-K in the solid phase and less in the liquid phase. Much work has been done to improve the thermal conductivity of HTFs through the addition of nanoparticles of higher conductivity, such as metallic nanoparticles or nanoparticulate graphite. These nanofluids display improved thermal conductivity and otherwise behave similarly to the pure HTFs. This investigation proposes such a system, focusing on the nitrate salts: potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, and the potassium-sodium nitrate eutectic (54 weight percent potassium nitrate), with melting points of 334 °C, 306 °C, and 222 °C, respectively. Attention is also paid to use of these materials as latent heat thermal energy storage (TES) materials-i.e., phase change materials (PCMs). The nitrate salt melt is a highly oxidative environment, so the use of carbonaceous materials or elemental metals may be hampered by degradative effects. Hence, this investigation specifically examines cupric oxide (CuO) nanoparticle-enhanced nitrate salts systems. The thermophysical properties (e.g., thermal diffusivity, latent heat) of the salt-nanoparticle systems are measured. Further, temperature-variant FTIR spectroscopy is used to determine any potential degradation of the salt after thermal cycling. The suitability of the enhanced nitrate salts systems, in regard to the chemical stability of the additive and the improvement of the thermal performance of the system relative to the pure salts, is demonstrated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","HTF; PCM; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy storage","Chemical stability; Energy storage; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Latent heat; Nanofluidics; Nanoparticles; Nitrates; Phase change materials; Pulse code modulation; Salts; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Thermal conductivity of liquids; Thermal conductivity of solids; Thermal energy; Thermodynamic properties; Carbonaceous materials; Concentrating solar power; HTF; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Low thermal conductivity; Metallic nanoparticles; Nanoparticle systems; Oxidative environment; Thermal conductivity; copper compound; FTIR spectroscopy; heat transfer; melting; nanoparticle; nitrate (inorganic salt); performance assessment; storage structure; thermal conductivity; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952683772

To fabricate such devices, the flexible and economical current collectors are needed. In this paper, we report the stainless steel fabrics as the current collector for high-performance graphene-based supercapacitors. The stainless steel fabrics have superior properties compared with the widely used flexible current collectors. The flexible supercapacitors show large specific capacitance of 180.4 mF/cm2, and capacitance retention of 96.8% after 7500 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, 96.4% of the capacitance is retained after 800 repeating stretching-bending cycles.

The results show that the as-milled Zr(V0.95Ni0.05)2 alloys with different concentration MWCNTs preserve a ZrV2 phase with C15 type structure and the lattice parameter of ZrV2 phase increases with increase of the MWCNTs concentration. During the hydrogenation process, it takes 35, 10, 14, 10 s to reach the 90% of their maximum hydrogen storage capacity at 773 K for the MWCNTs concentration is 1, 2, 5 and 10 wt.%, respectively. It is believed the addition of MWCNTs increase the hydrogenation kinetics in the way of the remarkably increased diffusion rate of H-atoms originating from MWCNTs with hollow structure. In addition, the activation property of Zr(V0.95Ni0.05)2 alloy is not affected significantly by the addition of MWCNTs. The slope of plateau decreases and the width of plateau increases with increasing MWCNTs concentration, which accounts for the increase of the reversible hydrogen storage capacity. In addition, the equilibrium pressure of Zr(V0.95Ni0.05)2 increases with the increase of MWCNTs concentration. The absolute value of enthalpy and entropy decrease as the MWCNTs concentration increase from 1 to 10 wt.%, indicating that the addition of MWCNTs dramatically decreases the stability of Zr(V0.95Ni0.05)2.

The morphology and electrode architecture in advanced battery materials have been re-designed into nanofibers and composite nanofibers. Nanofiber-based separators and electrodes have demonstrated to improve the energy density and cycling performance of LIBs. The improvement in the structure and morphology of nanofibers in LIBs such as LiSi and LiSn, have once again ignited the interest in these Li:M alloy anodes as alternative anode and cathode materials. The major challenges that confront this new frontier have the lack of scalable method among the various techniques and designing nanofibers with good structure and morphology that could prevent dendrite penetrations. However, there seems to be a solution in sight with the advent of mass production techniques such as electrospinning and Forcespinning® that have recently been developed. In this paper, the use of nanofibers and composite nanofibers as electrode and separator materials for lithium ion, Li-O2 and Li-S batteries is reviewed. The discussion focuses on the performance characteristics of these nanostructured electrode and separator materials and methods used to improve their performances. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Especially, the Rh55Ni45/Ce(OH)CO3 NCs exerted the highly activity and 100% H2 selectivity for the decomposition of hydrazine, providing high turnover frequency (TOF) values of 150 h−1 at 30 °C and 395 h−1 at 50 °C, respectively, relative high values for the metal catalysts. The activation energy for the decomposition of hydrazine catalyzed by Rh55Ni45/Ce(OH)CO3 NCs was measured to be 38.8 kJ/mol, lower than most of the values reported for this reaction using many different catalysts.

Wind parks and photovoltaic stations are employed as the RES units, while Pumped Storage Systems (PSS), electrochemical lead acid batteries and electrolysis units for hydrogen production are alternatively investigated as storage units. The examined hybrid power plants operation aims either at the maximization of the RES penetration or at the power demand peak shaving. The hybrid power plants' dimensioning is optimized using as a criterion either the RES annual penetration maximization or the optimization of the required investments economic indices. The work is integrated with an economic feasibility study for each investigated hybrid power plant. The hybrid power plants presented in this article refer to insular autonomous systems of very small size (Agios Efstratios, Castellorizo), small size (Karpathos-Kasos, Astypalaia), medium size (Rhodes, Samos) and large size (Crete). The article designates how the size of the insular system affects the hybrid power plant's synthesis and operating algorithm. The investigated hybrid power plants are proved to be technically and economically feasible, regardless of the size of the hosting insular system. The sensitivity analysis of the required investments' economic indices indicated that the produced electricity selling prices can be lower than the specific electricity production costs in the existing systems.

To directly compare the energy savings and economic effectiveness of BES to more conventional energy efficiency technologies, this study collected detailed information regarding the electrical loads associated with four Colorado manufacturing facilities. These datasets were used to generate a set of three scenarios for each manufacturer: implementation of a BES system, implementation of a set of conventional energy efficiency recommendations, and the implementation of both BES and conventional energy efficiency technologies. Evaluating these scenarios' economic payback period allows for a direct comparison between the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency technologies and that of BES, demonstrates the costs and benefits of implementing both BES and energy efficiency technologies, and characterizes the effectiveness of potential incentives in improving economic payback.

Existing kinetic energy harvesting solutions, such as piezoelectric or mechanical energy harvesting systems, failed to meet the relatively high power demand of road tunnels. Traditional piezoelectric methods only supply micro-electromechanical systems. Their low voltage leads piezoelectric methods to not be applicable in realistic facilities. Due to the transmission loss of energy in a mechanical motion rectifier, mechanical schemes also fail to promote the practical application of renewable kinetic energy harvesting. In this paper, we present a novel high-voltage kinetic energy harvesting system that is installed at the entrance and exit of a road tunnel. It harvests power wasted by vehicles passing over the harvester. The proposed system consists of four main steps: a speed bump and suspension, generator and power storage modules. Acting as the energy input, the speed bump module harvests kinetic energy created by running vehicles. The suspension module resets the speed bump by driving it upwards after vehicles depart from it. Meanwhile, the generator module generates electricity from the kinetic energy collected by the speed bump module. The power storage module rectifies the current and then stores the electrical energy in batteries. The high voltage obtained in the simulation and field tests is a proof that the retrofit mechanism of the energy harvesting system is beneficial and practical in generating energy for use in renewable road tunnels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","High-voltage; Kinetic energy harvesting; Linear alternators; Renewable road tunnels; Speed bump","Automobile suspensions; Electric generators; Energy harvesting; Energy utilization; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Magnetic levitation vehicles; MEMS; Piezoelectricity; Roads and streets; Speed; Synchronous generators; Transportation; Vehicles; Energy harvesting systems; High voltage; Linear alternators; Micro electro mechanical system; Operation and maintenance; Reduce energy consumption; Road tunnel; Speed bumps; Electric machine theory; design; electricity generation; kinetic energy; modeling; renewable resource; road; tunnel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949744520

However, the preparation and use of GPEs are complex, and most GPEs prepared through traditional methods do not have good wettability with the electrodes, which retard them from achieving their performance potential. In this study, these problems are addressed by conceiving and implementing a simple, but effective, method of electrodepositing poly(vinyl alcohol) potassium borate (PVAPB) GPEs directly onto the surfaces of active carbon electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors. PVAPB GPEs serve as both the electrolyte and the separator in the assembled supercapacitors, and their scale and shape are determined solely by the geometry of the electrodes. PVAPB GPEs have good bonding to the active electrode materials, leading to excellent and stable electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors. The electrochemical performance of PVAPB GPEs and supercapacitors can be manipulated simply by adjusting the concentration of KCl salt used during the electrodeposition process. With a 0.9 M KCl concentration, the as-prepared supercapacitors deliver a specific capacitance of 65.9 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 and retain more than 95% capacitance after 2000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1.

It was observed that the presence of GO greatly affect the viscosity of RSF solution. The RSF/GO hybrid fibers showed from FTIR result lower β-sheet content compared to that of pure RSF fibers. The result of synchrotron radiation wide-angle X-ray diffraction showed that the addition of GO confined the crystallization of silk fibroin (SF) leading to the decrease of crystallinity, smaller crystallite size, and new formation of interphase zones in the artificial silks. Synchrotron radiation small-angle X-ray scattering also proved that GO sheets in the hybrid silks and blended solutions were coated with a certain thickness of interphase zones due to the complex interaction between the two components.

Impressively, the Mn-Co oxysulfide electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with an ultrahigh specific capacity of 490 C g-1 at 2 A g-1 and 415 C g-1 at 20 A g-1 which is much higher than 301 C g-1 at 2 A g-1 and 174 C g-1 at 20 A g-1of the Mn-Co oxide nanosheets electrode. Moreover, the flower-like Mn-Co oxysulfide electrode also reveals good cycling stability with 86.5% capacity retention at high current density of 20 A g-1 after 3000 cycles. Because of the flower-like structure and partial substitution by sulfide, which provides large reaction surface area and more flexible structure, Mn-Co oxysufide electrode with excellent electrochemical performances would have great prospect for energy storage device applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a simple and novel strategy is presented to activate carbon cloth via chemical oxidation and then followed by gamma-ray irradiated reduction process for removing the oxygen functional groups bonded on the surface of carbon cloth. Activated carbon cloth with extensive pore distribution and high surface area was made up into electrodes to measure its energy storage performance Despite only 5.6% change in surface area from oxidized to gamma irradiated carbon cloth (118 and 124.6 m2/g), the electrode based on gamma irradiated carbon cloth shows an obvious 74.6% enhancement of area capacitance (from 402 to 702 mF/cm2) critically due to the removal of the oxygen functional groups boned on the surface of carbon cloth by the gamma reduction process. It also provides a desirable rate performance of 86% (610 mF/cm2 at 20 mA/cm2) and 110.5% of its original capacitance after 30000 cycles. In order to further corroborate the prospect of the activated carbon cloth, a symmetric device based on the activated carbon cloth was assembled and it shows a maximum energy density of 0.556 mW h/cm3 and a supreme power density of 1016 mW/cm3. The promising energy and power characteristics and excellent cycling stability of the activated carbon cloth have high potential for low-cost, high-performance, and flexible supercapacitors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It shows a superior-specific capacitance of 1362F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1.When the current density increases to 16 A g-1, the specific capacity still retains 964 F g-1 (70.8% capacity retention).

However, H2O and CO2 in air are viewed as detrimental factors which hinder its performance. Thus, most previous researches focus on the Li-oxygen battery with pure O2 as working atmosphere. The actual influence of ambient air on the cell chemistry has seldom been investigated. Here, we carry out study of the Li-air batteries with tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME)-based electrolytes and carbon-nanotube-based cathodes operated in ambient air. The cells show the specific capacity as large as 7000 mAh g-1 upon the first discharge to 2 V and more than 50 cycles when being operated with the capacity cutoff of 500 mAh g-1. It is found that the TEGDME-based electrolytes slightly decompose during cell operation. Li2O2 forms during initial discharge and turns Li2CO3 and LiOH owing to its reaction with CO2 and H2O. The lithium anodes become expanded and pulverized after cycles, the problem of which can be relieved by protection with coated polymer layers.

Our calculations revealed that Ti preferred to substitute for the AlH site of AlH4 unit, whereas Nb preferred to substitute for the Al atom in bulk. Structural analysis showed that the structure of Nb-doped NaAlH4 bulk was looser than Ti-doped NaAlH4 bulk. The analysis of density of states illustrated that Ti interacted with Al atoms in covalent bonds, whereas Nb interacted with Al atoms mainly in weak ionic bonds in Ti- and Nb-doped NaAlH4 bulk. Thus, the diffusion of hydrogen atoms and AlHx units was more favorable in Nb-doped bulk than in Ti-doped bulk. The location of Nb atom in the NaAlH4 (001) surface was investigated, and an active NbAl2H10-Al2H6 complex was observed.

Noticeably, the energy density and power density of PEDOT-PSS/NMCO are by far higher than those of the existing analogues recently reported. The exceptional performance of PEDOT-PSS/NMCO benefits from its unique mesoporous architecture, which could provide a larger reaction surface area, faster ion and electron transfer ability, and good structural stability.

The results reveal that graphene nanosheet directs the cross-linkage of phenolic novolac resin to form a hierarchical lamellar structure, resulting in its perfect ions transmission channels and high conductivity (1020 S·m-1). The obtained lamellar composite has been exploited as electrode material for supercapacitors in both aqueous electrolyte and ionic liquid electrolyte. This composite exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 270 F·g-1 in 30 wt% KOH electrolyte at the current density of 1 A·g-1. The specific capacitance of this composite can still be maintained to a remarkably high value of 237 F·g-1 (87.8% of retention ratio) even at a very high rate of 50 A·g-1. In an ionic liquid electrolyte, the highest specific capacitance is evaluated to be 202 F·g-1 at 1500 mA·g-1 and the energy density of the composite reaches up to a value of 63.2 Wh·Kg-1.

The graphite plate and channel are also included in the geometric model to represent an actual cell more accurately and increase the generality and usefulness. Rather than applying Darcy's law typically used in a two-dimensional model to calculate the relation of velocity and pressure, we applied the Brinkman equation to handle the interface between the porous electrode and channel. The model includes a comprehensive description of energy transport and presents time-dependent characteristics of voltage and overpotential changes. The performance changes at different applied current density, temperature and flow rate values are also investigated. At a low applied current density, the flow rate has little effect on cell performance. The voltage and overpotential increase followed by a small increase with the increase in temperature. The current density distribution indicates the importance of cell structure optimization. The model is validated using data obtained from experiments in the literature.

To optimize large-scale integration of these resources and improve the operation performance of the distribution system, this paper proposes a novel dynamic energy management strategy with the cooperative interaction of an energy system: a multi-grid connected microgrids (MGs)-based active distribution system (ADS). A bi-level multi-objective optimization problem of the strategy is formulated with the active distribution network (ADN) in the upper level and MGs in the lower level. The interaction can be classified into two categories: the one between MGs and the ADN and the other one among MGs. The former is described by bi-level programming; the latter is innovatively explained by an interactive energy game matrix (IEGM) defined in this paper. The concept of the expanded energy storage system is defined and applied to the IEGM for the optimal operation of ADSs. The optimal operation includes improved technical performances in terms of power quality, energy utilization, adaptability and autonomy. The optimization problem is solved with a hybrid algorithm of Rough Set Theory-Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm-NSGA-II. Case studies of an ADS with different MGs and a real system would validate the efficiency of the proposed methodology. Results show that the proposed EM strategy can accurately quantify and guide the energy interaction among MGs and that between MGs and the ADN. Moreover, those technical performances of the ADS are improved. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Active distribution system; Bi-level multi-objective optimization; Energy management; Game matrix; Microgrids","Electric power distribution; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Rough set theory; Active distribution network (ADN); Active distribution systems; Cooperative interactions; Dynamic energy managements; Energy storage systems; Hierarchical genetic algorithm; Micro grid; Multi-objective optimization problem; Renewable energy resources; distribution system; energy conservation; energy resource; genetic algorithm; optimization; performance assessment; power generation; renewable resource; resource management; technical efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947901084

The phase compositions and microstructures of the alloy were analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then the alloy powders were subjected to isothermal hydrogen absorption/desorption characterizations, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis and pressure-composition isotherms (PCI) measurements. XRD and SEM results showed that the alloy was composed of primary Mg24Y5 intermetallic and fine dendritic eutectic Mg-Mg24Y5 mixture. First hydrogenation process resulted in an irreversible two-step disproportion reaction: Mg24Y5 + H2 → Mg + YH2 → MgH2 + YH2 + YH3, and 6.479 wt.% hydrogen was absorbed at 380 °C. For further absorption/desorption cycles, the alloy had a reversible hydrogen capacity of about 5.6 wt.% due to the fact that the YH2 has a very high thermal stability and can not desorb hydrogen at the present experimental temperature. The hydrogen absorption and desorption rates were gradually improved by increasing hydriding/dehydriding cycle times because the alloy particles significantly cracked and pulverized during the first few cycles. The activated alloy exhibited well isothermal hydrogen absorption kinetics, but the dehydrogenation occurred at relatively high temperature. DSC measurements indicated that the desorption process of the fully hydrogenated alloy began at about 320 °C and peaked at 367 °C when the heating rate was 3 °C/min. The activation energy was determined as 122 and 116 kJ/mol according to the isothermal dehydrogenation kinetics at different temperatures and DSC curves at different heating rates. Moreover, the enthalpy and entropy changes for hydrogen absorption/desorption were calculated to be -79.8 kJ/mol H2, -139 J/K/mol H2 and 81.2 kJ/mol H2, 141 J/K/mol H2, respectively. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","Activation energy; Disproportionation reaction; Hydrogen storage; Kinetics; Mg-Y alloy; Thermodynamics","Activation energy; Binary alloys; Bins; Chemical activation; Dehydrogenation; Desorption; Differential scanning calorimetry; Enzyme kinetics; Heating rate; Hydrogen; Hydrogenation; Intermetallics; Isotherms; Kinetics; Phase structure; Reaction kinetics; Scanning electron microscopy; Temperature; Thermodynamics; Vacuum applications; X ray diffraction; Dehydrogenation kinetics; Disproportion reactions; Disproportionation reactions; High thermal stability; Hydrogen-absorption kinetics; Pressure composition isotherms; Thermodynamics and kinetics; Vacuum induction melting; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027929767

The optimized c/a ratio was found in good agreement with experimental data of the C14 Laves phase. When hydrogen is introduced in the AB2 matrix (A = Zr; B = Ni, Cr) the A2B2 sites are preferentially occupied in the structure, followed by the AB3 while B4 remains empty.

The evolution of both hydrogen storage capacity and absorption kinetic behavior are monitored during pressure cycling. Changes induced by cycling are characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and particle size distribution (PSD). All studied materials lost part of their hydrogen storage capacity during hydrogen cycling.

HNFBs are composed of a molten Na-Cs alloy anode, flowing aqueous catholyte, and a Na-β′-Al2O3 solid electrolyte as the separator. The surface functionalization of graphite felt electrodes for the flowing aqueous catholyte has been studied for its effectiveness in enhancing V2+/V3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+ redox couples. The V4+/V5+ redox reaction has been further investigated at different cell operation temperatures for its cyclic stability and how the properties of the solid electrolyte membrane play a role in cycling. These fundamental understandings provide guidelines for improving the cyclic performance and stability of HNFBs with aqueous catholytes. We show that the HNFB with aqueous V-ion catholyte can reach high storage capacity (∼70% of the theoretical capacity) with good Coulombic efficiency (90% ± 1% in 2-30 cycles) and cyclic performance (&gt;99% capacity retention for 30 cycles).

To optimize PCM-based latent thermal energy storage systems (TESS), a better understanding of the heat transfer interactions during these transitions is needed. In this paper the heat transfer rate enhancement caused by natural convection of PCMs undergoing melting is quantified based on experimental observations. For this, a heat transfer enhancement factor and an effective heat transfer coefficient were developed. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests were run to measure latent heats of fusion and phase transition temperatures of the PCMs. It was found that the experimentally-obtained temperature ranges required for complete melting exceeded those produced by the DSC tests. The reason for this stemmed from the natural convection of the molten PCM. The effective heat transfer coefficients when natural convection was accounted for were greater than when only heat conduction was considered. The increases in effective heat transfer coefficient were 12% and 30% percent for vertical and horizontal heat transfer paths, respectively. The existence of natural convection reduced the time required for complete melting by approximately 45% for vertical heat transfer.

Buildings are often put forward as a potential supplier of flexibility services through demand side management (DSM) and distributed energy storage, partly as thermal energy. This paper presents a bottom-up approach for the quantification of this flexibility service. Cost curves are computed from the solution of optimal control problems with low-order models. These curves show the amount of flexibility and their associated cost. The method is generic and can be applied to heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) services, thermal energy storage (TES) and local electricity production. A case study is performed on a monitored office building in Brussels, Belgium. The results reveal a large variation in both flexibility and cost depending on time, weather, utility rates, building use and comfort requirements. The study shows that for the studied day, flexibility is not for free. The mean flexibility cost has the same order of magnitude as the imbalance price in the Belgian power system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Buildings; Case study; Demand response; Flexibility; Optimal control","Air conditioning; Buildings; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Heat storage; Office buildings; Optimal control systems; Renewable energy resources; Thermal energy; Demand response; Demand side managements; Distributed energy storages; Flexibility; Optimal control problem; Optimal controls; Renewable energy source; Ventilation and air conditioning; Smart power grids; air conditioning; bottom-up approach; building; cost-benefit analysis; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy resource; quantitative analysis; renewable resource; thermal power; ventilation; Belgium; Brussels [Belgium]; Brussels [Brussels (RGA)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948844655

We include sensitivities for technology costs and availability, fuel prices and emissions, and demand profile. Meeting an emissions target of 85% below 1990 levels is feasible across a range of assumptions, but the cost of achieving the goal and the technology mix are uncertain. Deployment of solar photovoltaics is the main driver of storage deployment: the diurnal periodicity of solar energy availability results in opportunities for daily arbitrage that storage technologies with several hours of duration are well suited to provide. Wind output exhibits seasonal variations and requires storage with a large energy subcomponent to avoid curtailment. The combination of low-cost solar technology and advanced battery technology can provide substantial savings through 2050, greatly mitigating the cost of climate change mitigation. Policy goals for storage deployment should be based on the function storage will play on the grid and therefore incorporate both the power rating and duration of the storage system. These goals should be set as part of overall portfolio development, as system flexibility needs will vary with the grid mix. © 2015 The Authors.","Batteries; Energy storage; Power system planning; Power system simulation; Solar energy; Wind energy","Climate change; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy storage; Financial markets; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Solar cells; Solar energy; Wind power; Balancing requirements; Climate change mitigation; Energy availability; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Portfolio development; Power system planning; Power system simulations; Western electricity coordinating councils; Solar power generation; climate change; cost analysis; electricity; emission control; energy conservation; energy planning; energy policy; feasibility study; greenhouse gas; photovoltaic system; solar power; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946811203

The model can be applied both for operating heat storage optimally and supporting investment planning for a new storage. Heat demand is forecasted based on a weather forecast. Each day the heat demand and power price forecasts are input to a generic CHP optimization model for a several-day time window to obtain a heat storage operation plan. Then only the first day of the plan is implemented with actual power price and heat demand using a single-day optimization model to compute the actual production amount, fuel costs and revenue from power sales. After that, the time window is slid one day forward, and the above-mentioned process is repeated. In the test runs, forecasts for power price and temperature are simulated by disturbing actual (historical) data by the Wiener process (random walk). To evaluate the benefit and validate the proposed method, the results are compared with the no-storage case and the theoretical optimum assuming perfect demand and price forecasts. The results show that the revenue from power sales can be significantly improved. The method is used to evaluate the benefit of different sized storages for the CHP system. Also the effect of the width of the time windows on the performance of the method is evaluated. The model was tested using real-life heat demand data for the city of Espoo in Finland, and NordPool spot market data for power price for a one year time horizon. The results indicate that considering the forecasting uncertainty, 5-day sliding time window method can obtain 90% of the theoretically possible cost savings that can be derived based on perfect forecasts. © 2015 The Authors.","Combined heat and power; Heat demand forecast; Heat storage; Optimization; Sliding time window algorithm","Costs; Digital storage; Economics; Forecasting; Heat storage; Investments; Optimization; Random processes; Sales; Vehicle routing; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power production; Heat demands; Investment planning; Optimization modeling; Price forecasts; Sliding time windows; Storage operations; Weather forecasting; algorithm; combined heat and power; cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; energy conservation; energy market; model test; optimization; power generation; price determination; random walk method; weather forecasting; Espoo; Finland; Uusimaa; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946595293

This paper investigates the optimal coordinated operation of multiple autonomous MGs and reveals the potential technical benefit. The proposed solution identifies the optimal network topologies and allocates the critical loads (CLs) to appropriate DGs based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm with power loss and reliability considerations. The non-critical loads (NLs) are determined to be supplied by the MGs based on the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach, which effectively improves the global utilization efficiency of DGs. Through the event-driven resource reallocation across multiple cooperative MGs, the dynamic balance between the power generation and demand can be attempted. The proposed approach is verified by using the IEEE 33-bus network model and its performance and scalability are further assessed through a large-scale IEEE 300-bus network scenario. The numerical results confirm that the suggested cooperative control of multiple MGs can effectively promote the capability of secure power supply to CLs, and simultaneously improves the global utilization efficiency of DGs significantly, even without any energy storage in the network. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Autonomous microgrids; Cooperative control; LMI; MST; Network topology matrix","Electric network topology; Linear matrix inequalities; Network architecture; Topology; Trees (mathematics); Autonomous microgrids; Co-operative control; LMI; MST; Network topology; Electric power distribution; algorithm; electronic equipment; matrix; network design; numerical model; optimization; performance assessment; power line; renewable resource; resource allocation; topology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944910115

Experimental results show that the methane reforming in tubular packed reactor can efficiently store high temperature thermal energy, and the sensible heat and heat loss besides thermochemical energy storage play important role in the total energy storage process. When the operating temperature is increased, the thermochemical storage efficiency first increases for methane conversion rising and then decreases for heat loss rising. As the operating temperate is 800 °C, the methane conversion is 79.6%, and the thermochemical storage efficiency and total energy efficiency can be higher than 47% and 70%. According to the experimental system, the flow and reaction model of methane reforming is established using the laminar finite-rate model and Arrhenius expression, and the simulated methane conversion and energy storage efficiency fit with experimental data. Along the flow direction, the fluid temperature in the catalyst bed first decreases because of the endothermic reaction and then increases for the heat transfer from reactor wall. As a conclusion, the maximum thermochemical storage efficiency will be obtained under optimal operating temperature and optimal flow rate, and the total energy efficiency can be increased by the increase of bed conductivity and decrease of heat loss coefficient. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computational fluid dynamics; Porous medium; Solar energy; Thermochemical storage; Tubular packed reactor","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Computational fluid dynamics; Digital storage; Energy storage; Heat losses; Heat transfer; Methane; Porous materials; Solar energy; Temperature; Different operating conditions; Energy storage efficiencies; Heat loss coefficients; High temperature heat transfer; Porous medium; Thermochemical energy storage; Thermochemical storage; Tubular packed reactor; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; chemical alteration; computational fluid dynamics; energy efficiency; equipment; heat transfer; high temperature; methane; porous medium; solar power; storage; thermochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927729451

However, separation process is pivotal for increasing its calorific value and removing CO2. This work presents the kinetic and separation efficiency study as well as microcosmic structure analysis for purifying simulated biogas (45.0 mol% CO2/CH4 binary mixture) through hydrate crystallization approach. Particularly, synergic additives comprise gas solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and traditional hydrate promoter (tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB)) were proposed to enhance the hydrate-based separation process. The promotion mechanism was explored through in-situ Raman spectroscopy. The residual gas phase and the decomposition gas phase from the hydrate slurry were sampled and analyzed. Based on the experimental data, the gas storage capacity, unit system gas consumed rate, gas selectivity and separation efficiency were calculated for evaluating the separation process. It was found that, the synergic additives could promote the mixture hydrate formation process due to DMSO (acid gas solvent) could improve both rate and selectivity of CO2 during the dissolution and diffusion processes. In addition, the Raman analysis reveals that the simulated biogas forms structure II hydrate and semiclathrate framework with THF-DMSO and TBAB-DMSO respectively, and CH4 molecules are only found in the smaller (512) cages of the mixture hydrates. It is inferred that DMSO just performs as an acid gas solvent during the gas dissolution and diffusion processes but not participate in the hydrate framework formation.

Here, we prepare Kx≈0.25IrO2 catalyst that exhibits an excellent OER activity compared to IrO2, which is univerally acknoweledged as a state-of-the-art OER catalyst. The prepared catalyst reflects a small overpotential 0.35 V at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a lower Tafel slope (65 mV dec-1) compared to that for IrO2 (74 mV dec-1). The performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray adsorption (XAS) experiments indicate that the Ir-site of Kx≈0.25IrO2 has a lower valence and more Ir-5d occupied states, suggesting more electrons on the Ir site. The extra electrons located on the Ir site and distorted IrO6 octahedral symmetry have a significant effect on the 5d orbital energy distribution which is verified by our DOS calculation. The performed DFT calculations state that the Kx≈0.25IrO2 essentially obtains good OER performance because it has a lower theoretical overpotential (0.50 V) compared to IrO2 (0.61 V). © 2015 American Chemical Society.","DFT; electronic structure; hollandite iridate; hydrothermal; OER","Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Electronic structure; Iridium; DFT; Hollandite structure; Hollandites; hydrothermal; Octahedral symmetry; OER; Oxygen evolution reaction; Renewable energies; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954460095

The as-synthesized Te@PEDOT coaxial nanocables have diameters of center cores in the range of 5-10 nm, and the size of the outer shell from several nanometers to 15 nm. More interestingly, the as-prepared Te@PEDOT nanocables can be converted to Pd@PEDOT nanocables via a galvanic replacement reaction. The center core of the Pd nanowire exhibits a high crystallinity. The application of the synthesized Pd@PEDOT nanocables as peroxidase-like catalysts for the colorimetric detection of H2O2 is reported. The synergistic effect between the Pd nanowire and electrically conducting PEDOT enhances the catalytic activity toward the oxidation of the peroxidase substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine in the presence of H2O2. A detection limit toward H2O2 is as low as 4.83 μM, and a linear range from 10 to 100 μM has been achieved.

However, to harness this remarkable potential for high power density energy storage, one has to address the interfacial potential barrier that hinders the electron injection from the metal side. Herein, we present that, solely by inserting ultrathin amorphous germanium (a-Ge) (∼5 nm) at the interface of NiSix/amorphous Si (a-Si), the rate capacity was substantially enhanced, 477 mAh g-1 even at a high rate of 40 A g-1. In addition, batteries containing the NiSix/Ge+Si anodes cycled over 1000 times at 10 A g-1 while the capacity retaining more than 877 mAh g-1, which is among the highest reported. The excellent electrochemical performance is directly correlated with the significantly improved electrical conductivity and mechanical stability throughout the entire electrode. The potential barrier between the NiSix and a-Si was modulated by a-Ge, which constructs an electron highway. Besides, the a-Ge interlayer enhances the interfacial adhesion by reducing void fraction and the inhomogeneous strain of the Li-Ge and Li-Si stacking structure was accommodated through the bending and twist of relatively thin NiSix, thus ensures a more stable high-rate cycling performance. Our work shows an effective way to fabricate metal/a-Si nanowires for high-rate lithium-ion battery anodes. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","electron conductivity; germanium interlayer; high-rate lithium-ion anodes; NiSix/a-Si nanowire; structural integrity","Amorphous silicon; Anodes; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Germanium; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Mechanical stability; Nanowires; Secondary batteries; Silicon; Structural integrity; Void fraction; Electrical conductivity; Electrochemical performance; Electron conductivity; Interfacial adhesions; Interfacial potential; Lithium-ion anodes; Lithium-ion battery anodes; Stacking structures; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954426669

The calculated binding energy (8.27 and 8.62eV) of the Ti atom to the hollow site of the zigzag and armchair substrate in the BTG sandwich-type structures are nearly double of the corresponding cohesive energy of metal Ti(4.85 eV/atom) and the binding energy of the Ti atom above the hollow site of the graphitic sheet(4.74 eV), consequently allowing the atomic dispersion of Ti atoms without clustering. Therefore, the adsorption of H2 molecules between by the Ti atoms in the sandwich-type structures will be experimentally feasible. The calculated average adsorption energies of molecular hydrogen around Ti in the sandwich-type structures are in the range of 0.27-0.41 eV, which intermediates between physisorbed and chemisorbed states(0.1-0.8 eV). The maximum H2 molecules adsorbed by each Ti in the BTG structure should be 2. The partial density of states and the difference charge densities explore that the Ti sites adsorb molecular hydrogen mainly through the well-known Dewar-Kubas interaction. The calculated desorption temperature and molecular dynamic simulation indicate that the sandwich-type hydrogenated structures are easier to desorb H2 molecules. Therefore, the Ti decorated BTG sandwich-type structures are appropriate for hydrogen storage at near-ambient conditions. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The study investigates the possibility of absorbing a part of the heat of compression in the high latent-heat material during melting, with the aim of saving the monetary and energy resources spent at the refueling station to cool the gas prior to tank filling. This is done while respecting the technical constraint of keeping the walls below the critical temperature of 85 °C to ensure the mechanical stability of the storage system even when the gas is fueled at ambient temperature. Results show that a 10-mm-thick layer of paraffin wax can absorb enough heat to reduce the adiabatic temperature by 20 K when compared to a standard Type IV tank, but its influence on the hydrogen peak temperature that occurs at the end of refueling is modest. The heat transfer from the gas to the phase change material, mainly occurs after the fueling is completed, resulting in a hydrogen peak temperature higher than 85 °C and a lower fueled mass than a gas-cooled system. Such a mass reduction accounts for 12% with respect to the case of a standard tank system fueled at -40 °C. A parametric analysis that embraces the main thermal properties of the heat-absorbing material as well as the major design parameters is here carried out to determine possible solutions. It is found that the improvement of a single thermal property does not provide any significant benefit and that the most effective strategy consists in augmenting the heat transfer area by employing extended surfaces or the encapsulation technique. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In particular, we use EEG data from an Alzheimer's disease (AD) pilot study and apply several wavelet functions to determine the signals' time and frequency characteristics. The wavelet entropy and wavelet sample entropy of the continuous wavelet transformed data are then determined at various scale ranges corresponding to major brain frequency bands. Non-parametric statistical analysis is then used to compare the entropy features of the EEG data obtained in trials with AD patients and age-matched healthy normal subjects under resting eyes-closed (EC) and eye-open (EO) conditions. The effectiveness and reliability of both choice of wavelet functions and the parameters used in wavelet sample entropy calculations are discussed and the ideal choices are identified. The result shows that, when applied to wavelet transformed filtered data, information entropy can be effective in determining EEG discriminant features, after selecting the best wavelet functions and window size of the sample entropy.

The method assumes a quadratic energy cost functional, and the non-causal energy optimal control ratio within the redundant actuation space is defined. Near energy optimal control allocation is addressed by using a LTI controller to align the control inputs with a causal approximation of the energy optimal control ratio. The use of a LTI controller for control allocation leads to low computation burden compared to techniques in the literature which require optimization at each time step. Moreover, the proposed method achieves broadband, near optimal control allocation, as opposed to traditional allocation methods which make use of a static system model for control allocation. The proposed method is validated through simulations and experiments on an over-actuated hybrid feed drive system. Significant improvements in energy efficiency without sacrificing positioning performance are demonstrated.

Preliminary studies were conducted where quasistatic and vibratory cutaneous haptic feedback was provided to subjects performing nonweight-bearing motion tracking tasks with the EMG controlled transfemoral prosthesis. The results of these studies showed that the subjects exhibited improved tracking performance when following pseudo-random step commands under EMG control augmented with static and vibratory haptic feedback cues. The work to be discussed in this paper augments the EMG control architecture to foster improved co-contraction of the instrumented antagonist muscle pair. Using the modified EMG control architecture, experimental studies were conducted to investigate the efficacy of two haptic feedback modalities in conveying information pertinent to single-DOF nonweight-bearing sinusoidal motion tracking tasks. The two haptic feedback modalities investigated were quasi-static pressure feedback provided with pneumatic actuation and vibratory feedback provided by a vibrotactile motor array. Able-bodied test subjects were asked to control the prosthetic knee to follow sinusoidal trajectories with and without visual and haptic feedback. Experimental results show that EMG-control performance in tracking sinusoidal trajectories significantly improves in visually devoid environments when haptic feedback in the form of error-based and pacemaking stimulation patterns are presented to the user.

This paper is concerned with improving the safety of wheelchair operation by the on-line estimation of tire slip. Wheelchair tire slip is a result of icy or low friction surfaces, often representative of dangerous conditions. In this research, wheel slip is detected by estimating the instantaneous center of rotation (ICR) locations of wheelchair wheels relative to the ground surface. Any departure of the estimated ICR positions from the wheel contact point indicates slippage is occurring. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm uses inputs of position and orientation obtained via map-based localization to detect changes in wheelchair ICR location estimates. The ICR EKF algorithm is verified in simulation. A robotic wheelchair is used for testing the presented algorithms under conditions inducing tire slip. The results show that the ICR locations do not vary significantly when the wheelchair is operated under normal conditions, i.e. low slip surfaces; however, they change significantly under slip conditions. Implementing this method with electric wheelchairs can improve the prediction of wheelchair motion on slippery surfaces, enabling warning systems and safe operational modes that can enhance the safety of wheelchair users.

This reliable, low-cost, alternative does not require power conversion equipment, as is the case with conventional variable speed. Previous work conducted by the author has demonstrated that a VRG can increase the power production for a fixed-speed system with passive blades. The current study characterizes the performance of a wind turbine equipped with a VRG and active blades. The contribution of this work is an integrative framework that optimizes power production with blade root stress. It works by defining a set of control rules that specify the VRG gear ratio and pitch angle that will be used in relation to wind speed. Three ratios are selected through the proposed procedure. A case study based on the simulation of a 300-kW wind turbine model is performed to demonstrate the proposed technique. The model is constructed with aerodynamic, mechanical, and electrical submodels. These drivetrain components work together to simulate the conversion of moving air to electrical power. The blade element momentum (BEM) technique is used here to compute the blade loading. The resulting torque and rotor speed are reduced and increased, respectively, through the mechanical system gearbox. The output from this is then applied to the electrical generator. The BEM technique is also used here to determine the bending and thrust and loads that are applied to the blade. The stress in the root of the blade is then determined based on these loads, and that caused by centrifugal force and gravity. The proposed method devises a VRG design and control algorithm based on the unique wind conditions at a given installation site. Two case studies are conducted using wind data sets provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Low and high-speed data set are selected as inputs to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method. Dynamic programming is used to reduce the computational expense. This enables the simulation of an exhaustive set of potential VRG combinations over each set of recorded wind data. Each possible combination is evaluated in terms of the total energy production and blade-root stress produced over the simulation period. A set of weights is applied to a multi-objective function that computes the cost associated with each combination. A Pareto analysis is then used to identify the VRG combination and establish the control algorithm for both systems. The results suggest that the VRG can improve energy production in the partial-load region by roughly 10% in both cases. Although stress increases in Region 2, it decreasesin Region 3, and overall, through the optimal selection of gear combinations.

However, there is a trade-off between efficiency and power density mediated by heat transfer, such that as the process time increases, efficiency increases at the expense of decreasing power. This trade-off can be mitigated in a liquid (water) piston aircompressor/ expander with enhanced heat transfer. However, in the past, dry air has been assumed in the design and analysis of the compression/expansion process. This paper investigates the effect of moisture on the compression efficiency and power. Evaporation and condensation of water play contradictory roles - while evaporation absorbs latent heat enhancing cooling, the tiny water droplets that form as water condenses also increase the apparent heat capacity. To investigate the effect of moisture, a 0-D numerical model that takes into account the water evaporation/ condensation and water droplets have been developed. Results show that inclusion of moisture improves the efficiencypower trade-off minimally at lower flow rates, high efficiency cases, and more significantly at higher flow rates, lower efficiency cases.

An accurate glucose dynamic model with physical activity as an additional input is highly desirable for the next generation artificial pancreas. In this paper, we present a nonlinear data-driven model that captures both the insulin-independent and -dependent effect of physical activity, especially the prolonged effect of physical activity on insulin sensitivity that can last 24-48 hours post exercise. The model was identified and validated using data sets generated by a physiological glucoseexercise model under a clinical training protocol. Compared to modeling the effect of physical activity as a linear additive term only in a glucose dynamic equation, the proposed nonlinear model showed significant improvement of prediction accuracy in all three metrics, particularly in large prediction horizons (P < 0:05). Further investigation in time-series data indicates that the improvement mainly resulted from the better prediction of glucose around the first meal time after exercise (6 to 8 hours after the meal was taken).

However, studying insect flight experimentally remains a challenge in both freeflight and tethered-flight settings. In free flight experiments, due to highly unpredictable and fast flight behavior of flying insects, it is difficult to apply controlled sensory inputs to their flight system for system identification and modeling analyses. In tethered flight experiments, constrained whole body movement results in silenced proprioceptive feedback therefore breaks the flight control loop and does not reveal any flight dynamics. Therefore, this work aims to develop a novel insect tether system using magnetic levitation. Such a system magnetically fixes an insect in space but allows it to rotate freely about yaw axis with minimal interference from mechanical constraints. This paper presents the development, analysis and feedback control of this system and finally test its performance using a hawkmoth (Manduca Sexta). In addition, a system identification of the magnetic levitation system and detailed analysis in closed-loop stability and performance are provided. In the future, the insect tether system will be applied to study the insect flight aerodynamics, sensing and control.

Leveraging the similarities between walking and stair climbing, this new approach adopts the general finite-state impedance control framework. Furthermore, important modifications are introduced to model the biomechanical characteristics that are beyond the capability of standard impedance control. The transition between the walking and stair-climbing modes is triggered through the real-time measurement of the spatial orientation of the user's thigh, which provides a reliable indicator of the user's intention of making such transition.

During hydraulic fracturing, a blender is used to mix sand with water and chemicals to obtain a fluidic mixture that will be pumped down a well to frack rocks. In order to achieve high-quality fracturing during a job, the blender needs to maintain its tub level as well as the density of the fluidic mixture. In this paper, an auto-tuning proportional-integral (PI) control is developed for the blender automation system to maintain the tub level of its fluidic mixture. The control system adopts a single-loop PI with gains that can be auto-tuned during a job. A relay feedback test is conducted for auto-tuning the PI gains online. The auto-tuning PI control has been successfully tested in a blender simulator. Experimental results have shown that the control performance was improved after auto-tuning and that the control system was adaptive to variation in system parameters.

It consists of a powered platform; therefore, the users do not need to wear or carry any measurement device or actuation system other than reflective markers used to record the ankle kinematics with a motion capture camera system. This paper describes the continuous development of the Instrumented Walkway and presents an experimental preliminary validation of its capability to estimate the impedance of a system with time-varying dynamics. To validate the system, a mockup with mechanical characteristics similar to a human lower-leg and controllable time-varying stiffness was used. The stiffness of the mockup was estimated with fixed and time-varying stiffness. With fixed stiffness, a stochastic system identification method was used to estimate the mockup's impedance. When the mockup presented a timevarying stiffness, a second order parametric model was used. The RMS error between the two methods was 2.81 Nm/rad (maximum 4.12 Nm/rad and minimum of -3.41 Nm/rad). The results show that the proposed approach can estimate the stiffness of systems with time-varying dynamics or static dynamics with similar accuracy. Since the setup was already validated for systems with time-invariant dynamics, it concluded the system's applicability for time-varying systems such as the human ankle-foot during the stance phase.

In this paper, the design and control of a new robotic knee orthosis is presented, with the objective of assisting the user's locomotion (primarily sit-to-stand motion) by applying an assistive torque on the knee, the largest joint in the human body. The orthosis consists of an orthosis shell and an actuation unit. The former functions as the user interface that transfers the assistive torque to the human body, while the latter generates the desired assistive torque with a motor-ball screw assembly. Through detailed design calculation, it has been demonstrated that the actuated orthotic joint is able to provide 20% of the required knee torque in the sit-to-stand motion. A controller for the robotic orthosis has also been developed by studying and emulating the knee biomechanics in the sit-to-stand motion. Benchtop testing conducted on a surrogate limb system demonstrated that the joint motion powered by the robotic orthosis is stable, smooth, and similar to the biological knee motion in the human sit-to-stand motion.

A hierarchical control architecture is proposed where the higher level controller is located at traffic signal light while the lower level controllers are equipped on each HEV. The higher level controller utilizes Signal Phase and Timing (SPAT) information from the traffic lights to generate target velocities for every HEV, which allows a maximum number of vehicles pass the intersection at given green light window. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is used to track the target velocity and evaluate the energy efficient velocity profile for every vehicle for a given horizon. Each lower level controller then follows the velocity profile (from the higher level controller) in a fuel efficient fashion using adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS). The lower level controller also feeds the average recuperation efficiency in a certain time window back to the higher level controller, thus affects the future velocity profile evaluation from the higher level controller, which is the major contribution of this paper. In this paper, the HEV model is developed based on Autonomie software and the simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

The method is based on using time-based trajectories that can induce a highly stable limit cycle to the bipedal robot. The time-based nature of the controller motivates its use to entrain a model of an amputee walking, which can potentially lead to a better coordination of the interaction between the prosthesis and the human.

Among various technologies developed to address this issue, the electrooculography (EOG) signal is considered most suitable for sleepiness detection. It is simple, and resilient to environmental factors such as light intensity and driver movement. Most importantly, the physiological signal changes in an early stage and can be used to detect the on-set of human sleepiness. In this paper, we introduce the development of a wearable sleepiness detection system based on analyzing EOG signal dynamics. The system includes wearable sensors, amplifying and transmitting circuits, and a smart phone that could alarm the driver if sleepiness is detected. In this system, the EOG signal is considered as a neurophysiological response of the oculomotor system. Blink signatures are extracted from the EOG signal. It was found that the poles of a linearized blinking motion associated with an alert state are different from those associated with a sleepy state. Based on this understanding, an algorithm to detect the driver's sleepiness was developed. A proof of concept device design has been completed. This system will help a driver to correct the behavior, and ultimately saves lives.

Mechanical behaviors of live cells play an important role in various cell physiological and pathological activities, and have been studied via various techniques and approaches. Studies of evolutions of mechanical properties of live cell, however, are still rather limited and scarce, due to the limitations of current instruments including SPM for single cellular measurements. Particularly, currently nanomechanical measurements using SPM is too slow to excite the mechanical behavior and then measure the corresponding response of life biological species over a large frequency range (broadband). Moreover, large uncertainty is induced in the in-liquid nanomechanical measurement using SPM, as in the indentation quantification, the effects of the acceleration force from the cantilever motion and the hydrodynamic force are not accounted for. The main contribution of this article is the use of a control-based nanomechanical protocol to interrogate the viscoelasticity oscillation of live human prostate cancer cell (PC-3 cells) and its dependence on myosin activities. The experiment results show that as the oscillation of static elastic modulus reported earlier in the literature, the oscillation of dynamic viscoelastic modulus measured is also periodic with a 200-second period. Moreover, as the elastic modulus oscillation, both the amplitude and the period of the viscoelasticity oscillation also strongly depend on the myosin activities, and closely regulated by the calcium density of the cytoskeleton.

There is already a rich literature on quantifying battery SOC estimation errors for different estimator designs. The novelty of this paper stems from its extensive examination of both the expected SOC estimation bias and noise, for a least squares estimation algorithm, in the presence of three different fundamental sources of these estimation errors. We show, both analytically and using Monte Carlo simulation, that under reasonable operating conditions, the expected bias in SOC estimation for lithium-ion batteries is dominant compared to the expected estimation variance. This leads to the important insight that quantifying SOC estimation variance using Fisher information furnishes overly optimistic predictions of achievable SOC estimation accuracy.

The first novelty is a 3-DoF spherical parallel manipulator (SPM) that uses three linear actuators. Each actuator is designed using a method of motion coupling such that the pitch and linear stroke DoF are dependent. By using an SPM, this shoulder exoskeleton takes advantage of the inherent low effective inertia property of parallel architecture. The second novelty is a 2-DoF passive slip mechanism that couples the user's upper arm to the SPM. This slip mechanism increases system mobility and prevents joint misalignment caused by the translational motion of the user's glenohumeral joint from introducing mechanical interference that could affect the device's kinematic solution or harm the user. An experiment to validate the kinematics of the SPM was performed using motion capture. A computational slip model was created to quantify the slip mechanism's response for different conditions of joint misalignment. In addition to offering a low inertia solution for the rehabilitation or augmentation of the human shoulder, the presented device demonstrates the technologies of actuator motion coupling and passive slip for use in exoskeletal systems. The use of motion coupling could be applied to other types of parallel actuated architectures in order to constrain the kinematics or improve stiffness characteristics. Passive slip mechanisms could have application in either serial or parallel actuated systems as a means of negating the adverse effects of joint misalignment.

Among several non-destructive methods, the vibration-based method, which utilizes global characteristics of the structures, has several advantages such as not requiring prior information on possible damage location and physical access to it. In the meantime, the mechanical structures are inevitably subject to uncertainties, whose distribution is often unknown in practical situations due to such as limited amount of available data. Uncertainties are treated as interval uncertainty in such cases. In this regard, this study presents vibration-based damage identification under interval uncertainty. To obtain reliable result, this research does not assume any random distribution, e.g., uniform distribution, inside interval. Since detected damage is not assumed to be monotonic function with respect to interval uncertainty either, traditional fuzzy interval arithmetic is not applicable. Instead, we first carry out exhaustive search to see the effect of the interval uncertainty on the identified damage; i.e., discretizing interval uncertainty into sub-intervals and executing damage identification under all possible combinations to see the effect of the interval uncertainty on the identified damage. We then develop the unique algorithm based on M-H algorithm to facility computational efficiency.

The fundamental trade-off between efficiency and power density is due to limitation in heat transfer capacity during the compression/expansion process. In our previous works, optimization of the compression/expansion trajectory has been proposed as a means to mitigate this tradeoff. Analysis and simulations have shown that the use of optimized trajectory can increase power density significantly (2-3 fold) over ad-hoc linear or sinusoidal trajectories without sacrificing efficiency especially for high pressure ratios. This paper presents the first experimental validation of this approach in high pressure (7bar to 200bar) compression. Experiments are performed on an instrumented liquid piston compressor. Correlations for the heat transfer coefficient were obtained empirically from a set of CFD simulations under different conditions. Dynamic programming approach is used to calculate the optimal compression trajectories by minimizing the compression time for a range of desired compression efficiencies. These compression profiles (as function of compression time) are then tracked in a liquid piston air compressor testbed using a combination of feedforward and feedback control strategy.

The system undergoes different approach angles of a pipe contraction as a typical profile of the so-called ""Smart Valves"" network containing tens of actuated valves. A high fidelity interconnected mathematical modeling process is derived to reveal the expected complexity of such a multiphysics system dealing with electromagnetics, fluid mechanics, and nonlinear dynamic effects. A coupled operational optimization scheme is formulated in order to seek the most efficient trajectories of the interconnected valves minimizing the energy consumed enforcing stability and physical constraints. We examine various global optimization methods including Particle Swarm, Simulated Annealing, Genetic, and Gradient based algorithms to avoid being trapped in several possible local minima. The effect of the approach angles of the pipeline contraction on the amount of energy saved is discussed in detail. The results indicate that a substantial amount of energy can be saved by an intelligent operation that uses flow torques to augment the closing efforts.

For outdoor environments, one of the most reliable methods for navigation is waypoint following. Usually, the path or trajectory to be followed is decided based on the behavior of the vehicle during path following such as time and energy consumption. However, feasibility of the trajectory is based on the vehicle dynamics and the ability of UAV to follow the path generated based on the way-point setup. Moreover, the paths obtained from minimizing time or energy consumption are often contradictory. This paper investigates two cases where the objective of the path planning based on the Continuous Cubic C1 Bezier Curve (C1CBC) method and 4 other first degree Bezier curves is: i) minimizing the time consumption, and ii) minimizing the energy consumption. At the end, the quad-copters were simulated through the generated path to reveal the effects of the path UAV follows to reach to the goal position.

We adopt a first order differential equation model with a binary (ON-OFF) switching control function for each load. An energy cost minimization problem is then formulated with a pair of constraints on the temperature lower and upper bounds, as well as an equality condition on the initial and final temperature states. We use dynamic programming to compute cost-optimal control inputs and temperature trajectories for a given electricity price profile and ambient temperature condition. To account for temperature deviation from its desired setpoint, a quadratic temperature deviation penalty is added to the cost function. Moreover, to minimize the control input chattering for equipment protection, the cost function is expanded to also minimize the number of on-off switching events. Results for the different weighting combinations of the optimization objectives provide useful insights on the optimal operation of individual and multiple interacting HVAC loads. In particular, we observe that the loads are desynchronized under the cost-optimal operation, in the presence of local (renewable) power generation. The presented optimization algorithm and observed results can lead to the development of novel model predictive and rule-based feedback control policies for optimal energy management in households.

The results of this work can be used for mass sensors design. The MEMS device consists of MEMS resonator cantilever over a parallel ground plate (electrode) under Alternating Current (AC) voltage. The AC voltage is of frequency near one fourth of the natural frequency of the resonator which leads to the superharmonic resonance of second order. The AC voltage produces an electrostatic force in the category of hard excitations, i.e. for small voltages the resonance is not present while for large voltages resonance occurs and bifurcation points are born. The forces acting on the resonator are electrostatic and damping. The damping force is assumed linear. The Casimir effect and van der Waals effect are negligible for a gap, i.e. the distance between the undeformed resonator and the ground plate, greater than one micrometer and 50 nanometers, respectively, which is the case in this research. The dimensional equation of motion is nondimensionalized by choosing the gap as reference length for deflections, the length of the resonator for the axial coordinate, and reference time based on the characteristics of the structure. The resulting dimensionless equation includes dimensionless parameters (coefficients) such as voltage parameter and damping parameter very important in characterizing the voltage-amplitude response of the structure. The Method of Multiple Scales (MMS) is used to find a solution of the differential equation of motion. MMS transforms the nonlinear partial differential equation of motion into two simpler problems, namely zero-order and first-order. In this work, since the structure is under hard excitations the electrostatic force must be in the zero-order problem. The assumption made in this investigation is that the dimensionless amplitudes are under 0.4 of the gap, and therefore all the terms in the Taylor expansion of the electrostatic force proportional to the deflection or itspowers are small enough to be in the first-order problem. This way the zero-order problem solution includes the mode of vibration of the structure, i.e. natural frequency and mode shape, resulting from the homogeneous differential equation, as well as particular solutions due to the nonhomogeneous terms. This solution is then used in the first-order problem to find the voltage-amplitude response of the structure. The influences of frequency and damping on the response are investigated. This work opens the door of using smaller AC frequencies for MEMS resonator sensors.

A tilting rotor quadcopter provides advantage in terms of additional stable configurations and maneuverability. Upon failure of one propeller, a traditional quadcopter has a tendency of spinning about the primary axis fixed to the vehicle as an outcome of the asymmetry about the yaw axis. This forces the quadcopter to land abandoning its mission. The tilting-rotor configuration is an over-actuated form of a traditional quadcopter and it is capable of handling a propeller failure, thus making it a fault tolerant system. In this paper, a dynamic model of tilting-rotor quadcopter with one propeller failure is derived and a controller is designed to achieve hovering and navigation capability.

Piston position estimation is useful for a number of automation and performance improvement applications in hydraulic actuators, pneumatic cylinders, and I.C. engines. A significant challenge to magnetic field based position estimation comes from disturbances due to unexpected ferromagnetic objects coming close to the sensors. This paper develops a new disturbance estimation method based on modeling the magnetic disturbance as a dipole with unknown location and magnitude. A Truncated Interval Unscented Kalman Filter (TIUKF) is used to estimate all the parameters of this unknown dipole. Experimental data from a pneumatic actuator is used to verify the performance of the developed estimator. Experimental results show that the developed estimator is significantly superior to a linear magnetic field model based disturbance estimator.

These robots achieve locomotion via actively controlled fins, and actuation is often achieved via oscillatory inputs. Given these types of applications, accuracy and energy-saving in trajectory control is of importance for mission successes.

The approach relies on the integration of PV arrays with individual batteries to form ""hybrid cells"" that are then assembled into series strings. We use Lyapunov analysis to show that the proposed hybrid strings are globally asymptotically self-balancing, meaning that initial variations in state of charge (SOC), no matter how large, converge to zero. The PV subsystem serves as a negative feedback path that guarantees self-balancing without requiring dedicated balancing circuits. This significantly reduces the cost of the power electronics needed for integrating batteries into PV farms, compared to typical integration topologies. The paper uses local linearization to approximate the balancing rate, thereby highlighting its independence of battery pack length and elucidating its dependence on subsystem sizing. Finally, a simulation study validates the paper's theoretical insights regarding self-balancing, and examines its sensitivity to parameter heterogeneities.

If a wheelchair's battery power depletes without the user being aware, the individual may become stranded, further limiting their freedom of mobility and potentially placing the user in a harmful situation. This research seeks to develop a State-of-Charge (SOC) estimator for the batteries of an electric wheelchair. A second-order equivalent circuit battery model is developed and parameterized for a wheelchair's lead-acid battery pack. To simplify the SOC estimation, this algorithm models a vehicle's fuel gauge. A coulomb accumulator is incorporated to estimate energy usage in the non-linear region of the OCV-SOC curve, while a Kalman filter is used to estimate SOC in the linear region of the curve. The estimator is verified using experimentally collected data on-board a robotic wheelchair. The implementation of these algorithms with powered wheelchairs can significantly improve the estimation of wheelchair battery power and can ultimately be coupled with warning systems to alert users of depleting battery life, as well as enable low-power modes to increase wheelchair user safety.

The suspension system is analyzed to estimate the harvestable power and damping capability of the generator. Analysis for the generator and its efficiency are presented. Harvestable power of around 105 mW was achieved at a 3.5-Hz input disturbance. The regenerative suspension system can reduce the vibration of the sprung-mass acceleration by up to 22% in an indexed performance. Around 8.4 W used to drive the motor in active control was saved when the regenerative system was used.

SOH monitoring is critical to battery management in particular for balancing the trade-off between maximizing system performance and minimizing battery degradation. However, SOH-related electrochemical variables cannot be directly measured non-invasively. Hence, estimation algorithms are needed to track those variables nondestructively while the battery is in use. In this paper, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate the number of cyclable Li-ions as an unknown battery parameter. Simulations are performed using an example parameter set for a hybrid-electricvehicle battery whose cathode material is LiMn2O4 mixed with other Li-compounds to obtain estimation results under a typical electric vehicle current profile that consists of a 1 C constant current charge mode and a discharge current profile for an electric vehicle subject to the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule cycle. The simulations show promising results in estimation of the number of cyclable Li-ions using the EKF under the ideal conditions. Next, robustness of the algorithm under non-ideal conditions (i.e., with SOC estimation error, modeling error, and measurement noise) is analyzed, and it is shown that estimation of the number of cyclable Li-ions using the EKF preserves high accuracy even under these non-ideal conditions. The proposed estimation technique for the number of cyclable Li-ions can also be applied to other parameter sets and batteries with other cathode materials to monitor the SOH change resulting from any degradation mechanism that consumes cyclable Li-ions.

In large complex systems, faults are often difficult to identify and predict, but recent advances in technology have enabled low-cost wirelesscapable sensors, which can provide an unprecedented amount of data to system owners. Combining this data with knowledge of the system dynamics, and a methodical structural analysis-based fault diagnosis approach, provides new opportunities in the field of fault diagnostics. The goal of the project described in this paper is to develop methods to detect and diagnose faults in industrial fluid systems in order to minimize downtime costs and energy losses, with minimum system capital cost in mind. This paper summarizes a portion of the first phase of this project, which focuses on fault modeling of a small-scale compressed-air test bench. Specifically, the design of the test bench, creation and validation of a flow model used to understand the test bench system dynamics, fault and structural analysis of an element of the test bench (an orifice-pipe combination), and the generation of a sensor installation guide that indicates what type and where to place sensors to detect and isolate faults that may occur. The sensor installation guide provided insight that all faults in the orifice-pipe element were detectable and isolable to the desired level with only a pressure sensor in the orifice and pipe. Orifice and orifice pressure sensor faults were uniquely isolable, but pipe and pipe pressure sensor faults were only isolable.

The response of the system was experimentally characterized by determining the latency, and the relationship between stimulation pulse width, stimulation current, joint position and generated output torques. After system characterization, stimulation control methods to enhance haptic sensations were designed, implemented and pilot tested under a variety of virtual wall hit scenarios. Our results indicate that the wall hit trajectories and interaction were improved by control laws that initiated low intensity stimulation prior to the wall hit and utilized cocontraction for damping.

In comparison to classical/modern control approaches, model-based control techniques, e.g., sliding mode control (SMC), applied to flexible fluidic actuators (FFAs) offer significant performance advantages and are considered to be state-of-the-art. Improvements in position tracking are possible using nonlinear control approaches that offer enhanced performance for common applications such as tracking of sinusoidal trajectories at high frequencies. This paper introduces a SMC approach that increases the tracking capabilities of prolate flexible pneumatic actuators (PFPAs). A model-based proportional, integral, derivative sliding mode control (PIDSMC) approach designed for position control of PFPAs is proposed. SMC and PIDSMC systems are implemented on low-cost open-source controls hardware and tested for tracking sinusoidal trajectories at frequencies of 0.5 Hz and 1.0 Hz with an amplitude of 8.255 mm and an offset of 12.7 mm. The PIDSMC approach reduced the maximum tracking error by 20.0%, mean error by 18.6%, and root-mean-square error by 10.5% for a 1 Hz sinusoidal trajectory and by 8.7%, 14.7%, and 3.8%, respectively, for a 0.5 Hz sinusoidal trajectory. These reductions in tracking errors demonstrate performance advantages of the PIDSMC over conventional sliding mode position controllers.

In particular, scalable data-driven approaches is of great interest, because it can deal with large volume of streaming data without requiring models that can be inaccurate and computationally expensive to run. Properly designed, a data-driven methodology could enable fast and automatic evaluation of infrastructures, discovery of causal dependencies among various sub-system dynamic responses, and inference and decision making with uncertainties and lack of labeled data. In this work, a spatiotemporal pattern network (STPN) strategy built on symbolic dynamic filtering (SDF) is applied to explore spatiotemporal behaviors in bridge network. Data from strain gauges installed on two bridges are simulated by finite element method, and the causality among strain data in spatial and temporal resolutions is analyzed. Case studies are conducted for truck identification and damage detection from simulation data. Results show significant capabilities of the proposed approach in: (i) capturing spatiotemporal features to discover causality between bridges (geographically close), (ii) robustness to noise in data for feature extraction, and (iii) detecting and localizing damage via the comparison of behaviors within the bridge network.

However, designing an active control for these vehicles is a very challenging task because the control system is usually under-actuated and has to meet multiple conicting objectives. Examples of conicting objectives include designing a highly relative stable system while minimizing the control efforts or maximizing the capability of the system to reject external disturbances. In addition, the mathematical models of these systems are not completely controllable and observable. This paper studies multi-objective optimal design of feedback controls for a sub-system of high-speed trains, i.e. the bogie system. The bogie system can be decomposed such that the observable and controllable components of the model are used to stabilize the internal states and therefore the overall system. A linear mathematical model of the system is used in the design. The controllable and the observable states of the model are separated to form a state-feedback control to drive the internal modes and the whole system to stability. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to search for the feedback control gains to optimize three objectives: the Frobenius norm of the control law, relative stability and the disturbance rejection. The solutions of the multi-objective optimization provide various trade-offs among the objectives. Numerical simulations show that the proposed control designs can stabilize the system even at a high critical speed of 500 km/h.

The overall experimental setup consists of a skidsteered mobile robot, Kinect sensor, laptop, wide-angle camera and two lamps. The OpenNI middleware is used to process data from the Kinect sensor, and the OpenCV is used to process data from the wide-angle camera. A new human-following algorithm is proposed based on human motion estimation. The humanfollowing control system consists of two feedback control loop for linear and rotational motions, respectively. A lead-lag and lead controller are developed for the linear and rotational motion control loop, respectively. Experimental results show that the tracking algorithm is robust and reduced the distance and angular error by 40% and 50%, respectively. There are small delays (0.5 s for linear motion and 1.5 s for rotational motion) and steadystate errors (0.1 m for linear motion and 1.5° for rotational motion) of the system's response. However, the delays and errors are acceptable since they do not cause the tracking distance or angle out of the desirable range (±0.05m and ±10° of the reference input). There are four gestures designed for the user to control the robot, two switch-mode gestures, lamp-creation, lamp-selection and color change gesture.

To design this filter, the air bladder is modeled using a standard linear solid (SLS) model. The prediction error minimization (PEM) algorithm is then implemented to identify the continuous-time transfer function of this SLS model, which is then transformed to discrete time domain to implement in a digital processor.

An islanded microgrid is disconnected from the larger, main grid, and must maintain voltage and frequency standards using only local generation. As a result, islanded microgrids are more vulnerable to fluctuations in power supply and demand; this is especially relevant for intermittent renewable sources like wind turbines. The system is stabilized with static-output-feedback H∞ γ-suboptimal control. This is a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) controller in which the measured data is used as the direct input to a static gain matrix, whose output is in turn used to control the closed-loop system. In order to judge the performance of the decentralized controllers, the micgorid is controlled first in a centralized manner, where each controller has access to all measured state variables. Decentralized controllers are then synthesized by casting the problem as a convex program, where each controller only has access to locally measured variables. Control performance is compared with respect to a switched-on wind turbine, where we see that the decentralized controller effectively mitigates the system disturbance due to the renewable intermittency.

Sensitivity analysis is done on this model to identify the effect of parameter variations on the State of Health (SOH) prediction. The sensitivity analysis shows that the aging model alone is not robust enough to perform long term predictions, hence we propose to use online parameter estimation algorithms to adapt the model parameters. Four different estimation methods are compared using aging campaign. It is demonstrated that the estimation algorithms improve aging model leading to significant improvement in Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction.

In addition, a kind of hard carbon with high graphitization degree was also prepared as a control by direct pyrolysis of alkali lignin (AL). The morphology and structure of the as-obtained carbon materials were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectra and elemental analysis. They served as anodes in lithium-ion batteries with the aim to investigate the electrochemical performance. These two kinds of lignin-derived carbon materials exhibited different electrochemical performances due to their various structures and functional groups.

Elaboration of MoS2 with desired structures, morphologies and compositions as well as fabrication of MoS2-based hybrids are current research directions. Herein, we demonstrate engineering MoS2 with a multiphase structure including 2H and 1T phases as well as edge-rich nanospherical morphology via a hydrothermal route with the assistance of carbon dots (CDs) for the first time. The resultant MoS2 3D nanospheres are formed through the self-assembly of MoS2 2D nanosheets consisting of a few atomic layers stacked along the (002) direction with an enlarged interlayer spacing.

In this synthesis, well-defined Co3O4-carbon hollow polyhedrons serve as both oxidizing agent and growth platform for amorphous FeOOH nanowires.

Among various methods, the development of an effective synthesis methodology that could give a high-quality outcome using special synergetic construction and enhancement of adhesion between the collector substrate and active material is a feasible strategy to solving the above bottleneck problem. Hence, in this paper we reported a universal, facile and low cost self-assembly strategy to fabricate binder-free Ni/Co-LDH array materials in situ on different substrates (typically: Ni foam, Cu foil, fabric, and CNT/rGO film) using a hypothermal chemical coprecipitation strategy under low temperature (55 °C) and normal pressure reaction conditions. The resulting Ni/Co-LDH array materials’ growth on each substrate displayed a special three-dimensional hierarchical structure with a well-defined nanosheet interconnected network configuration, which provides a generality and versatility to this synthetic method that is applicable to large-scale production. Significantly, electrochemical characterization reveals that the binder-free Ni/Co-LDH array electrode materials all exhibit a high specific capacitance over 2380 F g-1 (1 A g-1) regardless of the in situ substrate material, and excellent cycling stability (105.7% remained after 2700 cycles). The design and fabrication of AASs are also demonstrated by exploiting this binder-free LDH array as the positive electrode material, which has a high energy density (141.03 W h kg-1) and power density (1.17 kW kg-1). These results have greatly exceeded that of previously reported nickel or cobalt oxide/hydroxide based AASs and other typical AASs, such as those based on NiCo2O4, Mn3O4, and CoMoO4. Remarkably, with cycling up to 1000 times under a high scan rate of 100 mV s-1, the AASs still retain over 89.6% of their initial capacitance values. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Binders; Bins; Capacitance; Characterization; Copper; Coprecipitation; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Manganese; Metal cladding; Nickel; Self assembly; Temperature; Asymmetric supercapacitor; Chemical co-precipitation; Electrochemical characterizations; Hierarchical structures; High specific capacitances; Interconnected network; Large scale productions; Positive electrode materials; Substrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002766983

However, the inherently low thermal conductivity and poor photoabsorption of organic PCMs lead to slow thermal charging/discharging rates, hindering the direct thermal energy conversion and storage. Here, we demonstrate that multifunctional PCMs with high thermal conductivity, improved shape-stability and efficient light-thermal-electric energy conversion can be fabricated by introducing polyethylene glycol (PEG) into graphene oxide (GO)/boron nitride (BN) hybrid porous scaffolds (HPSs) constructed via an ice-templated assembly strategy.

Furthermore, the obtained composite PCMs with high energy storage density and excellent thermal stability can also be utilized to realize efficient light-to-thermal and light-to-electric energy conversion and storage, providing promising application potential in advanced energy-related devices and systems for solar energy utilization and storage. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Blending; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Graphene; Hybrid materials; Ice; Nitrides; Phase change materials; Scaffolds; Self assembly; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Electric energy conversion; Energy conversion and storages; Enhanced thermal conductivity; High energy storage densities; High thermal conductivity; Latent heat energy storage; Low thermal conductivity; Thermally conductive fillers; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002532864

Thus, it is crucial to develop composite anodes with high specific capacitance to match that of cathodes. In this work, a novel anode material with well-dispersed Fe2O3 decorated on vertically aligned carbon nanotubes has been synthesized by a facile two-step method, consisting of supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) assisted impregnation and subsequent thermal annealing.

The desiccant coated heat exchangers (DCHX) overcome this limitation. Such heat exchangers are able to deliver combined heat and mass transfer between the process air and the working fluid. The process air can be cooled and dehumidified simultaneously by pumping cooling water/refrigerant in the DCHX. The DCHX has to be heated cyclically to regenerate the desiccant material. This paper presents a review on the studies conducted on air-toliquid DCHX. It summarizes various modeling approaches used to simulate the performance of DCHX as well as the experimental studies conducted to validate these models. It also reviews the current and potential applications of these heat exchangers. Current work in this field consists of experiments conducted on the DCHX as standalone equipment (i.e. component level) as well as an integrated component into cooling and dehumidification systems (system level). The integration of the DCHX in such systems was found to improve the COP, leading to energy savings. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Air; Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Cooling systems; Cooling water; Driers (materials); Energy conservation; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Heat exchangers; Humidity control; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Mass transfer; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Coated heat exchanger; Combined heat and mass transfers; Component levels; Dehumidification system; Model approach; Sorption capacities; System levels; Temperature increase; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002496889

A key weakness in the deployment of many DG/CHP systems is the inability of the installed system to properly match up with the actual load that it is being asked to serve. In general, it is difficult to optimally match the demand of both electricity and thermal requirements with a single system as a result of variations in loads with season, site operational changes, and other factors. It seems apparent that improved flexibility in how a DG/CHP system's electricity/thermal production ratio is established will provide more flexibility in how a given system can meet a given demand profile. While examples of temperature increase via supplemental burners are available for small scale systems, a system to control both exhaust temperature (increase and decrease) and overall flow rate is not available. This paper describes the results of a multi-year program sponsored by the California Energy Commission to develop and demonstrate an exhaust energy tailoring system that will provide flexibility in both temperature adjustments and overall exhaust flow to meet the requirements of various heat recovery systems while providing low emission when coupled with a commercial distributed generation ""prime mover"". The program integrated a multi-stage Rich/Quick-mix/Lean combustion system operating on the vitiated exhaust stream from a Capstone Model ""iCHP65"" to provide flexible wide range control of the exhaust energy and quality. Additionally, the integrated system reduced both the criteria pollutant concentration levels and emission rates over the Capstone unit alone.

The pixels in camera image of the flux distribution are scaled by the flux peak value measured with the flux gauge or the total power value measured with the calorimeter. An alternative method, called PHLUX developed at Sandia National Laboratories, can serve the same purpose using a digital camera but without auxiliary instrumentation. The only additional information required besides the digital images recorded from the camera are the direct normal irradiance, an image of the sun using the same camera, and the reflectivity of the receiver or target panel surface. The PHLUX method was evaluated using two digital cameras (Nikon D90 and D3300) at different flux levels on a target panel. The performances of the two cameras were compared to each other and to measurements from a Kendall radiometer. For consistency in comparison of the two cameras, the same focal length lenses and same number of neutral density filters were used. Other camera settings (e.g., shutter speed, f-stop, etc.) were set based on the aperture size and performance of the cameras. The Nikon D3300 has twice the number of pixels as the D90. D3300 provided higher resolution, however, due to the smaller pixel sizes the images were noisier, and the D90 with larger pixels had better response to low light levels. The noise in the D3300, if not corrected, could result in gross overestimation of the irradiance calculations. After corrections to the D3300 flux images, the PHLUX results from the two cameras showed they agreed to within 8% for a peak flux level of 1000 suns on the target, and less than 10% error in the peak flux when compared to the Kendall radiometer. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Calorimeters; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Digital cameras; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Gages; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Pixels; Radiometers; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Video cameras; Wind power; Auxiliary instrumentation; Beam characterization; Camera settings; Direct normal irradiances; Flux distributions; Higher resolution; Neutral density filters; Sandia National Laboratories; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002487970

High failure rates of expensive nacelle-based electronics and gearboxes are particularly problematic. On-going research is investigating the possibility of shifting to a seawater-based hydraulic power transmission, whereby wind turbines pressurise seawater that is transmitted across a high-pressure pipeline network. A 9-turbine hydraulic wind farm with three different configurations is simulated in the present work and a previously developed method for open-loop pressure control of a single turbine has been adapted for this multiple-turbine scenario. A conceptual quasi-constant-pressure accumulator is also included in the model. This system is directly integrated within each hydraulic wind turbine and it allows the output power from the wind farm to be scheduled on an hourly basis. The shift in control methodology when integrating storage is illustrated in the present work. Simulation results indicate a strong relationship between hydraulic performance attributes and the specific wind turbine array layout. The beneficial effects of storage can also be observed, particularly in smoothing the output power and rendering it more useable. Finally, the energy yields from 24-hour simulations of the 9-turbine wind farms are calculated. Integrated storage leads to a slight increase in yield since it eliminates bursts of high flow, which induce higher frictional losses in the pipeline network. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Environmental technology; Failure analysis; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; High pressure pipelines; Hydraulic motors; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Pipelines; Seawater; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Wind turbines; Beneficial effects; Constant pressures; Frictional loss; Hydraulic energy storage; Hydraulic performance; Integrated storage; Pipeline networks; Technical challenges; Offshore wind farms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002444309

Phase 1 of the project focused on design trades and cost analyses leading to a cost-optimized self-powered autonomous tracking heliostat concept with a mirror surface area in the 100m range. In Phase 2 30-year accelerated testing of the mirror modules based on ReflecTec film with 94% specular reflectivity bonded on composite foam substrate were initiated and completed in Phase 3. The tests with 15 coupons showed optical performance degradation of less than 5% in specular reflectance following 30-year equivalent UV testing and other abuse testing such as acid rain, bird dropping, thermal cycling, etc. A small scale prototype (3mx2m) heliostat design based on modular truss elements with removable mirror modules was developed in detail. In this phase components such as the dual-axis actuators were sized and selected based on wind load requirements and pointing accuracy demands were completed. Finite Element analyses for the mechanical structure with mirror modules were performed using three separate commercial codes - ANSYS, COMSOL and SolidWorks to validate the optical errors induced by wind loads on the structure up to 35 mph. Results indicated that the RMS deflections contributed to less than 0.4 mrad pointing error. Dynamic response of the heliostat indicated that the first 5 eigenmodes were in the 17-20 Hz range. The individual structure elements such as the trusses and c-rails were fabricated locally and assembled with the mirror facets in the lab for initial fit check and testing. The nine mirror facet surface errors were characterized using photogrammetry and verified using Reverse Hartmann techniques and showed to be in the order of 1 mrad or less. A three-level controller (main, gateway and heliostat) was architected and built. Tracking of the sun is done using NREL's Sun Tracking Algorithm implemented in the gateway controller. Target-pointing vectors are calculated for each heliostat and conveyed wirelessly to the individual heliostat controllers for actuating the azimuth and elevation motors. The power subsystem consisting of solar panels and a battery provide 24V for the actuators and controller boards. The system was sized to provide adequate power for a period of 5hrs of operation when power is not available. Initial calibration will be performed with on-site camera tracking the sun's image on a target located approximately 52m from the heliostat. Testing of the heliostat pointing under calm and windy conditions will be done to demonstrate overall performance that meet DOE targets of 4 mrad under 27mph winds. Commercialization efforts are underway to transition the design to the commercial sector. The project is well on its way to approaching overall cost targets and current estimates are approximately $90-110/m2 and lower costs can be achieved with alternates to the film we have identified. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Acid rain; Actuators; Aerodynamic loads; Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Concentration (process); Controllers; Costs; Dynamic loads; Environmental technology; Errors; Finite element method; Foams; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Loads (forces); Mirrors; Optical testing; Reflection; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Target tracking; Thermoanalysis; Thin films; Trusses; Wind power; Wind stress; Accelerated testing; Autonomous tracking; Individual structures; Mechanical structures; Optical performance; Specular reflectance; Specular reflectivity; Technology development; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002406501

Distributed bio-refining systems would be able to operate on private farm and commercial scales, eliminating the need for large capital investment for large processing facilities and decreasing logistical concerns for harvesting and marketing corn stover. A techno-economic model was developed to analyze the economics of harvesting techniques, logistics, processing requirements, and end product utilization. With the model, a base case analysis was established to analyze average values and to create a basis in which to compare a variety of economic scenarios. A sensitivity analysis was also completed to investigate outcomes based on variability of crop yields and product price, as well as costs associated with harvesting stover, input for operating the torrefaction system, and capital costs of equipment. Results of the analyses were quantified with respect to input costs required to generate torrefied products, potential profit of processed products, and the payback period of the production and conversion system. Preliminary results indicated that processing corn stover feedstock within a distribution torrefaction bio-refining system had high potential, in terms of economic feasibility, over a wide range of scenarios. Results indicated that payback periods as low as five years were possible under a wide variety of applications and operating costs.

The multicomponent mixture with variable temperature across boiling is employed as a working fluid. This has a potential for decreasing exergy loss associated with heat transfer during phase change processes (boiling and condensation). Absorption process has also an effect of lowering exhaust pressure of a turbine. The APCs hold a potential for heat recovery applications at very low temperatures, where constant temperature of boiling and condensation largely limits performance and economic effectiveness of Organic Rankine cycles (ORCs). Theoretical calculations show superiority of APC over extensive range of considered ORC working fluid. The advantage of APC further increases when air cooled condenser needs to be used instead of wet cooling tower. With the same boundary conditions for all cycles the APC provides higher utilization efficiency and power output at source temperatures below approximately 120 °C, for temperatures as low as 60 °C the net power output can be surpassed even more than three times. The proposed APC employs aqueous solution of salts considered generally for absorption cooling (Lithium Bromide, Lithium Chloride, Calcium Chloride) as a working fluid. Unlike ammonia used in mixture with water in Kalina APC or often ORC working fluids, used salts are non-toxic, environmentally friendly and pure water in expander simplifies its design. After summary of theoretical research from thermodynamics point of view are discussed principles, aspects and issues for design of single components of the cycle. Results of sizing are presented on two examples with 100 °C heat source. First one is 20 kWeunit using hot air as a heat source and air cooled condenser, second one is 500 kWeunit with heat source being pressurized water and using wet cooling tower heat rejection.

In most grain production scenarios, supplemental drying is required post-harvest to allow long-term storage of the crop. Traditional high-temperature, high airflow drying systems have been known to be an energy intensive and high cost process of grain production. However, advanced continuous flow drying systems have shown to be 30% or more energy efficient than systems produced in recent decades. In this study, harvesting times (early fall, mid-fall, late fall) were compared to quantify the effects of field losses as the fall progresses with the potentially reduced drying requirement as the crop undergoes natural drying in the field. A model was developed to investigate the energy and economics of drying, based on harvest period, dryer efficiency, field drydown, and field losses. A sensitivity analysis was completed that focused on the energy consumption of artificial drying based upon harvesting conditions, as well as economic factors of field drying and fuel cost. Preliminary results of the study have shown that the use of higher efficiency drying systems combined with moderately prompt harvest times generally provide the most profitable scenario, while delayed harvest times increase the likelihood of field loss, which are not typically offset by the reduced drying requirements. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Cost benefit analysis; Crops; Drying; Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Grain (agricultural product); Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Profitability; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Artificial drying; Drying technique; Economic factors; Energy efficient; Energy requirements; Grain production; Higher efficiency; Long-term storage; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002376259

Recently the burden placed upon local utilities is an issue some regulators have been asked to address. This research uses actual 2013 and 2014 solar production data from nearly 200 sites, wholesale electricity day-ahead pricing data, and utility-wide demand data. This is all analyzed by the hour for two full years for a western Pennsylvania based utility and an eastern Pennsylvania based utility and their wholesale generators. Results show electricity is 15% more valuable when solar PV systems are generating power and feeding the grid during good weather conditions than at night or cloudy days when solar customers get energy back from the grid. Solar energy generation is highly predictable in the dayahead market, and leads to suppression in market prices for electricity. Thus to reveal the true impact of this market suppression, an increased solar renewable portfolio standard (RPS) fraction of 0.2 to 10% was simulated. This caused a decrease in demand resulting in a corresponding reduction in the price of electricity yielding savings to the utility. The maximum rate of increase and decrease in the utility-wide load did not change significantly until the solar RPS exceeded 5%. Additionally, the demand for electricity was reduced during the highest load hours of the year that corresponded to the most expensive hours of the year. The minimum base-load of the year was decreased substantially for solar RPS of 5% or greater and the base load reaches zero for solar RPS over 10%. From the data of these two years, it is demonstrated that an increased use of solar energy would lead to savings that are larger than the loss in revenue due to having fewer traditional non-solar customers. Thus electricity suppliers and utilities stand to have both higher profits and higher profit margins when customers adopt net-metered solar energy compared to the non-adoption of solar energy. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Commerce; Costs; Digital storage; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Profitability; Sales; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Day ahead market; Energy generations; Rate of increase; Renewable portfolio standard; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar production; Solar PV systems; Wholesale electricity; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002374785

Based on NREL projections, the United States has more than 32,000 TWh of onshore and 17,000 TWh of offshore potential for wind power generation, which is far beyond its 11,000 TWh of current annual electricity consumption. However, there are a number of efficiency challenges that must be overcome in order to turn this potential into actual production. One area that can potentially improve the energy production of wind turbines is the correction of yaw error. Yaw error (also referred to as yaw angle or yaw misalignment) is the angle between the turbine's rotor and the wind direction. A yaw error reduces turbine's power production at wind speeds below the rated speed. Besides impacting the power producing ability of a turbine, yaw error also affects the reliability of critical subsystems in wind turbines. Variation in yaw error (at any wind speed and not only below the rated speed) affects the loads on the components and the subsequent mechanical stresses. These mechanical stresses change the damage accumulation for components and sub-assemblies, which ultimately affects their reliability. About 17 to 28% of wind project costs attribute to O&M costs, which are directly affected by the reliability. In this study, we investigate the effects of yaw error on the reliability of blades by performing load and stress analysis for various yaw errors. We then use the results of these analyses to adjust the Weibull parameters used for predicting the failure time of blades. Finally, we will use a stochastic cost model to show how correcting the yaw error can avoid maintenance costs in wind farms. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Climate change; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Environmental technology; Errors; Fuel storage; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Stress analysis; Stresses; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Wind; Wind effects; Wind power; Wind turbines; Annual electricity consumption; Damage accumulation; Energy productions; Geopolitical issues; Mechanical stress; Renewable sources; Weibull parameters; Wind turbine blades; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002374653

These generators are widely applied to refrigeration cycle systems; yet when paired with a bi-directional turbine, the resulting sound wave can be harnessed to generate electricity. This paper begins with a discussion of the thermoacoustic application covering relevant issues for the turbine.

However, in order for s-CO2 cycle to reach high efficiency, highly effective recuperators are needed. These recuperative heat exchangers must transfer heat at a rate that is substantially larger than the heat transfer to the cycle itself and can therefore represent up to 24% of the total power block cost in a recompression Brayton cycle [1]. Lower cost regenerators are proposed as a cost saving alternative to high cost printed circuit recuperators. A regenerator is a heat exchanger that alternately has hot and cold fluid passing through it. During the first half of its cycle the hot gas is passed over a storage media bed (stainless steel balls, screens, or similar fill material) where thermal energy is stored. During the next half of the cycle, cold fluid is passed through in the opposite direction, extracting the thermal energy from the bed. By operating a cycle with two (or more) regenerators, where one is always in a hot to cold (HTC) blow and the other in a cold to hot blow (CTH), a quasi-steady state can be achieved in the cycle to allow continuous operation. A model of the regenerator was created and used in place of a recuperator in a model of a 10MW power plant. The thermal effectiveness of the regenerator cycle was slightly lower than the recuperator cycle, however the regenerator cycle had a saving of about 9.3 percent in the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE). A scale model of the regenerator is under construction which will verify the performance of the regenerator model. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Brayton cycle; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Costs; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Printed circuit testing; Printed circuits; Recuperators; Regenerators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Stainless steel; Supercritical fluid extraction; Sustainable development; Thermal energy; Thermoanalysis; Timing circuits; Wind power; Continuous operation; Experimental testing; High-efficiency; Quasi-steady state; Recuperative heat exchangers; Stainless steel balls; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Thermal effectiveness; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002342224

This is both for general competitiveness of solar technology in the energy industry, and also to meet the US DOE Sunshot Initiative Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) cost goals [1]. We present here an investigation on the effects of adding a bottoming steam power cycle to a solar-fossil hybrid CSP plant based on a Small Particle Heat Exchange Receiver (SPHER) driving a gas turbine as the primary cycle. Due to the high operating temperature of the SPHER being considered (over 1000 Celsius), the exhaust air from the primary Brayton cycle still contains a tremendous amount of exergy. This exergy of the gas flow can be captured in a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), to generate superheated steam and run a bottoming Rankine cycle, in a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) system. A wide range of cases were run to explore options for maximizing both power and efficiency from the proposed CSP CCGT plant. Due to the generalized nature of the bottoming cycle modeling, and the varying nature of solar power, special consideration had to be given to the behavior of the heat exchanger and Rankine cycle in off-design scenarios. Variable guide vanes (VGVs), which can control the mass flow rate through the gas turbine system, have been found to be an effective tool in providing operational flexibility to address the variable nature of solar input. The effect VGVs and the operating range associated with them are presented. Strategies for meeting a minimum solar share are also explored. Trends with respect to the change in variable guide vane angle are discussed, as well as the response of the HRSG and bottoming Rankine cycle in response to changes in the gas mass flow rate and temperature. System efficiencies in the range of 50% were found to result from this plant configuration. However, a combustor inlet temperature (CIT) limit lower than a turbine inlet temperature (TIT) limit leads two distinct Modes of operation, with a sharp drop in both plant efficiency and power occurring when the air flow through the receiver exceeded the (CIT) limit, and as a result would have to bypass the combustor entirely and enter the turbine at a significantly lower temperature than nominal. Until that limit is completely eliminated through material or design improvements, this drawback can be addressed through strategic use of the variable guide vanes. Optimal operational strategy is ultimately decided by economics, plant objectives, or other market incentives. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Brayton cycle; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Combustors; Competition; Environmental technology; Exergy; Flow of gases; Fuel storage; Gas turbines; Gases; Geothermal energy; Heat exchangers; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Mass transfer; Rankine cycle; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Steam generators; Sustainable development; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Turbine components; Waste heat; Wind power; Bottoming rankine cycles; Combined cycle gas turbine; Concentrating solar power; Heat recovery steam generators; High operating temperature; Operational flexibility; Operational strategies; Turbine inlet temperature; Combined cycle power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002340241

PHRs can facilitate higher operating temperatures (>700°C), they can allow for inexpensive direct storage, and they can be integrated into cavity receiver designs for high collection efficiency. In operation, PHRs use solid particles that are irradiated and heated directly as they fall through a region exposed to concentrated sunlight. The heated particles can subsequently be stored in insulated bins, with the stored thermal energy reclaimed via heat exchanger to secondary working fluid for the power cycle in CSP. In this field Georgia Tech has over five years' experience developing PHR technology through the support of the DOE SunShot program and similar research efforts. Georgia Tech has dealt with the crucial challenges in particle receiver technology: particulate flow behavior, particulate handling, and particulate heat transfer. In particular, Georgia Tech has specialized in innovative advances in the utilization and design of discrete structures in PHRs (DS-PHR) to prolong particulate residence time in the irradiated zone. This paper describes the development and results of labscale testing for DS-PHRs especially in the Georgia Tech high flux solar simulator (GTHFSS). The GTHFSS is a bank of high intensity xenon lamps with elliptical reflectors designed to replicate a concentrated solar source. Two series of tests have been undertaken: batch and continuous operation. Initially the DS-PHR has been tested in a batch apparatus in which a substantial but still limited quantity of preheated particulate flows through from an elevated bin through the irradiated PHR into a weighing box collecting bin. The use of a weighing box is advantageous since the flow rate of particulate is otherwise especially hard to measure. Temperature rise measurements and mass flow rate measurements allow calculation of energy collection rates. Calorimetry measurements, also described in the paper, are used to verify the incident concentrated radiation allowing the calculation of the collection efficiency. This preliminary series of experiments have been completed using the batch apparatus, with the efficiencies of the lab-scale DS-PHR being determined for a range of temperatures. Efficiencies above 90% have been measured at low temperatures roughly corresponding to the so-called optical efficiency, which is the rate of energy collection at low temperature and minimal heat loss. Batch experiment data indicates a collection efficiency of approximately 81-85% at an average particle operating temperature of 500°C. Lab-scale batch results at 700°C in proved to be unstable, and as such a rework employing a continuous recirculation loop is underway. While the batch apparatus is convenient for preliminary work, it is challenging to reach steady state operation in the mixing and measurement section below the DS-PHR, which limits this apparatus in higher temperature experiments. Consequently, the experiment is being reconfigured for continuous flow, in which the particulate will be heated and recirculated by a high temperature air conveyor. The advantage of the high temperature conveyor has already been proved by its successful integration as a heater and mixer in the hot bin of the batch apparatus. Such a compact device was also quite advantageous in the limited confines of a typical laboratory simulator such as the GTHFSS. While continuous flow prevents the exceedingly desirable use of an uninterrupted mass measurement device, highly accurate mass flow data is still expected based on the use of a perforated plate flow control station. This device relies on the Berverloo effect to maintain a constant flow of particulate through an array of orifices, for which the flow is largely independent of upstream conditions. A weighing box will be used to calibrate and verify the mass flow. This paper will report on efficiency measurements with the batch flow experiments and present the preliminary steps taken to conduct the recirculation experiment. The bulk the research reported in the paper is sponsored by and done in support of the DoE Sun Shot initiative. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Bins; Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Conveyors; Digital storage; Electric lamps; Environmental technology; Flow rate; Fuel storage; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Laboratories; Mass transfer; Perforated plates; Simulators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Weighing; Wind power; Collection efficiency; Concentrated sunlights; Efficiency measurement; High collection efficiency; Laboratory simulators; Mass flow rate measurement; Operating temperature; Steady-state operation; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002340204

Rivers close to urban centers tend to get filled with manmade waste materials, such as plastics and paper, gradually forming floating masses that further trap biological materials and animals. In addition, sewage from residences and industries, as well as rainwater runoff pour into rivers and lakes carrying solid wastes into the water bodies. As a result, the water surfaces get covered with a stagnant, thick layer of synthetic and biological refuse which kill the fish, harm animals and birds, and breed disease-carrying vectors. Such destruction of water bodies is especially common in developing countries which lack the technology or the means to clean up the rivers. A terrible consequence of plastic and synthetic waste being dumped irresponsibly into the oceans is the presence of several large floating masses of garbage in the worlds' oceans, formed by the action of gyres, or circulating ocean currents. In the Pacific Ocean, there are numerous debris fields that have been labeled the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. These patches contain whole plastic litters as well as smaller pieces of plastic, called microplastics, which are tiny fragments that were broken down by the action of waves. These waste products are ingested by animals, birds and fishes, causing death or harm. Some of the waste get washed ashore on beaches along with dead marine life. The best solution for eliminating all of the above waste management problems is by the application of MIPG systems to convert solid waste materials and contaminated water into syngas, organic fuels and raw materials. MIPG is the most efficient form of plasma gasification, which is able to process the most widest range of waste materials, while consuming only about a quarter of the energy released from the feedstock. MIPG systems can be scaled in size, power rating and wastetreatment capacity to match financial needs and waste processing requirements. MIPG systems can be set up in urban locations and on the shores of the waterbody, to filter and remove debris and contaminants and clean the water, while generating electric power to feed into the grid, and fuel or raw materials for industrial use. For eliminating the pelagic debris fields, the proposed design is to have ships fitted with waste collector and filtration systems that feeds the collected waste materials into a MIPG reactor, which converts the carbonaceous materials into syngas (H2 + CO). Some of the syngas made will be used to produce the electric power needed for running the plasma generator and onboard systems, while the remainder can be converted into methanol and other useful products through the Fischer-Tropsch process. This paper qualitatively describes the implementation schemes for the above processes, wherein MIPG technology will be used to clean up major waste problems affecting the earth's water bodies and to convert the waste into energy and raw materials in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner, while reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Animals; Biofuels; Biological materials; Birds; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Coal liquefaction; Debris; Developing countries; Earth atmosphere; Electric power generation; Environmental technology; Filtration; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fish; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Gasification; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Lakes; Ocean currents; Oceanography; Rivers; Sewage; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solid wastes; Sustainable development; Synthesis gas; Thermoanalysis; Waste management; Water pollution; Water resources; Wind power; Carbonaceous materials; Contaminated water; Filtration systems; Fischer-Tropsch process; Implementation scheme; Management problems; Microwave-induced plasmas; Plasma gasification; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002339007

[Robinson, et al. 2013b]. A heat pipe augmented sky radiator system was simulated by a thermal network with nine nodes, representing a thin polyethylene cover, white (ZnO) painted radiator plate [Duffie &amp; Beckman 2013], condenser and evaporator ends of the heat pipe, thermal storage fluid (water), tank wall, room, sky and ambient air. Heat transfer between nodes included solar flux and sky radiation to cover and plate, wind convection and radiation from cover to ambient, radiation from plate to ambient, natural convection and radiation from plate to cover, conduction from plate to condenser or, twophase heat transfer from evaporator to condenser, natural convection from evaporator to water and from water to tank wall, natural convection and radiation from tank wall to room, and overall heat loss from room to ambient. Nodal temperatures were simultaneously solved as functions of time using Typical Meteorological Year (TMY3) weather data. Auxiliary cooling was applied as needed to limit room temperature to a maximum of 23.9°C. For this initial investigation, a moderate climate (Louisville, KY) was used to evaluate the effects of radiator orientation, thermal storage capacity and cooling load to radiator area ratio, LRR. Louisville and two challenging climates (Miami, FL and New Orleans, LA) were then used to evaluate five cover configurations - zero, one and two covers with unconstrained temperature, and zero and one cover with temperature limited to the dew point of ambient air to simulate condensation on the cover. Results were compared to a Louisville baseline with LRR = 10 W/m2K, horizontal radiator and one cover with constrained temperature, which provided an annual sky fraction (fraction of cooling load provided by sky radiation) of 0.861. A decrease to 0.857 was found for an increase in radiator slope to 20°, and a drop to 0.833 for 53° slope (latitude + 15°, a typical slope for solar heating). These drops were associated with increases in average radiator temperature by 0.2°C for 20° and 1.5°C for 53°. A 25% decrease in storage capacity caused a decrease in sky fraction to 0.854. Sky fractions were 0.727 and 0.963 for LRR of 20 and 5, respectively. Sky fractions for the baseline system in Miami and New Orleans were 0.505 and 0.603, respectively. In all three climates, performance was little affected by constraining the cover temperature and by adding a second cover. These results confirm the potential for passive cooling of buildings by radiation to the sky. Climate, LRR and thermal storage capacity had strong effects on performance, while the cover configuration did not. Radiator slope had a surprisingly small impact, considering that the view factor to the sky at 53° tilt is less than 0.5. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Air; Air conditioning; Atmospheric radiation; Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Cooling systems; Digital storage; Drops; Environmental technology; Evaporators; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Heat pipes; Heat storage; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Natural convection; Radiation; Radiators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Tanks (containers); Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Walls (structural partitions); Wind power; Baseline systems; Cooling potential; Design parameters; Radiator temperature; Storage capacity; Temperature limiteds; Two-phase heat transfer; Typical meteorological year; Heat transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002335973

Rooftop and small-scale photovoltaic (PV) technology is a quickly growing sector of the distributed generation market. The array size chosen for a PV installation is one of the main factors affecting its ability to meet a building's electrical needs and reduce its operational emissions. The rooftop area available for placement of PV can be a constraint on the optimization of PV array size. If the optimal array area for a specific building is larger than the area available on the rooftop, optimization using demand-matching methods is not necessary. A new parameter EUI-R has been introduced to describe the building's annual electrical demand with respect to the building rooftop area. It is a decision-making tool presented to help a system designer choose whether to employ an optimization method or not in selecting a PV system. The EUI-R depends on 2 general parameters, building electric demand and building rooftop area, that should be easily accessible for any system designer. This paper presents an extended study of EUI-R applied to 10 commercial building types in 3 different climate zones throughout the U.S. These cities are characterized by different latitudes and varying amounts of available solar radiation. The results show a linear dependency between optimal PV size obtained with a simple demand-matching algorithm, and building rooftop area, applicable to any building type. Any distributed energy technology serving a single building should be sized based on the specific conditions unique to the building, including electric demand and physical space available. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Decision making; Electric energy storage; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Systems analysis; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Commercial building; Decision making tool; Distributed energies; Electricity generation; Linear dependency; Matching algorithm; Optimization method; Photovoltaic technology; Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002328228

In this study, fast pyrolysis of camelina (Camelina sativa) meal feedstock was performed in an auger-type reactor. End products of the processing consisted of bio-char and condensed vapor in the form of bio-oil (ranging from liquid to highly viscous tar-like products). The bio-oil produced in the reactor was collected and analyzed to determine the effects of reactor and condenser temperatures on the properties of the bio-oil produced. Five reactor temperatures and two condenser temperatures were investigated in this study. The rheological properties of the biooil samples were analyzed, water content was determined with the Karl Fisher method, energy content was measured with a bomb calorimeter, and acidity was determined using a total acid titration test. The aging characteristics of the bio-oil were also investigated at seven days, fourteen days, and twenty-eight days after the oil was created to determine what effect, if any, time had on the its properties. Preliminary results indicated that products of the camelina meal pyrolysis process were more uniform when compared to that of other feedstocks (e.g. carinata meal, corn stover), yielding more consistent bio-oil characteristics. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Augers; Biofuels; Byproducts; Calorimeters; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Environmental technology; Feedstocks; Fuel storage; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Pyrolysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Aging characteristics; Camelina sativa; Condenser temperature; Industrial by-products; Native prairie grass; Pyrolysis process; Reactor temperatures; Rheological property; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002271190

Simply, a nuclear reactor heats a coolant that powers a turbine to create electricity. The coolant then can either be re-cooled or can be used for process heat applications. By utilizing the heat off the reactor less energy is wasted. A few of the proposed uses of the wasted heat are water desalination, hydrogen production, or pyrolysis. Nuclear power plants most often provide baseload power and are very inflexible. One way to address this is to use nuclear hybrid energy systems. The goal of this research is to create a system that mimics the waste heat from a reactor, demonstrates how to utilize that heat, and shows that when energy demand is low the reactor does not need to reduce power; the energy can be directed elsewhere to create goods. We have developed an Energy Conversion Loop to act as a testbed for experimentation of the aforementioned processes and test the possibility of nuclear hybrid energy systems. The current design consists of a series of heat exchangers that transfer heat between hot air 427 °C (800 oF) and room temperature water. Each loop of the system mimics a type of process that can be tested with a waste heat application. Early models show the system is capable of producing air temperatures near 427 °C (800 °F) and steam temperatures of 154.4 °C (310 °F). These temperatures match needed process heat temperatures for pyrolysis, multi-effect distillation, and multi-stage flash distillation and can be used to simulate other processes for lab scale testing of wasted process heat. Physical testing will be completed in the future to confirm these results. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Coolants; Desalination; Distillation; Electric energy storage; Energy conversion; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactors; Pyrolysis; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Waste heat; Water filtration; Wind power; Hybrid energy system; Multieffect distillation; Multistage flash distillation; Nuclear reactor systems; Physical testing; Steam temperature; Sustainable energy sources; Water desalination; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002263479

In addition to their environmental benefits, RES are especially appropriate for remote areas, where the expansion of existing power grid is impractical and fuel transportation for thermal generators is too expensive. In this regard, our work studies the optimal capacity sizing for a completely green village (CGV), which is an isolated residential microgrid (MG) whose power is entirely generated by RES. In particular, we consider a neighborhood composed of smart homes that contain programmable appliances, whose operations can be interrupted or automatically scheduled in time. Though there are many works in literature that investigate MG optimal capacity sizing, to our knowledge, our work is the first that utilizes the scheduling of programmable appliance to minimize MG investment costs. To establish the effectiveness of our method, we compare an optimal MG capacity sizing algorithm that utilizes appliances' programmability (Opt-P) with an algorithm that places appliances into operation as soon as they are ready without shifting in time or preempting their operation (NoSch-P). Our simulation results show that Opt-P reduces the investment cost by at least 42% compared to NoSch-P, when the ratio between the energy storage investment cost per kWh and the RES' investment cost per kW is greater or equal to 10. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Automation; Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Electricity source; Environmental benefits; Fuel transportations; Investment costs; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Residential microgrid; Thermal generators; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002263379

Consequently, extensive researches are carried out in order to develop several codes capable of providing heliostat field analysis and optimization. Noting that most of the aforementioned heliostat field codes are developed based on the radial-staggered field layout which is arguably the most popular and widely implemented heliostat field configuration in the literature. Nevertheless, a ground-breaking heliostat field layout based on the spiral patterns of phyllotaxis discs is recently proposed. It was argued that the transition between the areas with high and low heliostat field density is not continuous in radial-staggered configuration. In a study by the authors, the spiral and radial-staggered field layouts thermoeconomic analyses are compared and the results points to the superiority of the radial-staggered layout. Nevertheless, it is believed that utilizing two design variables might be only sufficient for small number of mirrors. Therefore, more design variables must be implemented to fully control different areas of the field for larger capacity heliostat fields. In this paper, spiral field zoning is proposed and its impact on the spiral heliostat field layout performance is assessed. By dividing the heliostat field into multiple zones, each zone is designed with a set of design variables (two design variables: a and b). Consequently, the impacts heliostat field zoning might have on the field thermo-economic performance are investigated. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.","Concentrated solar power; Economic analysis; Heliostat field collector; Thermo-economic optimization","Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Zoning; Concentrated solar power; Design variables; Heliostat field; Mathematical formulation; Staggered configuration; Thermo-economic; Thermoeconomic analysis; Thermoeconomic optimization; Economic analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002262325

The experiments investigate the effect of power characteristics (temperature, shade and tilt angle) on solar panel electricity production. Solar cell efficiency is the ratio of the electrical output of a solar cell to the incident energy in the form of sunlight. The energy conversion efficiency of a solar cell is the percentage of the solar energy to which the cell is exposed that is converted into electrical energy. Extreme temperatures can cause a decrease in solar panel's power output and airstream can dissipate the heat and bring the solar panel to its normal operating condition. Solar panel efficiency is undesirably affected by heat and improved with introducing cooler medium. As well as heat, solar panel loses its power when a part of it is shaded by trees or surrounding buildings. Before solar panel systems are designed for homes, usually a detailed shading analysis of the roof is conducted to reveal its patterns of shade and sunlight throughout the year. By the same manner, how solar panels react to the direct and indirect rays from the sun in order to produce electricity is examined through experiments. Voltage, current and power flowing into a resistor are measured when the angle of the solar panel relative to the light source is changed. The tilt angles to the electrical measurements are linked to the differences in electrical generation. Students can perform experimental procedures explained here and gain the conceptual understanding of the Solar Energy better. The investigations require student explanation of the question, method, display of data with the critical response from peers. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Conversion efficiency; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Light sources; Solar cell arrays; Solar cells; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Conceptual understanding; Electrical generation; Electrical measurement; Electricity production; Experimental procedure; Normal operating conditions; Solar cell efficiencies; Surrounding buildings; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002251395

The simulation uses PRO/II® software and is based on data and processes used successfully in a bench scale facility. The unique 200-ton per day plant includes fast pyrolysis utilizing the tail gas reactive process followed by atmospheric separation, hydrodeoxygenation and final product separation, resulting in products similar to traditional fuels, i.e., gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.

Leopoliensis. The PBR was lit by two LED panels, one on each of the long sides of the PBR. The PBR dimensions were nominally 51mm by 273mm with a height of 319mm (273mm liquid depth). Each LED panel was powered at 14.1W (11.2V and 1.26A). Measurements of ambient temperature, ambient relative humidity, water loss from the PBR, relative humidity of the exhaust gas from the PBR, air flow rate through the PBR, air pressure in the plenum, growth medium temperature, and LED panel temperature were made approximately daily. Measurements show that the growth medium (water) temperature was relatively insensitive to the ambient temperature which varied from 22.7C to 33.6C. The medium temperature ranged from 23.9C (beginning of the test) to 40.6C. The medium temperature mirrored the LED panel temperature staying 2-4C below the LED panel temperature after the first day. The elevated LED panel temperature was likely due to the inefficiency of the LED lights and the fact that much of the light passing through the reactor volume was incident on the LED panel on the opposite side of the reactor. The panels are black in color and absorbed a significant portion of the light passing through the reactor volume. The air flow rate through the PBR ranged from 1.33x10-5m3/s to 1.67x10-5m3/s. The parallel between panel temperature and PBR medium temperature indicate that the amount of air moving through the PBR was insufficient to affect the medium temperature significantly. The heat loss from the PBR to the ambient environment was also small likely due to the small area available to heat loss to the environment when the PBR walls with the LED panels are excluded. The LED panels covered nominally 88% of the PBR reactor volume area. The measured data and measurements of light intensity passing through the two short walls of the panel will be used to estimate heat loss parameters of the PBR.

The target for the case study of this paper is the United Arab Emirates, which is a major producer and exporter of petroleum. The main EOR method employed by the UAE's oil companies is the miscible gas flooding method, whereby natural gas or carbon dioxide is injected into the oil reservoirs to boost the oil pressure, reduce the viscosity of the oil and to increase the pumping rates. UAE purchases natural gas for power production and EOR from its neighbor, Qatar, which makes the UAE a net importer of natural gas and a major consumer of energy, while reducing the national income from the oil sales. The UAE is looking at ways to boost its oil production and to reduce the usage of natural gas, including the injection of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and steam generated by concentrated solar power. UAE and the other Arabian Gulf nations have some of the highest per capita rates of production of domestic waste. Landfilling is the prevalent form of waste disposal for industrial, commercial and residential waste.

MIPG is shown to be the most efficient method of gasification available, as it uses much less energy for producing and sustaining the plasma than other techniques, and produces a much cleaner syngas than thermochemical gasification schemes. The syngas can be used for electricity generation or for making fuels and raw materials in the Fischer-Tropsch or similar processes. In this proposal, MIPG will be used to turn MSW, sewage sludge and biomass wastes into syngas. A part of the syngas will be used to produce electricity to power the petroleum extraction processes, while the carbon dioxide formed in this combustion of syngas can be captured and used for EOR in deep oil wells, which also functions as a form of sequestration of carbon. In addition, syngas can be turned into methane and synthetic natural gas using the Fischer-Tropsch or Sabatier process and then pumped into the oil wells. Some of the petroleum extracted can also be gasified using the MIPG method for the production of synthetic natural gas. Thus, the dependence on natural gas imports will be eliminated, while also achieving zero landfill targets. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Gases; Gasification; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen storage; Incineration; Industrial waste disposal; Intelligent buildings; Land fill; Municipal solid waste; Natural gas; Natural gas wells; Nitrogen; Oil well flooding; Oil wells; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Reservoirs (water); Sewage sludge; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Synthesis gas; Thermoanalysis; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Waste management; Well stimulation; Wind power; Concentrated solar power; Electricity generation; Enhanced oil recovery; Environmental reasons; Microwave-induced plasmas; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Sustainable waste management; Waste-to-energy power plants; Enhanced recovery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002198121

The SPHER is to be used with a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) system where a heliostat field highly concentrates solar radiation on the optical aperture of the SPHER. The solar radiation is volumetrically absorbed by a unique carbon nanoparticle gas mixture within the cavity of the SPHER. This research focuses on comparing a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model using the ANSYS FLUENT Discrete Ordinates (DO) Model and a program developed by the C&SEL which uses a Monte Carlo Ray Trace (MCRT) method to calculate the spatial and directional distribution of radiation for an idealized solar receiver geometry. Previous research at the C&SEL has shown successful implementation of the MCRT method to calculate the spatial and directional distribution of radiation for an idealized solar receiver geometry. The MCRT method is highly accurate and will serve as the benchmark solution for this research. However the MCRT code takes several days to run, is inflexible to geometry changes, and is cumbersome to implement as the MCRT code needs to be rewritten for each new receiver geometry being considered. These factors necessitate the need to find an alternate method that accurately calculates the spatial and directional distribution of radiation for a solar receiver and can be efficiently implemented for various receiver geometries being studied. The Discrete Ordinates method is a new method for solving the Radiative Transport Equations (RTE) using a FORTRAN program, developed by the C&SEL, and the ANSYS FLUENT Discrete Ordinates model for calculating the RTE. The FORTRAN program calculates the proper inlet radiation boundary conditions that ANSYS FLUENT uses for calculating the RTE. The methodology used for determining the correct CFD mesh, radiative boundary conditions, optimal number of DO theta and phi discretization, as well as the optical properties of the working fluid will be presented in this paper. The main focus of this research is to compare two different methods for solving the Radiative Transport Equations within the idealized SPHER. The solution data for several cases using the previous coupled MCRT method and the ANSYS FLUENT Discrete Ordinates method is presented for both a collimated and diffuse gray radiation approximation. The case studies focus on researching how the MCRT method and Discrete Ordinates method differ when comparing critical receiver parameters such as the mean outlet temperature, wall temperature profile, outlet tube temperature profile, and total receiver efficiency while keeping the total inlet radiation flux of 5 MW and inlet mass flow rate of 5 kg/s constant. This research also presents a study on the optimal Discrete Ordinates angular discretization, as well as a study to determine the solution's dependence on the number of inlet boundary conditions imposed on the window. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Boundary conditions; C (programming language); Carbon; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Computational fluid dynamics; Computational geometry; Digital storage; Environmental technology; Fluids; FORTRAN (programming language); Fuel storage; Gas turbines; Geometry; Geothermal energy; Heat transfer; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Optical properties; Radiation; Solar energy; Solar equipment; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Spatial distribution; Sustainable development; Temperature; Temperature control; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Concentrated solar power; Concentrated solar radiation; Directional distributions; Discrete ordinates method; Radiation boundary condition; Radiative boundary conditions; Radiative transport equation; Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002196328

TUSK systems use an axial-flow turbine and generator mounted on a rigid, underwater winged kite that is tethered to a floating surface buoy to extract power from an ocean current. The tethered underwater kite is controlled to travel in cross-current motions at a high velocity which is at least four to five times larger than the ocean current velocity. This higher velocity significantly increases the potential power output compared to conventional fixed marine turbines. Modeling and simulation of the kitetether dynamics in a TUSK system is studied by developing and solving governing equations of motion derived from Euler-Lagrange equations. Models for physical effects appropriate to TUSK systems are developed, including for turbine power and turbine drag, kite wing hydrodynamic forces, and the effect of turbine blade tip cavitation on turbine power output. A baseline simulation that includes these modeled effects and a simple kite control scheme is studied to estimate cross-current kite trajectories, turbine power output, kite hydrodynamic forces, kite pitch, roll and yaw dynamics, and tether tensions. Once the baseline simulation case has been fully explored, a parametric study is conducted that varies key design and flow parameters including ocean current speed, kite weight and wing area, turbine rotor area, tether length, and kite control system parameters. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Axial flow turbomachinery; Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Environmental technology; Equations of motion; Fluid dynamics; Fuel storage; Hydrodynamics; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Ocean currents; Oceanography; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Tetherlines; Thermoanalysis; Thermoelectric power; Turbine components; Turbines; Turbomachine blades; Wind power; Axial flow turbines; Current velocity; Energy technologies; Euler-Lagrange equations; Governing equations of motion; Hydrodynamic forces; Model and simulation; Turbine blade tip; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002196312

Now all kinds of alternative energy technology are developing rapidly to solve such problem in China. Electricity produced by non-fossil fuel energy is continued to increase sharply in China. But it's hard for regular alternative energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydroelectricity power, nuclear power and so on, to easily provide process heat for industry, especially high temperature steam. High temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR, sometimes also called HTR) is a kind of nuclear reactor, which are demonstrated very high efficiencies, safety and availability features by American and German power plant. HTR differs from water nuclear reactors by offering a high thermal efficiency for electricity generation and a high level of passive safety features. Now HTR-PM project is built in Shidao Bay of China. Moreover, HTR is the only nuclear reactor, which can provide high temperature steam comparing with other water nuclear reactors. So HTR can provide a versatile cogeneration solution for industry. In this paper, a case was studied, how to provide heat for a refinery and petro-chemical plant with HTR. Firstly, the energy need of a typical large chemical plant in China was investigated. Steam supply diagram of an oil refinery plant, which produced 10 million tons oil products and 1 million tons ethylene in China, was calculated. Secondly, technical feasibility of energy providing by HTR cogeneration plant was discussed. Extraction steam from HTR system was designed for the chemical plant. It would meet the requirement of steam supply for chemical plant and would replace the captive power plant, where coal was burning. The balance of steam, enthalpy and temperature was calculated. At last, economic evaluation for such cogeneration plants was carried out. The steam supply cost from captive coal power plant and HTR cogeneration plant was compared. Some economical conclusion was made from the discussion. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Carbon; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Chemical plants; Chemicals; Cogeneration plants; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Environmental technology; Ethylene; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Gas cooled reactors; High temperature gas reactors; High temperature reactors; Hydrogen storage; Industrial economics; Intelligent buildings; Nuclear reactors; Pebble bed modular reactors; Refining; Safety engineering; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Steam; Steam power plants; Sustainable development; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Air pollution in chinas; Alternative energy technologies; Captive power plants; Economic evaluations; Economic feasibilities; Electricity generation; Oil refinery plants; Passive safety features; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002188809

A high-efficiency, high-temperature solar receiver design based on arrays of cavities needs a highlyspecular reflective surface on its front section to help sunlight penetrate into the absorber tubes for effective flux spreading. Since this application is for high-temperature solar receivers, this surface needs to be durable and to maintain its optical properties through the usable life. Degradation mechanisms associated with elevated temperatures and thermal cycling, which include cracking, delamination, corrosion/oxidation, and environmental effects, could cause the optical properties of surfaces to degrade rapidly in these conditions. Protected mirror surfaces for these applications have been tested by depositing a thin layer of SiO2 on top of electrodeposited silver by means of the sol-gel method. To obtain an effective thin film structure, this sol-gel procedure has been investigated extensively by varying process parameters that affect film porosity and thickness.

In such a system, particulates are released into the PHR, and are heated to high temperature by concentrated solar radiation from the associated heliostat field. After being heated, the particles will then typically flow into the hot bin of the TES. Particulates accumulated in the hot bin can flow through a heat exchanger to energize a power generation system or be held in the hot TES storage bin for later use such as meeting a late afternoon peak demand or even overnight generation. Particles leaving the heat exchanger are held in the low temperature bin of the TES. A critical component in such a PHR system is the particle lift system, which must transport the particulate from the lower temperature TES bin back to the PHR. In our baseline 60 MW-thermal (MW-th) design, the particulate must be lifted around 70 m at the rate of 128 kg/s. For the eventual commercial scale system of a 460 MW-th design the particulate must be lifted around 138 m at the rate of 978 kg/s. The obvious demands on this subsystem require the selection and specification of a highly efficient, economical, and reliable lift design. After an apparently exhaustive search of feasible alternatives, the skip hoist was selected as the most suitable general design concept. While other designs have not been dismissed, our currently preferred somewhat more specific preliminary design employs a Kimberly Skip (KS) in a twoskip counterbalanced configuration. This design appears to be feasible to fabricate and integrate with existing technology at an acceptably low cost per MW-th and to promise high overall energy use efficiency, long service life, and low maintenance cost. A cost and performance model has been developed to allow optimization of our design and the results of that study are also presented.

Many conventional flywheel energy storage system design approaches use active magnetic bearings with backup bearing technologies to meet the need for high speed operation in a low ambient pressure environment. Low ambient pressures are needed to overcome the power loss limitations associated with windage at high surface speeds. However, bearing technologies that rely on active control tend to be large, are dynamically soft which necessitates backup bearings and require a power supply which consumes some of the stored power to maintain rotor levitation In this paper the authors will demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally the ability of advanced 5th generation compliant foil bearings to support large flywheel rotors weighing in excess of 900 N and which can operate to speeds in excess of 40,000 rpm. Testing conducted at pressures as low as 7 kPa demonstrates the ability of foil bearings to operate in low ambient pressures consistent with flywheel energy storage system needs for low windage loss.

In response to increase in electricity demand, natural gas ""peaker plants"" are being added to the grid, and the need for spinning and nonspinning reserves have increased. Many natural gas, and other heat source based, power plants exist as combined heat and power (CHP), or cogeneration, plants. When built for industrial use, these plants are sized and run based on heat needs of an industrial facility, and are not optimized for the value of electricity generated. With the inclusion of new, less expensive thermal energy storage (TES) systems, the heating and electricity usage can be separated and the system can be optimized separately. The use of thermal energy storage with CHP improves system economics by improving efficiency, reducing upfront capital expenditures, and reducing system wear. This paper examines the addition of thermal energy storage to industrial natural gas combined heat and power (CHP) plants. Here a case study is presented for a recycled paper mill near Los Angeles, CA. By implementing thermal energy storage, the mill could decouple electric and heat production. The mill could take advantage of time-of-day pricing while producing the constant heat required for paper processing. This paper focuses on plant economics in 2012 and 2015, and suggests that topping cycle industrial CHP plants could benefit from the addition of high temperature (400-550°C) energy storage. Even without accounting for the California incentives associated with implementing advanced energy storage technologies and distributed generation, the addition of energy storage to CHP plants can drastically reduce the payback period below the 25 year expected economic lifetime of a plant. Thus thermal energy storage can make more CHP plants economically viable to build. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Cogeneration plants; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power utilization; Energy storage; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Gas plants; Heat storage; High temperature applications; Hydrogen storage; Industrial economics; Industrial plants; Intelligent buildings; Investments; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Proven reserves; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermal energy; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Capital expenditures; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power applications; Energy storage technologies; High temperature thermal energy storages; Improving efficiency; Industrial facilities; Variable generations; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002168823

It is one of the most important part of a heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration systems (HVAC), because a DCS is composed of: Cooling towers, central chiller plant, water distribution systems and clusters of consumer buildings. This research is focused on the central chiller plant, due to it accounts for a substantial portion of the total energy consume of DCS and HVAC systems. The performance of central chiller plant is often affected by multiple faults which could be caused during installation or developed in routine operation. These non-optimal conditions and faults may cause 20-30% waste of energy consumption of HVAC&amp;R systems. Automated fault detection and diagnosis (AFDD) tools have potential to detect an incipient fault and help to reduce undesirable conditions and energy consumption, and optimize the facility maintenance. We propose an online data driven fault detection strategy for district cooling system. The main objective is to develop an automated fault detection tool based on historical process data, which can be applied in transient operation. The proposed hybrid strategy is based on unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, and multivariate statistic techniques. Its aim is to identify the operating states of the chiller and evaluate the fault occurrence depending of its current operating state. This strategy uses the K-means clustering method, Naive Bayes classifier and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The developed strategy was evaluated using the performance data of a 90-ton water-cooled centrifugal chiller (ASHRAE RP-1043) and also evaluated using a dynamic model of a chiller (Simscape™.) under similar conditions.

A linear empirical equation between daily CI change and the daily average PM10, WS, RH was developed using Microsoft Excel®. However, the model was not extensively evaluated due to the small data set available then. In this study, a larger data set was used to fit the linear model for daily CI change and daily average values of PM10, WS, and RH. In addition, a semi-physical model was developed to take into account the non-linear mechanics of turbulent deposition, resuspension of deposited dust, and the effect of relative humidity on resuspension. The regression and solver functions of Microsoft Excel® was employed to fit the data. The R-squared values of the linear model and the semiphysical model are 0.0949 and 0.1774, respectively. The semiphysical model predicts the daily ΔCI slight more accurately than the linear model. However, for prediction of cumulative ΔCI over longer periods of time, the two models perform roughly the same. Overall, both models are able to predict the two-month ΔCI with an uncertainty of less than 16%. The results from this study suggest that it is possible to use mathematical models to calculate PV power output degradation in the Doha, Qatar area.

On the other hand increasing share of renewable sources imposes additional stability risks on the power grid. Increased share of solar energy in power generation during noon along with increased power demand during afternoon peak hours generates a significant risk on the stability of power grid. Energy Storage systems are required to enable the renewable energy sources to continuously generate energy for the power grid and enhance the stability of future grid that benefits from more renewable sources. Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is one of the most promising forms of energy storage. Although round trip efficiency is relatively high in thermal storage systems, heat transfer is a well-known problem of most TES systems that use solid state or phase change. Insufficient heat transfer may significantly impact the performance of the TES system. The TES system of this study utilizes molten sulfur as the storage medium. Although thermal conductivity of molten sulfur is relatively low, the sulfurbased TES system benefits from enhanced heat transfer due to the presence of buoyancy-driven flows. In this study, the effect of natural convection on the heat transfer characteristics of a sulfur-based isochoric TES system is studied computationally and theoretically. It turns out that the viscosity of sulfur in the temperature range of this study (250-400 °C) varies by two orders of magnitude. A computational model was developed to investigate the effect of viscosity variations on the buoyancy-driven flow and corresponding charge and discharge times. The computational model is developed using an unsteady Finite Volume Method by a commercially available CFD package. The results of this study show that the heat transfer process in the isochoric TES element is highly impacted by natural convection. The viscous flow of molten sulfur near the boundaries of the isochoric TES element leads to different charge and discharge times. The discharge time is almost two times longer than the charge time due to formation of a viscous layer of elemental sulfur near the heat transfer surface. The viscous layer of sulfur decreases the activity of the buoyancy-driven flow and decreases the heat transfer rate during discharge cycle. The computational model was validated by comparing the results of a representative case with experimental data. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Buoyancy; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Computation theory; Computational fluid dynamics; Computational methods; Digital storage; Electric power system stability; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Environmental technology; Finite volume method; Fuel storage; Heat convection; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Natural convection; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sulfur; Sustainable development; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Thermoanalysis; Viscosity; Wind power; Energy storage systems; Enhanced heat transfer; Heat transfer characteristics; Heat transfer process; Heat transfer surfaces; Renewable energy source; Thermal energy storage systems; Thermal storage system; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002156946

Concentrated solar power (CSP) towers exhibit promising qualities, as temperatures greater than 1000°C are possible. The heat transfer fluid implemented to capture the sun's energy significantly impacts the overall performance of a CSP system. Current fluids, such as molten nitrate salts and steam, have limitations; molten salts are limited by their small operational temperature range while steam requires high pressures and is unable to act as an effective storage medium. As a result, a new heat transfer fluid composed of ceramic particles is being investigated, as ceramic particles demonstrate no practical limit on operation temperature and have the ability to act as a storage medium. This study sought to further investigate the use of dense granular flows as a new heat transfer fluid. Previous work validated the use of such flows as a heat transfer fluid; the present work examined the effect of flow rate, as well as the particle size and type on the heat transfer to the particle fluid. Three different types of particles were tested, along with two different diameter particles. Of the three materials tested, the particle type did not appear to effect the heat transfer. Particle diameter, however, did effect the heat transfer, as a smaller diameter particle yielded slightly higher heat transfer to the fluid. Flow rates ranging from 30 to 200 kg/m2-s were tested. Initially, the heat transfer to the flow, characterized by the convective heat transfer coefficient, decreased with increasing flow rate. However, at approximately 80 kg/m2-s, the heat transfer coefficient began to increase with increasing flow rate.

Traditional single sourced energy or power systems require the amount of energy creation and the production of usable power to be carefully balanced. With the introduction of multiple energy sources, loads, and energy capacitors, the design, simulation, and operation of such hybrid systems requires a new approach to analysis and control. This paper introduces three examples of ""Hybrid Nuclear Energy Systems"", for large scale power, industrial heat, and electricity generation. The system component independence, reliability, availability, and dynamic control aspects, coupled with component operational decisions presents a new way to optimize energy production and availability. Additional novel hybrid hydro-nuclear systems, concentrated solar-nuclear power desalination systems, and nuclear-insitu petroleum extraction systems are compared. The design aspects of such hybrid systems suitable for process heat, electricity generation, and/or desalination applications are discussed. After a multiple-year research study of past hybrid reactor designs and recent system proposals, the following design evaluation approach is the result of analysis of the best concepts discovered. This review of existing literature has summerized that postulated benefits of Hybrid Nuclear Sytems are; reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased energy conversion efficiency, high reliability of electricity supply and consistent power quality, reduced fossil fuel dependence, less fresh water consumption, conversion of local coal or shale into higher value fuels, while lowering the risks and costs. As these proposed hybrid systems are interdisciplinary in nature, they will require a new multidisciplinary approach to systems evaluation. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.","Hybrid reactor design evaluation methodology intrinsic safety simple systems energy capacitor","Availability; Biofuels; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Conversion efficiency; Desalination; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy conversion; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Nuclear energy; Power quality; Renewable energy resources; Small nuclear reactors; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Structural design; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Atmospheric concentration; Electricity generation; Fresh water consumption; Intrinsic safety; Multi-disciplinary approach; Multiple applications; Nuclear energy systems; Small modular reactors; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002145893

These peak loads expose the reliability of the electrical grid and customers may incur in additional charges for peak load management in regulated demand-response markets. This opens the need for the development of analytical tools that can inform building managers and utilities about near future conditions so they are better able to avoid peak demand charges, reducing building operational costs. In this article, we report on a tool and methodology to forecast peak loads at the City Scale using New York City (NYC) as a test case. The city of New York experiences peak electric demand loads that reach up to 11 GW during the summertime, and are projected to increase to over 12 GW by 2025, as reported by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). The forecast is based on the Weather Research and Forecast model version 3.5, coupled with a building environment parameterization and building energy model. Urban morphology parameters are assimilated from the New York Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO), while the weather component of the model is initialized daily from the North American Mesoscale (NAM) model. A city-scale analysis is centered in the summer months of June-July 2015 which included an extreme heat event (i.e. heat wave). The 24-hr city-scale weather and energy forecasts show good agreement with the archived data from both weather stations records and energy records by NYISO. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Buildings; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Digital storage; Electric utilities; Environmental technology; Forecasting; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Land use; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Taxation; Thermoanalysis; Urban planning; Wind power; Building energy demands; Building energy model; Building environment; Building managers; Independent system operators; Peak electric demands; Urban morphology; Weather Research and Forecast models; Weather forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002142066

Leopoliensis in 3.36 litters of Scully's growth media. The PBR width was 51mm with a 273mm length and a growth media depth of 271mm. One of the PBR unique features was that it used a plenum and a porous membrane to inject air enriched with carbon dioxide into the growth medium. The HDPE (high-density polyethylene sintered beads) porous membrane served as the barrier between the reactor volume and the mixing plenum of the PBR. The air bubbled up through the porous membrane into the reactor volume with the growth medium mixing the contents of the reactor volume and transfer oxygen and carbon dioxide between the growth media and the bubbles. The second unique feature of the PBR is that it incorporated light guides in the design. The light guides were acrylic rods 9.5mm in diameter and a length projecting into the reactor volume of 38.1mm. The guides did not touch the opposite PBR wall. The light guides were abraded with sand paper on the outer to enhance light transfer from the guide to the growth medium. There were eight rows of light guides on each of the two PBR walls that were 273mm in length. Each row consisted of eight light guides space 34.1mm apart and 17.1mm from the side (short) walls of the PBR. Light was provided by two LED panels with 384 LED lights on each panel. The light from the panels had a wavelength of 650nm. The Light guides protruded through the PBR wall and light from the LED panels entered the light guide ends or transferred through the wall directly into the PBR reactor volume. The light guide ends occupied approximately 16% of the PBR wall area lit by the LED panels. The PBR produced 7.1g per litter of algal biomass in a 14 day growth cycle which encompassed a 3 day lag phase. The light guides disrupted the bubble flow pattern not allowing an obvious riser and/or downcomer to develop in the reactor volume. The disrupted flow pattern enhanced mixing and gas transfer. The enhanced mixing rotated the algal cells from more to less areas of the reactor volume more often aiding photosynthesis in a manner similar to flashing lights. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.","Algae; Gas transfer; Light; Light guide; Mixing; Photobioreactor; Porous membrane","Algae; Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Environmental technology; Flow patterns; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; High density polyethylenes; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Light; Membranes; Mixing; Optical fibers; Pebble bed reactors; Photobioreactors; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Walls (structural partitions); Wind power; Enhanced mixing; Flashing lights; Gas transfer; Light guides; Photobiore-actor; Porous membranes; Through the wall; Unique features; Light emitting diodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002141991

These activities negatively contribute to Earth's greenhouse gases including water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ozone (O3). Approximately 82% of greenhouse gases are developed from the United States, Asia, and Europe alone. Food and their extraction processes, including transportation of those extracts, account for about 35% of those greenhouse gases. This includes wasted, rotten, and uneaten food. About 40% of food in the United States today goes uneaten, resulting in more than 20 pounds of food per person every month. Not only does this mean that Americans are throwing out upwards of $165 billion each year, amounting to $1,350 to more than $2,275 annually in waste per family of four, but also 25 percent of all freshwater and huge amounts of unnecessary chemicals, energy, and land. Moreover, almost all of that uneaten food ends up rotting in landfills. This number has increased, in regards to organic matter, from approximately 16 percent of U.S. methane emissions in 2010 upwards to 25 percent in 2012. With the increase in supply and demand of food, in addition to the lower consumer cost, the statistics of wasted feedstocks are rapidly increasing. The purpose of this research is to utilize wasted food to extract natural hydrocarbon oils through thermal depolymerization in order to develop an alternative fuel. Thermal depolymerization is a hydrous pyrolysis process that breaks down long chained polymers into simpler compounds and light hydrocarbons, much of which can be separated and used for fuel. Polymers include essentially all organic matter i.e. matter made of living or onceliving things, which include petroleum products like plastic, styro-foam, and nylon, as well as plant and animal material, and manure. Potatoes and corn starch were used as feedstocks for this research and thermal depolymerization was conducted on the feedstocks for analysis and fuel collection. With optimum use and a mature thermal depolymerization technology, the Earth might comfortably support 10 times its current population at a high standard of living. There is enough biomass existing now accessible on the surface of the earth to provide 100 years of human energy use. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Alternative fuels; Atmospheric aerosols; Biofuels; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Economics; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Feedstocks; Fertilizers; Fossil fuels; Fuel oils; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Nylon polymers; Oils and fats; Organic compounds; Organic polymers; Plastic products; Polymers; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Wind power; Atmospheric concentration; Extraction process; Hydrous pyrolysis; Land surface properties; Light hydrocarbon; Natural hydrocarbons; Supply and demand; Thermal depolymerization; Depolymerization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002141939

The intent of the tests was to investigate the impact of particle mass flow rate, irradiance, and particle temperature on the particle temperature rise and thermal efficiency of the receiver for each design. Results indicate that the obstructed flow design increased the residence time of the particles in the concentrated flux, thereby increasing the particle temperature and thermal efficiency for a given mass flow rate. The obstructions, a staggered array of chevronshaped mesh structures, also provided more stability to the falling particles, which were prone to instabilities caused by convective currents in the free-fall design. Challenges encountered during the tests included non-uniform mass flow rates, wind impacts, and oxidation/deterioration of the mesh structures.

These solid particles are stable at temperatures far greater than that of molten salts, allowing the use of efficient high-temperature turbines in the power cycle. Furthermore, many of the solid particles under development store heat via reversible chemical reactions (thermochemical energy storage, TCES) in addition to the heat they store as sensible energy. The heat-storing reaction is often the thermal reduction of a metal oxide. If coupled to an Air-Brayton system, wherein air is used as the turbine working fluid, the subsequent extraction of both reaction and sensible heat, as well as the transfer of heat to the working fluid, can be accomplished in a direct-contact, counter-flow reoxidation reactor. However, there are several design challenges unique to such a reactor, such as maintaining requisite residence times for reactions to occur, particle conveying and mitigation of entrainment, and the balance of kinetics and heat transfer rates to achieve reactor outlet temperatures in excess of 1200 °C.

Over the past few years, a number of reports have been emerged stating that the buildings sectors are responsible for approximately 31% of global final energy demand. Buildings account for 35% of total final energy consumption in India and building energy consumption is growing about 8% per years. Final energy demand in Indian building sector will grow up- to five times by the end of this century, driven by rapid income and population growth. Hospitals are institutions for the care of people with health problems and are usually functional 24hrs a day, all year around, which demands a lot of energy. Health sector is one of the largest and fastest growing sectors in India. By 2020, it is expected to become a $ 280 billion industry. In India hospitals contribute 2-3% of total energy consumption and the hospital building growth rate 12-15% in last decade. The World Health Organization estimated that India need 80,000 additional hospital beds every year to meet the demands of India's population.

There are two approached to use solar energy for generating electricity, i.e., using solar energy to directly to make work or integrating solar energy into fossil-fueled plant. The solar-aided coal-fired power generation (SACPG) mechanism is proven an effective way to use solar energy efficiently. In this paper, SACPG system and solar-alone parabolic trough CSP plant are modelled respectively. A comparison discussion related to TES system between SACPG system and solar-alone CSP plant is presented. The aim is to find what role of TES system will play in these two different systems. Through analysis, the role TES system plays varies in solar-alone power generation system and SACPG system. For solar-alone power generation system, the main function for TES system lies in storing surplus solar heat. Besides, there exists an optimum loop number with highest annual SEE with a specific TES hour. However, TES system for SACPG system not only stores the surplus solar heat, but also adjusts working condition. With the help of TES system, the working condition could be set as the high-pressure extraction steam could be totally replaced by solar heat. By doing so, annual solar power generation and annual SEE could be improved compared with that without TES system. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Electric energy storage; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar heating; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Coal-fired power generation; Comparison analysis; High-pressure extraction; Parabolic trough; Power generation systems; Renewable energies; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001968711

This work is concerned with the use of a new hybrid cooling and water desalination system driven by solar thermal energy. The system primarily consists of an evacuated tube solar collector, LiBr absorption chiller, and a humidification-dehumidification (HDH) unit. Seawater is used to cool the condenser and absorber of the chiller as well as the condenser of the HDH unit. The heat rejected by the absorber is used to drive the HDH unit. Thermodynamic model of the system has been formulated and simulated using engineering equation solver (EES) software. The results show that the coefficient of performance (COP) of the chiller nearly remain constant with increase in seawater temperature at the absorber inlet. The average COP of the chiller is found to be 0.76. The hybrid system efficiency increases with increase in the seawater temperature mainly due the effect of latent heat of water condensation. The rate of fresh water production increases with increase in the seawater inlet temperature. This resulted in a higher outlet temperature at the absorber exit, leading to a higher energy input to the HDH unit. Gained output ratio (GOR) increases with increase in seawater temperature. This is due to the direct proportionality of the GOR to the amount of fresh water produced. The results also revealed that increasing the flow rate of seawater causes the decrease in the fresh water production due to the corresponding decrease in the temperature of the seawater. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Air conditioning; Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Cooling systems; Desalination; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Humidity control; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Seawater; Seawater effects; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamic properties; Thermodynamics; Water; Water filtration; Wind power; Coefficient of Performance; Desalination systems; Engineering equation solvers; Evacuated tube solar collector; Fresh water production; Humidification-dehumidification; Solar thermal energy; Thermo dynamic analysis; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001967784

To alleviate the worries of the existing and approaching fresh water crisis, the answer for water sustainability may lie in developing the decentralized small-scale water desalination system. Solar humidificationdehumidification (HDH) is a carrier gas based thermal technique that is ideal for a small-scale decentralized water desalination system. An innovative design approach is to use the bubble column humidifier to enhance the performance of the HDH water desalination system. Therefore, a novel multi-stage stepped bubble column humidifier is proposed that is operated through solar thermal energy as the main source of energy input. The study addresses the relation between the pressure drop variations with varying water column height at different air superficial velocities. Findings revealed that the water column height and air superficial velocity should be optimized according to the geometric features of the perforated plate in order to achieve a higher humidifier performance with a lower pressure drop. The day round performance of the humidifier is investigated in single stage, two stage, and three stage configurations. Findings show that the average day round absolute humidity at the exit of the humidifier is increased by 9 % in two-stage and 23 % in three-stage configurations compared to the single stage humidifier. One major advantages of this proposed humidifier is its ability to have a direct solar thermal heating. Subsequently, it can be located in remote areas. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.","Bubble column humidifier; Fresnel lens; HDH systems; Solar thermal energy; Water desalination","Air; Biofuels; Bubble columns; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Desalination; Drops; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Humidity control; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Perforated plates; Pressure drop; Solar energy; Solar heating; Sustainable development; Thermal energy; Thermoanalysis; Water; Water filtration; Wind power; Experimental analysis; Fresnel lens; Humidification-dehumidification; Solar thermal energy; Superficial velocity; Thermal techniques; Water desalination; Water sustainability; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001967781

As such, TES allows CSP plants to continue to provide electricity to the grid even at times when the resource (the sun) is not available, such as cloud transients or at night. Advanced power cycle systems with supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as the working fluid provide high power conversion efficiency because of high temperatures attained, and less compression work and are being explored for integration with concentrating solar power plants. Currently, there is no costeffective way to store energy at high temperatures (>565 degree Celsius). The present work analyzes the thermal performance of a novel, cost-effective thermal storage system based on elemental sulfur as the storage media. The analysis is based on a detailed system-level computational modeling of the complex conjugate heat transfer and fluid flow phenomena at multiple scales to provide a scientific basis for engineering, designing and optimizing the novel thermal storage system for transient operation. The validation of the computational model based on data from experiments and full-scale plant operation is also reported.

Ray tracing using SolTrace was performed to understand the light-trapping effects of the finned receivers. Re-reflections of the fins to other fins on the receiver were captured to give an overall effective solar absorptance. The ray tracing, finite element analysis, and previous computational fluid dynamics showed that the horizontalfinned flat panel produced the most efficient receiver with increased light-trapping and lower overall heat loss. The effective solar absorptance was shown to increase from an intrinsic absorptance of 0.86 to 0.96 with ray trace models. The predicted thermal efficiency was shown in CFD models to be over 95%.

First of all the model was validated, with the information of the operation manual of the steam generator. Once the model was validated, it was achieved the thermal, exergetic and thermoeconomic analysis. As a result it was observed that the best operation load conditions are at 100%, 98.4%, 93.3% and 75.6%. Also some optimal values of air-gas relation, extraction pressure and drum pressure were found.

The modeling framework introduced in this paper would help such policymakers to make the appropriate investment decisions for the power sector. This paper applies an analytical model and an optimization model to investigate the implications of coimplementing an emission cap and a Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) policy for the U.S. Northeast. A simplified analytical model is specified and the first order optimality conditions are derived. The results from the analytical model are verified by running simulations using LP-CEM, a linear programming-based supply cost optimization model. The LP-CEM simulation results are analyzed under the recently proposed Clean Power Plan emissions cap rules and RPS scenarios for the U.S. Northeast region. The marginal abatement cost estimates, derived from a limited set of LP-CEM runs, are analyzed and compared to the theoretical results. For encouraging renewables generation, an RPS instrument is costeffective at higher policy targets, while an emissions cap instrument is cost-effective at lower policy targets. For CO2 emissions reduction, an emissions cap instrument is found be cost-effective for all policy targets. There is a trade-off between emissions levels and supply costs when the two instruments are co-implemented. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Analytical models; Biofuels; Carbon; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Computational electromagnetics; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost estimating; Costs; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Investments; Linear programming; Optimization; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Appropriate investment; First-order optimality condition; Implementation strategies; Marginal abatement costs; Optimization modeling; Policy interaction; Renewable portfolio standard; Running simulations; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001944011

As attitudes, technologies, and sustainability awareness change within the industry, data centers are beginning to realize higher levels of energy efficiency without sacrificing operational security. By exploiting the increased temperature and humidity tolerances of the information technology equipment (ITE), data center mechanical systems can leverage ambient conditions to operate in economization mode for increased times during the year. Economization provides one of the largest methodologies for data centers to reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint. As outside air temperatures and conditions become more favorable for cooling the data center, mechanical cooling through vapor-compression cycles is reduced or entirely eliminated. One favorable method for utilizing low outside air temperatures without sacrificing indoor air quality is through deploying rotary heat wheels to transfer heat between the data center return air and outside air without introducing outside air into the white space. A metal corrugated wheel is rotated through two opposing airstreams with varying thermal gradients to provide a net cooling effect at significantly reduced electrical energy over traditional mechanical cooling topologies. To further extend the impacts of economization, data centers are also able to significantly raise operating temperatures beyond what is traditionally found in comfort cooling applications. The increase in the dry bulb temperature provided to the inlet of the information technology equipment, as well as an elevated temperature rise across the equipment significantly reduces the energy use within a data center. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Biofuels; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Cooling; Cooling systems; Corrugated metal; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Equipment; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen storage; Indoor air pollution; Intelligent buildings; Mechanics; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Wheels; Wind power; Cooling applications; Dry bulb temperature; Increased temperature; Information technology equipments; Operating environment; Operating temperature; Outside-air temperature; Vapor compression cycle; Data reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001915794

This cost is still well below energy generation costs. However, as the lowest cost energy efficiency measures are adopted, the cost effectiveness of further investment declines. Thus, there is a need to develop large-scale and relatively inexpensive energy auditing techniques to more efficiently find opportunities for savings. Currently, on-site building energy audits process are expensive, in the range of US$0.12/sf - $0.53/sf, and there is an insufficient number of professionals to perform the audits. Here we present research that addresses at community-wide scales the characterization of building envelope thermal characteristics via drive-by and fly-over GPS linked thermal imaging. A central question drives this research: Can single point-in-time thermal images be used to infer R-values and thermal capacitances of walls and roofs? Previous efforts to use thermal images to estimate R-values have been limited to stable exterior weather conditions. The approach posed here is based upon the development of a dynamic model of a building envelope component with unknown R-value and thermal capacitance. The weather conditions prior to the thermal image are used as inputs to the model. The model is solved to determine the exterior surface temperature, ultimately predicted the temperature at the thermal measurement time. The model R-value and thermal capacitance are tuned to force the error between the predicted surface temperature and the measured surface temperature from thermal imaging to be near zero. The results show that this methodology is capable of accurately estimating envelope thermal characteristics over a realistic spectrum of envelope Rvalues and thermal capacitance present in buildings nationally. With an assumed thermal image accuracy, thermal characteristics are predicted with a maximum error of respectively 20% and 14% for high and low R-values when the standard deviation of outside temperature over the previous 48 hours is as much as 5°C. Experimental validation on a test facility with variable surface materials was attempted under variable weather conditions, e.g., where the outdoor air temperature experiences varying fluctuations prior to imaging. The experimental validation realized errors less than 20% in predicting the R-value even when the standard deviation of outdoor temperature over the 48 hours prior to a measurement was approximately 5°C. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Biofuels; Buildings; Capacitance; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Energy conservation; Environmental technology; Errors; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen storage; Infrared imaging; Intelligent buildings; Investments; Meteorology; Solar buildings; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Statistics; Surface properties; Sustainable development; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Energy efficiency programs; Experimental validations; Outdoor temperature; Outdoor-air temperature; Surface temperatures; Thermal capacitance; Thermal characteristics; Thermal measurements; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001907649

The tubes absorb the heat incident on the surface and transfer it to the fluid contained inside them. To increase the solar absorptance, high temperature black paint or a solar selective coating is applied to the surface of the tubes. However, current solar selective coatings degrade over the lifetime of the receiver and must be reapplied, which reduces the receiver thermal efficiency and increases the maintenance costs. This work presents an evaluation of several novel receiver shapes which have been denominated as fractal like geometries (FLGs). The FLGs are geometries that create a light-trapping effect, thus, increasing the effective solar absorptance and potentially increasing the thermal efficiency of the receiver. Five FLG prototypes were fabricated out of Inconel 718 and tested in Sandia's solar furnace at two irradiance levels of ∼15 and 30 W/cm2 and two fluid flow rates. Photographic methods were used to capture the irradiance distribution on the receiver surfaces and compared to results from ray-tracing models. This methods provided the irradiance distribution and the thermal input on the FLGs. Air at nearly atmospheric pressure was used as heat transfer fluid. The air inlet and outlet temperatures were recorded, using a data acquisition system, until steady state was achieved. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, using the Discrete Ordinates (DO) radiation and the k-? Shear Stress Transport (SST) equations, were developed and calibrated, using the test data, to predict the performance of the five FLGs at different air flow rates and irradiance levels. The results showed that relative to a flat plate (base case), the new FLGs exhibited an increase in the effective solar absorptance from 0.86 to 0.92 for an intrinsic material absorptance of 0.86. Peak surface temperatures of ∼1000°C and maximum air temperature increases of ∼200°C were observed. Compared to the base case, the new FLGs showed a clear air outlet temperature increase. Thermal efficiency increases of ∼15%, with respect to the base case, were observed. Several tests, in different days, were performed to assess the repeatability of the results. The results obtained, so far, are very encouraging and display a very strong potential for incorporation in future solar power receivers. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Air; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Coatings; Computational fluid dynamics; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Environmental technology; Flow of fluids; Fuel storage; Geometry; Geothermal energy; Heat transfer; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Oceanography; Ray tracing; Shear flow; Shear stress; Solar energy; Solar furnaces; Sustainable development; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Concentrating solar; Data acquisition system; Irradiance distribution; Light trapping effects; Outlet temperature; Shear-stress transport; Solar selective coating; Surface temperatures; Solar power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001907629

The ideal HTF should have low melting temperature and be thermally stable at high temperatures. High specific heat capacity is also favorable. The eutectic ternary salt mixtures studied in this work are formed by NaCl, KCl and ZnCl2. The heat capacity, heat of fusion, and melting temperatures of three salt mixtures were measured by using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)/Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) simultaneously. The accuracy of the measurements was validated by measuring three metals, Indium, Tin, and Zinc, which have standard reference data.

Thermo-chemical batteries are particularly appealing for energy storage applications due to their high energy densities and ability to store thermal energy as chemical energy for long periods of time without any energy loss. Thermo-chemical batteries based on a reversible solid-gas (MgCl2 - NH3) reactions and NH3 liquid-gas phase change are of specific interest since the kinetics of absorption are fast and the heat transfer rates for liquid - vapor phase change are high. Thus, a thermo-chemical battery based on reversible reaction between magnesium chloride and ammonia was studied. Experimental studies were conducted on a reactor in which temperature profiles within the solid matrix and pressure and flow rates of gas were obtained during charging processes. A numerical model based on heat and mass transfer within the salt and salt-gas reactions was developed to simulate the absorption processes within the solid matrix and the results were compared with experimental data. The studies were used to determine dominant heat and mass transfer processes within the salt. It is shown that for high permeability materials, heat transfer is the dominant factor in determining reaction rates. However increasing thermal conductivity might decrease permeability and reduce reaction rates. The effect of constraining mass flow rate on the temperature and reaction propagation is also studied. These results show that optimized heat and mass transfer within the solid-gas reactor will lead to improved performance for heating and air conditioning applications.

Current thermal storage systems in solar thermal systems work based on transferring the generated heat from sunlight to a thermal mass material in an insulated reservoir and then withdraw it during dark hours. Some common thermal mass materials are stone, concrete, water, pressurized steam, phase changing materials, and molten salts. In the current paper, a hybrid thermal energy storage system which is based on two metal hydrides is proposed for a solar thermal system. The two hydrides which are considered for this system are magnesium hydride and lanthanum nickel. Although metal hydride Energy Storage Systems (ESS) suffer from slow response time which restricts them as a practical option for frequency regulation, off peak shaving and power supply stabilization; they can still demonstrate significant flexibility and good energy capacity. These specifications make them good candidates for thermal energy storage which are applicable to any capacity of a solar thermal system just by changing the size of the ESS unit.

These emissions trap heat, increase the planet's temperature, and create significant health, environmental, and climate issues. Electricity production accounts for more than one-third of U.S. global warming emissions, with the majority generated by coal-fired power plants. These plants produce approximately 25 percent of total U.S. global warming emissions. In contrast, most renewable energy sources produce little to no global warming emissions. Unfortunately, generated electricity from renewable sources rarely provides immediate response to electrical demands, as the sources of generation do not deliver a regular supply easily adjustable to consumption needs. This has led to the emergence of storage as a crucial element in the management of energy, allowing energy to be released into the grid during peak hours and meet electrical demands. Compressed air energy storage can potentially allow renewable energy sources to meet electricity demands as reliably as coalfired power plants. Most compressed air energy storage systems run at very high pressures, which possess inherent problems such as equipment failure, high cost, and inefficiency. This research aims to illustrate the potential of compressed air energy storage systems by illustrating two different discharge configurations and outlining key variables, which have a major impact on the performance of the storage system. Storage efficiency is a key factor to making renewable sources an independent form of sustainable energy. In this paper, a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of a compressed air energy storage system is presented. Specifically, a detailed study of the first law of thermodynamics of the entire system is presented followed by a thorough analysis of the second law of thermodynamics of the complete system. Details of both discharge and charge cycles of the storage system are presented. The first and second law based efficiencies of the system are also presented along with parametric studies, which demonstrates the effects of various thermodynamic cycle variables on the total round-trip efficiency of compressed air energy storage systems.

Most of the renewable energy sources are intermittent and have generation peaks that do not correlate with peak demand. The stability of the power grid is highly dependent on the balance between power generation and demand. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) systems have been utilized to receive and store the electrical energy from the grid during off-peak hours and play the role of an auxiliary power plant during peak hours. Using Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems with CAES technology is shown to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of generated power. In this study, a modular solid-based TES system is designed to store thermal energy converted from grid power. The TES system stores the energy in the form of internal energy of the storage medium up to 900 K. A three-dimensional computational study using commercial software (ANSYS Fluent) was completed to test the performance of the modular design of the TES. It was shown that solid-state TES, using conventional concrete and an array of circular fins with embedded heaters, can be used for storing heat for a high temperature hybrid CAES (HTH-CAES) system.

First, a conventional compressed air energy storage process is modeled using a time series iterative forward differencing method to simulate the round trip efficiency, exergy storage, cavern temperatures and pressures, and the gas expander exit temperature of a CAES plant. The computational model was validated experimentally by comparing trended data of the compression cycle of a 280 HP Gardener-Denver tandem horizontal two-stage compressor to computational results. It was found that the process of cooling the compressors resulted in a large exergy loss and the inefficiencies of the expanders lead to higher temperature gas being exhausted back to ambient pressures. Second, Advanced Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (AACAES) was simulated to study the effectiveness of storing the thermal energy removed from the compressors to be added to the compressed air as it enters the expanders at a later time. Third, the concept of increasing the capacity of the thermal energy storage systems to allow recharge with concentrated solar heat was explored. It was found that the thermal efficiency of converting the solar thermal energy to power would be high (> 60%). Further, the expander exhaust temperature and exergy are high (> 500 K), implying that additional waste heat energy recovery will be possible. Taken together, the results of this study show that an integrated, high efficiency, on-demand, water-free, solar energy delivery system is possible if combined with an AACAES system.

By mapping energy storage physics to application economics, this paper offers a technology neutral look at how energy storage can solve real problems. A value analytics methodology was developed that combines the physics of energy storage, application power commands, and market-specific economic constructs. This approach evaluates and optimizes the value of energy storage for specific projects by providing insight into the tradeoffs between the lifecycle costs and revenues. These analytics calculate the net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) of select energy storage assets, markets, and applications by considering these key factors: • Duty profiles and control strategies • Market economics and revenue streams • Asset performance at cell, module, and system levels • Price projections including balance of plant (BOP) • Cycle and calendar life • Project length and financing terms The value analytics methodology combines three model streams. The first takes a high fidelity load profile (for example, the power output of a building, wind turbine, or solar farm), imposes a specific control strategy, and calculates revenue streams in a selected market. From this first model stream a storage power command is generated. This power command is fed into the second model stream that calculates the required size and price of a given storage type. Finally, a third model stream uses empirical life models to calculate degradation rates, replacement intervals, and maintenance costs. These are rolled up into a project specific financial analysis that forecasts project NPV and IRR. The underlying engine for this methodology is a large performance and price database of over 100 commercial and emerging energy storage assets that spans a wide range of technologies from ultracapacitors and flywheels to lead acid and lithium-ion batteries. The physics based performance of each asset is captured as an equivalent circuit model. These models are exercised to create performance envelops that describe the rate dependent power capability as a function of the type, amount, and age of installed storage. The energy storage value analytics described in this paper can be used to test key sensitivities. This methodology has been applied to standalone energy storage systems as well as the combination of energy storage with renewables and distributed power generation. As shown, the methodology is relevant for an even wider range of applications. Several solution maps will be shared that reveal, by market segment, the energy storage type, amount, and application that create the greatest customer value. This type of informed design and dispatch will solve real problems, create new value streams, and open new markets for grid scale energy storage.

Unlike standard lithium-ion pouch cells, the MES Composites maximizes material utilization by using CFRP facesheets to house the electrochemistry. Through-thickness polymer reinforcements are implemented to allow load transfer between the two facesheets, analogous to the sandwich structure construction. In this work, the design rationale, materials and fabrication techniques, experimental evaluation, and performance of the first-generation MES Composites will be presented. MES Composite cells with a nominal capacity of approximately 4 Ah, with various reinforcements-array configurations, were fabricated and first tested through a series of electrochemical reference performance tests (RPT) under a strain-free condition. The MES Composite cells then underwent a mechanicalelectrical- coupling test, where a quasi-static three-point-bending load was applied at increasing increments. Mechanical testing was interrupted after each increment to performa sequential RPT to quantify any non-catastrophic degradation in the electrochemical performance. The obtained results verify the feasibility of the concept showing that the electrochemical performance of the MES Composites can be maintained at the same level as the regular lithium-ion battery. The reinforcement architecture of the MES Composite constrains the relative motion of the battery electrodes and increases the bending rigidity, resulting in a higher load carrying capacity and inhibiting non-fatal injury of the cell under mechanical loads. This multifunctional material system can also be scaled up and ultimately provide considerable weight and volume saving at the system level.

Specifically for largescale applications solar energy and concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use techniques that include thermal energy storage systems and phase change materials to harvest energy. However, on the smaller centimeter scale, there have been historically fewer investigations of these same techniques. The main goal of this paper is to investigate thermal energy storage (TES) as applied to a small scale system for thermal energy capture. Typical large-scale TES consists of a phase change material that usually employs a wax or oil medium held within a conductive container. The system stores the energy when the wax medium undergoes a phase change. In typical applications like buildings, the system absorbs and stores incoming thermal energy during the day, and releases it back to the surrounding environment as temperatures cool at night. This paper presents a new TES unit designed to integrate with a thermoelectric for energy harvesting application in small, cm-scale applications. In this manner, the TES serves as a thermal battery and source for the thermoelectric, even when originating power supply is interrupted. A unique feature of this TES is the inclusion of internal heat pipes. These heat pipes are fabricated from copper tubing and filled with working fluid, mounted vertically, and immersed in the wax medium of the TES. This transfers heat to the wax by means of thermal conductivity enhancement as an element of the heat pipe operation. This represents a first of its kind in this small-scale, thermal harvesting application. As tested, the TES rests atop a low temperature (60 °C) heat source with a heat sink as the final setup component. The heat sink serves to simulate thermal energy rejection to a future thermoelectric device. To measure the temperature change of the device, thermocouples are placed on either side of the TES, and a third placed on the heat source to ensure that the energy input is appropriate and constant. Heat flux sensors (HFS) are placed between the heat source and the TES and between the TES and heat sink to monitor heat transferred to and from the device. The TES is tested in a variety constructions as part of this effort. Basic design of the storage volume as well as fluid fill levels within the heat pipes are considered. Varying thermal energy inputs are also studied. Temperature and heat flux data are compared to show the thermal absorption capability and operating average thermal conductivities of the TES units. The baseline average thermal conductivity of the TES is approximately 0.5 W/mK. This represents the TES with wax alone filling the internal volume. Results indicate a fully functional, heat pipe TES capable of 8.23 W/mK.

The introduction of carbon coating not only serves as a buttering to effectively prevent the restacking of nanoplates, but also largely improves electrical conductivity and reinforces the structural robustness of FeP. The obtained FeP@C nanoplates show two-dimensional morphology and possess a large surface-area-to-volume-ratio and abundant inner mesopores with a high specific surface area. As an anode of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the prepared FeP@C nanoplates exhibit exceptionally high electrochemical performance, which largely outperforms the Fe3O4@C counterpart under identical morphological properties in experimental and simulated results. As a result, the FeP@C nanoplates exhibit a reversible specific capacity of 720 mA h g-1 and a capacity retention rate of 96% after 100 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1. Even at a higher current density of 500 mA g-1, it still delivers a stable capacity of 610 mA h g-1 within 400 cycles with negligible capacity fading, which opens venues for long life-time applications of LIBs. Furthermore, the superior rate capability of such anodes is also obtained with a reversible specific capacity of 347 mA h g-1 at 5000 mA g-1. The outstanding lithium ion storage properties of the FeP@C nanoplates may be attributed to the reduced energy barrier for the Li storage reaction, shortened electronic/ionic transfer paths, and the physical buffering effect rooted in the rational integration of the phosphide-based species, plate-like nanostructure and conformal carbon surface modification. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.",,"Anodes; Automobile steering equipment; Carbon; Coatings; Hematite; Lithium-ion batteries; Magnetite; Surface treatment; Temperature; Chemical conversions; Conversion reactions; Electrical conductivity; Electrochemical performance; High specific surface area; Morphological properties; Reversible specific capacity; Structural robustness; Nanostructures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998600958

High capacitance retention in the repeated bending (20% decay after 1000 bending times) and torsion (107% retention after 1000 twisting times) tests demonstrated the great flexibility, structural stability and potential utilization of the a-FSSC in wearable electronics.

Herein, a type of ultrafine carbon nanoparticle with high nitrogen doping concentration can be simply prepared from a conveniently available precursor through a green and cost-effective hydrothermal process. With the aid of water, not only is the product's specific surface area enlarged, but the pore structure is also enriched, and there is improvement in the degree of graphitization and nitrogen-doped content. Meanwhile, the size of the carbon particle can be readily tuned to a nanoscale by changing the duration of the hydrothermal reaction. Interestingly, electrocatalytic activity is dramatically enhanced with the transformation of the carbon size and nitrogen structure. The characterization reveals that we have achieved a highly satisfactory electrocatalytic activity for ORR, a relatively positiv-e onset potential of -0.02 V (vs. Hg/HgO) in alkaline media and 0.55 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in acidic media, a higher diffusion-limiting current density than that of Pt/C, as well as outstanding stability and superior tolerance durability to methanol.

In this work, a magnetically carbonaceous fiber (MCF) aerogel was for the first time fabricated by a facile approach from natural cotton as a precursor, and this material can be used as a potential adsorbent without any further chemical modification for oil–water separation under demanding conditions. Owing to its unique and superior properties, such as twisted fiber structure, light weight, high porosity, desirable hydrophobicity, excellent separation efficiency, and strong thermal/mechanical stability, the MCF aerogel exhibits a high adsorption capacity for organic solvents and oils (22–87 times its own weight) and good recyclability. Coupled with the simple, low-cost, and environment-friendly synthesis process, the MCF aerogel will be a promising candidate for removing organic pollutants in environmental pollution cleanup. Hopefully, the MCF aerogel and the corresponding fabrication approach will be further applied to extensive applications including energy storage, fabrication of multifunctional composite materials, and so on.

The entire process can be performed at ambient temperature without consuming a large amount of energy. The resultant sponge, coated with a highly hydrophobic lignin-based shell, retained most of the inner space for the storage of oil and organic liquids and was similar to a sealed container with highly hydrophobic walls. The prepared sponge, with a highly hydrophobic surface (water contact angle of 145.9°), exhibited excellent absorption capacities for organic liquids, with a volume-based absorption capacity of up to 98% of its original volume. Moreover, the absorbed oil can be recovered by squeezing the oil-absorbed sponge with a good compressibility, which maintained above 86.96% of the mass-based absorption capacity even after 100 absorption/squeezing cycles.

However, there are some scientific and technical challenges for a large amount of charges to be transported through the devices because the kinetic resistances and volume change issues may limit the performance of devices. 3D conductive scaffolds are usually developed to build rapid electron/ion pathways and accommodate volume changes. Using a templated electrodeposition and hydrothermal synthesis technique, we developed a composite electrode consisting of NiCo2O4 nanowires on ultralight nickel foam. The NiCo2O4 nanowires provide a large surface for rapid charge transports. The ultralight nickel foam electrically wires NiCo2O4 and accommodates the volume expansion of NiCo2O4 during lithiation. The composite electrode demonstrates a high performance microstructure for ideal pseudocapacitors and lithium ion anodes. It not only enhances the utilization of active materials but also increases the electrode based specific capacitance by one order of magnitude as compared to the widely used nickel foam.

The micelles were prepared from poly(acrylonitrile)-block-poly(methylmethacrylate) (PAN-b-PMMA), and synthesized via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The RAFT-controlled synthesis of block copolymer, PAN-b-PMMA was conducted either in solution or emulsion conditions. It was found that micelles with well-defined morphology could be directly formed from the emulsion polymerization.

However, the easy aggregation nature of nanosheets hinders rapid transport of electrolyte ions, reducing the ion-accessible area and restricting the ion transportation. Herein, we propose a template strategy for preparing three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon nanosheets (PCNs) with an oriented and interconnected nanostructure. Zinc layered hydroxide nitrate is used as a layered template and provides a nanospace to confine the carbonization process of the organic carbon precursor (gallic acid). The unique nanostructure and large surface area of chemically activated PCNs (aPCNs) significantly shorten the ion transport length in low dimensions and improve the electrolyte wettability and ion accessible surface area for charge storage. The aPCNs exhibit excellent performance as demonstrated by their large specific capacitance (327 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1), superior rate capability (retaining 60.2% at 20 A g-1) and stable cyclability. In particular, the assembled symmetric device based on aPCNs delivers an energy density as high as 10.2 W h kg-1 at a power density of 301 W kg-1. © 2016 Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbonization; Electrolytes; Ions; Nanosheets; Nanostructures; Porous materials; Accessible surface areas; Carbonization process; Electrical conductivity; Electrical double layer capacitor; Electrical double layer capacitor (EDLCs); Large specific surface areas; Threedimensional (3-d); Two Dimensional (2 D); Organic carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994335415

Novel electrode architectures and new systems are considered to be the best choices to improve the electrochemical performance. Here, ultra-long Na2Ti3O7 nanowires (L-NTO NWs) with a length of more than 100 μm and a width of 100-200 nm were grown on a carbon cloth (CC) substrate by a one-pot hydrothermal method.

Meanwhile, the unique 3D architecture can maximize the active interface between the nanowires and electrolyte, enabling a long lifetime, large capacity, and a high coulombic efficiency. As a binder-free flexible electrode for sodium-ion batteries, this novel L-NTO NW@CC anode electrode demonstrates a high specific capacity of 170.3 mA h g-1 (close to 100% of the theoretical capacity), excellent cyclability with a capacity retention of over 96% after 200 cycles at 2C, and - following cycling at a current density of 3C - a discharge capacity of 100.6 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles.

Such an enhanced performance is ascribed to: (i) the boron species in B-rGO can enhance the binding with polysulfides, which helps suppress the shuttle reactions, thus alleviating overcharge and self-discharge; (ii) a certain amount of the boron doped into the graphene matrix can improve the electrical conductivity of the coating layer, thus enhancing the utilization of sulfur and improving the rate performance of the cells. With the B-rGO coated separator, the severe self-discharge of Li-S batteries can be alleviated. More importantly, for the high sulfur loading cathodes (above 4.5 mg cm-2), an improved high areal capacity of 4.71 mA h cm-2 can be achieved using the B-rGO coated separator.

In this sense, non-covalent interactions in host-guest arrays are among the most significant topics to address. In this work, the inclusion of a series of gases in the cavity of a minimal secondary building unit (SBU), namely, [Ag2(bisox)3] as the host was studied in terms of their non-covalent interactions and optical properties using different computational approximations. The relevant interaction energies indicated favorable inclusion of incoming guests in the respective host. Consequently, the decomposition of the interaction energy within the Ziegler-Rauk scheme revealed significant differences within the series of studied gases. Hence, the potential selectivity of the [Ag2(bisox)3] cage for a particular gas within the series was investigated. Natural orbital for chemical valence (NOCV) analysis was carried out to visualize possible channels of charge transfer between the host-guest pairs. Non-covalent interaction (NCI) analysis supports the fact that different types of weak interaction are involved in the series of studied gases and highlights remarkable differences between polar and non-polar guests. Otherwise, the ability of the studied cage to trap gases was evidenced by changes in the spectral properties of the free cage with respect to those of cages containing guests. This was investigated via computational analysis of the UV-vis absorption spectra. Furthermore, electron density difference maps (EDDMs) were employed to reveal the character of the electron transitions. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Charge transfer; Crystalline materials; Electron transitions; Gases; Optical properties; Organometallics; Porous materials; Silver; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Computational analysis; Host guest interactions; Interaction energies; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Non-covalent interaction; Secondary building units; Spectral properties; UV-VIS absorption spectra; Chemical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994204430

The micrometric pores are interconnected which form from the micrometric salt droplets during carbonization, while the nanopores are generated by the exclusion of small molecular gases. This unique structure and high nitrogen content endows the NPCs with excellent specific capacitance (364.93 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1) and good cycling stability (92.3% capacitance retention at 10 A g-1 after 5000 cycles) in 6 M KOH electrolyte.

Coordination supramolecular networks (CSNs) also exhibit a high specific surface area. However, they have been scarcely applied as electrode materials for supercapacitors yet. In the present study, a honeycomb-shaped Ni-pydc (pydc = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate) supermolecular-networks-coated electrochemically exfoliated graphene (Ni-pydc@EEG) composite was synthesized via a simple one-step electrochemical synthesis. The capacitance of the Ni-pydc@EEG composite increased sharply up to 835.3 F g-1 at 5 A g-1, while the pure Ni-pydc supermolecular networks could store only 158.7 F g-1 and the pure EEG could achieve only about 193.6 F g-1. This high capacitive performance could be attributed to the electrochemical synergistic effect between the redox active Ni-pydc and the EEG. To test for practical application, a small solid-state asymmetric device (Ni-pydc@EEG//EEG) was assembled and achieved a considerable energy density of 14.5 W h kg-1 at a high power density of 7500 W kg-1 and the ability to power a 2.5 W fan motor directly.

Nevertheless, increasing efforts have been paid to develop non-precious metal catalysts as alternatives to noble metal catalysts for HER and ORR. However, how to rationally design and construct an advantageous catalyst is still challenging. Here, a novel cobalt-embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (Co-N-GA) catalyst is firstly rationally designed and synthesized by employing a facile strategy of implementing the confined growth of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) within graphene aerogels (GAs). It is worth noting that the Co-N-GA exhibits hierarchical porosity involving micropores, mesopores and macropores, as well as a high surface area (466.6 m2 g-1). More importantly, benefiting from the synergetic effect of hierarchical porosity, high surface area, N-doped carbon and the inner Co metal, the catalyst Co-N-GA displays extraordinarily superior activity for both HER at various pH values and ORR along with better stability. Especially for HER, the onset overpotential, overpotentials@10, 100 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope on the catalyst Co-N-GA in 0.5 M H2SO4 are 0 mV, 46 mV, 183 mV and 33 mV dec-1, respectively. Most importantly, these values are much lower than those of almost all prepared noble-metal-free HER catalysts, indicating the excellent activity for HER of our as-prepared catalyst Co-N-GA.

The hybrid Co3O4/C NAs demonstrate a high specific capacitance of 1.32 F cm-2 at a current density of 1 mA cm-2, which is much superior to that of bare Co3O4 NAs.

However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides hampers their commercial application. Here, a Ca(OH)2-carbon framework derived from crab shells is successfully used to design a modified separator for Li-S batteries.

In this study, a fascinating carbon aerogel has been rationally designed with a unique cellular structure, consisting of one-dimensional carbon nanofibers derived from oxidized polyacrylonitrile (o-PAN) and two-dimensional carbon sheets originating from polyimide (PI). The interconnected o-PAN/PI (oPP) carbon aerogel exhibits low density but increased mechanical strength and can not only act as a versatile adsorbent but also as an ideal template for the in situ growth of MnO2 nanosheets to obtain oPP@MnO2 hybrid carbon aerogel. The oPP@MnO2 composite aerogel exhibits extraordinary electrochemical characteristics with a maximum specific capacitance of 1066 F g-1, approaching the theoretical value (1370 F g-1) of MnO2. Moreover, an assembled oPP@MnO2//activated oPP (A-oPP) asymmetric supercapacitor delivers a considerably high energy density of up to 30.3 W h kg-1, highlighting the advantages of the unique cellular structure of the oPP carbon aerogel and oPP@MnO2 hybrid carbon aerogel. Therefore, the successful fabrication of the oPP carbon aerogel widens the scope of traditional electrospun lamellar membranes to multi-dimensional aerogels, providing a new strategy for the construction of nanofiber-based materials for energy storage and environmental protection applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Carbon nanofibers; Cellular automata; Manganese oxide; Membranes; Nanofibers; Pore size; Asymmetric supercapacitor; Carbon based materials; Cellular structure; Electrochemical characteristics; Electrospun nanofibers; High energy densities; Internal surface area; Specific capacitance; Aerogels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992188134

Nevertheless, construction of TMP with abundant exposed active sites is of urgent concern and highly desirable for the HER. Herein, we report a novel strategy to configure integrated active site-enriched architectures (Fe2P-ND/FG) composed of diiron phosphide (Fe2P) nanodots with a diameter of ∼2.5 nm uniformly anchored on porous and fluffy graphene sheets (FG). The interconnected conductive networks within porous FG favor the formation of uniformly and highly dispersed Fe2P nanodots, finally helping the promotion of fast electrolyte ion and electron transfer during the electrochemical process. Compared with bulk Fe2P, these ultrasmall Fe2P nanodots lead to abundant exposed edges and atoms. Benefiting from the highly exposed active sites derived from Fe2P nanodots and superior electrical conductivity stemming from an interconnected graphene matrix, the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG hybrids exhibit outstanding HER catalytic activity and stability. Overpotentials as low as 44 and 91 mV are required to achieve current densities of 2 and 10 mA cm-2, respectively.

Taking a polycarboxylate based cobalt coordination polymer (CoCOP) as an example, we presented one-dimensional (1D) MOF nanowires by a facile and scalable method. The CoCOP nanowires deliver an impressive lithium ion storage capacity of more than 1100 mA h g-1 at 20 mA g-1. Besides the high energy and power performance (875 W h kg-1 and 6422 W kg-1) comparable to that of recently advanced metal oxide hybrid electrodes, they also exhibit excellent long term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles for fully reversible lithiation-delithiation chemistry based on a joint mechanism of intercalation-like structural deformation and Co2+/Co conversion reactions. Typical full cells with CoCOP nanowire anodes and commercial LiFePO4 powder cathodes (CoCOP-LiFePO4) also demonstrate excellent cyclability and fast charge-discharge capability with a capacity retention of 83% for more than 300 cycles at a 1C rate (1C corresponds to a one hour discharge process). Besides, a large capacity of 138 mA h g-1 at 0.1C and a high specific energy of 222 W h kg-1 (based on the total weight of CoCOP and LiFePO4) also substantiate their superior performance to common commercial energy storage and conversion devices. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Charging (batteries); Cobalt; Crystalline materials; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Energy storage; Intercalation; Java programming language; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Metals; Nanowires; Organometallics; Scalability; Secondary batteries; Tungsten; Advanced lithium-ion batteries; Conversion reactions; Coordination Polymers; Lithium ion storages; Metal organic framework; Nanowire electrodes; Structural compatibility; Structural deformation; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991738567

Although BN-DBTTC has a large energy gap of 2.59 eV, the devices with PC71BM as the acceptor show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 3.12% at a donor-acceptor (D-A) molar ratio (MR) of 1 : 4. An open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.96 ± 0.01 V is achieved at a MR of 1 : 2. The high Voc is ascribed to the lowered HOMO level by introducing BN units into the π-system and the supramolecular interaction between the curved π-surface of BN-DBTTC and PC71BM. Moreover, BN-DBTTC is added to a PTB7:PC71BM device to control the morphology of the blend film, showing increased PCE and enhanced stability by suppressing the crystallization of PCBM. After BN-DBTTC is introduced, the domain size is reduced from ∼200 nm to well below 20 nm. At a weight ratio of PTB7 : BN-DBTTC : PC71BM = 8 : 3 : 12, the PCE is enhanced from 3.91% to 4.75%, and the PCE degradation is reduced from 47.8% to 26.7% after 20-month storage.

In this study, an ultra-light flexible carbon foam (MFC) with a 3D interconnected hollow network was prepared through a special heating program from melamine-formaldehyde foam. The MFC can be used as an efficient host material to achieve both ultra-high sulphur loading and good electrochemical performance in lithium-sulphur batteries. Without a conductive additive and a binder, the sulphur loading in the MFC-based cathode could easily reach up to 75%. The MFC contains a high content of N and O strongly absorbing the polysulfides and has a flexible and sparse skeleton accommodating large volume change during electrochemical reactions. To further improve the performance of the eletrode, GO or rGO was used to decorate the MFC skeleton. The MFC-based electrodes with 75% sulfur loading have excellent cycling performance.

In our present work, the structural stability and catalytic properties for adsorbing CO2 on the surface of isolated Ni clusters and 5-8-5 monovacancy graphene (MGr) supported Ni clusters have been investigated using density functional theory. The results show that, with the increasing of atomic number, the structure of isolated Ni clusters tended to be stable and the structural parameters approached to that of metal crystal. In addition, when Ni clusters deposited on the MGr surface, the Ni-Ni bond generally elongated, indicating activation of the isolated metal clusters by graphene. Adsorption energies of CO2 onto Ni4 cluster and MGr were -1.80 and -1.35 eV, respectively, while the value reached -2.72 eV when CO2 adsorbed on Ni4 cluster modified with MGr (Nix/MGr). The phenomenon indicates that the adsorption capacity of CO2 were significantly improved by depositing Ni clusters onto MGr surface and the system tended to be more stable. According to the analyses of Mulliken charge, electrostatic potential (EP) and partial density of states (PDOS), more electrons transferred from Nix cluster to the region of CO2 and MGr when CO2 adsorbed on Nix/MGr. The mechanism was proposed for CO2 adsorption on Nix/MGr at the molecular level. It is of great significance to devise high activity catalyst of CO2 storage and hydrocarbon production from CO2.

The platform, controlled actively along both DOFs, is capable of producing rapid and strong perturbations up to an angular speed of 200°/s and peak torque of 400 Nm. This enables study of ankle impedance characteristics even during extreme task conditions such as running. The platform is designed to provide perturbations to the ankle up to an angle of 20° in sagittal plane and 10° in frontal plane, which is sufficient for all possible configurations of the ankle during postural balance and stance phase of walking. These characteristics of the platform make it ideal for both impedance and reflex characterization along both DOFs of the ankle. The platform's performance of position control is validated under varying loads simulating various conditions of posture and locomotion. The platform's orientation accuracy in both sagittal and frontal planes is established for various input signals including slow sinusoid inputs and rapid ramp perturbations. Implications for future ankle studies to estimate neuro-mechanical characteristics and applications to assistive and prosthetic devices are discussed.

This CEC was impregnated through its pores with paraffin to obtain a paraffin/carbon foam/expanded graphite composite (PCEC). In the case of CECs, when the amount of added expandable graphite reached 10 wt% to 15 wt%, the microstructure of the CEC was damaged because of the expansion in volume of the expandable graphite. Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis of PCECs showed that there was no chemical interaction between the paraffin and CECs. With an increase in the amount of expandable graphite in CECs, the adsorption capacity of paraffin and the latent heat first showed an increase and then decreased. The heat transfer capability of the paraffin was truly improved by the CECs. The processes for the preparation of the CECs and PCECs were environmentally friendly, convenient, and inexpensive.

The resulting aerogels, e.g. NaV3O8, NaV6O15, and K0.25V2O5, exhibit excellent Li+ storage properties in terms of high specific capacity, good rate capability, and outstanding cyclic stability as cathodes for lithium batteries. Importantly, the NaV3O8 aerogel demonstrates an excellent long-life cyclic performance of 600 cycles at 1000 mA g-1 with no capacity fading. To account for the mechanisms that affect the electrochemical properties, a systematic study is conducted. The superior performances may be due to the superior mechanical stability, good reversibility of lithium insertion/de-insertion and excellent interior structural stability. It is believed that our strategy could probably be extended to prepare other metal vanadate aerogel materials with great promise for various applications. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Lithium; Lithium batteries; Mechanical stability; Metals; Self assembly; Stability; Cyclic performance; Freeze-drying process; High specific capacity; Lithium storage properties; Self assembly routes; Storage properties; Structural stabilities; Threedimensional (3-d); Aerogels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988596431

However, safety and life issues are still great challenges for the practical applications of LIBs. Metallic lithium plating on the negative electrode under critical charging conditions accelerates performance degradation and poses safety hazards for LIBs. Therefore, anode lithium plating in LIBs has recently drawn increased attention. This article reviews the recent research and progress regarding anode lithium plating of LIBs. Firstly, the adverse effects of anode lithium plating on the electrochemical performance of LIBs are presented. Various in situ and ex situ techniques for characterizing and detecting anode lithium plating are then summarized.

Nevertheless, lead-free bulk ceramics show relatively low recoverable energy storage density (Wrec &lt; 2 J cm-3) owing to their low dielectric breakdown strength (DBS &lt; 200 kV cm-1). In order to significantly increase Wrec, we proposed a strategy (compositions drive the grain size to submicrometer) to improve the DBS of lead-free ceramics. In this work, (1 - x)(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3-xSrTiO3 (KNN-ST) ceramics were chosen as a representative to verify the validity of this strategy. The (1 - x)KNN-xST ceramics (x = 0.15 and 0.20) with submicrometer grains (about 0.3 μm) were prepared using pressureless solid state sintering. A large Wrec (4.03 J cm-3) and DBS (400 kV cm-1 with a thickness of 0.2 mm) were achieved for 0.85KNN-0.15ST ceramics. The value of 4.03 J cm-3 is superior to all other Wrec in lead-free bulk ceramics and 2-3 times larger than that of other lead-free bulk ceramics. A large Wrec (3.67 J cm-3) and energy storage efficiency (72.1%) were simultaneously achieved for 0.80KNN-0.20ST ceramics. The results confirm that the (1 - x)KNN-xST ceramics (x = 0.15 and 0.20) are desirable materials for advanced pulsed power capacitors. The findings in this study could push the development of a series of KNN-based ceramics with enhanced DBS and Wrec in the future. On the other hand, this work could broaden the applications of KNN materials in a new field. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Dielectric materials; Electric breakdown; Energy storage; Niobium oxide; Sintering; Sodium; Storage (materials); Energy storage efficiencies; Lead free ceramics; Low dielectric; Mechanical and thermal properties; Potassium sodium niobate; Pulsed power capacitors; Recoverable energy; Solid state sintering; Ceramic materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987940063

The combination of Ag grids with PEDOT:PSS not only compensates for the demerits of the single materials but also makes full use of their advantages. The Ag grids and the PEDOT:PSS layer offered extra conductive paths for each other, yielding a much lower sheet resistance of the PEDOT:PSS/Ag grids than that of either the Ag grids or the PEDOT:PSS layer, thus improving the electrochemical performance as well. The PEDOT:PSS layer could also boost the anti-oxidation capability as well as smoothen the line of the Ag grids.

Grafting poly(methacrylate esters) (ca. poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)) onto the side chain of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) (TrFE refers to trifluoroethyelene and CTFE is chlorotrifluoroethylene) has been shown to be an effective route to tailor the ferroelectric performance of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE). The resultant grafted copolymers possess advantages including well maintained high energy density and remarkably reduced energy loss. To further disclose the influence of a PMMA side chain on ferroelectric relaxation of a P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) main chain, a set of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)-g-PMMA copolymers bearing PMMA content from 10 wt% to 32 wt% were synthesized and well characterized in this work. The dielectric and energy storage performance of the grafted copolymers were systematically investigated under increased electric field, testing temperature, and frequency. The PMMA side chain was found to exhibit great influence with ferroelectric performance under varied conditions by impeding crystallization and formation of the ferroelectric phase of the P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) main chain along with increasing the Young's modulus of amorphous phase. As a result, the grafted copolymer with optimized PMMA content shows excellent stability with testing frequency, temperature, and electric field. That allows them to store and discharge energy consistently, which is rather important for energy storage capacitors working under varied conditions. With respect to promising energy storage performances together with low performance dependence during working conditions, the PMMA grafted P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) copolymer may offer a great candidate material for high energy density pulse capacitors. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chains; Dielectric materials; Elastic moduli; Electric discharges; Electric fields; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Esters; Fluorine compounds; Fluorine containing polymers; Grafting (chemical); Storage (materials); Composition dependence; Energy storage capacitor; High energy densities; Methacrylate esters; Poly (vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF); Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA); Storage performance; Testing frequencies; Ferroelectricity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986260108

The method employs thermal decomposition of thiocarbonyls to produce the reactive sulfide needed to react with lead oleate. Thioacetamide is emphasized in this work, but similar results are obtained with other thioamides and with various thioureas. The use of these reagents in the synthesis of PbS NCs is not new; however, this is the first detailed examination of the potential to produce high quality PbS nanocrystals by these methods, and new insights on this approach are presented here. Using thioacetamide in combination with lead oleate and a mixture of solvents, we have obtained PbS nanocrystals with relatively narrow (≤60 meV) exciton absorption peaks, moderate photoluminescence quantum yield, and good stability against size change or degradation upon storage. Size tuning over a wide range - from 4 nm to 10 nm particle diameters - can be achieved by controlling precursor concentrations or by gradually injecting multiple precursor doses.

However, the low active material utilization, severe capacity fading, and short lifespan of the resultant lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have greatly hindered their practicality. In this work, a multi-functional polyacrylonitrile/silica nanofiber membrane with an integral ultralight and thin multi-walled carbon nanotube sheet is presented and it provides a new approach to significantly improve the overall electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. The experimental results are in agreement with molecular modeling studies based on density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, this design is favorable for the fast diffusion of both lithium ions and electrons and the mitigation of the diffusion of polysulfides. As a consequence, a high reversible capacity of 741 mA h g-1 at 0.2C after 100 cycles with excellent cyclability and high-rate performance (627 mA h g-1 at 1C) are achieved even with a high sulfur loading of 70 wt% in the cathode, revealing its great potential for energy storage applications.

However, some of these binary composites, particularly with graphene, still suffer from low storage capacity with increasing current densities. To improve lithium storage performance of the binary composites, we used a SnO2 and graphene oxide binary composite, as an example, and double-doped with sulfur and fluorine. Compared with the bare SnO2@graphene oxide composite, the sulfur and fluorine co-doped SnO2@graphene oxide (SFSG) composite shows enhanced Li-ion storage and excellent cycling stability. The initial discharge capacity of the SFSG composite was up to 1419 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, showing a long-term stability and an outstanding rate capability at 3.2 A g-1. A full cell lithium ion battery assembled based on the SFSG anode also delivered high capacity along with high energy and power densities.

The structures of the three monomers are similar except for the groups between the imine linkages, so the difference in electrochemical behavior can be related to the influence of the groups. Polymerization parameters such as the consumed charge, the apparent surface coverage and the doping level are investigated to elucidate the effects of groups between imine linkages. The results show that poly[Ni(salen)] has higher consumed charge and apparent surface coverage than others, which means that poly[Ni(salen)] can be deposited more easily on the electrodes. While poly[Ni(salphen)] has the highest doping level, there are more electrons transferred per monomer unit, indicating a better capacitance for energy storage. The electrochemical characteristics are also evaluated and the peak potential in cyclic voltammetry plots is about 0.9 V for Ni(salen) and Ni(salphen), and about 0.7 V for Ni(saldmp). The different peak potentials indicate the redox potential will be related to the various groups. Meanwhile the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves display a specific capacitance of about 200 F g-1 for poly[Ni(salphen)], and about 150 F g-1 for poly[Ni(salen)] and poly[Ni(saldmp)]. The variation in electrochemical behavior is mainly caused by the different molecular structure and the groups between imine linkages are the unique differences in structure. So we propose a new electronic transmission mechanism that the electrons will transmit via the Ph-CN-Y-NC-Ph path (Y represents groups between imine linkages), and these groups can provide an electronic transmission path as imine bridges and then influence the electrochemical behavior. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Capacitance; Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrodes; Electropolymerization; Monomers; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nitrogen compounds; Redox reactions; Synthesis (chemical); Yarn; Electrochemical behaviors; Electrochemical characteristics; Electronic transmissions; Galvanostatic charge/discharge; Redox potentials; Schiff base complexes; Specific capacitance; Surface coverages; Nickel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984704830

Then, MGA-n/Si was embedded in the binder layer (outside shell) composed of tryptophan-functionalized graphene quantum dots (Trp-GQD) and sodium alginate. The introduction of Trp-GQD greatly improves the mechanical strength, elasticity and electronic conductivity of the outside shell. The integration of the inner shell with the outside shell achieves simultaneously good structural integrity, SEI stability at the silicon-electrolyte interface and high ionic/electronic conductivity of the silicon anode.

Energy storage systems are essential in order to efficiently use these energies. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) show bright prospect in the application for energy storage markets due to the potential low cost originating from unlimited sources and wide distribution of Na. However, the anode remains a great challenge in the industrialization of SIBs. Hard carbon holds the most promising future among all reported anodes; however, there are still two main shortcomings such as high cost and low initial coulombic efficiency, which limit its application. Here, we report a hard carbon material derived from an abundant and abandoned biomass of corn cobs (HCC) using a simple carbonization method. The HCC shows excellent sodium storage performance with a reversible capacity of ca. 300 mA h g-1, a high initial coulombic efficiency of 86% and good cycling stability. A prototype sodium-ion battery was prepared to prove the application prospect using HCC1300 as the anode and Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 as the cathode, exhibiting a high energy density of 207 W h kg-1 and a long cycle life. These excellent properties demonstrate that HCC is a potential candidate as an anode material for sodium-ion battery application.

However, most of the stretchable single-cell energy storage devices suffer from a relatively low operating voltage and thus a low energy density. Here, we report an all-solid-state asymmetric stretchable supercapacitor (ASS) with high energy density using the wrinkled manganese dioxide (MnO2)/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid film as a positive electrode and the wrinkled iron oxide (Fe2O3)/CNT composite film as a negative electrode in a neutral Na2SO4-poly(vinyl alcohol) (Na2SO4/PVA) gel electrolyte. Due to the high specific capacitance and excellent rate performance of MnO2/CNTs and Fe2O3/CNTs, as well as the synergistic effects of the two electrodes with an optimized potential window, the asymmetric stretchable cell exhibits superior electrochemical and mechanical performances. An optimized ASS can be reversibly cycled in the voltage window between 0 and 2 V, and shows a supreme energy density of 45.8 W h kg-1 (corresponding power density of 0.41 kW kg-1). Additionally, the ASS also exhibits exceptional cycling stability and durability, with 98.9% specific capacitance retained even after 10 000 electrochemical cycles at multiple strains.

However, its actual application is still hindered by multiple challenges, such as the insulating nature of sulfur, irreversible loss of active material, and degradation of Li-metal anodes. In this paper, a functional sulfonated acetylene black (AB-SO3-) coated separator is designed to improve the overall performance of Li-S batteries. The AB-SO3- coated separator is highly permselective to lithium ions against polysulfide anions, while the incorporation of AB-SO3- coated separator does not influence the ion conductivity. Also the AB-SO3- coating could function as an upper current collector to facilitate electron transport for enhancing the electrochemical utilization of sulfur and ensuring the reactivation of the trapped active material. Therefore, the Li-S cell with the AB-SO3- coating exhibits significant improvement in both reversible capacity and cycling stability as compared to the cell with the pristine Celgard separator. When the mass of the AB-SO3- coating is counted into the whole mass of the sulfur cathode, the Li-S cell exhibits a high sulfur content of 70 wt% in the whole sulfur cathode region and 3.0 mg cm-2 sulfur mass loading. This kind of a cell delivers a high initial capacity of 1262 mA h g-1, and a superior capacity of 955 mA h g-1 was retained after 100 cycles at 0.1C.

However, the intermittence of energy sources such as solar and wind requires sustainable energy storage technologies. Nowadays, electrochemical energy storage technologies and applications have attracted much attention, including portable electric devices, electric vehicles and smart power grids. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely applied in these areas because of their safety, portability and high energy density. Nevertheless, the resources of lithium are limited and the vast consumption of lithium has pushed up the price of lithium compounds, urging people to search for resourceful materials.

This homopolymer can be massively produced by simple stepwise polymerization at room temperature with a fast polymerization rate. For the first time, PAA homopolymer vesicles are carbonized to form N-HCSs with tunable porous structures and nitrogen contents (from 1.3% to 7.4%) by controlling the content of the cross-linker (melamine).

However, the demand for gel electrolytes that combine high mechanical strength and excellent electrochemical performances remains a challenge. Here, a novel redox-active gel electrolyte was prepared by adding AQQS (1-anthraquinone sulfonic acid sodium) to a PVA (polyvinyl alcohol)-H2SO4 system using a simple solution-mixing/casting method, which possesses not only excellent mechanical strength but also a high ionic conductivity of 28.5 mS cm-1. Surprisingly, the as-fabricated supercapacitor can be operated at a wide voltage range of 0-1.4 V, which is much larger than that of the previously reported active electrolyte based supercapacitors (about 1.0 V). Furthermore, the supercapacitor exhibits superior electrochemical performance such as a maximum specific capacitance of 448 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, a high specific energy of 30.5 W h kg-1 at a specific power of 350 W kg-1 and good cycling stability with 91% specific capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. Additionally, such a device displays remarkably stable capacitive performance with the gel electrolyte even under a large tensile strain of 100%, a high pressure of 2000 kPa or fold states. The results doubtlessly demonstrate that the toughened redox-active gel polymer is a promising electrolyte candidate for developing high energy density flexible energy storage devices. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Capacitance; Display devices; Electrolytes; Ionic conductivity; Ionic strength; Redox reactions; Solid electrolytes; Tensile strain; Capacitive performance; Cycling stability; Electrochemical performance; High energy densities; High mechanical strength; Specific capacitance; Super capacitor; Wearable devices; Electrolytic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982091412

Small organic molecules containing polycyclic aromatic moieties and polar functional groups have recently been presented as attractive electron donors that bind lithium and other small metal ions. This has endowed them with the potential to replace traditional inorganic electrodes consisting of metal composites. A family of naturally occurring carbonyl compounds, or quinones, have been of particular interest to the scientific community. However, they themselves have been plagued by issues of low voltages, poor conductivity, and capacity fading due to solubility in common polar electrolytes. Herein, we review a number of theoretical and experimental solutions to this problem, which include the use of heterocyclic derivatives, polymers, and conductive supramolecular carbon frameworks as electrochemical property enhancers, or stabilizers, of potential organic electrodes.

The traditional OER catalysts, such as IrO2, RuO2 and their binary or ternary oxides, have finite large-scale commercial applications due to their significant cost and rareness. Here, we hydrothermally synthesized cry-Ir by doping Ir into non-OER active cryptomelane-type manganese oxide to significantly reduce the Ir mass ratio by 60.3% from 85.7% in IrO2 to 34% in the developed catalyst, along with higher OER performance with a lower onset potential and 10 times higher specific mass activity. The special tunnel structure of cryptomelane plays an important role in promoting its OER activity through facilitating water molecular insertion into the tunnel. We combined Raman, XPS and TEM mapping to confirm that no IrO2 composite is present on the cry-Ir surface. The XPS and XAS spectra indicate substitution of Ir4+ on the Mn3+ site and the presence of more 5d states in the Ir site compared to IrO2. The differences in VBS spectra between cry-Ir, IrO2 and cry-Mn indicate that the electronic structure of Ir sites is modified when Ir substitutes Mn3+ sites. Thus, this special tunnel structure and modified Ir electronic structure in cry-Ir are responsible for the outstanding OER performance. Our studies provide an approach for designing effective Ir-based OER catalysts whilst significantly reducing the consumption of precious elements. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Catalysts; Electronic structure; Manganese; Manganese oxide; Oxides; Reaction kinetics; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Commercial applications; Complex reaction mechanism; Hydrothermally synthesized; Molecular insertions; Oxygen evolution reaction; Sluggish kinetics; Storage technique; Tunnel structures; Iridium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981710042

Its derivatives, MMO@Co3O4, spinelle@C and LDH@CoS with hierarchical structures were obtained by the subsequent oxidation, carbonization and sulfurization of LDH@ZIF-67, respectively, which exhibit distinct specific capacitances of 692, 781 and 1205 F g-1 at a discharge current density of 1 A g-1. Interestingly, these derivatives retained hierarchical structures with large surface area, which ensures that the majority of exposed active species can participate in the charge-discharge process and thus effectively contribute to total capacitances. The synergistic effect from fast electronic transfer reduces reversible ion accumulation at the interface, which imparts LDH@ZIF-67 derivatives improved electrochemical activities, in contrast to conventional bulk MOF derivatives. In addition, it was found that the combination of the remarkable electrical conductivity of sulfides (compared with their oxide counterparts) and the strong electronic coupling between LDH and CoS can facilitate fast electron transfer. As a result, LDH@CoS exhibits an excellent specific energy of 44.5 W h kg-1 at a current density of 20 A g-1, as well as good capacitance retention of 88.5% after 2000 cycles.

H and Pt on TiZn adsorption energies were calculated taking into account high symmetry adsorption sites. Both the adatoms prefer to be adsorbed on the hollow site where the higher coordination number allows them to minimize the repulsion among the overlapping charge densities of them and the surface. Furthermore, the influence of pre-adsorbed Pt on the H adsorption was analyzed in detail. It was found that this process is enhanced in Pt doped TiZn surface. The electronic structures and changes in the chemical bonding for both the adsorbates on the Ti alloy surface were computed by density of states (DOS) and overlap population (OP) methods, concluding that 3dx2-y2, 3dz2 and 3pz Ti, 5pz Pt orbitals play an important role in H adsorption, as well as it was deduced that the strong overlap between Pt and Ti orbitals allows H atoms to bond more effectively on the surface.

The effect of the addition of the polar component compatibilizer (HDPE-g-MAH) and PA11 on the dielectric properties of the HDPE/MWCNT composites was systematically studied. Through the addition of the polar phase (PA11) into the HDPE/MWCNT composites as the dispersed phase, with MWCNTs selectively localized in it, the dielectric properties were improved. Subsequently, as the compatibilizer (HDPE-g-MAH) was added into the HDPE/PA11/MWCNT composites, the interface between HDPE and PA11 became indistinct and PA11 in the form of dispersed phase coated MWCNTs could generate some degree of combination, to cause the size of the dispersed phase to get larger. Therefore, the dielectric constant of HDPE/PA11/MWCNT composites containing compatibilizer was up to 4000 at 3 wt% MWCNT and 103 Hz, which was attributed to the selective localization of MWCNTs to reduce the distance between the MWCNTs and the formation of larger sized microcapacitors (PA11 coated MWCNTs), and dielectric loss was still maintained at a low value (∼2 at 103 Hz), which was due to the stronger interfacial interaction between HDPE and PA11.

This paper analyses the use of residential lead–acid energy storage coupled with photovoltaics and its possible interaction with the grid for different limits of feed-in power without any support policies. In the literature, these subjects are often treated independently and for very specific, non-optimised cases, thus motivating further research. Results show that reaching self-sufficiency values up to 40% is possible, close to grid parity values, and only with photovoltaics. Beyond 40%, energy storage must be used, strongly raising the cost of the electricity consumed and therefore the need for support policies for widespread adoption. Also, peak power consumption from the grid remains constant and load variability rises, suggesting that an increase in self-sufficiency would be accompanied by lower utilisation factors of power plants and, consequently, higher wholesale electricity prices during no sunshine hours. Limiting feed-in power attenuates the increased load variability and only slightly affects the economic viability of such installations. These results present a novel optimisation tool for developers and should be considered in future studies of distributed photovoltaics and energy storage as well as in energy policy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy storage; Home energy storage; Lead–acid battery energy storage; Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE); Photovoltaics (PV); Self-sufficiency","Chemical contamination; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Energy storage; Acid batteries; Distributed energy storages; Levelised cost of energies; Photovoltaics; Self-sufficiency; Electric power transmission networks; cost analysis; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; fuel cell; household energy; photovoltaic system; price dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981158537

But previous attempts to overcome the poor electrical conductivity of MOFs hybrids involve a harsh high-template pyrolytic process to in situ form carbon, which suffer from extremely complex operation and inevitable carbon corrosion at high positive potentials when OER is operated. Herein, a self-assembly approach is presented to synthesize a non-precious metal-based, high active and strong durable Co-MOF@CNTs bifunctional catalyst for OER and ORR. CNTs not only improve the transportation of the electrons but also can sustain the harsh oxidative environment of OER without carbon corrosion. Meanwhile, the unique 3D hierarchical structure offers a large surface area and stable anchoring sites for active centers and CNTs, which enables the superior durability of hybrid. Moreover, a synergistic catalysis of Co(II), organic ligands and CNTs will enhance the bifunctional electrocatalytic performance. Impressively, the hybrid exhibits comparable OER and ORR catalytic activity to RuO2 and 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts and superior stability. This facile and versatile strategy to fabricating MOF-based hybrids may be extended to other electrode materials for fuel cell and water splitting applications. © 2016","3D hierarchical structure; Bifunctional catalysts; Corrosion-resistant; Metal organic frameworks; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes","Carbon nanotubes; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Corrosion; Corrosion resistance; Crystalline materials; Electrolytic reduction; Energy conversion; Fuel cells; Java programming language; Metals; Nanotubes; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Oxygen; Self assembly; Yarn; Bi-functional catalysts; Bifunctional oxygen catalysts; Corrosion-resistant; Electrocatalytic performance; Electrochemical energy conversions; Hierarchical structures; Metal organic framework; Oxygen reduction reaction; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979955142

However, the rapid capacity fading and poor rate performance are the main obstacles for practical application and still remain a large challenge. In this work, microalgae (Nannochloropsis) served as a biological template and carbon source to synthesize Si-O-C microspheres with the assistance of supercritical CO2 fluid. Compared to conventional artificial templates, microalgae is abundant, renewable and available, and can be regarded as a promising biological template. Meanwhile, supercritical CO2 fluid with high penetration, high diffusivity and high dissolving capacity can serve as a superior solvent to guarantee the efficient mass transfer and uniform dispersion of precursors.

A series of characterization techniques: SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman, XPS and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were used to verify the special nanostructure and unique composition of the as-prepared products, in which the NiMoO4 nanowires are homogenously distributed in the interconnected rGO network, and at the same time the NiMoO4 nanowires are encapsulated within the rGO sheets, further preventing the rGO nanosheets from agglomerating and restacking.

Underwater glider is a new kind of autonomous underwater vehicle. It ascends and descends between the sea surface and deep sea periodically by adjusting its net buoyancy. Thermal underwater glider can harvest ocean thermal energy through the utilization of phase change material (PCM) and convert it into mechanical energy for buoyancy-driven. In this paper, the fundamental principle of this thermal engine is unveiled. A nonlinear model for relationship between system pressure and phase change rate is established. Based on the established nonlinear model, influencing factors for system pressure and stored energy are analyzed comprehensively. Selected PCM is Hexadecane. Value range for air solubility in liquidus PCM is 0.06–0.1, and for residual air in the system is −0.02 to 0.05. The influence of these two factors on relative energy storage is similar. For typical values of air solubility 0.08 and residual air 0.005, utilization ratio of the thermal engine is less than 50%. Through experiment in the lake, the nonlinear model was verified, maximum system pressure was 12.5 MPa, and average stored energy of each cycle was 2.48 kJ. A prototype of thermal underwater glider has also been tested in the South China Sea. It had worked continuously for 29 days without any failure.

XRD and HRTEM analyses revealed pure phase of Co3O4 plates. SEM and TEM studies showed the Co3O4 materials possess hexagonal shapes with average thickness of 23 nm and edge length of 110 nm approximately. The effects of reacting NaOH concentration and initial Co2+ ion sources were investigated by a series experiments. It was found that the NaOH concentration played an important role for the formation of such novel cobalt oxide. When the NaOH concentration of the mixture was as low as 0.2 M, the morphology of final products can changed from hexagonal plates to particles. The observed better electrochemical properties of the hexagonal Co3O4 plate were attributed to the unique hexagonal plate architecture.

Herein, a facile hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of porous Ni2CO3(OH)2/functionalized graphene (NCB/FGN) composites is developed. To improve the dispersion properties of graphene, sulfonated salicylic acid serving as a functionalized composition is covalently anchored to the surface of functionalized graphene. The systematic investigation indicates that the presence of functionalized graphene plays a crucial role in establishing the porous structure of hybrid composites.

The prepared MoS2/GNS hybrid displays a typical crinkly and rippled structure with ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets uniformly grown on the surface of graphene. Additionally, the MoS2/GNS electrode exhibits superior electrochemical performance, such as high specific capacitance (320 F g-1 at 2 A g-1). The MoS2/GNS electrode holds great promise as a negative electrode for an ASC due to its high specific capacitance and wide operation window in negative potential.

Here, we report the preparation of well-ordered ultrathin film (UTF) electrodes based on layered double hydroxide nanosheets (LDH NSs) and iron porphyrin (Fe-PP) through an electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) technique, which show excellent OER performance. By virtue of the high catalytic activity of LDH NSs and good electron-transfer ability of Fe-PP, the resulting CoNi-LDH NS/Fe-PP UTF exhibits a remarkably low overpotential (264 mV) to attain an OER current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a substantially decreased Tafel slope of 37.6 mV dec-1, much superior to that of the IrO2 catalyst. Moreover, this method can be extended to the preparation of other UTFs based on LDHs and Fe-PP (e.g., CoMn-LDH NS/Fe-PP, CoFe-LDH NS/Fe-PP and ZnCo-LDH NS/Fe-PP) with significantly enhanced OER performance relative to pristine LDH NSs. To illustrate the advantage of these UTFs in practical water splitting, a prototype electrolyzer cell is also fabricated by using the (CoNi-LDH/Fe-PP)30 UTF as the anode and Pt wire as the cathode, which achieves the production of both oxygen and hydrogen by using a 1.5 V AA battery as the power source. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Catalyst activity; Cost effectiveness; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Film preparation; Nanosheets; Ultrathin films; Critical issues; Electron transfer; Layer-by-layer assemblies; Layer-by-layer techniques; Layered double hydroxide nanosheets; Oxygen evolution reaction; Renewable energy storages; Water splitting; Electrochemical oxidation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979231339

Herein we report a novel, facile route for the preparation of N-doped carbons based on direct pyrolysis of polypyrrole nanosheet precursors synthesized by confining the polymerization on the surface of NaCl crystals using FeCl3 as both the initiator and dopant. In the heating-up process of pyrolysis, a large amount of homogeneously distributed FeCl3 dopant and its derivatives gradually evolved into volatile nanoparticles which helped to generate abundant hierarchical macro- and meso-pores, resulting in honeycomb-like porous carbons with a high content of nitrogen dopants ranging from 7 to 18 at%, a large surface area, and an ORR activity superior to that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline electrolytes.

In this work, we have developed Mo2C/N-doped carbon mesoporous heteronanowires (Mo2C/N-C MHNWs) with enhanced capacitive behaviour as high-performance anode materials for LIBs. With the heterostructure, the Mo2C nanocrystallites offer short paths for Li+ diffusion, while the N-doped carbon matrix facilitates fast electron transportation and buffers the volume change of Mo2C during the discharge/charge cycles. When evaluated as anodes for LIBs, the Mo2C/N-C MHNWs exhibited high capacity and high rate capability, as well as a long-term cycle life.

In addition, the catalysts could be magnetically recovered, displayed high catalytic activity and excellent cycling stability. It is believed that the specific porous features, including high specific surface area and tailored pore size distributions, and surface defects can ensure the high activation of PMS for the catalytic oxidation of RhB. More importantly, the present synthetic method is facile, controllable and scalable, which highlights its potential in energy-storage, environmental treatment, and biology-related fields. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical activation; Magnetism; Pore size; Size distribution; Specific surface area; Surface defects; Calcination treatment; Environmental treatment; Heterogeneous catalyst; High specific surface area; Hydrothermal reaction; Large specific surface areas; Narrow pore size distributions; Recoverable catalysts; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978488498

This mechanism has not been considered in previous studies where these kinds of systems have been proposed as good candidates to serve as hydrogen storage materials. The reactivity of molecular hydrogen (H2) on three representative lithium edge-decorated carbon systems (on the clusters C5Li7+ (1) and C6Li6 (2), and on lithium edge-decorated zig-zag graphene nanoribbon (GNR-Li) (3)) have been studied using ab initio calculations based on the density functional theory with dispersion-corrected van der Waals exchange correlation functional. Our calculations show, on the one hand, that heterolytic hydrogen dissociation can precede with relatively low reaction barriers (0.60, 0.45 and 0.56 eV for systems 1, 2 and 3, respectively) along the minimum energy path and, on the other hand, that chemisorption energies are highly stabilizing (in the range of 1.15-1.54 eV). It is important to note that the highest activation barrier is found for the unique system, characterized as global minimum, on its corresponding potential energy surface (PES), which is system 1. These findings suggest that reversibility of the hydrogen absorption/desorption reactions, required in promising hydrogen storage materials, does not apply in these systems. © Copyright 2016, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The prepared PGE consists of a plasticized polymer blend of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polycarbonate that serves as a framework to immobilize phase separated interconnected liquid rich regions of ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC). Portions of these liquids that remain dissolved in the polymer blend act as plasticizers while interconnected liquid regions provide an all-liquid conductive pathway. A loosely bonded sodium salt, sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4), was added to the PGE to decrease the crystallinity of the polymer blend, thus lowering energy barriers for ion transfer in the blend and providing more charge carriers in the liquid rich phases to enhance the overall ionic conductivity of the PGE. Peak ionic conductivity of 5.67 × 10-4 S cm-1 was observed from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements of a PGE with 25 wt% NaBF4 which is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the same PGE without NaBF4 that demonstrates a conductivity of 1.03 × 10-6 S cm-1. The temperature dependence of ionic conductivity agrees with the Arrhenius equation from 20 °C to 90 °C. The activation energies for PGEs with different concentrations of NaBF4: 5 wt%, 15 wt% and 25 wt% are found to be 0.13, 0.17 and 0.28 eV respectively. Cyclic voltammetry confirmed that the PGEs are electrochemically stable over a wide potential range of -5 V to +5 V. In addition, transference number measurements, whose values varied from 0.83 to 0.93, demonstrate that these PGEs are ionic conductive electrolytes.

The CoMoS4 nanoparticles are successfully synthesized via a facile chemical co-precipitation process followed by calcining at 200 °C. The as-prepared CoMoS4 is firstly studied systematically as an electrode material for supercapacitors.

Herein, we present a facile and scalable strategy where two ultrathin mesoporous NiCoO2 sheets (∼2 nm) are anchored on both sides of a rGO sheet to form an ultrathin sandwich nanosheet (∼6 nm) using a chemical co-precipitation method. The sandwich nanosheets are randomly wrinkled, thus the framework built up by such sheets is porous and has a high specific surface area. The high quality rGO endows the composite with excellent conductivity. And the firm adhesion between the NiCoO2 sheet and flexible rGO also guarantees the integration of the electrode during electrochemical cycling.

Chem., 6, 727 (2014)]. The surface of B40 fullerene contains 4 heptagonal rings and 2 hexagonal rings, which may facilitate metal atom adsorption. Based on (van der Waals corrected) density functional theory, we show that alkali metal (AM) adsorbed on B40 can serve as a promising candidate not only for hydrogen storage, but also for hydrogen detection. The binding energy of AM atoms on B40 strengthens, due to the energetically favorable B 2p-AM p orbital hybridization. Thus, AM atoms are not likely to form clusters on B40, indicating a good reversible hydrogen storage. The (AM)6B40 can reach a gravimetric capacity of ∼8 wt% hydrogen with an optimal adsorption energy that is intermediate between the physisorbed and chemisorbed state. Interestingly, the number of adsorbed H2 molecules per AM atom depends on the position of the AM atoms adsorbed on the B40 surface. Furthermore, the optical absorption spectra of (AM)6B40 before and after hydrogen molecule adsorption are computed and a clear red (blue) shift is observed. These results can serve as a guide in the design of promising hydrogen storage materials and optical sensors based on the B40 fullerene.

However, their poor volumetric performances come from low packing density and/or high pore volume resulting in poor volumetric capacitance, which would limit their further applications. Here, a novel and one-step molten salt synthesis of a three-dimensional, densely nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) material by using low-cost and eco-friendly tofu as the nitrogen-containing carbon source is proposed.

As the electrode material for a supercapacitor, the NPC electrode shows both ultra-high specific volumetric and gravimetric capacitances of 360 F cm-3 and 418 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 (based on a three-electrode system), respectively, and excellent cycling stability without capacitance loss after 10 000 cycles at a high charge current of 10 A g-1 in KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the as-assembled symmetric supercapacitor exhibits not only an excellent cycling stability with 97% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles, but also a high volumetric energy density up to 27.68 W h L-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1, making this new method highly promising for compact energy storage devices with simultaneous high volumetric/gravimetric energy and power densities. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Doping (additives); Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Fused salts; Molten materials; Nitrogen; Porous materials; Electrical double layer capacitor; Gravimetric capacitance; Hierarchically porous carbons; Nitrogen-containing carbons; Porous carbon materials; Three electrode-system; Volumetric capacitance; Volumetric energy densities; Electrolytic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976384317

A suitable anode material is quite crucial for successful development of AM ion batteries. Using first-principles calculations, we propose that a two-dimensional (2D) group-IV monochalcogenide, germanium sulfide nanosheet (GSNS), can serve as high-performance anodes for the AM (AM = Li, Na, and K) ion batteries. The interaction between AM atoms and GSNS is strong enough to prevent the clustering of the intercalated AM atoms that may occur in other 2D materials. The low energy barriers for the diffusion of AM atoms on GSNS, 0.236 (Li), 0.090 (Na) and 0.050 eV (K), suggest the high charge/discharge rate of the GSNS anodes. Low average electrode potentials and a high AM storage capacity up to 512 mA h g-1 (for Na) can be achieved in the AM/GSNS systems.

However, it has proved difficult to achieve competitive figures of merit for sodium-ion batteries due to the lack of a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism(s). Herein, we report a sodium electrochemical conversion reaction with Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated on carbon nanotubes (Co3O4/CNTs) utilizing in situ TEM, down to the atomic-scale. We observe synergetic effects of the two nanoscale components, which provide insights into a new sodiation mechanism, facilitated by Na-diffusion along a CNT backbone and CNT-Co3O4 interfaces. A thin layer of amorphous low conductivity Na2O forms on the CNT surfaces at the beginning of sodiation. The conversion reaction results in the formation of ultrafine metallic Co nanoparticles and polycrystalline Na2O, and fast diffusion of the reaction products which might be due to the quick migration of Na2O under an electron beam. In the desodiation process, the dissociation of Na2O and formation of Co3O4 due to the de-conversion reaction are observed. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Amorphous materials; Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Electric batteries; Ions; Metal ions; Nanoparticles; Nanotubes; Yarn; Cobalt oxide nanoparticles; Conductive carbon nanotubes; Conversion reactions; Economic considerations; Electrochemical conversion; Figures of merits; Reaction mechanism; Sodium ion batteries; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973320183

Owing to their excellent ionic conductivity and stability with metallic lithium anodes, nanostructured lithium thiophosphate solid electrolytes such as β-Li3PS4 have found use in the fabrication of all-solid lithium batteries for large-scale energy storage systems. However, current methods for preparing air-sensitive solid electrolyte membranes of lithium thiophosphates can only generate thick membranes that compromise the battery's gravimetric/volumetric energy density and thus its rate performance. To overcome this limitation, the solid electrolyte's thickness needs to be effectively decreased to achieve ideal energy density and enhanced rate performance. Herein, we show that the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) technique produces ultrathin membranes of a lithium thiophosphate solid electrolyte with controllable thicknesses between 8 and 50 μm while maintaining the high ionic conductivity of β-Li3PS4 and stability with metallic lithium anodes up to 5 V.

To this end, low-cost γ-FeOOH is firstly electrodeposited on carbon cloth, and its pseudocapacitive behavior in a typical IL is investigated through an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) for the first time.

By taking advantage of the prominent pseudocapacitance of γ-FeOOH, as well as excellent characteristics of IL gel electrolytes (thermostability, non-flammability, chemical inertness and wide potential), an advanced high-temperature f-SSC is fabricated by using γ-FeOOH as the anode and porous N-doped activated carbon as the cathode. The f-SSC exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance at elevated temperatures, and can achieve a maximum volumetric energy density of 1.44 mW h cm-3 (based on the whole device volume) at 200 °C.

The H-OH-LDH electrode shows a well-defined hierarchical structure with a greatly increased accessible interlaminar surface area, leading to improved electrochemical energy storage ability. Most significantly, the interlayer space of H-OH-LDH acts as an electrolyte micro-reservoir to store OH- ions, which dramatically decreases the diffusion resistance of OH- to the inner surface of LDH lamella, and consequently results in an ultrahigh-rate-capability (capacitance reservation of 66% when the current density increases from 1 to 100 A g-1). The remarkable rate capability is superior to that of ever-reported transition metal oxide/hydroxide-based electrodes. In addition, an all-solid-state hybrid capacitor device was fabricated based on this H-OH-LDH electrode, exhibiting outstanding energy and power output (35.5 W h kg-1 at 27.3 kW kg-1) as well as excellent cycling stability. Therefore, this work demonstrates a new approach for the design and fabrication of LDH-based materials with self-generated electrolyte reservoirs, which have promising potential application in energy storage/conversion systems. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Capacitors; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Metals; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Cycling stability; Diffusion resistance; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrolyte reservoirs; Hierarchical structures; Interlayer spaces; Layered double hydroxides; Transition-metal oxides; Electrolytic capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973117965

In this manuscript, we report the first synthesis of poly(methyl methacrylate-methallyl alcohol) (P(MMA-MAA)) copolymers via an indirect polymerization process involving the partial hydrogenation of PMMA. The copolymers with varied monomer molar ratios have been carefully characterized with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The introduction of -OH groups leads to the formation of H-bonds among -OH and ester groups, which is responsible for the enhanced glass transition temperature and Young's modulus. As a result, the permittivity of P(MMA-MAA) is increased at low MAA content and reduced quickly as more MAA introduced. The breakdown strength (Eb) of P(MMA-MAA)s is improved significantly from about 400 MV m-1 of PMMA to over 550 MV m-1 of P(MMA-MAA) bearing 19 mol% MAA units. The highest discharged energy density (Ue) is observed as 13 J cm-3 at 550 MV m-1 electric field which is 2-3 times larger than BOPP and 50% higher than that of PMMA. Most interestingly, energy loss (Ul) is well maintained at about 8%@550 MV m-1, which is rather close to biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP). The promising energy storage capability and excellent energy discharging efficiency of the P(MMA-MAA) copolymer could finally meet the desperate need in high pulse energy storage capacitors. Constructing strong H-bonds in glassy dipolar polymers might offer a great option for designing and fabricating polymeric dielectrics with high Ue and low Ul. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Capacitors; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Elastic moduli; Electric fields; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Esters; Glass; Glass transition; Hydrogenation; Monomers; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Polypropylenes; Thermogravimetric analysis; Bi-axially oriented polypropylenes; Discharged energy densities; Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA); Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); Partial hydrogenation; Polymeric dielectrics; Polymerization process; Thermogravimetry analysis; Acrylic monomers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971668142

The possible mechanism of formation of RuO2@Co3O4 HNFs is presented. The synergy between RuO2 and Co3O4 and the unique feature of heterostructure allow the composite to exhibit a high reversible capacity of 1103.6 F g-1 at a current density of 10 A g-1 and a high-rate capability of 500.0 F g-1 at a current density of 100 A g-1.

In the meantime, novel polyethylene glycol (PEG)@network polymer shape-stabilized phase change materials (ssPCMs) were prepared by introducing PEG into the network polymers. The structure and morphology of the network polymers and the ssPCMs were systematically studied by SEM, FT-IR, solid-state 13C NMR, XRD and TGA. The experimental results showed that the network polymers with similar C-O-C functional groups to PEG exhibited good interface combination with PEG-6000 in ssPCMs. A comparison of NP-A and NP-B indicated that a smaller interstitial space induced much stronger interactions, which could promote the adsorption capacity of PEG in network polymers. With high free porosities and large enough interstitial space, the micron-network polymers exhibited good adsorption capacity for PEG (up to 85 wt%) without leakage even above its melting point.

Glucose and graphene oxide (GO) both possess abundant oxygenated functional groups, and their strong synergetic effects help to restrict the growth of Ni3S2 to form a nanoslice structure. Meanwhile, the redundant glucose can be transformed into a thin carbon layer coating on the surface of the Ni3S2 slices through the subsequent thermal treatment. When evaluated as the anode of a lithium ion battery (LIB), the synthesized Ni3S2@C-RGO nanocomposite showed an initial capacity of 608.4 mA h g-1, a specific discharge capacity of 560 mA h g-1 remained after the 100th cycle, and improved rate capability, which is much better than that of the Ni3S2 and Ni3S2-RGO nanostructures. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to the synergetic effects between Ni3S2 nanoslices and the 2D C-RGO nanostructures, such as increasing conductivity, shortening Li+ ion diffusion path, and accommodating huge volume changes through the cycles. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Carbon; Electric discharges; Energy conversion; Glucose; Graphene; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanocomposites; Nanostructures; Virtual storage; Carbon-layer coatings; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical performance; Energy conversion and storages; Heating treatments; Reduced graphene oxides; Specific discharge capacity; Structural instability; Nickel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970965927

Directly synthesizing oxide nanowires on conductive substrates and assembling them into 3D self-supporting spatial architectures are of great importance for improving their performances. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a top-down and bottom-up combined manufacturing strategy, which can facilely fabricate various 3D self-supporting macro-micronano-nanowire multiscale architectures directly on bulk metal substrates. By employing micro-nano precursor structures, the gap between the commonly micrometer scale top-down and nanometer scale bottom-up approaches is bridged seamlessly. The presented strategy combines the advantages of the ultrafast laser direct writing approach in creating versatile micro patterns with those of the oxidation growth approach in creating elaborate nanowires. Both the precursor structures and the nanowires can be flexibly tuned in order to achieve arbitrary desired 3D architectures. Successfully pairing the scalable top-down laser direct writing technique with the high throughput bottom-up oxidation growth technique greatly improves the potential of our strategy in mass production and widespread adoption.

However, side reactions are inevitable when the carbon materials are exposed to the Li2O2 product and the organic electrolytes, leading to degradation in their cycling performances.

Sodium vanadium fluorophosphates have been studied extensively recently due to their high storage capacity and high discharge voltage. Shape and size often have a crucial influence over the properties. The controlling synthesis of nanoparticles with special microstructures is significant, which becomes a challenging issue and has drawn considerable attention. In this study, Na3(VPO4)2F3 nanoflowers have been synthesized via a pH-regulative low-temperature (120 °C) hydro-thermal route. In particular, it is a green route without any organic compounds involved. The hydro-thermal reaction time for the formation of Na3(VPO4)2F3 nanoflowers has also been investigated. A weak acid environment (pH = 2.60) with the possible presence of hydrogen fluoride molecules is necessary for the formation of the desired nanoflower microstructures. Compared to the nanoparticles obtained by Na2HPO4·12H2O, the as-synthesized Na3(VPO4)2F3 nanoflowers showed an excellent Na-storage performance in terms of superior cycle stability, even without any further carbon coating or high-temperature treatment. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Microstructure; Nanoflowers; Nanoparticles; Temperature; Cycling stability; Discharge voltages; Fluoro-phosphates; High temperature treatments; Hydrogen fluoride molecules; Low temperatures; Storage performance; Thermal reactions; Synthesis (chemical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969980681

The designed porphyrin-based COF (Por-COF), featuring a relatively large pore volume and narrow pore size distribution, has been employed as a host material for sulfur storage in Li-S batteries. With a 55% sulfur loading in the composite, the thus-prepared cathode delivers a capacity of 633 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.5C charge/discharge rates. Therefore, embedding sulfur in the nanopores of the Por-COF significantly improves the performance of the sulfur cathode.

As a traditional pseudocapacitive material, WO3 possesses high theoretical capacitance and good conductivity among various transition metal oxides. Herein, a nanoflower-like WO3 (NFL-WO3) electrode with perfect electrochemical performance is synthesized through a facile and effective electrodeposition method. The NFL-WO3 electrode after optimization exhibits a very high areal specific capacitance (Ca) of 658 mF cm-2, which is the highest one in pure WO3 materials to the best of our knowledge and a large gravimetric specific capacitance (Cg) of 196 F g-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1. Our result demonstrates the excellent balance between Ca and Cg compared with other reported WO3 based materials. After experiencing 5000 cycles, 85% of its capacitance can still be retained. Based on the full analysis of cyclic voltammetry curves and Nyquist plots, the pseudocapacitance should be the dominate contribution to the total capacitance. In addition, it can be assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor for powering small electronics (light-emitting diode sets and mobile phone).

Here a rigorous numerical model is developed to predict the capacity retention of Li/S batteries discharged at different rates by taking into account the polysulfide (PS) shuttling effect for various nanostructured cathodes. In a numerical model, capacity fading of the cell is considered to be affected by the concentration of sulfur dissolved into the electrolyte and deposited on the anode as a Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer. Our approach considers SEI layer formation as the main factor that dominates capacity fading over initial cycles (50 cycles). Equivalent Porosity (EP) is determined for various nanostructures and the model asset structures with smaller EP result in smoother capacity fading over cycling performance. The mean value of percentage error between simulation results and experimental capacity in all analyzed structures is less than 5%, except for mesoporous carbon at high discharge rates (1C).

The physicochemical properties of these MoS2/CNS layered materials have been investigated using surface area analysis (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and advanced electrochemistry, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation (GCPL), long-hour voltage-holding tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The two different MoS2/CNS layered materials exhibit unique differences in morphology, surface area, and structural parameters, which have been correlated with their electrochemical capacitive properties. The flower-like morphology (f-MoS2/CNS) shows lattice expansion (XRD), large surface area (BET analysis), and small-sized nanostructures (corroborated by the larger FWHM of the Raman and XRD data). In contrast to the f-MoS2/CNS, the spherical morphology (s-MoS2/CNS) shows lattice contraction and small surface area with relatively large-sized nanostructures. The presence of CNS on the MoS2 structure leads to slight softening of the characteristic Raman bands (E12g and A1g modes) with larger FWHM. MoS2 and its CNS-based composites have been tested in symmetric electrochemical capacitors in an aqueous 1 M Na2SO4 solution. CNS improves the conductivity of the MoS2 and synergistically enhances the electrochemical capacitive properties of the materials, especially the f-MoS2/CNS-based symmetric cells (most notably, in terms of capacitance retention). The f-MoS2/CNS-based pseudocapacitor shows a maximum capacitance of 231 F g-1, with high energy density 26 W h kg-1 and power density 6443 W kg-1. For the s-MoS2/CNS-based pseudocapacitor, the equivalent values are 108 F g-1, 7.4 W h kg-1 and 3700 W kg-1. The high-performance of the f-MoS2/CNS is consistent with its physicochemical properties as determined by the spectroscopy and microscopy data.

However, the low operating current density hinders its progress. Developing high activity cathode materials is an efficient way to reduce cell electrochemical polarization and improve the operating current density. Thus, it is essential to study the relationship between the activity and structure of carbon materials to optimize the performance of ZBFB. The pore parameters and phase structure of four commercialized carbon materials were investigated by an N2 sorption isotherm experiment and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The electrochemical property of the four carbon materials was systematically studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the kinetic parameters and diffusion coefficients were calculated. The results indicate that specific surface area, pore size distribution and electrical conductivity are the main factors affecting the electrochemical activity of carbon materials. The carbon material with high surface area, suitable pore size distribution and excellent electrical conductivity shows high activity to the Br2/Br- redox couple in ZBFB.

However, improving the overall efficiency of water splitting is a challenging issue. Here, we designed Co-Fe nanoparticle coupled nitrogen-enriched porous carbon (CoyFe10-yOx/NPC) nanosheets as highly efficient non-precious-metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nitrogen-enriched porous carbon (NPC) nanosheets were prepared using a Schiff-base network (SNW) as the precursor and the SNW was based on commercially available and inexpensive monomers which were terephthalaldehyde and melamine. The resulting SNW possessed a high nitrogen content, a high surface area and a high density of metal-coordination sites. In addition, when used as the catalyst for the OER, the Co-Fe nanoparticle catalyst containing 30% Co (Co3Fe7Ox/NPC) showed the highest activity, requiring 328 mV over-potential to achieve a stable current density of 10 mA cm-2 for at least 15 h and a small Tafel slope of 31.4 mV dec-1 in 1.0 M KOH solution, which were comparable even superior to those of many other non-noble metal catalysts. Consequently, the high efficiency and durability make these supported amorphous Co-Fe nanoparticles potentially applicable for improving the performance for electrolysis of water and energy storage applications.

IrO2 (Ir4+: 5d5) ranks among the most active known OER catalysts. However, it is unclear how the environment of the Ir4+ oxygen-coordination octahedra affects the OER electrocatalysis. Herein, we present the OER kinetics on a single-crystal, epitaxial SrIrO3(100)p perovskite oxide synthesized using molecular-beam epitaxy on a DyScO3(110) substrate. We find that by switching the host structure of the Ir4+ oxygen-coordination octahedra from corner- and edge-sharing rutile (IrO2) to purely corner-sharing perovskite (SrIrO3), the OER activity increases by more than an order of magnitude. We explain our finding with the correlated, semimetal electronic structure of SrIrO3; our density functional theory calculations reveal that the adsorption energetics on SrIrO3 depends sensitively on the electron-electron interaction, whereas for IrO2, it depends rather weakly. This finding suggests the importance of correlations on the OER and the design of future transition metal oxide electrocatalysts. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Catalysis; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electron-electron interactions; Electronic structure; Epitaxial growth; Metals; Molecular beam epitaxy; Molecular beams; Oxide minerals; Perovskite; Single crystals; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Adsorption energetics; Electrochemical energy storage devices; Electrochemical Generation; Host structure; Oxygen coordination; Oxygen evolution reaction; Perovskite oxides; Transition-metal oxides; Oxygen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966747102

Controlling the crystalline quality is critical for the material's physical properties on the nanoscale. We report a systematic investigation into the optimization of structural quality and yield of vanadium oxide nanotubes (VONTs) synthesized by hydrothermal treatment. Usually, interdigitation of alkyl-amine chains occurs between V2O5 lamina, a stitching process that allows scrolling of 2D crystalline sheets into nanotubes with consistently high quality. Through detailed microscopy and spectroscopy examination, we demonstrate that two amine molecules per V2O5 unit optimizes the structure, quality and yield of the VONTs, and that uniform coverage of the juxtaposed V2O5 surfaces in the interlayer spacing minimizes non-uniformities and defects. This observation is consistent for a range of primary amine lengths (hexylamine to hexadecylamine). Through statistical investigation of hundreds of VONTs under each condition, we uncover the effect of amine chain length of V2O5 2D sheet thickness, and mechanism for optimum VONT quality. Finally, we summarize non-uniformities during VONT synthesis including, bending, spiraling and twisting of the scrolled crystalline layers. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chains; Crystalline materials; D region; Energy efficiency; Metal insulator boundaries; Metals; Nanotubes; Oxides; Positive ions; Van der Waals forces; Vanadium; Yarn; Crystalline layers; Crystalline quality; Hydrothermal treatments; Interdigitations; Interlayer spacings; Stitching process; Structural qualities; Yield of vanadiums; Structural optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966376395

The microscopic structure, morphology and metal-support interaction of the Fe/BNNSs catalysts were investigated by TEM, FT-IR, 1H MAS NMR and H2-TPR. The average thickness of the N-rich BNNSs support was 4-8 nm, and the mean size of the iron nanoparticles was 25-40 nm. The CO conversion, CH4 and C5+ selectivity of typical Fe/BNNSs catalyst with 33 wt% Fe-loading were 47%, 13.7% and 48% at 270 °C, respectively. No obvious deactivation was observed even after 270 h running. The conversion, selectivity and the iron time yield (FTY) of Fe/BNNSs catalysts were highly related to the loading, dispersion of iron nanoparticles. The lower loading and better dispersion of the iron nanoparticles in Fe/BNNSs catalyst resulted in the better FTY and C5+ selectivity.

However, lead-free relaxor ceramics with the bulk form exhibit low recoverable energy storage density (Wrec &lt; 2 J cm-3) owing to low dielectric breakdown strength (DBS &lt;200 kV cm-1). Here we use a strategy (the transition liquid phase sintering) to decrease the porosity and increase DBS of lead-free relaxor ferroelectric ceramics. This is achieved by introducing ZnO into 0.8(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3-0.2Sr(Sc0.5Nb0.5)O3 (0.8KNN-0.2SSN) ceramics. A dense microstructure (a low porosity) and submicron sized grains were found for 0.8KNN-0.2SSN-x mol%ZnO ceramics, which is responsible for a large DBS (400 kV cm-1). Both a large Wrec (2.6 J cm-3) and high energy storage efficiency (73.2%) were achieved for 0.8KNN-0.2SSN-0.5 mol%ZnO ceramics.

With the increasing interest in portable and wearable electronic equipment, various flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) and flexible electrodes (FEs) have been investigated widely and constantly in recent years. Currently-developed FEs/FSCs exhibit myriad physical forms and functional features and form a complicated and extensive system. Herein, we summarize the recent results about FEs/FSCs and present this review by categories. According to different micro-structures and macroscopic patterns, the existing FEs/FSCs can be divided into three types: fiber-like FEs/FSCs; paper-like FEs/FSCs; and three-dimensional porous FEs (and corresponding FSCs). Subsequently each type of the FEs/FSCs is further sub-classified based on their construction rules, and mechanical and electrochemical properties. To our best knowledge, this is the first time such a hierarchical and detailed classification strategy has been propose.

Density functional theory yields Li binding energies and the intercalation capacity of a fixed density bundle of identical tubes. Two nanotube diameters are tested to explore the size effect on Li storage capacity. An infinite bundle model represents low surface area and a bundle with open tubes describes high surface area tuned by edges terminated in low-coordinated sites or functionalized with hydrogen. Charge and discharge curves are measured during the first 5 cycles and the chemistry of intercalation and interfacial reactions are characterized via in situ Raman spectroscopy. A significantly high capacity at the first discharge featuring Li intercalation and products from interfacial reactions evident from Raman spectroscopy is dramatically reduced at the 2nd cycle and still decreases during successive cycles. The experimentally observed irreversible capacity loss is explained by the density functional theory analyses that demonstrate a much lower capacity of the nanotube bundle compared to graphite, in agreement with the results obtained in the 2nd cycle. The excess capacity measured in the first cycle is attributed to the presence of defects and unsaturated edges and to the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Anodes; Binding energy; Carbon nanotubes; Density functional theory; Electrolytes; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanotubes; Raman spectroscopy; Solid electrolytes; Yarn; Charge and discharge; Experimental approaches; Experimental investigations; In-situ Raman spectroscopy; Intercalation capacity; Irreversible capacity loss; Single-walled carbon nanotube bundle; Solid electrolyte interphase; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962295362

Generally, vanadates exhibit more stable electrochemical performance than pristine vanadium oxides, and different vanadates also vary in the performance. However, the detailed mechanisms of the variation in the performance of vanadates and vanadium oxides are poorly explored. Here we choose and construct three typical layered vanadium-based nanowires (V2O5, KV3O8 and K0.25V2O5), and investigate the origin of the enhanced electrochemical performance of the potassium vanadates compared to V2O5, based on crystal structure analysis, electrochemical tests, ex situ ICP measurements and in situ XRD detections. We demonstrate a synergistic effect between layer surface configurations and K ions of potassium vanadate nanowires, which leads to the great improvement in electrochemical stability of K0.25V2O5. The layer surface configuration of K0.25V2O5 only consists of single-connected oxygen atoms, which provides strong interaction with the K ions. And the stabilized K ions act as ""pillars"" between interlayers to protect the layered structures from collapse in the charge/discharge process.

However, high cost and low energy density are two serious disadvantages. By integrating the advantages of Li-/Na-ion batteries and electrochemical capacitors, Li-/Na-ion capacitors have been explored recently. Al is very cheap and is the most abundant metal element on the earth. There are few reports on Al-ion capacitors due to the challenges in finding a suitable anode with large capacitance and good rate performance. Here, the feasibility of assembling an Al-ion capacitor with good electrochemical performance is demonstrated. The Al-ion capacitor is assembled by using a composite of MoO3 nanotubes coated by a conductive polypyrrole (PPy@MoO3) as an anode, which functions via a redox intercalation/deintercalation of Al3+ ions in aqueous solution. It delivers a capacitance of 693 F g-1, about 3 times higher than that of electrode materials for sodium-ion capacitors in aqueous solution.

However, most advances have been limited to half cells or lithium batteries, and with a single mode of charge storage (intercalation, conversion, or alloying etc.). The use of dual-mode charge storage with non-traditional material pairings, while maintaining the numerous benefits of nanoscale materials, could significantly improve the capacity, energy density, stability and overall battery safety considerably. Here, we demonstrate an efficient, high capacity full inverse opal Li-ion battery with excellent cycle life, where both the cathode and anode binder-free electrodes are composed of 3D nanocrystal assemblies as inverse opal (IO) structures of intercalation-mode V2O5 IO cathodes and conversion-mode Co3O4 IO anodes. Electrochemically charged Co3O4 IOs function as Li-ion anodes and the full V2O5/Co3O4 cell exhibits superior performance compared to lithium batteries or half cells of either IO material, with voltage window compatibility for high capacity and energy density. Through asymmetric charge-discharge tests, the V2O5 IO/Co3O4 IO full Li-ion cell can be quickly charged, and discharged both quickly and slowly without any capacity decay. We demonstrate that issues due to the decomposition of the electrolyte with increased cycling can be overcome by complete electrolyte infiltration to remove capacity fading from long term cycling at high capacity and rate. Lastly, we show that the V2O5 IO/Co3O4 IO full Li-ion cells cycled in 2 and 3-electrode flooded cells maintain 150 mA h g-1 and remarkably, show no capacity fade at any stage during cycling for at least 175 cycles. The realization of an all-3D structured anode and cathode geometry with new mutually co-operative dual-mode charge storage mechanisms and efficient electrolyte penetration to the nanocrystalline network of material provides a testbed for advancing high rate, high capacity, stable Li-ion batteries using a wide range of materials pairings. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anodes; Cathodes; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Ions; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Nanocrystalline materials; Nanocrystals; Porous materials; Secondary batteries; Storage (materials); Capacity retention; Cathode and anode; Charge discharge tests; Electrolyte penetration; High rate capability; Material stability; Nano-scale materials; Nanocrystal assemblies; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961150367

When the field is applied in the C ← N direction, Ea decreases with the field strength. The Ea may vanish when the field is strong enough. The applied field perpendicular to the C-N bond has little effect on Ea.

UV-Vis absorption spectra revealed that the absorption coefficients in the region from 350 nm to 600 nm were distinctly enhanced by incorporation of perylene tetracarboxylic derivatives into the BODIPY block. Due to the photo-induced electron transfer effect, the fluorescence of the dyads was strongly quenched. Differential pulse voltammograms (DPV) were involved to evaluate the energy levels of the dyads. The oxidation peaks are almost exactly the same located at 0.53 eV vs. Ag/AgCl, and the reduction peaks occurred at -1.1 eV, -1.0 eV and -0.5 eV, shifted toward positive potential values, for OMePTAC-BODIPY, PTAC-BODIPY and PBI-BODIPY respectively, indicating that the LUMO levels of dimethylaminostyryl BODIPY-perylene tetracarboxylic derivatives dyads are precisely designed by variating acceptor units from BODIPYs meso-position. Singlet oxygen (1O2) experiments uncovered that 1O2 is much impeded along with the increase of the electron affinity of the electron acceptor units. The rates for the charge separation (kCS) and charge recombination (kCR) were deduced by the Marcus equation, for OMePTAC-BODIPY and PTAC-BODIPY, the kCS (1011 s-1) are approximately three orders of magnitude faster than kCR (108 s-1), which will be beneficial to the photoelectric conversion and energy storage process. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Electron transitions; Photoelectricity; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Absorption co-efficient; Charge recombinations; Differential pulse voltammograms; Perylene tetracarboxylic; Photo-induced electron transfer; Photoelectric conversion; Three orders of magnitude; UV-VIS absorption spectra; Electron affinity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960076140

Herein, a facile and scalable method is developed to prepare a two-dimensional earth-abundant jarosite-KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6/rGO hybrid via a solution-phase oxidation process at elevated temperature. In this synthesis, single-layer graphene sheets serve as both structure-directing agents and growth platforms to directly grow monocrystalline KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 nanoplates with unique hexagonal shapes, forming a KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6/rGO hybrid. As a cathode for lithium batteries, the hybrid structure exhibits a high reversible capacity of 120.5 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a specific current of 2C and thus retains 88% of the maximum capacity. The monocrystalline jarosite-KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6-nanoplates/rGO hybrid exhibits a discharge capacity of 143.6, 113.9, 98.2, 83.9 and 65.9 mA h g-1 at 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20C, respectively, and retains a specific capacity of 134.4 mA h g-1 when the specific current returns from 20C to 1C, displaying an excellent rate capability. At a high rate of 10C, the jarosite-KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6/rGO composites maintained 70.7 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles with a capacity retention of 78.2%, indicating remarkable cycling stability even at a high rate. Compared with KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 particles, the KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6/rGO nanocomposites exhibit remarkably prolonged cycling life and improved rate capability. Therefore, the earth-abundant jarosite-KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6/rGO hybrid demonstrates great potential for application as a high-performance cathode material in new-generation lithium-ion rechargeable batteries. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Cathodes; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Graphene; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Nanostructures; Scalability; Secondary batteries; Elevated temperature; High energy densities; High reversible capacities; Lithium ion rechargeable batteries; Lithium-ion battery cathodes; Solution-phase oxidation; Structure directing agents; Sustainability issues; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959576520

When subjected to tensile strain, the elongation at breaking of these SEBS-based AAEMs was up to 500%, a value 80 times greater than that of an AAEM using polystyrene as the main chain. Remarkably, the ion exchange capacity (IEC), conductivity, dimensions and mechanical properties of this AAEM could remain almost unchanged in 2.5 M KOH at 60°C for about 3000 h, indicating the excellent alkaline stability of the PEG-grafted SEBS-based AAEMs. As confirmed by TEM, the grafting of PEG could enlarge the size of the ion-conducting channels, significantly enhancing the conductivity of these AAEMs (80°C, from 29.2 mS cm-1 to 51.9 mS cm-1). Furthermore, the peak power density of an H2/O2 single fuel cell using this SEBS-based AAEM was up to 146 mW cm-2 at 50°C.

The poor interfacial conductance is one of the key limitations in enabling all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. However, the origin of this poor conductance has not been understood, and there is limited knowledge about the solid electrolyte-electrode interfaces in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. In this study, we performed first principles calculations to evaluate the thermodynamics of the interfaces between solid electrolyte and electrode materials and to identify the chemical and electrochemical stabilities of these interfaces. Our computation results reveal that many solid electrolyte-electrode interfaces have limited chemical and electrochemical stability, and that the formation of interphase layers is thermodynamically favorable at these interfaces. These formed interphase layers with different properties significantly affect the electrochemical performance of all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. The mechanisms of applying interfacial coating layers to stabilize the interface and to reduce interfacial resistance are illustrated by our computation. This study demonstrates a computational scheme to evaluate the chemical and electrochemical stability of heterogeneous solid interfaces.

Solar fuels have already been recognized as a promising method towards this goal and have attracted tremendous research interest recently. Alternatively, this goal can also be achieved by using the solar-powered electrochemical energy storage (SPEES) strategy, which integrates a photoelectrochemical cell and an electrochemical cell into a single device. The integrated device is able to harvest solar energy and store it in situ within the device via a photocharging process and also distribute the energy as electric power when needed. This essay reviews the past SPEES research and analyzes its future prospects with a special emphasis on chemical design and material choices.

Members of the CuNb1-xTaxO3 (0 &lt; x ≤ 0.25) solid solution have been synthesized via high temperature solid-state methods. The structure of CuNbO3 was found to be Cu-deficient Cu0.965NbO3 after heating in air at 250 °C for 3 hours, i.e., under similar conditions as those used to prepare it as a polycrystalline film. Powder X-ray diffraction techniques confirmed the purity of each composition up to x ≤ 0.25 and the lattice parameters were refined as the molar ratio of Nb(v) and Ta(v) was varied (a = 9.499 to 9.506 Å, b = 8.439 to 8.451 Å, c = 6.768 to 6.781 Å and β = 90.847 to 90.694°). An increase in the amount of Ta(v) yielded a small blue shift of the bandgap size from ∼1.89 eV to ∼1.97 eV for CuNb1-xTaxO3 from x = 0 to 0.25. Polycrystalline films of each member of the CuNb1-xTaxO3 solid solutions produced relatively comparable p-type photocurrents of up to -0.5 mA cm-2, while the stability of the cathodic photocurrent also remained similar with increasing Ta(v) content. Mott-Schottky analysis of CuNb1-xTaxO3 showed that the conduction band edge of -1.5 (vs. SHE) provides a sufficient overpotential (∼800 mV) to drive the reduction of water to hydrogen gas at the surface. The capability of the solid solutions to drive hydrogen production was confirmed through suspended particle photocatalysis. Further characterization of the CuNb0.91Ta0.09O3 composition included scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analyses. These data show that Cu(i) is oxidized to Cu(ii) as CuNb1-xTaxO3 is heated in air. Thus, the formation of Cu(ii) rich regions at the surface, together with the Ta(v) content, are found to play important roles in the stability and magnitude of the cathodic photocurrents produced under visible-light irradiation. Importantly, these results demonstrate that solid solution compositions can be used in films for solar energy conversion, notwithstanding their inherent atomic disorder. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Copper; Digital storage; Electrochemistry; Energy conversion; Energy gap; Hydrogen production; Niobium oxide; Oxide semiconductors; Photocurrents; Scanning electron microscopy; Solar energy; Solid solutions; Structure (composition); Tantalum oxides; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Cathodic photocurrent; Chemical compositions; High temperature solid state methods; Mott-Schottky analysis; Photoelectrochemical properties; Powder X ray diffraction; Solid solution composition; Visible-light irradiation; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959018211

The characteristics of the raw materials were determined by chemical and physical analysis. The co-pelletization process was studied by quantifying the energy consumption of compaction and extrusion processes. The physical properties of the pellets, including moisture adsorption, pellet energy density and hardness, were also determined. The blending of biomass with oil cake would increase the density of the pellets, and thus reduce their costs during production, transport and storage. The energy consumption of compaction decreased upon increasing the castor bean cake content, while the energy consumption of extrusion and the pellets' energy density showed the opposite tendency. Moreover, the maximum compression force and hardness increased with the increase in the blend ratio of CAS (castor bean cake). This thermal analysis suggests that adding CAS can enhance char combustion and can lead to greater reactivity during char combustion. 10-20% of castor bean cake by mass would be a suitable proportion in co-pelletization with biomass, in terms of energy consumption and the pellet properties. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Biomass; Blending; Chemical analysis; Combustion; Compaction; Energy utilization; Extrusion; Hardness; Thermoanalysis; Blend ratios; Char combustion; Chemical and physical analysis; Compression force; Energy density; Extrusion process; Moisture adsorption; Pellet properties; Pelletizing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958961004

In the composite, PEG served as a phase change material for thermal energy storage, and the porous carbon, which was prepared from fresh potato via freeze drying followed by heat treatment, was used as an absorbent that also acted as the supporting material. Various analytical techniques were used to investigate the chemical composition, microstructure, and thermal properties of the prepared PEG/porous carbon ss-CPCMs. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic results indicated that PEG was well absorbed and encapsulated in the porous structure of the carbon and that there was no chemical reaction between them during the phase change process. The shape and exudation stability test results indicated that the PEG/porous carbon ss-CPCMs have excellent shape stability, compared to pristine PEG. The contact angle test suggested that the melting PEG has good level of wettability on the carbon so that melting PEG could be well protected from exudation in the porous carbon by surface tension effects, even if the temperature is higher than the melting point of PEG. Differential scanning calorimetric results showed that the PEG/porous carbon ss-CPCMs have considerable phase change enthalpies and thermal storage capabilities. In addition to this, the latent heats of ss-CPCMs increased with increasing contents of PEG in the composites, and the highest value was achieved when the amount of PEG was 50%. Moreover, the thermogravimetric analysis results showed that the composites had excellent thermal stabilities. Based on the above analyses, the prepared ss-CPCM with 50% PEG content proved to be a promising candidate for thermal energy storage applications. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chemical analysis; Energy storage; Food storage; Heat storage; Polyethylene glycols; Polyethylenes; Porous materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Thermodynamic properties; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Chemical compositions; Composite phase change materials; Differential scanning calorimetric; Fourier transform infra reds; Phase change enthalpy; Phase change process; Supporting material; Surface tension effects; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958280992

However, reversible hydrogen storage capacities and sorption kinetics of Li4(NH2)3Cl and Li3Mg0.5(NH2)3Cl have not been reported yet. In the present work, Li4(NH2)3Cl was synthesized using a new synthesis route that involves the pre-milling of a LiNH2-LiCl mixture. Attempts to synthesize Li3Mg0.5(NH2)3Cl by applying similar synthesis procedures using LiNH2 and 0.5MgCl2 were unsuccessful; instead, a mixture of Li4(NH2)3Cl-0.5Mg(NH2)2 was obtained. The hydrogen storage properties of the Li4(NH2)3Cl-3LiH and Li4(NH2)3Cl-0.5Mg(NH2)2-3LiH composites were evaluated between 200 °C and 300 °C. The onset of hydrogen release was reduced by 20 °C when Li4(NH2)3Cl-3LiH decomposed in the presence of Mg(NH2)2 (180 °C with respect to 200 °C) and its hydrogen desorption rate increased by 83%. However, no change in the dehydrogenation activation energy was observed for Li4(NH2)3Cl-3LiH decomposition due to minor amounts of Mg(NH2)2. The hydrogen storage capacity under cycling was reduced from about 3.0 wt% to 1.5 wt% at 300 °C, after rehydrogenation at 6.0 MPa. The formation of Li7(NH)3Cl was clearly identified in the dehydrogenated material.

Fabrication of cost-effective and eco-friendly hierarchical porous N-doped carbons from renewable biomass resources is a sustainable route for future energy storage. However, it is still a big challenge to produce N-doped carbons with hierarchical porous structure from cellulose, which is the most abundant and widely available renewable resource on earth. Here, we designed a facile and effective strategy to produce hierarchical porous N-doped carbons from cellulose for high-performance supercapacitor and CO2 capture applications. In this method, hierarchical porous cellulose aerogels were first obtained via a dissolving-gelling process and then carbonized in NH3 atmosphere to give hierarchical porous N-doped carbon aerogels with more interconnected macropores and micropores. Due to the unique porous structure and physicochemical properties, the as-prepared N-doped carbon aerogels had a high specific capacitance of 225 F g-1 (0.5 A g-1) and an outstanding cycling stability. For the first time, we also demonstrated that this N-doped carbon aerogel exhibited a exceptional CO2 adsorption capacity of 4.99 mmol g-1, which is much higher than those of other porous carbons.

Among them, graphene oxide (GO) holds much promise for supercapacitor applications due to its high-capacitance, low-cost, etc. Nevertheless, intrinsic characteristics related to the capacitive properties of GO are far from being fully understood. Little attention has been paid to the size effect of raw graphite on the electrochemical characteristics of GO. In order to investigate the relationship between raw graphite size and the capacitive properties of GO, electrochemical performances of GO, prepared from raw graphite of three different sizes using a modified Hummer's method, were compared. Experimental results indicated that the capacitance of a GO electrode was enhanced with the increasing size of the raw graphite. The GO electrode prepared with the largest size of raw graphite achieved a specific capacitance as high as 94.4 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 due to a medium-sized specific surface area and smaller charge transfer resistance. It is concluded that more attention should be paid to the prevention of agglomeration or even restacking of the graphene-based material after the heat drying of graphene-based solutions because of residual intercalated water molecules, which contribute to strong hydrogen bonding interactions between layers. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Carbon; Charge transfer; Electrodes; Graphite; Hydrogen bonds; Molecules; Carbon based materials; Charge transfer resistance; Electrochemical characteristics; Electrochemical performance; Energy storage and conversions; Hydrogen bonding interactions; Intrinsic characteristics; Supercapacitor application; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958213502

Here, we develop three-dimensional mesoporous carbon network (3DMCN)-coated LiFePO4/Fe nanospheres (3DMCN-LFP/Fe-NSs) for tackling this problem. This new nanocomposite cathode is synthesized by using thermal conversion of natural alginate (ALG) biomass. In the heat-treated process, an ALG hydrogel with an ""egg-box"" structure was transformed into unique 3DMCN, while some of the iron ions were reduced to iron metal. The 3DMCN and Fe metal coating not only reduces the anisotropy and grain size of LiFePO4, but also enhances its electron conductivity and lithium ion diffusion coefficient. This makes this specially designed nanocomposite give a remarkable synergistic effect for both lithium storage and transfer kinetics.

But its use as a commercial material is hindered by its relatively high operating temperatures and slow release/uptake kinetics. To solve this, we first synthesized Ni decorated graphene nanoplate (Ni/Gn) catalysts with highly dispersed metal nano-particles (NPs) via a facile method, then the as-prepared Ni/Gn catalysts were introduced by using the hydriding combustion synthesis and mechanical milling (HCS + MM) method to obtain Mg-based composites. Remarkable enhancement of hydrogen sorption rates has been found for these composites in the presence of Ni/Gn additives, especially for the Mg@Ni8Gn2 sample: A hydrogen absorption amount of 6.28 wt% within 100 s at 373 K and a hydrogen desorption amount of 5.73 wt% within 1800 s at 523 K. A rather low activation energy (71.8 kJ mol-1) for the dehydrogenation of MgH2 was determined in the same sample, indicating that relatively moderate temperatures are required to absorb/desorb hydrogen.

Due to the local dipole-π interactions between indole and carbon dioxide (CO2), the uptake capacity for CO2 reaches up to 16.0 wt% (1.0 bar, 273 K), and the high (CO2/N2 = 15, CO2/CH4 = 32) selectivities of the polymer make it a promising material for potential application in gas separation. Furthermore, the hydrogen storage is up to 2.48 wt% (1.0 bar, 77 K). In comparison to the reported porous organic polymers, the preparative strategy exhibits cost-effective advantages, which are essential for scale-up preparation.

It was observed that the amplitude of Payne effect is related to the interfacial interaction characterized by the content of bound rubber. An interesting phenomenon was produced in the effect of temperature on the Payne effect for spherical silica filled rubber that the amplitude of Payne effect decreases with the temperature below 253 K but the storage modulus increases with the temperature above 253 K which performs the feature of entropic elasticity as pure rubber. The activation energy of the unstable chains can be also divided into two sections in the temperature range which is related to the critical value of immobilized rubber to influence the Payne effect. The results reveal that the number of immobilized rubber reduces with the temperature and it has a critical value to affect the Payne effect which is verified by Maier-Göritz model.

Their micro-structure, electrical properties and electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications in different neutral electrolytes (1 M NaNO3 and Ca(NO3)2 aqueous solutions) have been studied. The composite electrodes have similar pore features to original ACFF textiles, but show notably enhanced electrical and electrochemical performance. The composite textile electrodes show low electrical resistance, high specific capacitance (up to 1516 mF cm-2 in neutral electrolytes) and excellent cycling stability (no capacitance decay after 5000 charge-discharge cycles). Besides, electrochemical capacitance of composite textile electrodes in Ca(NO3)2 electrolyte is higher than that in NaNO3 electrolyte at low scan rates (1-5 mV s-1), but the situation is reversed when scan rates are higher than 10 mV s-1.

The well-dispersed MWNTs in the homogeneous matrix preferentially migrated into the SAN-rich phase after the occurrence of phase separation and then further agglomerated in the SAN-rich phase to form the conductive pathway. The effect of MWNTs on the phase separation temperatures of a PMMA/SAN blend was found to depend on the composition of the blend matrix, as a result of the composition difference between the surface layer of the MWNTs and the polymer matrix induced by the selective absorption of SAN on the surface of MWNTs. Thermal-induced dynamic percolation was observed for both the resistivity ρ and dynamic storage modulus G′ as a function of annealing time. The respective contribution of phase separation and MWNTs aggregation to the variation of G′ was also clearly distinguished during annealing. The influence of temperature and filler loading on the percolation time of ρ was investigated and the activation energies of dynamic conductive (DC) percolation were determined, independent of the volume content of MWNTs.

The porous structure and seamlessly connected graphene flakes make GF a promising electrode material for supercapacitors and batteries. However, the electrical conductivity of GF is still unsatisfactory due to the lack of macropore size (∼300 μm) control that hinders its applications. Previously we reported a new seamless 3D graphene structure - graphene pellets (GPs) - with well-controlled mesopore size (∼2 nm), high electrical conductivity (148 S cm-1) and good electromechanical properties that differ substantially from the known GF. Here we demonstrate that the obtained 3D graphene structure is an ideal scaffold electrode for pseudocapacitive materials and redox additive electrolyte systems. For example, after electrochemical coating with MnO2, the GP/MnO2 electrode showed specific and volumetric capacitance up to 395 F g-1 and 230 F cm-3 at 1 A g-1, respectively. When combined with a hydroquinone and benzoquinone redox additive electrolyte, the GPs showed a specific capacitance of 7813 F g-1 at 10 A g-1.

In this study, we prepare ultra-small, poorly crystalline FeOx nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes as the anode material for sodium-ion batteries. It exhibits excellent half-cell performances; and, when combined with a Prussian blue cathode material, it leads to iron-based full batteries.

Interestingly, it was observed that the specific surface area, surface heteroatoms content, and pore size distribution of the porous carbon were affected by the H2O2 and EDTA-2Na pre-treatment and KOH/C ratio. As the KOH/C ratio increased, the porosity development was broadened quickly and considerably under the micropore and a smaller mesopore within the range of 0.7-2.7 nm was obtained, indicating that there are no dividing walls among the variable sized pore framework and that an opened and interconnected channel texture was formed.

The dependence of crystalline, ferroelectric, dielectric and energy storage properties on both the orientation ratio and PMMA content was systematically discussed. Besides the orientation of the polymer chains in the amorphous phase together with the alignment of crystalline and ferroelectric grains, uniaxially drawing the films leads to an improvement in both the content and size of the crystalline and ferroelectric phases.

It is found that the laser induced anchoring of Au NPs onto the NS basal plane and edges resulted in enhanced light harvesting that is potentially useful for energy conversion and storage applications. To demonstrate the potential of the approach for practical applications, the incorporation of WS2-Au NP assemblies into the photoactive layer of ternary bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is realized. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the binary device consisting of a poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT)[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PC71BM) blend as the donor-acceptor pair was 5.6%, while after the employment of WS2-Au NPs the efficiency enhancement of the ternary device was approximately 13% reaching a total PCE of 6.3%. The facile, rapid and room temperature nature of the photo-induced method proposed here provides unique opportunities for the cost-effective synthesis of bulk amounts of NS-NP assemblies in solution for many optoelectronic applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Butyric acid; Cost effectiveness; Energy conversion; Gold; Gold alloys; Graphene; Heterojunctions; Irradiation; Metallic compounds; Nanoparticles; Nanosheets; Bulk heterojunction (BHJ); Energy conversion and storages; Laser-induced nucleation; Metallic nanoparticles; Optoelectronic applications; Organic photovoltaic (OPV); Power conversion efficiencies; Two dimensional nanosheets; Organic lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953426321

The paper reported the synthesis of nitrogen and sulphur-functionalized multiple graphene aerogel (N,S-MGA) through simple multiple gel method. The as-prepared N,S-MGA exhibits a much higher density and electronic conductivity compared with classical graphene aerogel. The density rapidly increases and resistance reduces with increasing number of the graphene oxide gelation. The unique architecture creates ultra fast electron transfer and electrolyte transport. The introduction of nitrogen and sulfur functional groups leads to additional pseudocapacitance. The N,S-MGA electrode provides high specific capacitance (486.8 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1), rate capability (261.8 F g-1 at the current density of 20 A g-1) and cycling stability (lost of less 4% after 3000 cycles) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The performance can be greatly improved by increasing number of the graphene oxide gelation. Interestingly, the addition of K3Fe(CN)6 into the KOH electrolyte can enhance the pseudocapacitance via directly contributing pseudocapacitance to N,S-MGA electrode and promoting the electron gain and loss of nitrogen and sulfur functional groups. The specific capacitance is 4929.4 F g-1 at the current density of 2 A g-1 in the mixed 1 M KOH with 1 M K3Fe(CN)6 electrolyte. The capacitance retention is more than 98.7% after 5000 continuous charge/discharge cycles, verifying good long-term cycling stability. The energy density reaches to 316.6 W h kg-1 at the power density of 683.7 W kg-1 and 117.6 W h kg-1 at the power density of 1020 W kg-1.

A combination of water resources model for a system of reservoirs that implements a demand-priority based linear programing algorithm and a single node power grid system model is implemented on hourly time step. This model was accompanied by a global genetic algorithm solver to determine optimum operation targets for each storage reservoir aiming at maximizing the 90th percentile power generation produced by the integration of wind and hydro over the entire simulation period.This model was applied on the reservoir storages and hydropower system in the Zambezi river basin to test if the storage reservoirs could be efficiently be used to offset wind power intermittence in South Africa subjected to the different physical and policy constraints. Based on the optimized target operation and hourly annual real data for the year 2010, the water resources system and power interconnection system were simulated together to assess the maximum firm generation of power as a result of the new wind and hydro combination target for storage hydropower plants.The result obtained indicates that high regulation of wind and hydro can be achieved as a result of combined operation and showed 45% increase in the level of wind penetration in South Africa's power system over the reference scenario.

This paper studies cost-optimal and rule-based control for buildings with PV, employing a heat pump, thermal and electrical storage and shiftable loads as flexibility sources to increase the value of PV for the prosumer. The cost-optimal control minimizes variable electricity cost employing market data on electricity price and optionally constrains grid feed-in to zero; the rule-based control aims at maximizing PV self-consumption. The flexibility strategies are combined into a simulation model to analyze different system configurations over a full year.The applicability of the new model is demonstrated with a case study with empirical data from a real low-energy house in Southern Finland. Compared to inflexible reference control with a constant price for bought electricity, cost-optimal control employing hourly market price of electricity achieved 13-25% savings in the yearly electricity bill. Moreover, 8-88% decrease in electricity fed into the grid was obtained. The exact values depend on PV capacity and the flexibility options chosen. Limiting grid feed-in to zero led to less energy efficient control. The most effective flexibility measures in this case turned out to be thermal storage with a heat pump and a battery, whereas shiftable appliances showed only a marginal effect. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand side management; Energy storage; Intelligent building; Photovoltaics; Prosumer; System control","Commerce; Costs; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Intelligent buildings; Demand side managements; Electricity production; Flexibility measures; Photovoltaics; Prosumer; Rule-based control strategies; System configurations; System control; Electric power transmission networks; control system; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy market; installation; photovoltaic system; residential energy; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944710588

In the current work, we have examined the corrosion resistance of zirconia, beryllia and magnesia ceramics at 900 °C in the Li2CO3-Li2O and Li-Na-K carbonate eutectic mixtures to identify suitable electrically insulating materials. Conclusions regarding material stability were based on elemental analysis of the melt, primarily via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, a particularly sensitive technique. It was found that magnesia is completely stable for at least 33 h in a Li2CO3-Li2O melt, while a combined lithium titanate/lithium zirconate layer forms on the zirconia ceramic as detected by XRD. Under the same melt conditions, beryllia shows considerable leaching into solution. In a Li-Na-K carbonate eutectic mixture containing 10.2 mol% oxide at 900 °C under standard atmospheric conditions, magnesia showed no signs of degradation. Stabilization of the zirconia content of the eutectic mixture at 0.01-0.02 at% after 2 h is explained by the formation of a lithium zirconate coating on the ceramic. On the basis of these results, we conclude that only magnesia can be satisfactorily used as an insulating material in electrolysis cells containing Li2CO3-Li2O melts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To improve the battery state-of-energy estimation accuracy and reliability, an online model-based estimation approach is proposed against uncertain dynamic load currents and environment temperatures. Firstly, a three-dimensional response surface open-circuit-voltage model is built up to improve the battery state-of-energy estimation accuracy, taking various temperatures into account. Secondly, a total-available-energy-capacity model that involves temperatures and discharge rates is reconstructed to improve the accuracy of the battery model. An extended-Kalman-filter and particle-filter based dual filters algorithm is then developed to establish an online model-based estimator for the battery state-of-energy. The extended-Kalman-filter is employed to update parameters of the battery model using real-time battery current and voltage at each sampling interval, while the particle-filter is applied to estimate the battery state-of-energy. Finally, the proposed approach is verified by experiments conducted on a LiFePO4 lithium-ion battery under different operating currents and temperatures.

These systems store electricity by generating a synthetic fuel in electrolysis mode and subsequently recover electricity by electrochemically oxidizing the stored fuel in fuel cell mode. System thermal management is improved by promoting methane synthesis internal to the ReSOC stack. Within this strategy, the cell-stack operating conditions are highly impactful on system performance and optimizing these parameters to suit both operating modes is critical to achieving high roundtrip efficiency. Preliminary analysis shows the thermoneutral voltage to be a useful parameter for analyzing ReSOC systems and the focus of this study is to quantitatively examine how it is affected by ReSOC operating conditions. The results reveal that the thermoneutral voltage is generally reduced by increased pressure, and reductions in temperature, fuel utilization, and hydrogen-to-carbon ratio. Based on the thermodynamic analysis, many different combinations of these operating conditions are expected to promote efficient energy storage. Pressurized systems can achieve high efficiency at higher temperature and fuel utilization, while non-pressurized systems may require lower stack temperature and suffer from reduced energy density. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, microcellular 3D graphene foams were fabricated via ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) with electroless plated nickel (Ni) foam templates. The microcellular Ni foam templates exhibit sufficient thermal stability for few layer graphene (FLG) growth in the APCVD process, yielding graphene foams with a pore size less than 100 μm, density of 0.0020 g cm-3, and pore wall thickness of about 5 nm. The 3D graphene foam has a cellular morphology with a surface-to-volume ratio of 2.5×105 m2 m-3. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
