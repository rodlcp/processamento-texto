The efficiency of passive electromagnetic and electrodynamic methods to confine the rotating rings is investigated. Confinement methods examined include repulsive image force, repulsive null flux, attractive image force, and radially stable attractive. For each method the decay time is given in terms of the ring material properties and design parameters. The repulsive techniques are shown to have decay times of less than a day when optimized within a set of practical design constraints. The two attractive levitation methods result in the largest decay times, but are inherently unstable. When null-flux stabilizers are used with attractive levitation, the decay time is shown to depend on magnetic field inhomogeneity. Finally, an inherently stable and very efficient attractive levitation method is proposed.

Materials considered for these applications included various pairs of organic or inorganic liquids with water or other solvents, supercritical gases, and molten salts and metals. Dual temperature storage is theoretically possible with systems that either undergo clathration at the lower temperature and CBS at the higher temperature or endothermic phase separation at the lower temperature (closed-loop CBSs).

In order to simulate actual storage conditions of foods packaged in PVC plastic materials, Inverse High Pressure Liquid chromatography (IHPLC) has been employed in this work at temperatures 8, 18.5, and 27 °C using distilled water as the solvent system. Concentrations of 0.34, 0.48, 0.80, 1.20 and 2.38 μg of VCM/g of unplasticized PVC resin were introduced into the HPLC column containing the PVC resin (stationary phase). The specific retention volume (V °g) of VCM was found to be highly dependent upon both concentration and temperature. V °g increased as the concentration of VCM injected decreased in accordance with the ""active site"" hypothesis. The thermodynamic parameters namely, enthalpy of sorption (ΔHs), entropy of sorption (ΔSs) and free energy of sorption (ΔGs), were all negative corresponding to a spontaneous exothermic process. The activity coefficient was much smaller then 1 indicating strong attractive forces between polymer and monomer.

Physical consequences of the phenomomenon are considered for two extreme situations - transmission through pure mobile and pure rigid media continua, respectively. The dye is treated as a linear oscillator and spectral properties are assumed to be unchanged between the media. Two problems are examined, namely signal propagation and the extraction of energy at a point in the medium for a number of configurations of pump and signal polarizations, transverse or longitudinal excitations. Signal gradients and steady-state conversion efficiencies are presented algebraically and graphically. A mobile medium has one of the steepest gradients, the largest energy storage, and one of the highest conversion efficiencies. Nevertheless, performance of a transversely excited, single-pass amplifier for the commonly used configuration where pump and signal are plane polarized and have a shared polarization axis (Configuration C) shows little difference between rigid or mobile media, according to this analysis. For a rigid Configuration C, only about 21% of the dye molecules carry most of the signal load, in contrast with a mobile medium where all molecules work equally, and such a restricted distribution undergoes rapid turnover of its excited state. Twisting of the signal plane of polarization in a dye amplifier is confirmed.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042134807

Bit densities of 108/cm2 are being achieved and improvements can be expected. This paper reviews the status and discusses the most critical issues of the technology. It is shown that the fundamental broadband signal-to-noise ratio in existing rare-earth transition-metal media is well above 20 dB and therefore adequate to maintain error rates less than 10-12. Substrate imperfections in optical media lead to error rates of 10- 5-10-6, but even these relatively high raw bit error rates are corrected to 10-13 by error correction codes and hardware being used in write-once optical disk storage systems. The stability of magnetic domains recorded into magneto-optical materials may be explained by a model involving wall energy, demagnetizing fields, applied fields and wall coercivity, and there exist materials which fulfill the requirements necessary to have recorded data remain stable against fields up to 100 Oe and temperatures from 0 to 100 °C. Of more concern is the stability of the amorphous thin films against long-term annealing. Passivation with optical dielectrics is essential, and preliminary data on some rare-earth transition-metal alloys indicate that recorded data would be stable for five years when stored at 50 °C and that the media could withstand in excess of 1010 write/erase cycles with less that 10% change in minimum stable domain size. It is concluded that magneto-optic recording technology is a promising high-density recording technology with a place in the digital storage hierarchies of the future.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038425009

In this review two main categories of enzymopathies, glycogenosis and mitochondrial disorders, are discussed. Clinically, the patients with these categories of enzyme defects present two major syndromes: (a) acute recurrent muscle impairment, generally related to exercise, associated with cramps and/or myoglobinuria; (b) progressive muscular weakness and wasting eventually associated with signs of affected organs other than skeletal muscle. Defects of glycogen breakdown and of the first step of glycolysis are more frequently associated with acute exercise intolerance, such as in myophosphorylase and phosphofructokinase deficiencies, but may be associated with progressive muscle weakness and wasting, such as in acid maltase and debrancher enzyme deficiency. Clinical heterogeneity is common in these disorders, but a biochemical explanation for their different clinical expression is still lacking. Defects of the second step of glycolysis, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase and lactate dehydrogenase deficiencies, have been discovered recently and are associated with exercise intolerance. The reason for muscle weakness and atrophy in glycogenosis is still unclear, although it has been suggested that excessive protein catabolism occurs in myophosphorylase, debrancher and acid maltase deficiencies. Myopathies due to deficiencies of mitochondrial enzymes are less well defined, as a group, than the glycogenoses. They are currently considered to fall into three main groups: (a) defects of substrate utilization, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency; (b) defects of respiratory chain complexes, such as cytochrome-c-oxidase deficiency and (c) defects of phosphorylation-respiration coupling, such as Luft's disease. Again, severe and benign exercise intolerance or progressive life-threatening myopathic syndromes may be the clinical expression of these disorders. Detailed biochemical and morphological studies of muscle biopsies are needed in these patients to obtain a definite diagnosis and prognosis, and to decide on eventual treatment. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",,"carnitine palmitoyltransferase; cytochrome c oxidase; etiology; glucan 1,4 alpha glucosidase deficiency; glycogen storage disease type 3; glycogen storage disease type 5; heredity; human; mitochondrial myopathy; muscle; phosphofructokinase deficiency; priority journal; review; Adult; Carnitine; Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase; Enzymes; Female; Glucan 1,4-alpha-Glucosidase; Glycogen Storage Disease; Glycogen Storage Disease Type III; Glycogen Storage Disease Type V; Human; Metabolic Diseases; Mitochondria, Muscle; Muscles; Muscular Diseases; Oxygen Consumption; Phosphofructokinase-1; Phosphorylation; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022373877

In our laboratory, the glucose transport activity in the subcellular fractions was assayed after reconstruction into egg lecithin liposomes. The apparent translocation of the glucose transport activity from the storage site to the plasma membrane was reversible, energy dependent, protein synthesis independent, almost completed in 5-10 min at 37°C when the hormone concentration was 1 nM, and very slow at a low temperature (for example 15°C).

The nature of the resulting flow and of the associated thermal field is discussed and related to the effect of stratification on the local buoyancy level. The decay of a given stratification with time due to diffusion and heat loss is discussed. The rise of thermal plumes and buoyant jets in a stratified environment is considered in detail.

This method has been used to investigate the behavior of h. v. d. c. converters. The state space technique demands that the space variables which describe the electric power system must be independent. A convenient choice of state variables is the electric charge of capacitors and the magnetic flux within inductors, which gives a direct correspondence between the energy storage elements of the physical system and the state variables of the mathematical model. However, this choice does not guarantee variable independence and for complex systems, variable dependence may not be apparent when assembling the equations. Equations describing electric power systems are developed. It is shown that when the network equations are organized using nodal analysis, all state variables describing electric charge are independent.",,"NODAL ANALYSIS; STATE SPACE ANALYSIS; STATE VARIABLE; ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022307891

At the same time too large a number of elements has to be avoided in view of computer time and storage requirements. Therefore an optimal mesh should be graded according to a uniform error distribution. As the error can hardly be predicted by the data, the finite element solution itself should provide some information on the magnitude and distribution of the error. These a-posteriori-estimates have been put on a reliable mathematical foundation for a class of bilinear forms by Babuska et al. in the energy norm. Computer error estimators for the magnitude and error indicators for the distribution of the error have been obtained for some one-dimensional problems and for the problem of plain strain and plane stress. In this paper the general theory of Babuska is applied to plate-problems according to Mindlin's plate theory. In contrast to Kirchoff's theory shear forces are considered. Thus, better results near corners are obtained and, furthermore, thick plates can be treated. For quadrilateral elements an error indicator is derived, which is composed of element residuals and of the jumps of bending moments and shear forces across element edges.",,"PLATES - Stresses; STRESSES - Shear; ABSTRACT ONLY; ERROR ESTIMATORS; POSTER PAPER; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022306976

Incentives to reduce peak loading of the system would be more attractive for the industrial consumer if a reliable and economically viable method was available to monitor industrial loads. The numerous applications of dynamic load information have prompted many local distribution authorities to operate energy usage recording schemes. The recorders used are usually based on a magnetic tape cartridge. This storage system has a limited reliability. As site installation information such as input variable names and scaling factors is not recorded onto the tape, correct data interpretation depends on the careful handling of tapes by the operators. The aim of this project is to produce a solid state memory based energy recorder that will overcome these difficulties. Periodic uploading of the data to a computer is required to free the recorder memory for future use and to allow analysis of the recorded data to be performed.

For each combination, a battery-life model predicts the time interval between battery replacements by deducting the fraction of total life consumed each day. An economic model then produces life-cycle system cost. Repeating this process for different combinations of array area and battery capacity identifies the minimum-cost system design.",,"DIESEL ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION; AUTONOMOUS POWER SYSTEMS; PHOTOVOLTAIC-DIESEL POWER SYSTEM; SOLAR POWER PLANTS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022289317

Since DSG installations are becoming more numerous, and since the conditions which allow the overvoltages to exist are possible in many practical DSG connections, the overvoltages must be controlled. The first step in mitigation is to understand the source of the overvoltage and the energy levels which must be controlled or dissipated. The mechanisms for producing the overvoltages are based on ferroresonance phenomenon and are not extremely sensitive to types of generators, types or connections of transformers, location of capacitors, or other equipment parameters. The overvoltage depends on the establishment of a harmonic resonant circuit utilizing transformer saturation characteristics, the existence of power factor correcting capacitors on the feeder and a source of energy sufficient to maintain transformer saturation.",,"ELECTRIC POWER FACTOR - Correction; ELECTRIC TRANSFORMERS; DISPERSED STORAGE AND GENERATION (DSG); FERRORESONANCE; HARMONIC RESONANT CIRCUIT; TRANSFORMER SATURATION; OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022281658

These materials have become practical only through diligent attention to the fundamentals of physical chemistry applicable to PCM sciences: phase equilibria, crystal nucleation and growth, crystallography, solution chemistry, and thermochemistry.

' Liquid ice is a solution of a substance such as a salt or sugar in water to form crystallization nuclei for ice formation at temperatures somewhat below 32 degree F. The mixture of ice crystals and liquid behaves like a liquid and can flow through pipes. It can, therefore, be used as both a cold transport medium and a cold storage medium.

Geologic formations, structures, and materials provide this capacity. Thermal energy may be drawn at relatively high temperatures by direct heat exchange from energy conversion and industrial processes, waste incineration, and stand-by heating capacity, as well as solar radiation. Heat is available at lower temperatures from ambient air, soil and rock, surface water, ice, and ground water. In this article a number of different systems and configurations are described for exchanging heat between seasonal sources and sinks and natural storage media.

The magnets and ring are contained in a tunnel, which may be buried in the ground. Levitational support against gravity is also provided by magnetic fields. Electrical energy insertion or extraction is similar to that for a synchronous motor/generator.

Another candidate dielectric liquid for future pulsed-power devices is a mixture of ethylene glycol and water, because this mixture can extend the intrinsic time constant from hundreds of microseconds to tens of milliseconds. A longer intrinsic time constant eases the requirements for the charging portion of the pulsed-power train. An important characteristic of the liquid dielectric is the energy density. Since energy density varies as the square of the electric field, electrical breakdown is an important physical phenomenon for dielectric mixtures.

In the absence of ballast, current and laser pulse width decrease on increasing the voltage applied to the discharge tubes but these quantities remain unaffected on varying the value of the energy storage capacitor. This enables an independent control of the laser pulse duration and energy. Threshold energy for the onset of nonuniformities in the glow discharge reduces almost exponentially on increasing the discharge current pulse duration but rises on decreasing the operating value of E/N, the electric field to neutral gas density ratio.

Model calculations are carried out to fit the linear viscoelastic behaviour of the system as well as its stress response in large amplitude shear experiments. Information is thus obtained about the stiffness and strength of the interparticle bonds, and the chance of them breaking in a state of rest or as the result of flow. It is concluded that the probability of interparticle bond fracture strongly depends on the measure of bond stretching. The general findings link up with the Lennard-Jones potential which is assumed to describe the potential energy of the bonds between the particles.

In this study devices from good and bad lots and commercially available silver-filled epoxies have been examined. Comparison of secondary electron images with absorbed current micrographs indicates that conduction occurs through a percolative network. The sensitivity of resistivity as a function of silver concentration to formulation shows that conductivity through the percolative network is strongly affected by a complex interplay between the silver flake and the epoxy matrix. The amount of insulating amorphous carbon layer immediately surrounding the silver flake, as demonstrated by Raman scattering, is related to the storage time and conductivity. The bulk conduction mechanism probably involves a combination of direct contact of silver flakes and tunneling through the insulating layer. This insulating layer can be electrically broken down to form a mechanically fragile pathway. Secondary electron micrographs demonstrate that the silver flakes are randomly oriented throughout the bulk but, near interfaces between the metallization or air, they tend to align parallel to the interface. The minimum free energy configuration near the interface appears to be driven by the specific surfaces areas and the interfacial free energies. The orientational ordering near the interface undoubtedly alters the resistivity in that region.",,"INTEGRATED CIRCUITS; SILVER AND ALLOYS - Electric Conductivity; DIE ATTACHMENT; ELECTRON MICROGRAPHS; SILVER FILLED EPOXIES; ELECTRIC CONNECTORS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022228066

The switch required for this has to be able to interrupt a substantial current, as well as permit a rapid build-up of a high voltage across its opened terminals. A nonlinear resistor can change its resistivity in response to an external stimulus. Resistors that are sensitive to temperature are used in this evaluation; specifically positive temperature coefficient PTC resistors that can exhibit increases in resistance over three orders of magnitude when their temperature exceeds a critical value. These are particularly attractive since the application of a current can be used to raise their temperature relatively uniformly throughout their bulk. Relatively fast switching speeds can therefore be attained. The implementation of successful PTC resistors has so far been most successful in dual-phase materials. Switching speeds of milliseconds are easily attainable, even without triggering.

Use of backup diesel/petrol generators appear to be more attractive than the provision of battery storage for a period of longer than ten days. In all these cases, however, a long term financial policy is needed to justify the economic viability of SPS.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; ENERGY UTILIZATION - India; SOLAR ENERGY - Economics; ECONOMIC ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY; ECONOMIC VIABILITY; PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATIONS SCOPE IN INDIA; SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS (SPS); PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022222756

Because of the large numbers of these capacitors used in electronic equipment and their propensity to fail when short-circuited, the overall system reliability can be significantly affected by the reliability behavior of the multilayer ceramic capacitor. A computer-based test system is described here which continuously monitors the leakage current of up to l60 MLCs simultaneously at life test conditions. A unique feature of this system is that all measurements are made on the devices at the elevated temperature and voltage conditions present during the test. Special shielding and grounding techniques are used to allow measurements down to 10 pA. The leakage current data are logged and can be converted to insulation resistance to provide a complete insulation resistance history for each device under test. This information can provide insight to failure mechanisms and life behavior unobtainable by the conventional 'blown fuse' test.",,"CONTROL, ELECTRIC VARIABLES - Current; ELECTRIC MEASUREMENTS - Monitoring; ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT - Components; ACCELERATED LIFE TEST; DEVICE UNDER TEST (DUT); INSULATION RESISTANCE; LEAKAGE CURRENT; MULTILAYER CERAMIC CAPACITORS (MLC); CAPACITORS, CERAMIC",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022215788

The magnetic switch cores were built from materials of two different alloys, and were tested in both as-cast and annealed states. The performance data acquired indicates that annealing of the core material reduces energy loss by up to a factor of five and that, as expected, losses are lower in the higher resistivity materials.",,"MAGNETIC DEVICES - Design; PULSE GENERATORS; MAGNETIC MODULATOR; PROTON STORAGE RING; PULSE REPETITION RATE; ACCELERATORS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022207917

The effect of cycling on the chromium electrode and the membrane was determined. Bismuth and bismuth-lead catalyzed chromium electrodes and a radiation-grafted polyethylene membrane were evaluated by cycling between 5 and 85% state-of-charge at 80 mA/cm**2 and by periodic charge-discharge polarization measurements to 140 mA/cm**2 . Gradual performance losses were observed during cycling but were recoverable by completely discharging the system. Good scale-up to the 867 cm**2 stack was achieved. The only difference appeared to be an unexplained resistive-type loss which resulted in a 75% W-hr efficiency (at 80 mA/cm**2 ) versus 81% for the 14. 5 cm**2 cell. A new rebalance cell was developed to maintain reactant ionic balance. The cell successfully reduced ferric ions in the iron reactant stream to ferrous ions while chloride ions were oxidized to chlorine gas.",,"CHARGE-DISCHARGE CYCLING; IRON AND CHROMIUM CHLORIDES; ELECTRIC BATTERIES, SECONDARY; ENERGY STORAGE",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022201264

Assuming fuel savings only, the allowable cost of PV electricity is found to be about 0. 045 ECU/kWh. If capacity savings are assumed too, the allowable cost increases to about 0. 06 ECU/kWh.

The chiller system at the central plant consists of four 1250 ton centrifugal chillers, a six-cell cooling tower, five 100,000 gallon chilled water storage tanks, and associated pumps and piping. Computer models of the chilled water system were developed to study the energy conservation potential of control strategies intended for the minicomputer control system. Comparisons of modeled performance with measured data showed good agreement both at the component and system levels. Optimal control strategies for the number of chillers, cooling tower fan speeds, and condenser pump flow rates were developed. These resulted in an estimated combined savings of 4,400 a year. Demand limiting using the chilled water storage reduced annual peak demand by 161 kW and saved an additional 5,500.

Dispersed sources are viewed as active devices contributing to the regulation of real and reactive power flows while improving the stability of the power system. Conceptual means are developed for an effective DSG-utility grid interface. Computer models of appropriate interconnection and control equipment are used in simulation studies to test the effectiveness of control strategies and to optimize design parameters. Simulation results indicate that load frequency control and voltage regulation may effectively be accomplished with dispersed generators within a fraction of the time required for conventional regulating units. Appropriate modulation and conditioning of the DSG-output power can assist in damping out undesired power oscillations. Implementation of the proposed policies should reduce the load-following requirements for conventional power generating units, increase the value and acceptability of new energy technologies, and improve the power quality and stability of the interconnected system.",,"COMPUTER SIMULATION; ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION - Control; ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS - Interconnection; ELECTRIC UTILITIES - Energy Management; SYSTEM STABILITY; DISPERSED STORAGE AND GENERATION (DSG); DSG-OUTPUT POWER; ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES INTEGRATION; INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS POWER STABILITY; ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022189004

During this period, 743 ton-hours of cooling or 8,921,856 Btu (2613 kWh) were recovered with an estimated 5% to 8% of the stored cooling capacity remaining. However, all of the ice had been melted. Approximately 52% of the stored energy had been recovered, indicating a probable 45% to 50% loss to the surrounding earth.",,"HEAT EXCHANGERS; ICE - Storage; PIPE, PLASTIC; POLYETHYLENES - Applications; SOILS - Frozen; FARENHEIT FREEZING DEGREE HOURS; PROPYLENE GLYCOL-WATER MIXTURE; SOIL'S VOID SPACE; WATER-SATURATED EARTH MASS; COLD STORAGE",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022185019

To realize these advantages the high specific strengths of filament-wound composite materials will be required. To overcome the limited radial tensile strength of composite materials an interference assembly of nested rings is proposed. A complete stress analysis of a multiring/multimaterial flywheel is discussed and it is shown that the SED of a given geometry can be increased by a fact of 2 or more through interference assembly. It is also shown that the radial stresses can be redistributed with interference assembly so that the outer flywheel rings will separate at their interfaces if a given flywheel speed is exceeded.

The diffractive character of elastic scattering, seen as the shadow of inelastic absorption, is presented as a consequence of unitarity in the s-channel. Some relevant theorems are recalled on the limiting behavior of hadron-scattering amplitudes at infinite energy.

However, further significant improvements should still be possible by employing regenerative braking systems, which involve the transfer of the kinetic energy of the vehicle, normally dissipated as heat through the brakes, to some form of energy storage device. The stored energy is then used to restart the vehicle. One such device is that based on the use of a flywheel. This enables the kinetic energy of a vehicle to be transferred to inertial energy and vice-versa thereby offering the potential for savings in fuel, reduction in exhaust pollution and engine noise and optimisation of the drive-line.

The momentum imparted by several types of plasma plug igniter has been measured by mounting each igniter in a simple pendulum and recording the steady state amplitude attained when the igniter is energised in sychronism with the swings of the pendulum. This technique, being far more sensitive than the previous single-shot method, allows relatively fine comparisons to be made between different types of igniter. The individual momentum measurements lie reasonably close to a theoretical limit based on the conversion of the translational energy of the Joule heated gas within the cavity to kinetic energy. On this basis it seems unlikely that substantial increases in imparted momentum can be expected from plug redesign etc. A separate series of measurements with energy storage at capacitor voltages of 5-20 kV instead of the usual range of 0.3-1 kV reveals that the imparted momentum decreases by less than 30%. Since recent measurements have demonstrated that the marginal igniter lifetime can be substantially extended by working at such high voltages, the above small decrease encourages the view that high voltage operation may be a desirable option.",,"COMBUSTION; GASES; PLASMA IGNITERS; PLASMA DEVICES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022060825

One of the main aims of the abiotic research was to deepen our understanding of the physical processes governing the local- and microclimate of northern coniferous forests. As part of this, the energy budget of a sparse pine forest in central Sweden was intensively studied. Analysis of Bowen ratio measurements during 1977 and 1978 showed that the fraction of net radiation (Rn) utilized for sensible and latent heat (LE) fluxes was not constant over the season. The ratio LE Rn increased from about 40% in May to about 60% in August and September. The mean daytime latent heat flux from a dry canopy was about 135 W m-2 in May, increasing to 150-160 W m-2 in July and August and then decreasing to 100 W m-2 in September. The sensible heat flux decreased from about 190 W m-2 in May to 55 W m-2 in September. The mean daytime energy storage rate was largest in May and September with about 23 W m-2 and smallest in July with 12 W m-2. The Bowen ratio at noon decreased from about 2 in May to 0.5-1 in August and September. During a period of six days, simultaneous measurements of evapotranspiration from the ground vegetation and the whole forest were made. Averaged over the daytime period, about 59% of the net radiation was used for latent heat flux, 32% for sensible heat flux and 9% for storage. Only 13% of the latent heat flux came from the ground vegetation while more than 50% of the sensible heat flux originated from the ground. Comparison between four European coniferous forests showed that the mean daytime latent heat flux varied relatively little. The mean rate was 135 ± 27 W m-2 and there was no correlation between density of forest and rate of latent heat flux. © 1985.",,"ATMOSPHERIC THERMODYNAMICS; HYDROLOGY; SOLAR RADIATION; CONIFEROUS FORESTS; ENERGY BUDGET COMPONENTS; FORESTRY; ecosystem investigations; microclimate; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022265938

This metabolic loss is driven by intracellular ATPases which are usually considered to include the ion pumps and the reactions which maintain the discoid shape of the human erythrocyte. Under the acidic conditions of blood storage, the energy-yielding reactions of the glycolytic pathway are restricted at the hexokinase and phosphofructokinase steps. We show here that under such circumstances the enzyme of the diphosphoglycerate shunt, diphosphoglycerate mutase/phosphatase and the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase can form a futile cycle with ATPase activity. This ATPase activity responds to 2-phosphoglycolate which is known to activate both diphosphoglycerate mutase and diphosphoglycerate phosphatase reactions. When the enzymes of the futile cycle are combined with the enzymes of the lower glycolytic pathway in a reconstitution experiment designed to represent conditions within the stored erythrocyte, the futile cycle does provide an ATPase activity which results in the metabolic loss of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. An isotope incorporation experiment demonstrates that the futile cycle is active in glucose-depleted erythrocytes. © 1985.","ATPase; Diphosphoglycerate mutase; Diphosphoglycerate phosphatase; Erythrocyte; Glycolysis; Rapoport-Luebering shunt","2,3 diphosphoglyceric acid; adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphate; blood and hemopoietic system; blood bank; erythrocyte; glycolysis; human; human cell; priority journal; 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Diphosphoglyceric Acids; Erythrocytes; Glycolysis; Human; NAD; Phosphoglycerate Kinase; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022374928

This study was undertaken to define an advanced IPACS and to evaluate its merits for a Space Station application. System and component designs are developed to establish the performance of this concept, and system trade studies are conducted to examine the viability of this approach relative to conventional candidate systems.

The reason is that the longitudinal revolution frequency spread of the beam which otherwise provides Landau damping vanishes at the transition energy.

The proximity of the LEP storage ring, with maximum energy of 100 GeV per beam, offers the possibility of e-p interactions. Because of limitations in space and deflection, it is assumed that e-p insertions are in a straight section between two arcs, which does not contain RF cavities. Among the envisaged insertions, head-on collisions give the highest luminosity. In this case, the electron beam is deflected vertically so that there is a path common to both beams between the LEP insertion quadrupoles used for separating the beams outside this region.

The beam position vibration increases the effective beam size and thus reduces the brightness. So the positional stability measurement provides important information for beam lines. Data about amplitude and frequency of beam vibration and long term beam movement at different beam ports can be useful in locating the noise source for accelerator physicists. For the noise which can not be eliminated, a beam position monitor can provide the signal for the feedback system to stabilize the beam position. These considerations become more evident as higher brightness and better energy resolution are sought.

The lay-out of COSY was developed in cooperation with the Universities in Nordrhein-Westfalen and meets the experimental requirements of variable and high quality beams which are necessary for future nuclear research under discusion. The motivation for the cooler-synchrotron COSY emerged from discussions of nuclear physicists in Nordrhein-Westfalen on future research activities. The “Workshop on Electron Cooling” in 1982 came to the conclusion that a cooler-synchrotron1 is an excellent tool for advanced nuclear research experiments. It should be built at the KFA in cooperation with the surrounding Universities. The three essential properties of the storage ring will be: - high luminosities and very efficient use of the beam in the storage ring by thin internal targets - energy variability in the range of 20 MeV to 1.5 GeV by RF acceleration - very high beam quality through phase space cooling. Two classes of experiments will be feasible in the first step of construction. At proton energies up to about 200 MeV it will be possible to excite selectively fundamental nuclear spin isospin modes and to resolve the corresponding nuclear levels with the existing high resolution spectrometer BIG KARL2. At higher energies single nucleons in the nucleus can be excited internally and coherent meson production can be studied, processes which reflect details of the subnuclear structure.

Although even in central Europe the total radiation upon a building amounts to more than the heating energy needed during the winter season, closer inspection shows that the available storage capacity is not sufficient to cover the entire load by radiation: auxiliary heat is always required. On the other hand, overheating must be avoided by means of control devices. Components in use at present are: windows, conservatories and, to a lesser extent, trombe walls. Newer developments are based on materials exhibiting high light transmission and good heat insulation properties. Such materials can be used as outside insulation of old building stock and offer prospects for significant energy savings. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Our approach is based on selfconsistent theory. In analogy to the theory of quasistatic convection by Grad, we interpret the break-down of the quasistatic theory near the separatrix as evidence for the occurence of a boundary layer. In particular, this picture suggests large (however integrable) current sheets, with the current flowing parallel to the poloidal magnetic field. This concept is also tested by numerical computations. Here the discretization procedure simulates those physical effects that in a real case would keep the current from becoming infinitely large. The results fully confirm the formation of current sheets. Our findings have potential applications to energy storage for solar flares and to the heating of the solar corona. © 1985 D.

Because approximately one-third of the total national energy budget is consumed by buildings, solar and conservation improvements can have a large effect on our overall energy consumption. There have been a large number of materials research programs funded through the Department of Energy (DOE) in an attempt to expand the use of solar energy. These materials programs have covered the areas of sealants and gaskets, insulations, glazings, glazing- surface treatments, polymers, selective absorber surfaces, phase-change storage, and heat mirrors. In addition to developing the materials, a large effort has been directed toward determining the reliability and durability of solar materials. The present state-of-the-art and status of these solar materials will be discussed. Although much progress has been made in recent years, many improvements are still needed. For many of the more routine materials, simple cost reductions or durability improvements would suffice. For the more advanced concepts of controlling energy flow into or out of buildings, basic materials research remains a necessity. There are a large number of potentially viable concepts that appear promising, but which have not yet been developed into usable materials. © 1985 American society for metals.",,"BUILDINGS - Heating; ENERGY CONSERVATION; HEATING - Solar; ENERGY SAVINGS; GLAZING MATERIALS; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022131615

The major technical issue is whether, from an overall systems integration, cost, and growth viewpoint, solar-generated power is best supplied by photovoltaic (PV) arrays or by a solar dynamic (heat engine) system. Photovoltaic technology is well developed and proven, but projected costs would be higher than those estimated for the less well-defined solar dynamic system. PV's major limitation is its low overall efficiency, resulting from 11-16% solar-cell efficiency and 55-65% electrochemical energy storage efficiency. Hence the solar array must have a large area, which significantly affects station dynamics, control, and drag compensation. Solar dynamic systems have higher overall efficiency and therefore need less deployed area. However, since the solar dynamic technology is still in its infancy, it is not certain whether it is possible to count on its successful development.",,"FUEL CELLS - Electrolytes; HEAT ENGINES - Design; SOLAR CELLS - Arrays; SOLAR ENERGY - Applications; SOLAR RADIATION - Concentrators; SPACE PLATFORMS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022131181

It has a regime of variation which is determined both by the course of diverse processes inside and on the surface of earth, in the biosphere, in space. Global mass and energy exchange and mass and energy transport occur. The rates of the interconversion processes are different in different parts of the section of the lithosphere and mantle. The structure of the phase states of water also changes with increase of depth, pressure, and temperature. Problems of the replenishment and reproduction (storage) of subsurface waters are acquiring particular importance. Investigations of the conservation of the earth's water resources are included in this important direction of hydrogeology. Among the most important directions of general and regional hydrogeology for fulfilling the Food and Energy Programs in the twelfth and subsequent Five-Year Plans, are a study of subsurface waters of the biosphere and, in particular, the upper stages of the earth's crust; a study of subsurface waters of deeper hydrodynamic stages of the crust and upper mantle.",,"AQUIFERS; WATER RESOURCES - Analysis; WATER, UNDERGROUND; HYDROGEOLOGY; GEOLOGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022124829

This interaction, including such facets as excitation, degradation, storage, and transfer, is considered here with regard to its profound potential for altering the capabilities of minerals to serve both as substrates for prebiological chemistry and as inorganic prototypic life forms. The interaction of minerals and energy in relationship to surface chemistry is discussed in terms of the spectroscopic properties of minerals, the interaction of energy with condensed phases, some commonly accepted concepts of heterogeneous catalysis in the absence of electronic energy inputs, and some commonly accepted and novel means by which surface activity might be enhanced in the presence of energy inputs. An estimation is made of the potential contribution of two poorly characterized prebiotic energy sources, natural radioactive decay and triboelectric energy. These estimates place a conservative lower limit on their prebiotic abundance. Also some special properties of these energy sources, relative to solar energy, are pointed out which might give them particular suitability for driving reactions occurring under geological conditions. Skeletal support for this broadly defined framework of demonstrated and potential relationships between minerals, electronic excitation, and surface reactivity, as applied to chemical evolution, is provided from the results of our studies on 1/1 clays. We have discovered and partially characterized a number of novel luminescent properties of these clays, that indicate energy storage and transfer processes in clays. These luminescent properties are interpreted in relationship to the electron spin resonance phenomena, to provide a basis for estimating the potential significance of energy storage and transduction in monitoring or driving clay surface chemistry. Consideration of the electronic structure of abundant minerals in terms of band theory and localized defect centers provides a predictive theoretical framework from which to rationalize the capacity of these materials to store and transduce energy. The bulk crystal is seen as a collecting antenna for electronic energy, with the defect centers serving as storage sites. The clay properties produced by isomorphic substitution appear to be intimately associated with all of the life-mimetic chemical processes that have been attributed to clays. It appears sensible to postulate that the energetic properties of these substitutional defect centers may also be influential in these biomimetic processes: the promotion of surface reactions, storage of information, replication with transfer of information, and asymmetric separation of electrical charges, as well as their more recently hypothesized roles in energy storage and transduction. The identity of the sites implicated in all of the biomimetic functions of clays as well as their capacity for energy storage is seen to offer significant potential for coupling these functions to an environmental energy source. A yet more specific and experimentally testable hypothesis is offered for a new biomimetic process performed by clays. This hypothesis is that energy stored near isomorphically substituted sites provides the energetic basis for the coupled transport of electrical charge and/or electronic energy through the clay layer, which operates via environmental activation of electron/hole mobility. This is to say that mobility of charge/electronic excitation between defect centers serves as the basis for a primordial inorganic electron transport chain. © 1985 D.

Lucinoma annulata and C. elongata were dredged from the Santa Barbara basin, California, USA, at a depth of 480 to 490 m, and Lucina floridana were dug from below the roots of seagrasses in Saint Joseph Bay, Florida, at a depth of 0.25 to 2m. Foot tissue of Lucinoma annulata, without symbionts, had a total sulfur content of 1.4±0.1 (SD) mg 100 mg-1 dry weight of tissue (%DW). The symbiont-containing gill tissue of different individuals of L. annulata varied in color from dark red to pale yellow, and the total sulfur content was 2.5±0.4% DW in red gills and was 5.6±3.3 % DW in the yellowest gills. Maintenance of L. annulata in the laboratory for 21 d in the absence of sulfide resulted in the loss from the gill of yellow deposits which were elemental sulfur in the form of liquid-crystalline sulfur globules rather than solid orthorhombic sulfur crystals. The foot tissue did not contain elemental sulfur. When examined by freeze-etch microscopy, sulfur globules were found only within bacteria and not in the animal host cytoplasm. Sulfur globules were confined to the periplasmic space of the bacteria. C. elongata and Lucina floridana resembled Lucinoma annulata in the physical form and distribution of elemental sulfur. The absence of elemental sulfur in the animal cytoplasm suggests that its formation from sulfide is not a detoxification scheme to protect animal tissue from sulfide toxicity. The sulfur deposits probably represent inorganic energy reserves that permit the symbiotic bacteria to function even during the temporary absence of external sulfide. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002621241

From spatial observations, we deduce both flares probably occur in the same loop within the resolution of the data. For the first flare, the energy in the fast electrons (assuming a thick-target model) is comparable to the convective up-flow energy, suggesting that these are related successive modes of energy storage and transfer. The total energy lost through radiation and conduction, 2.0 × 1028 erg, is comparable to the energy in fast electrons 2.5 × 1028 erg. For the second flare, the energy in the fast electrons is more than one order of magnitude greater than the energy of the convective up-flow. Total energy losses are within a factor of two lower than the calculated fast electron energy. We interpret the observations as showing that the first flare occurred in a small loop with fast electrons heating the chromosphere and resulting in chromospheric evaporation increasing the density in the loop. For the second flare most of the heating occurred at the electron acceleration site. The two symmetrical components of the Ca xix resonance line and a high velocity down-flow of 115 km s -1 observed at the end of the second hard X-ray burst are consistent with the flare eruption (reconnection) region being high in the flare loop.

At 40°C VR was 4.3±0.2 m/s and f was 13.5±0.5 s-1. 3. Between 25 and 40°C, the thermal dependencies of VR and f were approximately constant (Q10's of 1.31 and 1.36 for VR and f, respectively). Below 25°C performance declined more markedly with decreasing temperature. At 20°C strides were qualitatively normal, but VR was only half of the value at 25°C. At 15°C the lizards were substantially incapacitated, and VR was 10% of the value at 20°C. Stride length was approximately 0.33m and changed very little with Tb from 20-44°C. 4.

The turnover of cytoplasmic ATP is higher than in most other cells; when it is lowered, platelet responses are powerfully inhibited. One-third of the total adenine nucleotides are present in the cytoplasm and a small fraction of these, 50% of the ADP, is bound to actin and not available to metabolism. These nucleotides are not synthesized de novo in platelets which readily form them from adenine, adenosine, and hypoxanthine. The remaining two-thirds are sequestred in the dense granules together with serotonin and divalent metal ions. NMR studies show that this ATP and ADP are stacked in large aggregates together with the divalent cations. Serotonin is incorporated into the aggregates by being positioned between, and in close proximity to, adjacent adenine rings. In the congenital platelet disorder, ""Storage Pool Deficiency,"" the dense granule content is absent or markedly reduced, which may be caused by an impaired transport of ATP across the dense granule membrane. The content of the dense granules, the β-thromboglobulin, albumin, fibrinogen, certain coagulation factors, fibronectin of the α-granules, and the acid hydrolases of the lysosomes are discharged by exocytosis, but the exact mechanisms are not known. This discharge, platelet secretion, is complete for the dense granule and α-granules contents, but is only 30% to 55% for the acid hydrolases. After pretreatment of platelets with certain amines, thrombin causes secretion of all β-hexosaminidase, indicating that the β-hexosaminidase usually retained during secretion is bound within the lysosomes at the acid pH but becomes dissociated by raising the pH with the amines. Agonist-induced platelet aggregation and secretion are accompanied by rapid changes in phosphoinositide metabolism which are usually monitored as the radioactivity in phospholipids of platelets preincubated with radioactive arachidonate, glycerol, inositol, or orthophospate. The mechanisms for precursor incorporation are not well known and interpretations of published results are hampered by much uncertainty. Experimental support for the widely accepted coupling of receptor occupancy to the phospho-diesteratic hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate is nonexistent. These two hydrolytic steps occur concomitantly and together with formation of diglyceride and phosphatidate; all four steps cannot be temporally resolved. Another approach, with association-dissociation-reassociation of thrombin to its receptor with hirudin, indicates that the phosphatidate formation is tightly coupled with receptor occupancy. The 32P3H ratio of the phosphatidate formed by thrombin occupancy increases five- to seven-fold in platelets prelabeled with both 32P-orthophosphate and 3H-arachidonate. This heterogeneity can be explained by phosphorylation of two pools of diglyceride with different 3H content; one pool may be derived from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and the other from phosphatidylinositol. The disappearance of phosphatidylinositol is abolished by ATP deprivation suggesting a disappearance by two phosphorylations (to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate) rather than by hydrolysis by phospholipase C. It is the bisphosphate that is hydrolyzed diesteratically and yields diglyceride. There is a transient decrease in the 32P-radioactivity of the bisphosphate followed by a marked increase in platelets pulse-labeled with 32P-orthophosphate; ATP deprivation has no effect on the decrease but abolishes the increase, which agrees with the above mechanism for diglyceride production. However, one would expect that all 32P of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate would be consumed by ATP deprivation, but this is not the case. Apparently there is only a small fraction of the labeled phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate that participates in signal processing. Further understanding in this area clearly require more knowledge about the metabolism of the phosphoinositides in non-stimulated platelets. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ can mediate platelet responses and is made available through receptor occupancy. However, there is increasing evidence that other second messengers (ie, diglyceride and perhaps inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate) also mediate the responses and can act synergistically with Ca2+. Both substances are formed together in the diesteratic hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. Ca2+ may originate from intracellular stores and or from the extracellular phase. A distinctly lower concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ is associated with the shape change response than with dense granule secretion, suggesting that the various responses may have different thresholds for Ca2+. Stimulated platelets provide several agonists (positive feedback) that may interact synergistically with the primary agonist, and it is presently unclear whether the potential second messengers are produced by one agonist only. © 1985.",,"actin; adenine nucleotide; adenosine triphosphate; calcium; phosphatidylinositol; serotonin; animal; blood; cell compartmentalization; cell granule; energy metabolism; glycolysis; human; in vitro study; physiology; review; thrombocyte; Actins; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Blood Platelets; Calcium; Cell Compartmentation; Cytoplasmic Granules; Energy Metabolism; Glycolysis; Human; In Vitro; Phosphatidylinositols; Serotonin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022090454

These conditions tend to produce longitudinal and transverse beam instabilities, excessive beam growth through multiple intra-beam scattering and a short gas-scattering lifetime. Passing the beam only occasionally through the undulator in a by-pass straight section, as proposed by Murphy and Pellegrini [1], allows operation in a high-gain, single-pass mode and a long gas-scattering lifetime. Several storage ring designs have been considered to see how best to satisfy the several requirements.

A p.v, array gives a 65 kWp nominal peak power. DC/DC converters feed the main d.c. bus and the storage battery which assures the uninterrupted operation of the desalination plant during overcast periods. The total plant area is 5000 sq. m; 1800 of them covered by the p.v. field: The layout of the rows of modules has been designed to optimize the efficiency of the array subsystem, to minimize atmospheric overvoltage, and to assure easy operation and maintenance. Good fitting with the natural characteristics of land is obtained. The final solution of the supporting structure satisfies to the last Italian codes for seismic areas: Pv modules are bolted to galvanized steel beams supported by walls of vibrated concrete. The electric appliance load consists of a.c. induction motors driven by single inverters. The R.O plant produces about 5000 cu. m. of water with an average power requirement of 13 kWh/cu. m.

It is shown that carbon losses observed during the long-term incubation are due to the catabolism of reserve products (polysaccharides and lipids), which occurs both during the light and dark periods and provides carbon and energy for pursuing protein synthesis during the dark. Catabolism rates, as calculated by means of a simple mathematical model, indicate reduced rates of lipid catabolism (1-2% h-1, respectively for the light and dark periods), although polysaccharide catabolism proceeds at much higher rates, namely 20% h-1 during the light and 8% h-1 during the dark period. Assuming that protein synthesis proceeds at a constant rate during the 24-h period and that β 1-3 glucan constitutes the main storage product of this diatom population, it is shown that at least 65% of the gross primary production is catabolized by the cells. From this, only 16% are mobilized for dark protein synthesis. The remaining is respired, especially during the light period. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250112841

Measurements were made of the principal structures in the legs of an ostrich. Hence peak stresses in muscles, tendons and bones were calculated. They lay within the range of stresses calculated for strenuous activities of other vertebrates. The ostrich makes substantial savings of energy in running, by elastic storage in stretched tendons. Pachyornis was a flightless bird, much heavier than ostriches and with massively thick leg bones. These bones are shorter than predicted for its estimated body mass, by extrapolation from allometric equations for flying birds. An attempt is made to calculate the stresses that acted in the leg bones in running, for all possible patterns of leg movement. The stresses were probably rather low, unless Pachyornis was capable of running fast. It is argued that the optimum factor of safety for moo leg bones may have been exceptionally high, as a consequence of the absence of predators. © 1985 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W.

The work concentrated on the clear-cut site which supported a canopy layer composed primarily of bracken fern and logging remnants. Forty days of radiation data were collected at the clear-cut site. After the first four weeks of measurements (the 'green' season), most of the ferns quickly died, and their foliage changed appearance from a green to brownish colour (the 'brown' season). The daily mean reflection coefficient of solar radiation determined over the 'green' season was 0.20 and decreased to 0.13 for the 'brown' season. The corresponding value for the forest was 0.13, based on a limited amount of data. The clear-cut site received 11% and 21% less net radiation than the forest on a 24-hr and daylight-hours basis, respectively, as a consequence of the higher reflection coefficient and larger daytime longwave radiation emission. A reversing temperature difference measurement system (RTDMS), incorporating ten-junction thermopiles was employed at each site in order to determine Bowen ratios (β) via differential psychrometry. Both systems performed well, especially the RTDMS over the forest which was capable of resolving very small differences of temperature, typically less than 0.2 °C over a height of 3 m. The mean hourly Bowen ratio, calculated from values from 0800 to 1600 hr, varied from 0.2 to 1.0 for the forest and from 0.4 to 0.8 for the clear-cut site in the 'green' season. A significant canopy heat storage component of the energy balance, QS, was found at the clear-cut site. In the early morning, a portion of the available energy was used to heat the biomass materials and air within the canopy layer. The stored heat within the canopy was released later in the day, increasing the available energy total. The daily mean value of the Priestley-Taylor coefficient α (Priestley and Taylor, 1972) for the 'green' season at the clear-cut site was 1.14, and individual values tended to increase during wet surface conditions and decrease when the surface dried. The daylight mean α value during dry canopy conditions at the forest was 1.05, and much higher values occurred when the canopy was wet. The enhancement of α for the wet forest was a result of the evaporation of intercepted rain (which is not limited by stomatal resistance) and the concomitant transfer of sensible heat to the forest. © 1985 D.

The screw compressors compress freon gas with rotating screws into smaller volumes. When that happens, the gas temperature rises and is used to generate hot water for winter heating. By using screw compressors the system operates over a wider range of pressures and temperatures ( minus 20 degree F to 120 degree F) than a standard centrifugal compressor. Its ability to cool below freezing allows the heat pump to make ice. The heat pump can store cooling and extract heat by lowering the temperature and changing the state of water. Heat removed from the water to make ice is used to heat the building during the winter in the unoccupied evening hours. With the capacity to produce ice, the heat pump is, in effect, storing the electrical energy that allowed the compressor to make the ice thus permitting the building to consume only half as much energy as a similar-sized high-rise.",,"HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS - Energy Management; ICE - Storage; SCREW COMPRESSOR HEAT PUMP; OFFICE BUILDINGS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022050263

The storage capacity for glycogen is thus low. Lactate production at 37°C in a substrate-free medium was low (2.5-6.3 nmoles/106 cells in 40 min), but was stimulated 5-fold in the aerobic medium and 10-15 fold in the anaerobic medium by glucose. Both aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis in presence of glucose can thus provide energy for histamine secretion. The initial enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, have been demonstrated in mast cells. The enzyme activity in mast cells was, however, low compared to the high activity in the other peritoneal cells. The extent of the pentose cycle activity was determined from the conversion of14C1-- and14C6-glucose to14CO2, expressing the specific14CO2 yields as fractions of the total glucose utilization. The normal pentose cycle activity with 1 m M glucose was 0.4% of the glucose metabolism. This was remarkably simulated by an electron acceptor, phenazine methosulfate. The pentose cycle was enhanced to 0.71% (80% stimulation) after exposure of the mast cells to compound 48/80, causing 68% histamine release. The stimulation of the pentose cycle by compound 48/80 seems to be due to the enhancement of biosynthetic processes during the regenerative phase. We have previously reported stimulation of CO2 and lactate production from glucose in mast cells by secretagogues. The present experiments also show a stimulation of total glucose utilization and increased incorporation of14C from glucose to lipids. © 1985 Birkhäuser Verlag.",,"compound 48-80; phenazine methosulfate; radioisotope; animal cell; drug efficacy; glucose c 14; glucose metabolism; histamine release; mast cell; nonhuman; pentose phosphate cycle; rat; reticuloendothelial system; Animal; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Radioisotopes; Glucose; Glycogen; In Vitro; Lactates; Lactic Acid; Male; Mast Cells; p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine; Pentosephosphate Pathway; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021926264

Three basic factors should be considered in the selection of an indirect-fired domestic water heating system for a given application: dependability, temperature control, and life cycle costs. Each of these types of heaters and selection factors is discussed in the article.",,"PLUMBING - Design; WATER HEATERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022028282

In the fern Osmunda regalis the percentage of cells which does not die but stays alive, although reproductively sterile, increases with dose. The assumed mechanism of this effect is a continuation of cytoplasmic growth during radiation-induced mitotic delay which induces terminal differentiation (early differentiation) thus preventing mitosis and the expression of chromosomal injury. Suppression of cytoplasmic growth after irradiation should abrogate reversion. This was tested using anoxia. Reversion was suppressed by storage of the sporelings in nitrogen for 8 h or more after X-rays, but was not suppressed by storage in 0.27 μM oxygen nor by a 60-min exposure to air after irradiation and before storage in nitrogen. Anoxia before irradiation in air had no effect. Anoxia only during irradiation showed an OER of about 2 for the reversion peak. The partial abrogation of reversion is consistent with the assumed mechanism. Marked reversion also was observed after 14.7 MeV neutrons. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",,"etiology; hypoxia; linear energy transfer; methodology; nonhuman; plant; radiation injury; revertant; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Energy Transfer; Mitotic Index; Neutrons; Oxygen; Plants; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Time Factors; X-Rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021932456

This single flasher tends to have a comparatively long exposure time and the electric pulse width of the FX wave form is about 0.3>usec. The maximum FX dose is about 50mR at lm per pulse, and the effective focal spot varies according to condenser charging voltage, A-C distance, etc., ranging from 1.0 to 3.0mm in diameter, but in the low dose rate region it can be reduced to less than 1.0mm in diameter. The FX dose is determined by the condenser charging voltage and the A-C distance, while the FX spectrum is determined by the average voltage of the FX tube and filters. Various clear FX images were obtained by controlling the spectrum and dose. FCR is a new storage medium for medical radiography developed by the Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. and this apparatus has various image forming functions: Low dose radiography, film density control, image contrast control, subtraction management and others.

An IBM PC was chosen for the low-cost, general-purpose display unit. Up to four spectra may be displayed simultaneously in different colors. The histogram saves 1024 channels per detector, 640 of which may be distinctly displayed per spectra. The IEEE-488 standard provides the data path between the IBM PC and the data collection unit. Data are sent to the PC under interrupt control, using direct memory access.

Ihe more the truncation effect is pronounced the less is the energy portion used and it deteriorates towards zero for a very pronounced beam expansion with an almost homogeneous illumination. For an image forming system the Gaussian intensity distribution of the incident beam may be interpreted as an apodization with a Gaussian amplitude in the pupil. Point image, encircled energy, MTF and depth of focus can be calculated from the pupil function that is defined in this way. For diffraction limited lenses it is shown how different pronounced truncations of the incident Gaussian beam will affect these image quality criteria. Applications of this effect occur e.g. in the optical data storage technology and in infrared laser applications. Ihe smallest point image is obtained for homogeneous illumination of the pupil but the needed beam expansion utilizes only a small portion of the total incident energy. Ihe central core is becoming wider the more the apodization effect is pronounced in the truncated Gaussiar. beam. Ihe encircled energy functions for less pronounced apodi- zations are similar in the central region to those without apodization. Off a diameter corresponding to the first dark Airy ring an increase of the apodization effect that means a less pronounced truncation is reducing the fraction of the total energy contained in the outer region of the point image. For a 3x Airy disk diameter almost the total energy is encircled for a Gaussian distribution whereas only some 9 0% are encircled for homogeneous illumination. © 1985 SPIE.",,"IMAGE PROCESSING - Image Analysis; LASER BEAMS; APRODIZATION AND IMAGE QUALITY; ENCIRCLED ENERGY; GAUSSIAN INTENSITY DISTRIBUTION; MODULATION TRANSFER FUNCTION; TRUNCATED GAUSSIAN LASER BEAMS; OPTICAL SYSTEMS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022241098

The cold tank is a conventional design with a carbon steel wall and external insulation. The hot tank empolys new technology; it has firebrick insulation internal to a structural shell, with a corrugated liner inside the insulation to contain the salt.

The geyser pump collector is found to be as efficient as an electrically pumped collector.

The use of hydro for generating peaking electric power is technically and environmentally undesirable in Florida since lakes have minimal storage capacity and water fluctuations have adverse effects on fish and wildlife as well as water quality. Limited potential may exist for small hydro installations to serve local and individual needs at existing dams in Florida. Nationwide, small hydro will be at a disadvantage because it will not have a dependable capacity and will have high capital costs.

With this system, heat was stored starting in September and ending in October 1982, and then from early December, the heat pump was operated. The indoor temperature was maintained at 20 DEGREE C.

The browning was determined by measuring the extinction value at 420nm of 5% metaphosphoric acid extracts. The browning was accelerated on increasing the water activity and the temperature while almost no browning could be observed below BET's monolayer moisture value at 10-30°. How ever, the maximum browning was found between aw 0.4-0.8 since the reaction rate was rather reduced at the higher water activity. The position of the maximum browning shifted to a lower water activity with increasing the storage temperature. Therefore, the existence of the maximum is attributed to both the effects of the increasing mobility and the dilution of the reactants by the influence of the water. The browning was inhibited in an oxygen free atmosphere, irrespective of the water activity. Thermodynamic parameters for the browning were obtained from the rate constants of the reaction. The activation entropy change (ΔS0) depended on the altering of the water activity more than the temperature. A highly linear correlation between ΔS and ΔH (the activation ent halpy change) became evident, regardless of the temperature, which was known in the denaturation of the proteins. The change of activation free energy (ΔG) was maximum at aw 0.05 corre sponding to the water activity for the most safe storage of hoshi-nori. We postulated that the influence of the water activity on hoshi-nori during the storage can be reflected in the browning reaction. Consequently, the browning of hoshi-nori (i.e. extinction value at 420nm) may be able to be used as an index to estimate a background about humidity conditions during the storage. © 1985, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Further, it was found that the overall reaction rate constants of both reactions could be expressed in non-linear form, which gave a maximum value at about 473.2 K for the hydration of CaO. © 1985, The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.

These defects, including the hard‐to‐cook phenomenon and hard shell, are initiated by structural and compositional factors but can be at least partially controlled by storage and processing conditions. The available literature on bean hardening is reviewed from which it may be concluded that adverse storage conditions (high temperatures and humidities) consistently produce these defects. A kinetic approach is taken to the hardening problem, including hydration and cooking, which should allow a better understanding of the processes involved. Methods that can be utilized to produce better cooking legumes are reviewed as are processing alternatives including disruption and dry fractionation, wet fractionation, extrusion, enzymes and animal feeding. The influence of hardening on the nutritive value of legumes, although not extensively studied, is examined and it is concluded that protein quality and the availability of essential amino acids can suffer.

These defects, including the hard‐to‐cook phenomenon and hardshell, are initiated by structural and compositional factors but can be at least partially controlled by storage and processing conditions. Structural components implicated include seed coat, cell walls, middle lamella, starch granules and membranes while, compositionally, proteins, carbohydrates, phytate, polyphenols and lignin may also be important. Methods of texture measurement of legumes, including mechanical, physical and sensory properties are reviewed. The most commonly held hypothesis for the mechanism of the hard‐to‐cook defect states that beans fail to soften after exposure to high temperature and humidity storage because the increased water activity potentiates phytase which hydrolyzes phytate, rendering it no longer capable of chelating the Ca++ and Mg++ ions of the middle lamella and, hence, undissoluble. More recent evidence, however, provides potential roles for lignification, starch gelatinization and perhaps other mechanisms depending upon conditions.

The defective trehalose and glycogen accumulation in strains which bear the glc1 mutation results from abnormal activation of trehalase by a protein kinase which has partially lost its cAMP dependence. Cells bearing the bcy1 mutation produce an altered protein kinase due to extremely low levels of the cAMP-binding protein. This altered kinase activates trehalase, resulting in low trehalose contents in these cells. In cell-free extracts of control strains (S288C and 7Q-2D), which produce normal levels of glycogen and trehalose, the enzyme trehalase is mainly found in an inactive, cryptic form. Each of the haploid strains containing one of the mutant genes (glc1, glc4-1 and bcy1) is defective in both trehalose and glycogen accumulation and exhibits low activation ratios of trehalase by protein kinase. Genetic complementation experiments clearly establish that the bcy1 mutation involves a different gene to that altered by the glc1 mutation, since the resulting diploid behaved normally. Strain AM9-10D, previously classified as wild-type (normal for bcy1), is defective in the accumulation of trehalose and glycogen and exhibits almost all trehalose in the active form. © 1985.","glycogen; Protein kinase; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; trehalase",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982560978

The compositional depth profiles and local bonding properties of the films are the object of the analysis. Different aspects of the application of Auger electron spectroscopy and sputtering to SiC are critically evaluated. These include the chemical information available from the structure of the Auger spectral lines from C and Si, and the effects of ion bombardment, i.e., preferential sputtering, radiation induced diffusion and segregation, as well as disorder. The samples all contain cubic (polycrystalline) SiC(β-SiC). The films are found to be homogeneous in the bulk, with a thin layer at the surface strongly enriched in carbon. A film with a high percentage of Si was found to be inhomogeneous, and to have a significant amount of SiO2formed at the surface during storage and handling in a room ambient. The films with higher surface concentrations of carbon clearly showed less tendency to form oxides. Chemical information relating to the local bonding of Si and C is obtained from the Si(L23VV) and C (KVV) Auger spectra. The Si (KLL) Auger spectrum is also included in the discussion.

Historically. external circuits have been used to extinguish a plasma (arc) conducting medium by counterpulsing the arc current to zero. Preliminary results show that solid-state dc interrupters utilizing gate turnoff thyristors can provide for reduced capacitive energy storage requirements over vacuum interrupters and SCRs in creating a current zero. Additionally. the hardware required in the gate circuit of the GTO is significantly reduced over the counter pulse circuits in vacuum interrupters and SCRs by taking advantage of the turn-off gain available in the GTO. Interrupters designed around the GTO can have applications in the power conditioning and protection circuits of particle accelerators and fusion reactors.

This allows the study of short-distance QCD processes such as high transverse momentum photon-photon and photo-production reactions, deep inelastic Compton scattering, the photon structure function, direct photon reactions, or searches for pseudo-Goldstone bosons and supersymmetry particles like the photino or goldstino. The relative reaction rates should be quite high since (1) photo-production cross sections are significantly larger than the corresponding electro-production cross sections and (2) absence of the conventional beam-beam interaction allows significantly higher currents and smaller interaction areas. It thus seems possible to have photon luminosities much larger than for electrons. Examples are given using the PEP storage ring with the SLAC linac beam.

The rapid cycling Booster (50 Hz) accelerates from 440 MeV to 3 GeV; the 10 Hz main ring is 5 times larger and brings the energy to 30 GeV. The lattices are all of the separated-function type. For avoiding serious beam losses at transition the transition energy is driven far above the top energy of the accelerators. This feature is obtained mainly by creating a superperiodic structure with missing magnet cells and by choosing the horizontal tune just below the number of superperiods.

The construction started in 1981, and the first beam was stored on 10th of Nov. in 1983. The maximum beam current up to this time is 200 mA and the e-folding lifetime of the beam is about 2 hours at the beam current of 100 mA. The injection energy of the ring is 600 MeV, and the injected beam can be accelerated up to 750 MeV. The critical wavelength of the synchrotron, radiation from the ordinary bending magnets is 56.9 A at the electron energy of 600 MeV. A superconducting wiggler of which magnetic field is 4T is installed in 1984. This field strength gives the critical wavelength of 16.2 A0 at 600 MeV. An undulator with permanent magnets was also constructed. Single bunch operation was tried successfully. Some experimental works using synchrotron radiation have just started in 1984.

Over the past few years we have made such magnets using a single size SmCo5 block with up to five easy-axis orientations. The final production scheme is modular in that magnets are built-up from quantized layers. All multipole layers are made in exactly the same way using algorithms differing only by the desired multipole symmetry. The method is simple, efficient and inexpensive and allows a “do-it-yourself” approach to constructing new magnetic elements. For rings these might include focusing optical klystrons, rotatable multipoles for diagnostics, correction or extraction, or possibly combined function systems for the unit cells. A high quality, low-beta, PMQ insertion which can change beta, tune and energy is described as well as the PMS's for the SD and SF elements of the North SLC damping ring. Because these sextupoles will be the first optical use of PM's in storage rings they are discussed in detail together with the advantages, problems and requirements of such applications.

Novel features required include use of multiple beams, beam current amplification in the linac, and manipulation of long beam bunches with a large velocity difference between head and tail. Recent experiments with an intense bright beam of cesium ions have established that much higher currents can be transported in a long quadrupole system than was believed possible a few years ago.

This work is motivated by the need to cool superconducting magnets. Superconducting magnets are used in several advanced technology applications, e.g., magnetic fusion energy, magnetic energy storage, and high-energy physics. Helium is a reliable method for cooling superconducting magnets. There are substantial amounts of data available in the pertinent range of physical parameters, i.e., mass, velocity, and pressure. However, a unified effort to study the effects of all the parameters is still lacking. There is no single correlation available which can predict CHF under different physical conditions and geometrically different test sections. Most of the correlations have been tested for a very limited amount of data. A correlation to predict the boundary vapor quality is also needed. Two separate correlations may have to be developed for burnout of the first and second kind. Since the Soviet data show that the burnout phenomenon in helium is similar to that in steam-water flow, a correlation based upon phenomenological approach can be developed. © 1985, Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957077449

The atomic scattering properties are characterized by phase shifts. In the electron energy range between 50 eV and 1000 eV, five to twenty phase shifts are included. This means every scattered wave contains 25 to 400 partial waves and numerical evaluation is often not possible due to the lack of storage and computer time. The reduced angular momentum expansion is an approximation, which on the one hand is much quicker than the full partial wave expansion and which has a high accuracy on the other hand.

The reason is that the longitudinal revolution frequency spread of the beam which otherwise provides Landau damping vanishes at the transition energy. The amount of the beam dilution near the transition energy is determined by τth, the length of time when the beam stays unstable, and the growth rate of the instability. It is pointed out in this paper that Tth is proportional to the fourth power of γt, and thus the choice of a large γt is not desirable from this point of view.

The wind systems analyzed were: wind assist combustion engines; wind assist electric motors, with and without the sale of surplus electricity; and a stand-alone turbine with a reservoir for water storage. Because of the reduced wind power available and the relatively short time span during the irrigation season, the wind assist turbines will only provide between 6 and 31% of the required energy for pumping water. In all regions, the amount of electrical energy available for sale from the wind assist system is greater than the energy saved. The stand alone turbines can provide all the energy required for pumping the irrigation water; however, their use will require the installation of a reservoir for water storage. Thus, the stand-alone systems are suitable only in locations where surface irrigation systems can be used or where other energy sources can be used to pressurize the water distribution system.

The strongest enhancements are found on substrates that consist of discrete metal particles. A theoretical description for plasmon resonances of such particles is developed, which includes the effects of finite particle size and of dipolar interactions between the particles. Spheroidal particles with dimensions in the range 10-100 nm are found to produce the strongest enhancements; the role of particle interactions in shifting and broadening the plasmon resonances is discussed. Potential applications of the amplified local fields for chemical processes include photochemistry, chemical vapour deposition, and etching. Storage of excitation energy in the bonds to be transformed is necessary for these reactions. The enhanced excitation rate is competing with radiationless energy transfer to the substrate. This rate must be reduced by a spacer layer between metal and adsorbate, in order to obtain a net increase in the population rate of excited states from the enhanced local intensity. Surface enhanced Raman scattering is developing into a powerful analytical tool. The method combines submonolayer sensitivity with the inherent advantages of Raman spectroscopy, i.e. molecular specificity and compatibility with reaction pressure environments. Applications in heterogeneous catalysis for the in situ observation of catalyst surfaces and the detection of surface intermediates are discussed.

The lowest electronic excited state of these compounds can be effective triplet energy sensitizers as evidenced by a maximum quantum yield of 1.0 with (MePh2P)3CuX, The efficiency of the (MePh2P)3CuX sensitizers is unprecedented compared to other reported inorganic complexes used as sensitizers for the NBD/Q system. The (MePh2P)3CuCl sensitizer has an intersystem crossing triplet yield of 1.0 with a triplet lifetime in benzene at room temperature of 3.3 μs. The triplet energy transfer rate constant with NBD is 8 X 107M-1 s-1. While the L3CuX (L = Ph3P, MePh2P) species are the most efficient sensitizers in solution, dissociation of the ligand from the metal in dilute solution detracts from their otherwise attractive features. The much lower quantum efficiency observed for the (Ph3P)3CuX compared to the MePh2P sensitizer is attributed to this extensive ligand dissociation. The coordinately unsaturated (arylphosphine)copper(I) halides produced by ligand dissociation appear to have extremely short lifetimes while the free ligand undergoes photodecomposition. Ground-state complexation of NBD with the coordinately unsaturated (arylphosphine)copper(I) halides is shown to occur in the presence of a large excess of NBD.

Control experiments wherein the catalyst and the pendant groups were omitted revealed negligible stabilization of the n-CdS electrode. Steady-state electrochemical polarization with potential scan reversal of the naked n-CdS samples revealed useful features that could be used as diagnostic criteria for the detection of photoanodic corrosion of the n-CdS surface.

Heavy utilization of LEAR is ushering in a new era where p's achieve their logical potential, equal to that of e-, e+, H-, as controlled probes and experimental building blocks. The uniqueness and usefulness of pÌ„s for studies at low (table top) energies is well documented. IThe main stumbling block to universal pursuit of such studies is the overhead of p production. The stability of the pÌ„ thus makes cogent an investigation of possibilities and limits to transporting pÌ„'s in quantity. I will base my discussion on LEAR as the source of pÌ„'s for bottling, since it is the only concrete example to work with at present. Two other lines of contemporary research then, largely in atomic physics, pioneeredby Dehmelt and collaborators, aimed at precision studies of clouds of, or single e±,p±, or ions in larqe storage time traps.2 Second, there is work, experimental and theoretical, from the plasma physics tradition aimed at characterizing non neutral plasmas.

This objective was achieved through a thorough investigation of such processing variables as: shorter processing times, lower processing temperatures, reduced water usage and combined processing stages. In addition, pre-steaming of the fabric to improve impregnation, activation of chemical reactions, and foam application were investigated. Surveys of current practice showed that energy requirements for cotton and polyester/cotton fabric preparation range between 10 and 30 GJ/tonne of fabric processed. From the work carried out in the project, a procedure is recommended that consumes as little as 3.4 GJ/tonne. The recommended process depends upon the use of a steam purge unit, in which fabric runs counter-current to the flow of steam and, consequently, air is displaced from the fabric. On immersion of the purged fabric into a solution, there is instantaneous and uniform impregnation. To maximize reductions in energy and water consumption, the three separate preparation processes of desizing, scouring and bleaching were combined into a single process. Acceptable preparation of fabrics was obtained; in particular, the procedure for cotton fabrics was to batch the impregnated fabric for 5 hr at 40 degrees C and follow by washing-off and drying. The latter are the only significant energy consuming processes. Attempts to develop a continuous process were only partially successful because it was not possible to identify an optimized procedure. In this process, steaming at atmospheric pressure for a few minutes replaced the storage at 40 degrees C. Preliminary work was carried out with organic stabilizers as an alternative to the use of sodium silicate as stabilizer. On cotton fabric, the results from the use of organic stabilizers indicated a beneficial effect for single-stage preparation, and further work is obviously required. On polyester/cotton fabric their use was more effective than sodium silicate and fabric preparation was similar to, or even better than, conventional preparation. A literature review (122 references) on low-energy processes for textile preparation is attached as an appendix to the report.

The aim of conductor grading is to design a feeder so as to minimise the sum of the capital investment end capitalized energy loss costs for the feeder. In finding such a design several factors such as non-uniform feeder loading, load growth, allowable voltage drop in the feeder, etc, have to be considered, The conductor grading problem being inherently a multi-stags decision problem, can be considered as a dynamic programming problem and has been solved as such, in the past. In this paper a direct solution procedure for conductor grading is proposed, thereby eliminating the complexity of the dynamic programming approach. The proposed solution technique is extremely simple, involves very little computation and needs very little computer storage. Several examples are presented to illustrate the proposed procedure and high-light its advantages.

The light irradiance value used was sufficient to allow the maximal growth rate to be attained, when supplied continuously. Adaptation of O. agardhii to the L/D cycle was characterized by an increase in pigment content and photosynthetic performance, accompanied by a decrease in growth rate. This mode of adaptation resembled the adaptation of O. agardhii to continuous low light intensities. It is suggested that in this case the L/D cycle provokes this adaptation in order to allow the cells to accumulate carbohydrate rapidly during the light period. This was attributed to the storage of polyglucose, which served as a carbon and energy source for growth in the dark. The utilization of polyglucose in the dark was able to sustain the synthesis of all other cell components at the same rate as when cells were growing in the light. The growth yield in the dark, whilst metabolizing internally stored polyglucose, was 0.52 g cell C/g polyglucose C, or 0.62 g cell dry weight/g polyglucose. Although in the pulsed mode there is a 66% loss in light irradiance per 24 h when compared with a continuous light regime, the growth rate of the cyanobacteria grown in the pulsed mode was only 35% lower than the growth rate of a culture grown in continuous light. This can be explained by a high growth yield in the dark and by increased CO2 fixation rates in the light of cells grown in the pulsed mode. © 1985.","carbohydrate accumulation; Cyanobacteria; light intensity adaptation; light/dark cycle; photosynthesis; protein synthesis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342616681

Thermal storage makes it possible to conserve heat which would otherwise be wasted and use it when it is needed. The most graphic example is in solar energy for space heating where maximum gain occurs at the time of minimum demand. Industrial waste heat is another source often out of phase with demand. For space heating, the most common temperature range for storage is 30 degree to 100 degree C. Temperature over 100 degree C and up to about 200 degree C occur with some district heating systems and industrial processes.

At 2 h, propranolol was infused (bolus 100 μg/kg; 1 μg/kg·min) for the remaining 75 min.

A simple, inexpensive method for assessing maternal nutritional status during pregnancy was sought to control for nutrition in the development of fetal growth curves for diverse populations. Triceps skinfold thickness was measured at intervals throughout pregnancy in 60 Ethiopian women. In normally nourished pregnancies this measurement increases in the first two trimesters and decreases in the third, reflecting early pregnancy storage of fat and its release in late gestation to meet the increasing energy needs of the fetus. Ethiopian women who had skinfold thickness increases and decreases as great as those in the United Kingdom (UK) had neonates as heavy as those in the UK. This may mean that Ethiopian fetuses have the same growth potential as those in the UK and that the same growth curves can be used for the two populations. Skinfold thickness measurements may be the means by which nutrition can be controlled as a growth factor in determining the intrinsic fetal growth potentials of diverse populations.

Inborn errors of galactose metabolism have contributed to our understanding of the potential toxicity of this carbohydrate. In addition to the classic acute manifestations of neonatal galactosemia, long-term follow-up of surviving patients have revealed unusual neurodevelopmental and reproductive problems. Many investigators have suggested that the newborn infant can utilize galactose better than adults and that neonatal galactose assimilation exceeds that of glucose. Galactose may be an excellent substitute for glucose among hyperinsulinemic infants of diabetic mothers or premature infants with glucose intolerance. However, until further investigations are performed to define the role of galactose in newborn nutrition and to determine its potential toxicity, galactose should not be used as the primary carbohydrate in sick newborn infants. © 1985 The C.

At all temperatures, strong catecholamine-dependent fluorescence, attributable to the sympathetic innervation, was seen around the blood vessels of BAT from both lean and obese animals. Additionally, catecholamine-dependent fluorescent varicosities, in direct contact with the adipocytes were seen in abundance in lean mice acclimated at 23°, 13° or 4°C and in obese mice acclimated at 13°C. This latter compartment was greatly reduced in lean mice acclimated at 33°C and in obese mice acclimated at 23° and 33°C. Three acute treatments (pretreatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor; 24 h food deprivation; and short-term cold exposure followed by short-term warm exposure) all increased the varicose fluorescence associated with adipocytes in obese mice housed at 23°C, which suggests that the low resting level in these animals is attributable, at least in part, to subthreshold concentrations of catecholamines in existing varicosities rather than the absence of sympathetic varicosities per se. These results are in accordance with the results from noradrenaline turnover studies which suggest that the difference in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in BAT from lean and obese (ob/ob) mice is best demonstrated at normal environmental temperatures. The reduced SNS activity in BAT of obese mice (which our studies show to be at the 'cellular' level) is likely to be a major factor in their reduced non-shivering thermogenesis and resultant high efficiency of energy storage as previously suggested by other workers. © 1985.","brown adipose tissue; catecholamines; fluorescence histochemistry; genetic obesity","catecholamine; adrenergic system; animal experiment; autonomic nervous system; brown adipose tissue; fluorescence; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; soft tissue; temperature acclimatization; Acclimatization; Adrenergic Fibers; Animal; Brown Fat; Catecholamines; Cold; Histocytochemistry; Mice; Mice, Obese; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Temperature; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022384194

In the two bin inventory control system, adipose tissue is viewed as a large storage reservoir which is periodically refilled by means of adjustments made in meal consumption. The gastrointestinal tract is viewed as a smaller bin which triggers renewed food ingestion when it becomes partially emptied. However, reduction in the contents of the adipose tissue bin below a critical level (reorder point quantity) generates a signal to the brain that appropriately modulates meal size and intermeal interval. Because this model evolved to cope with worst case situations, a strong bias for storage in time of plenty is inherent in the system. This fact helps to account for the high prevalence of obesity in energy-rich societies, where, in contrast to the situation that obtains in primitive societies, the energy cost of obtaining food is minimal.",,"central nervous system; diet; energy transfer; human; meal; nonbiological model; normal human; obesity; priority journal; satiety; short survey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022381489

Obese mice had body temperatures 1.0-1.4 °C lower than lean mice in the postprandial state and during ad libitum feeding. During food deprivation, obese mice became more hypother-mic than lean sex-matched controls. A 5 °C fall in body temperature was observed in mutant females in the first 24 h of starvation, about twice that seen in any other experimental group. Over the same period the temperature changes of obese males and lean females were similar and both groups had larger hypothermic responses than lean males. The present results indicate that both genotype and gender affect thermoregulation in these mice. Under normal colony room conditions (ad libitum feeding, 23 °C) the ob/ob mutation is expressed by lower body temperatures which along with hypoactivity and hyperphagia account for the high rates of energy storage. When food availability is limited, females of both phenotypes display an increased capacity to reduce their maintenance energy requirements by lowering body temperatures.

For that purpose, glucose storage and GIT were determined during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in eight elite endurance athletes exercising between 6 and 16 h/week. Their values were compared with those obtained in five nontrained subjects submitted to two OGTT, i.e., before and 16 h after they had performed a 90-min vigorous exercise. As expected, endurance athletes exhibited a reduced GIT and a greater glucose storage during the OGTT in comparison to the preexercise values of nontrained subjects. Once the latter subjects had performed the 90-min exercise, their glucose storage during the OGTT was similar to the level found in athletes. This adaptation was accompanied by a significant reduction in GIT, which corresponded to 47% of the difference observed between trained and nontrained subjects when both groups maintained their usual life habits. Unlike GIT, resting metabolic rate (RMR) was found to be higher in athletes than in nontrained individuals. When subdividing the athletes into two subgroups on the basis of the duration of their weekly training, it was found that RMR was mainly elevated in those performing the higher amount of exercise. These results demonstrate that the reduced GIT characterizing endurance-trained individuals is partly explained by an increase in glucose storage during an OGTT. As further discussed, this reduced GIT is likely an indirect consequence of modifications of other energy-requiring energy processes rather than a direct result of the postexercise increment in glucose storage.",,"glucose; endocrine system; endurance; fitness; human; human experiment; normal human; priority journal; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022372277

Oxygen consumption and the capacity of the host liver to metabolize lactate were studied in isolated hepatocytes from sarcoma-bearing rats (TIH) and pair-fed controls (CH). Basal oxygen consumption (without exogenous substrate) is significantly increased by 65% in the TIH as compared to the CH. The addition of a physiologic concentration of lactate stimulated oxygen consumption over the already stimulated basal state by 13% in the TIH compared to 5% in the CH. When the hepatocytes are incubated with 1.5 mM of [U-14C]lactate, glucose production, lactate oxidation, and entry of lactate carbons into nonsecretory protein are significantly increased in the TIH. Associated with this stimulation is a significant decrease in lactate incorporation into glycogen and lipid in the TIH. This study suggests that the tumor-influenced liver utilizes lactate at an increased rate and its intermediary metabolism is directed toward energy utilization rather than energy storage. The enhanced metabolic processes in the tumor-influenced liver are associated with an increased oxygen consumption which may be a contributory factor to the negative energy balance, a characteristic of cancer cachexia. © 1985.",,"lactic acid; radioisotope; animal cell; cachexia; cancer; energy expenditure; etiology; liver; liver metabolism; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; priority journal; rat; Animal; Energy Metabolism; Lactates; Liver; Male; Methylcholanthrene; Neoplasm Transplantation; Oxygen Consumption; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Sarcoma; Skin Neoplasms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022371160

By means of a hybridization assay, we have shown that the response of hepatic mRNAS14 to T3 and dietary manipulation is analogous to the response of many hepatic lipogenic enzymes. We extend our previous studies by examining mRNAS14 expression and regulation in other lipogenic and nonlipogenic tissues. The relative levels of mRNAS14 expression in three fat depots (epididymal, retroperitoneal, and brown fat) and lactating mammary gland are 10- and 4-fold higher, respectively, than that in euthyroid male liver. Expression of mRNAsu in liver, epididymal fat, and mammary gland is augmented by T3, wherea s feeding a lipogenic diet augments mRNAS14 in liver and fat only. In contrast, the relative levels of mRNAS14 in various nonlipogenic tissues (brain, heart, kidney, lung, spleen, testes, and pituitary) are 7% that in liver or less. Neither diet nor thyroid status influenced mRNAS14 levels in the nonlipogenic tissues. We also found that hepatic mRNAS14 in the 15-day-old rat is expressed at 0.3% of the adult (2-month) hepatic level and increases 186-fold from 15 to 30 days of age. We speculate that low levels of mRNAS14 in neonatal rat liver may be due to high fat in the milk diet. The presence of high basal levels of mRNAS14 in lipogenic tissues and its regulation by T3 and diet suggest that the Spot 14 protein may play an important role in some aspect of synthesis, metabolism, transport, or storage of lipid used in energy production. Further, our results emphasize that the presence of T3 receptors in a tissue is not sufficient to confer T3 regulation of mRNAS14 expression. Additional tissue-specific factors are required for the regulation of the Spot 14 gene. © 1985 by The Endocrine Society.",,"fat; liothyronine; messenger rna; animal cell; animal experiment; breast; coding; cytosol; diet; endocrine system; epididymis fat; heredity; lipogenesis; liver; male genital system; methodology; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Age Factors; Animal; Diet; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Epididymis; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Lipids; Male; Mammae; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; RNA, Messenger; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Translation, Genetic; Triiodothyronine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022367999

We have studied the ability of trehalose, a carbohydrate commonly found at high concentrations in organisms capable of surviving dehydration, to stabilize dry liposomes. With trehalose both inside and outside the bilayer, almost 100% of trapped solute was retained in rehydrated vesicles previously freeze-dried with 1.8 g trehalose/g dry phospholipid. Trehalose is very effective at inhibiting fusion between liposomes during drying, as assessed by freeze-fracture and resonance energy transfer between fluorescent probes incorporated into the bilayer. However, inhibition of fusion alone does not account for the preservation of the dry liposomes, since the concentration of trehalose required to prevent leakage is more than 10-fold that required to prevent fusion. We provide evidence that stabilization of the dry liposomes requires depression of transition temperature and consequent maintenance of the constituent lipids in the dry liposomes in a liquid crystalline phase. © 1985.",,"liposome; trehalose; freeze drying; methodology; nonhuman; preservation; priority journal; Chromatography, Gel; Disaccharides; Freeze Drying; Freeze Fracturing; Liposomes; Models, Molecular; Temperature; Trehalose",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022365706

The reactively sputtered electrodes were formed by deposition onto sputter-deposited films of both iron and conducting indium tin oxide (ITO), while the plasma oxidized electrodes were formed with ITO only. The performance of the electrodes as photoanodes for 02 evolution was found to be strongly dependent on a number of fabrication parameters, the best results being achieved for films formed on ITO and then vacuum annealed, both at 350°C. In this case, the performance matched or exceeded that reported in the literature for other methods of fabrication of polycrystalline iron oxide. Annealing these films in oxygen resulted in a decrease in photocurrent by a factor of three to four, as well as a 0.7V suppression of the photocurrent onset potential. The effect was reversed on reannealing in vacuo. Postfabrication treatment of electrodes in various aqueous solutions was found to effect their performance significantly. More specifically, a substantial enhancement of the photocurrent in the onset region was achieved by treatment in a boiling KSCN solution.

Changes in metabolite concentrations were expressed graphically as percentages of controls using ""crossover"" plots in order to identify transitory rate-controlling steps. The results show that endotoxin administration increased glycolytic flux through pyruvate kinase, inhibited gluconeogenic flux through phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, decreased glycogen storage, shifted cytosolic and mitochondrial redox state from a relatively oxidized to a more reduced state, decreased the extra- and intramitochondrial malate-aspartate and glutamate-α-ketoglutarate shuttle activities, depleted ATP, ADP, and NADP concentrations, and decreased energy charge.

The major objective of this research (Comeau, 1984) was to propose a model that would explain the bio-P removal phenomena under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The model presented here is based on the observations made with bio-P removal processes and on principles of microbial biochemistry. Bio-P bacteria are defined as being responsible for bio-P removal and are proposed to be capable of both polyphosphate (polyP) and poly- beta -hydroxybutyrate (PHB) storage.The limited understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in biological enhanced phosphorus (bio-P) removal has hindered the successful development of this technology for wastewater treatment. The major objective of this research (Comeau, 1984) was to propose a model that would explain the bio-P removal phenomena under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The model presented here is based on the observations made with bio-P removal processes and on principles of microbial biochemistry. Bio-P bacteria are defined as being responsible for bio-P removal and are proposed to be capable of both polyphosphate (polyP) and poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) storage. Under anaerobic conditions (absence of both free oxygen and nitrate) available substrates such as acetate (HAc) will be transported across the membrane by facilitated diffusion. Under usual conditions of pH, most of the acetate will be in the anionic form (Ac-) and one H+ of the proton motive force will be required for Ac- intracellular transport. Once inside Ac- can then be stored as PHB. It is postulated that the mechanism by which polyP confers an advantage to bio-P bacteria for PHB accumulation is by re-establishing the pmf in orde to allow more Ac- to be transported across the membrane and be stored. If the pH gradient of the pmf was not re-established no more Ac- could be accumulated. The pmf is proposed to be re-established by polyP which provides a source of phosphate molecules that can be neutrally transported across the plasma membrane. Once outside, phosphate molecules will dissociate and the released protons (H+) will re-establish the pmf and H+ can be used again for acetate transport. The source of energy required to metabolize acetate into acetyl CoA could possibly come from polyP breakdown. For acetyl CoA to be stored as PHB, a source of NADH is required. NADH can be produced anaerobically from acetyl CoA utilization by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle which functions at a reduced rate under these conditions. Under subsequent aerobic conditions bio-P bacteria now have the advantage of a reserve of PHB that can be used for energy production while any available substrate in solution is heavily competed for by other aerobic bacteria. Energy is produced aerobically from PHB via acetyl CoA metabolized in the TCA cycle to produce NADH which is oxidized at the electron-transport chain (ETC) in the presence of oxygen (or nitrate) in order to expel protons and thus establish the pmf. The pmf is used to form ATP which can be converted to polyP for storage. The availability of PHB can result in a high intracellular ATP to ADP ratio. Thus polyP can be accumulated and bio-P bacteria can grow and multiply. Therefore, the proper sequencing of environmental conditions in the waste treatment reactors results in anaerobic exposure to simple substrates such as acetate which are stored with the assistance of polyP. This is followed by aerobic conditions where polyP accumulates and phosphorus is removed from the wastewater. The proposed models were found to provide not only very satisfactory explanations for the observed phenomena related to bio-P removal, but were also found to be of a very valuable predictive power to assess the pertinence of a design or of an operational modification for upgrading a bio-P treatment plant (Comeau, 1984).",,"Biochemistry; Phosphorus compounds; SANITARY ENGINEERING - Research; Sewage bacteriology; BIOCHEMICAL MODEL; BIOLOGICAL ENHANCED PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL; POSTER PAPER; Sewage treatment; phosphorus; bacterium; biological model; model; nonhuman; sewage treatment; therapy; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022344820

Since the majority of osseous metastases involve axial sites, dual-energy scanned projection radiography may be a useful adjunctive modality in the management of oncology patients. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers.","Bone neoplasms; Bone neoplasms; Bone neoplasms; Diagnosis; Digital; Dual-energy; Metastases; Radiography; Secondary; Subtraction","bone; bone metastasis; case report; computer analysis; diagnosis; digital radiography; human; kidney; lymphatic system; male genital system; methodology; priority journal; article; bone tumor; image subtraction; metastasis; radiography; radiology; tomography; Bone Neoplasms; Human; Subtraction Technique; Technology, Radiologic; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022340656

Increasing substrate availability to working muscle can improve exercise tolerance but the effect on muscle energy metabolism has not been studied. Using phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) we examined forearm muscle ATP, phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (P(i)) and pH in a McArdle patient (MP) and two healthy subjects (HS) at rest and during intermittent maximal effort handgrip contractions under control conditions (CC) and during intravenous glucose infusion (GI). Under CC, MP gripped to impending forearm muscle contracture in 130 s with a marked decline in muscle PCr and a dramatic elevation in P(i). During GI MP exercised easily for &gt;420 s at higher tensions and with attenuated PCr depletion and P(i) accumulation. In HS, muscle PCr and P(i) changed more modestly and were not affected by GI. In MP and HS, ATP changed little or not at all with exercise. The results suggest that alterations in the levels of muscle PCr and P(i) but not ATP are involved in the muscle fatigue in McArdle's disease and the improved exercise performance during glucose infusion.",,"child; clinical article; diagnosis; glucose infusion; glycogen storage disease type 5; human; muscle; muscle fatigue; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022339474

An efficient and stable quadratic programming active set algorithm is used to solve for the optimal release policies. The stability and convergence of the solution algorithm are ensured by the factorization of the reduced Hessian matrix and the accurate computation of the Lagrange multipliers. The quadratic model is compared with a simplified linear model and it is found that optimal release schedules are robust to the choice of model, both yielding an increase of nearly 27% in the total annual energy production with respect to conventional operation procedures, although the quadratic model is more flexible and of general applicability.

Now energy required for pumping must be purchased at a substantially increased cost. However, energy generated in the Project can be sold with maximum revenues at times of peak electrical demand. To determine the most efficient operation schedules for the SWP, a coordinated set of models was developed for execution in “real-time.” This set of models includes network flow programming models, a number of other simulation models, and a large-scale linear programming (LP) model designed to determine optimal flows throughout the California aqueduct system, given the energy demands for pumping, energy generation capabilities and water demands.

This paper describes the design and performance of single‐well tracer tests utilizing multilevel observation wells at a field site near Mobile, Alabama. In a given observation well, a total of 7 sampling zones were isolated using inflatable packers and silicone rubber plugs. All instrumentation was contained within a removable insert that extended from the well bottom to the land surface. Each sampling zone contained an electrical conductivity probe and was connected to the surface with two lengths of vacuum tubing. When combined with peristaltic pumps, the tubing allowed mixing of the sampling zone contents as well as water sample collection. A total of 5 experiments were performed using bromide as a conservative tracer. Results showed that the sampling zones were well isolated and that sampling zone mixing was necessary to achieve results that were independent of probe placement within a given zone. Both electrical conductivity and bromide concentration breakthrough curves indicated the presence of a high horizontal permeability zone in the bottom third of the aquifer, although the concentration data were considered the more accurate and reliable. Permeability values based on tracer travel times from the injection‐recovery well to the multilevel observation well varied by a factor of 4 over the aquifer thickness. Such results are reasonably consistent with permeability trends inferred during thermal energy storage experiments performed previously at the same site.

Torques, angular velocities, and power of the ankle joint during plantar flexion were measured in jumping experiments in order to achieve insight into shape and magnitude of the instantaneous torque-angular velocity relation in a complex movement. Twelve trained subjects performed maximal vertical jumps from a semi-squatting position with 100° of flexion in the knee joint. Ground reaction force measurements and film analyses were used to calculate instantaneous torques, angular velocities, and power outputs during plantar flexion. The shape of the instantaneous torque-angular velocity was different from the well-known hyperbolic force-velocity relation for isolated muscles. Maximal power output (2499 ± 751 [SD] W) occurred at 60% of the mean maximal torque (301 ± 62 N-m) and 80% of the mean maximal angular velocity (970° /s). The maximal power output was six times larger than the power output reported in the literature for maximal isokinetic (monoarticular) plantar flexions. Influences like storage of energy in the series elastic component of Hill's muscle model and the role of polyarticular muscles in transporting energy from knee to ankle are discussed. It is concluded that many more selective studies will be necessary before it is possible to relate intrinsic muscle properties to the performance of muscles in poly-articular complex movements. © 1985 by the American college of Sports Medicine.","Bi-articular muscles; Force-velocity relation; Isokinetic dynamometer","adult; central nervous system; clinical article; diagnosis; human; human experiment; jumping; muscle; musculoskeletal system; normal human; plantar flexion; volleyball; Ankle Joint; Biomechanics; Human; Sports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022262332

These plantships would tap a virtually unlimited source of energy for economical production of hydrogen by water electrolysis. Hydrogen could be delivered to U.S. users from such plantships via hydrogen liquefaction, transport and storage, or by incorporation in a chemical carrier and shipment by conventional transport methods. Costs of OTEC energy in the form of liquid fuels delivered to U.S. users are estimated to be favorable compared with equivalents derived from land-based sources after 1990. The paper briefly reviews the status of OTEC technology and projected costs for plantship construction and deployment. This provides a basis for a more detailed description of the onboard processes and costs for production of hydrogen, ammonia and methanol on OTEC plantships. Estimated costs for the three fuels delivered to U.S. ports are: liquid hydrogen $41-66 MBtu, ammonia $10-16 MBtu-1, methanol $9-14 MBtu-1 (1983$).

The study consisted of first analyzing the heat flow through a single wall and considering various boundary conditions on the inside. The boundary conditions were: constant inside air tempeture throughout the day, variable inside air temperature on a 24-hour cycle, and variable inside air temperature on a 48-hour cycle. Next, the heat flow through walls was studied through a thermal network analysis of a simple building. In this case it was assumed that the ambient air temperature (following a periodic distribution) was increased suddenly and followed this new distribution for many days thereafter. It was concluded that walls with high thermal inertia or time constant can store coolness for several days. The larger the time constant of the wall (for example adobe as compared with brick) the longer it takes for the wall temperature to reach a steady periodic distribution after the change has occurred. However, because of low thermal conductivity of adobe, the retrieval of the stored coolness in these walls is slow, and the mean daily temperature of the room air in the adobe building does not change appreciably beyond seven days after the change. Increase of the wall thickness beyond 50 cm does not improve the thermal performance of the building significantly. © 1985.",,"AIR CONDITIONING; BRICK - Thermal Properties; ENERGY STORAGE; HEAT TRANSFER - Analysis; ADOBE WALLS; BUILDINGS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022241973

A DGSR value is the product of two factors: a seasonal low-frequency component, principally due to the sun's periodic movement, and a random component due to rapid fluctuations of the atmospheric environment. Methods are provided to automatically separate and estimate both components from the available (generally short) DGSR records. Hence, other series describing the sun-position evolution or any kind of atmospheric conditions are not necessary. An illustrative example is included which results in a good global agreement between simulated and original sequences. © 1985.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; AUTOMATIC MODELLING; DAILY GLOBAL SOLAR RADIATION (DGSR); SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022239378

Path numbers increase combinatorially without bound as path length increases, at much faster rates with energy storage than without. Energy flows over only very short paths in the nonstorage case, but with storage present most flow is associated with long paths. Cycling results. A cycling index modified from the literature standard to include storage shows 11% cycling in the subject model. Energy does cycle in ecosystems; it differs from matter in its dissipation, not cycling, characteristics. A new result is the role of storage in diversifying path structure and increasing flows in networks. The basis for this is examined through influence theory of mathematical graphs, with the conclusion that energy storage as biomass is the root cause of ecosystem energy cycling. Issues of food chain length and embodied energy are reviewed in light of the long paths and related energy flows present in even small order models. © 1985.",,"community energy cycling; oyster; reef",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022229814

The tempo of geologic events is a function of the rate of energy input and the capacity and competence of the energy storage buffer. Buffers release energy at rates that range from catastrophic to gradual. External events can act as triggers, one event entraining another in its rhythm, but most geologic episodes are probably inherent in the processes that produce them.

During winter a large excavated reservoir is filled with a snow/ice mixture produced by a snow machine of the type used in ski resorts. At the end of the cold season the ice is covered with insulation. When cooling is needed, chilled water is pumped from the pond, and, after being warmed by the load, the water is returned to the pond. Since the ice in the ice pond is porous, it forms a very effective heat exchanger. Water can be extracted at temperatures between 0 and 1°C, thus providing excellent potential for dehumidification. Experimental ice ponds have been built and operated from 1980 to 1982, and a full scale ice pond (with 10,000 m3 capacity) has been built to supply cooling for a 12,000 m2 office building.

The exercise-induced body weight increases which are seen in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were not found in Siberian hamsters. Instead, the Siberian hamsters maintained their body weights, compensating for the increased energy demands of exercise by increasing their food intakes. Exercise did not affect carcass composition. Melatonin treatment decreased food intake and carcass lipid stores but did not affect voluntary exercise. The previously reported decrease in testis weight was seen in all melatonin-treated hamsters, but the stimulation of brown adipose tissue growth was not.

Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights, NY 10598, United States","The use of electron beams for contactless testing of electrical functions and electrical integrity of different active devices in VLSI - chips - has been demonstrated over the past years. This method of testing electronic networks is based on an electron probe which is moved from point to point in the network and a current of secondary electrons emitted in response to the impingement of the probe is converted to a signal indicating the presence of a voltage or varying potential at the different points. Voltage contrast, electron beam induced current, dual potential approach, stroboscopic techniques and other methods have been developed and are used to detect different functional failures in devices. Very little attention in most of the applications has been paid to the electron optical environment, mostly SEM's were upgraded or converted to do the job of a ""voltage contrast"" machine. This by no means will satisfy all requirements and new thoughts will have to be given to aspects such as: low voltage electron guns, two lens systems, different means of detection, signal processing and storage are a few of them. Besides the VLSI application, the contactless testing of three dimensional conductor networks of a 10 cm × 10 cm × .8 cm multilayer ceramic poses a different and new application. The mechanism of electron-solid interaction, the secondary electron generation, the energy distribution, the secondary electron yield, are important parameters to understand for any electron beam test technique. According to the secondary electron yield curve in Figure 1, floating samples can be charged positively or negatively with respect to ground, depending on the primary electron energy. The surface potential of a sample in turn determines the impact energy of the primary electrons and also energy of the secondaries that leave the surface. These two effects generate different voltage contrasts to be used in electron beam testing. The test method for packages uses multiple electron beams to both generate and detect voltage differences between the surface terminations of conductors in order to identify opens and short in the package networks. © 1985.",,"ELECTRON BEAMS; ELECTRON OPTICS; CONTACTLESS TESTING; ELECTRON-BEAM TEST TECHNIQUES; ELECTRON-SOLID INTERACTION; SECONDARY ELECTRONS; INTEGRATED CIRCUIT TESTING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022204065

Based on Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) statistics and considering carriers tunneling between the metal and interface states, occupation functions of both donor- and acceptor-like interface states at arbitrary energy level within the semiconductor band gap are derived and analyzed. It reveals that, for the same energy level, the occupation functions of donor-like and acceptor-like interface states are remarkably different in magnitude. The deviation in occupation functions of these two types of interface states is a nonlinear function of the ratio of capture cross-section of the charge states to that of the neutral states (CC/CN) and the semiconductor surface conditions. If the insulating layer (SiO2) is relatively thick (&gt; 50 Å) or thin (&lt; 10 Å), interface states are in equilibrium with the semiconductor or the metal, respectively. Under the circumstances, the occupation functions of the two types of interface states are no longer distinguishable. Alternatively, they can be approximated by the well-known Fermi-Dirac distribution function. In this paper, quantitative influences of key parameters of MIS tunnel structures such as insulating layer thickness, electron and hole density at the semiconductor surface, capture cross-sections for charged and neutral states, etc., on interface states occupation function are discussed. For Gaussian-distributed donor- and acceptor-like interface states, the quantitative roles of interface states in charge storage and current-assisting effects are also demonstrated. © 1985.",,"SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - Analysis; BAND GAP; INSULATING LAYER THICKNESS; INTERFACE STATES; MIS TUNNEL STRUCTURES; OCCUPATION FUNCTIONS; SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES, MIS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022195527

The first five years of the IEA program on hydrogen have seen considerable progress made towards the common goal of developing cost-effective, high-efficiency water-splitting technologies for use with renewable or inexhaustible energy sources. The past achievements and present programs are described. The current perception of the potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier is examined to permit a critical appraisal of the relevance of the content and scope of the cooperative program.

The principle behind this technique is that, if a laser beam with a known spatial distribution such as a Gaussian profile is used for imaging, the radius of the thermal image formed depends uniquely on the intensity of the impinging beam. Thus by measuring the radii of the images produced for different incident beam intensities the minimum intensity necessary (that is, the threshold) for thermographic imaging is found. The diameter of the laser beam can also be found from this measurement. A simple analysis based on the temperature distribution in the laser heated material shows that there is an inverse square root dependence on pulse duration or period of exposure for the energy fluence of the laser beam required, both for the threshold and the subsequent increase in the size of the recording. It has also been shown that except for low intensity, long duration exposure on very low conductivity materials, heat losses are not very significant. © 1985.","carbon photographic paper; laser; thermographic recording","LASER BEAMS - Applications; THERMOGRAPHY; CARBON PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER; HEAT LOSSES; THERMOGRAPHIC RECORDING; THRESHOLD ENERGY; DATA STORAGE, OPTICAL",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022181080

Heat is exchanged across sediment‐atmosphere and sediment‐water interfaces at differing states of the tide. This takes place within the context of seasonal changes in the temperature of the atmospheric boundary layer, and sea and river water. Subsurface heat flux in an intertidal mudflat near Grangemouth in the Forth Estuary, Scotland, was determined over a full seasonal range of ambient conditions during 1981. Measurements of temperature and weather variables were made from a 4.3m high instrument tower. Thermal properties of the muddy sediment were determined under laboratory conditions. Heat flux in and out of a 0.1 m deep surface layer of mud was calculated. Time of high water exerts a strong control over net heat flux in a 24 hour period. This is due to variation in heat exchange across the sediment‐water interface during tidal inundation, and across the sediment‐atmosphere interface at low water. The relationship between time of high water and net heat flux during inundation follows a broadly similar form at all seasons. Season, however, determines the magnitude of heat exchanges.

The theoretical results were found to be very sensitive to a variation in the activation energy. There is a satisfactory agreement between experimental and theoretical results when the layer is sufficiently thick (approximately L > 0.5 cm). Because the Biot number declines with the decrease in layer thickness the deviation of theory from experiment occurs at low L. Oxygen consumption near the hot surface (∼ 15 %) has only a minor effect on the temperature of ignition. The sedimentation of dusts on hot surfaces is a frequently occurring phenomenon in many branches of industry. These situations may cause spontaneous ignition due to self-heating and, subsequently, a fire. Similar problems occur in the case of storage and transportation of powders and reactive materials. An evaluation of the minimum temperature of a hot surface which ignites a thin slab of a pulverized solid is a basic problem well known in the literature on thermal explosion, and has been a subject of many experimental [1-4] and theoretical [5-10] studies. Recently, an important step has been taken toward the unification of the experimental methods used to determine the critical ignition temperature of the porous slab heated from below [4].

This analysis differs from similar previous analyses for water heating systems in that a control scheme more typical of air heating systems is used: collector output may go directly to either storage or the load. The IDPM is compared to simulations using a fully mixed model of storage and a single-phase model of storage. The comparisons show that the IDPM is more accurate than the mixed model and requires considerably less computation time than simulations using the single-phase model.

Here we review performance achievements for a variety of pulsed and CW laser configurations including single-mode, multimode, and mode-locked resonators, high-power amplifiers, and zig-zag slabs. In these configurations, operating performance levels have been demonstrated that are comparable to those of older, more familiar solid-state laser technologies.

The intense radiation available at 33 keV photon energy used in DSA provides maximum sensitivity to intraarterial iodine and essentally eliminates contrast due to nonvascular body structures. Arteries can be visualized with high resolution in spite of their constant motion. So far, high energy storage rings are required to produce hard X-rays at 33 keV in sufficient intensity. For a dedicated source a lower energy and therefore smaller storage ring at reduced cost would be desirable. In this paper the potential and limitations of low energy storage rings as dedicated radiation sources for DSA are discussed. With high field pulsed magnets in a 1.2 to 1.5 GeV storage ring of about 10 m diameter the required photon intensity can be provided for DSA. Several photon beam lines can be installed at such a ring and of the order of 10,000 patients per year and beam line could be screened.

The storage ring, which will accept the light ion beams from the existing k=200, multi-stage cyclotron facility, requires an electron beam variable in energy from about 7 to 275 keV. The electron beam system consists of a high perveance electron gun with Pierce geometry and a flat cathode. The gun and a 28 element accelerating column are immersed in a uniform longitudinal magnetic guide field. A computer modeling study of the system was conducted to determine electron beam density and transverse temperature variations as a function of anode region and accelerator column design parameters. Transverse electron beam temperatures (Et - mc2β2γ(θH+θV))of less than a few tenths of an electron volt at a maximum current density of 0.4 A/cm2 are desired over the full energy range. This was achieved in the calculations without the use of resonant focusing for a 2 Amp, 275 keV electron beam. Some systematics of the electron beam temperature variations with system design parameters are presented. A short discussion of the mechanical design of the proposed electron beam system is also given.

We describe the relation of luminosity to other quantities of interest to the machine users, such as energy spread, beam sizes or polarization. For example, the maximum event rate on a narrow resonance may not correspond to the condition of maximum luminosity. Partial control of beam parameters is available through damping partition number variation, coupling adjustment, wigglers, etc. but a proper estimation of the necessary operating conditions must include a self-consistent, realistic treatment of the beam-beam effects which also determine performance. The established correlation between theory and simulation of the beam-beam effect in several regimes has been exploited in the search for good working points. Single particle stability (dynamic aperture) has been improved at the same time.

In the main tunnel (170 m radius) are the Collector ring, which collects 5 Booster pulse trains, the 10 Hz Driver synchrotron and the dc Extender ring, where beam is stored for slow resonant extraction.

Thus the RO technique is very attractive for desalination of brackish water. The basic principles as well as the energy requirements of the RO system are discussed here. A simplified approach to optimize the system parameters, so that the energy consumption per m3 of desalinated water is a minimum, is given in this work. Because of the high cost of PV energy, a recovery unit is recommended and it is shown here that a considerable amount of energy demand can be economized using that unit. A proposed design for the recovery unit is discussed. The characteristics of a PV powered RO system are studied for tropical climate conditions where many consecutive cloudy days are unlikely to occur (the climatic conditions of Egypt have been considered). In the design given here, the system is assumed to work during daytime hours only to minimize the required battery storage size.

Two types of cells have been tested. A first class uses the mixed ionic solid RbAg4I5 together with a silver anode. The second one uses β-Al2O3, xNa2O together with sodium-doped (CH)x. Both fulfill the objective of being able to discharge at room temperature. In addition to the usual performances such as voltage, current, capacity, weight, shape, etc., we give the results over 4 yr of investigations on the discharge life and storage life. Many practical problems have been encountered, especially in the case of the sodium-polyacetylene battery. They are also reported, as well as some improvements made during that period such as encapsulation, diffusion inhibitors, and separation of the components until the first charge. The conclusion is that polyacetylene is proved to be a useful electrode material in solid-state batteries at the laboratory level. The possible further development to reach the industrial stage is discussed in terms of lifetime energy, density, and cost. © 1985, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

Typical pressure variation includes a random component (referred to as measurement noise) due primarily to measurement error and a systematic component (referred to as process noise) due to various internal and external disturbances such as offshore tides, temperature changes, and pump action. Much of the systematic component can be removed through time series modeling, with residuals from the model representing the random component. This paper addresses the estimation of the noise components through time series models applied to test data. Effectiveness of leak-detection algorithms based on test statistics (e.g. two-minute averages of pressure readings) can be determined from known or estimated standard deviations of the process and measurement noise components. The U.S. Department of Energy (operator of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) plans to use the results of the time series analysis, together with hydraulic models, in order to establish leak-detection procedures that will meet Environmental Protection Agency requirements. © 1985.",,"PETROLEUM PRODUCTS - Storage; STATISTICAL METHODS - Time Series Analysis; BRINE PIPELINES; STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE; PIPELINES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022121501

When an external field is applied, the direction of magnetization is assumed to curl parabollicaly near the 90° walls. The 90° wall will move to decrease the energy associated with this curling. This movement can be described by the equation of rotational motion for the wall. The switching time relating to a 90° wall is fairly short (6 - 18 nsec) calculated by solving the equation of motion.

The crystal texture and preferred orientation of sputtered Co-Ni films were determined by x-ray diffraction technique. The chemical composition and distribution of non-metallic elements of sputtered films were studied by energy dispersive analysis of xray and scanning Auger microprobe respectively. Scanning and transmission electron microscopes were used to study the structure and morphology of the films. The sputtered Co-Ni films were found to have a simultaneous presence of [0002] and [1010] orientations with a stable HCP structure. The change of preferred orientation of Co-Ni films with thickness (500A to 1um) resulted in dramatic changes in coercivity, squareness ratio and the shape of the M-H hysteresis loops of the films. It appeared that the magnetic behavior of these films was predominantly controlled by the texture of the films and was less sensitive towards the thickness. © 1985, IEEE.

The importance of such loads is twofold. First, they account for a significant portion of power system dynamics following a power outage. Second, because they are associated with energy storage, they are often selected for load shedding within a load management program. The derivation of the aggregate electrical dynamics is considered first for a homogeneous group of devices. Subsequently, a perturbation analysis yields the dynamics for a nonhomogeneous group. The homogeneous group aggregrate load model is a system of coupled ordinary and partial differential equations (Fokker-Planck equations). It is obtained by writing evolution equations for the probability density of a hybrid-state Markov system used to model the switching dynamics of individual devices. This result is new and could give a clue to the analysis of a broad class of hybrid-state stochastic systems. In turn, this could provide a new impetus not only in the area of electric load modeling but other areas such as power system reliability and the design of relay control systems, where stochastic hybrid-state models occur frequently. Simulation results which illustrate the dynamical properties of the model are presented. © 1985 IEEE",,"CONTROL SYSTEMS, STOCHASTIC; ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS - Load Management; HEATING - Electric; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; PROBABILITY - Random Processes; ELECTRIC LOAD MODELING; MARKOV PROCESSES; STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS; SWITCHED SYSTEMS; AIR CONDITIONING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022118190

And the dependence of their crystal structure and magnetic properties on preparation conditions, especially on ion bombardment onto film surface during deposition, has been investigated. All films are composed fine crystallites of which size and magnetic ordering depend significantly on the kinetic energy of the bombarding ions. On the condition of bombarding ion energy around 115 eV, saturation magnetization 4πMs takes the maximum of 21 kG, and coercive force Hc takes the minimum about 1 Oe. These results indicate that the bombardment of argon ions with proper energy results in an improvement of atomic ordering and macro-structural uniformity in the films. Electrical resistivity p also depends on the ion energy. p of the films with high 4πMs and low Hc is rather high about 40 µΩ.cm.

A chemical reaction superimposed upon the system will transform the molecules of some of the chemical species into molecules of other species, whose rheological character, namely their ability to relax stored mechanical stress, will differ. The energy of deformation that was put into the molecules that have reacted will then either be converted into heat directly or be first transferred as potential energy of deformation to the mechanisms of the resultant species and only then follow the relaxation paths of these molecules into heat. The chemical reaction thus represents an alternative and parallel pathway of stress relaxation. A model involving a linearly viscoelastic system subject to a series of linear monomolecular interconversions is presented. The differential equation describing the time rate of stress is derived and discussed. A stored energy distribution matrix is introduced and its properties are defined. It will be assumed, in this paper, that the energy stored in molecules that are being chemically transformed is totally dissipated into heat during the reaction. The resultant changes in the relaxation time spectrum are illustrated and characterized by calculating the frequency dependence of the transient in dynamic storage and loss modulus of the system as the chemical reaction is suddenly started. Formulas for other deformation histories are also presented. The integrals in the cases here considered can all be solved analytically. © 1985, The Society of Rheology.

Fuel degradation was monitored in the presence of the following added specific compounds: 2,5-dimethylpyrrole (DMP), N-methyl pyrrole (NMP), thiophenol, thiophene, decanethanol, dibutyl sulphide, dibutyl disulphide, tetrahydrothiophene, hexadiene, 1-hexene, indene, iron(II), and copper(II)-phthalocyanines (FePc, CuPc) and mixtures of some of these at various temperatures. The light scattering results are correlated with extent of deposit formation, which is an accepted measure of stability, and with oxygen uptake results. Light scattering intensity, weight of deposit and oxygen uptake increase with increase in storage time, concentration of added specific compound and stress temperature. Temperature variations of these measurements give activation energies of the degradation reactions. The first direct evidence has been obtained of the pyrrole radicals in DMP and NMP when a fuel is degraded in the presence of pyrrole. These two pyrrole radicals give different electron paramagnetic resonance parameters: g and linewidth values. The degradation products obtained in the presence of FePc and CuPc show properties which indicate that CuPc interacts with petroleum JP-5 with added DMP more strongly than does FePc. © 1985.","jet fuel; petroleum; storage stability","FUELS - Storage; DEGRADATION; JET FUELS; PETROLEUM; LIQUID FUELS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022112013

The studies were conducted mainly for samples deposited at 300 and 450 °C. The dc conduction behavior of the samples was similar for all deposition temperatures at fields below 0.25 MV/cm and at temperatures between 25 and 325 °C. The conduction was ohmic and polarity independent, characterised by an activation energy decrease above 120 °C and an increase above ∼200 °C. Activation energies were higher (0.6 - 1.0 eV) than those of ac conduction (0.05-0.4 eV). The effect of adsorbed moisture or a mix of electron hop and ionic conduction, or a combination of all three, were suggested as possible mechanisms. A sample deposited at the high temperature of 450 °C was ohmic up to breakdown, but the one deposited at the low temperature of 300 °C showed a space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) effect at fields above 0.25 MV/cm and room temperature. Charge storage by the MoZrO2-Mo samples increased linearly with voltage and increased with temperature. At any voltage and temperature, the sample deposited at 300 °C had roughly double the charge storage of the one deposited at 450 °C. Charge storage was polarity independent at 25 and 60 °C, but showed a polarity dependence at 90 °C that was ascribed to the remanence of previous charging. © 1985.",,"ELECTRON BEAMS - Applications; FILMS - Preparation; ZIRCONIUM COMPOUNDS - Electric Conductivity; CHARGE STORAGE; ELECTRON BEAM DEPOSITION; SPACE-CHARGE-LIMITED-CURRENT EFFECT; ZIRCONIA THIN FILM CAPACITORS; CAPACITORS, CERAMIC",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022107384

The program, known as the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, includes intensive geologic characterization of about 40km2 and construction of an underground test facility. The gravity survey reported here is part of the geologic site characterization. The gravity survey was conducted to delineate structural features near and at the proposed site. However, during the survey the gravity field was found to be dominated by effects of lateral density variations within relatively flat-lying strata. Particularly distinctive is a pattern of elongate negative anomalies about one-half mGal in amplitude. Boreholes in the anomalies encountered normal stratigraphy and no unusual geologic structures. However, borehole densilogs showed lower densities and uphole velocity surveys showed lower acoustic velocities than are measured outside of the anomalies. The low densities adequately account for the observed gravity anomalies. The regional stratigraphy contains water-soluble minerals (halite, polyhalite, anhydrite-gypsum, carbonates). Much of this material has dissolved and the region has been identified as a karstland. At the site, dissolution is slowly affecting the Rustler formation overlying the main salt-bearing units. The low rock densities, associated with the negative gravity anomalies, are interpreted as due to alteration in the vicinity of solution conduits within the Rustler formation. This interpretation is supported by (1) partial coincidence between the negative gravity anomalies and closed topographic depressions (alluvial dolines); (2) greater anhydrite-to-gypsum conversion detected in boreholes within the anomalies; and (3) solution conduits encountered in one of the boreholes. © 1985 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",,"Acoustic wave velocity measurement; Boreholes; Gypsum; Pilot plants; Salt deposits; Sodium chloride; Software testing; Stratigraphy; Transuranium elements; GEOLOGY - Stratigraphy; RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS - Storage; Density variations; Department of Energy; Geologic characterization; Geologic structures; High precision gravity survey; Low-level radioactive wastes; Structural feature; Waste isolation pilot plants; Geological surveys; GEOPHYSICS; RADIOACTIVE WASTE REPOSITORIES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022068904

This is due in part to the limited availability and high cost of suitable equipment for small‐diameter boreholes. In this study, drillstem tests were performed in exploratory boreholes to evaluate the hydraulic characteristics of a proposed compressed air energy storage site in central Illinois. The tests were conducted in small‐diameter coreholes (vertical and inclined) at depths up to 610 meters (2000 ft) using a drillstem tool designed and field‐tested by the authors. Field data were analyzed using semilog and curve‐matching techniques. Values of hydraulic conductivity obtained by the two methods were generally in very good agreement. The curve‐matching method allowed for calculation of wellbore storage and an estimation of well‐bore damage (skin effect). Test results indicate that exploratory boreholes were severely damaged by the coring process. In the presence of wellbore damage, slug test hydraulic conductivities were significantly lower than those given by drillstem tests conducted in the same zones. The sole use of slug tests would have underestimated hydraulic conductivity and led to erroneous conclusions regarding site conditions. The drillstem test methodology described herein offers a cost‐effective technique for measuring representative values of hydraulic conductivity in single boreholes. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell.

The gases used are H2-Ar, D2-Ar and H2-D2-Ar mixtures. The absorption rates of the hydrogen isotopes are confirmed to be fast enough so that this absorption method can be used as a hydrogen recovery process in the fuel cycle of a fusion reactor. The length of the absorption zone for D2 in the zirconium bed is about twice as long as that for H2. For the breakthrough of hydrogen isotopes in the H2-D2-Ar mixture, the hydrogen isotopes flow out in the sequence of D2, HD and H2. The major reason is believed to be that the absorption rate and the solubility of hydrogen are greater than those of D2.

The program reported here treats the complete equations for combined free and forced convection in a vertical annulus. It allows for viscosity and density variation with temperature, and a variable heat flux or temperature at the walls. It was developed from a similar program for circular tubes. Comparisons are made with published data for velocity profiles and heat transfer performance. These are good, and show the step‐wise energy balance method is necessary and valid. The strategy of generation of the required data is explained, together with sample output. These data are themselves analysed computationally; the performance equations agree with original predictions typically to within ± 11 per cent, with a standard deviation of around 2 per cent.

The required air storage mass for a particular CAES generation/compression cycle is a function of both the total air mass withdrawn (during generation) and the total air mass added (during compression). Thus, the air storage mass is dependent upon both the air mass flow rates and daily operating times for the individual turbine and compressor selected. The volumetric requirements of the underground cavities are examined as a function of geologic formation and inlet pressure. While constant volume air storage in a salt formation is emphasized air storage in a variable volume compensated rock cavern, and variable pressure storage In an aquifer are also discussed. Both a daily and weekly compression cycle are addressed and the affect of duty cycle on the compressor train selection is shown.

Model experiments using a modified double cantilever beam test have been made on aligned composite materials tested in 0·6M HCI. The rate of crack growth normal to the fibre direction depends on stress intensity. The crack-tip fracture processes for cracks growing in the velocity range 10−9 to 2 × 10−8 m S−l have been determined using fractographic techniques. The stresses in the fibres before fracture at the crack tip have been estimated from the size of the mirror zones. A major feature of stress corrosion is the planar nature of the crack surface and, at low stress intensities, fracture occurs without interface cracking or debonding. An estimate of the strain energy release rate has been made from an analysis of the stress fields at the crack tip and the mechanisms of crack growth. The results are in reasonably good agreement with experimentally determined values. © 1985 The Institute of Metals.",,"ACIDS; CORROSION - Stress Corrosion Cracking; PRESSURE VESSELS - Plastics Applications; SOLUTIONS; TANKS - Plastics Applications; ACIDIC SOLUTIONS; CRACK GROWTH; FRACTURE MECHANISMS; PIPES; PLASTIC STORAGE TANKS; PLASTICS, REINFORCED",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022037590

The degradation, e.g., the lowering of heat of crystallization and of crystallization temperature, is thought to be caused by both the decrease in molecular weight of polyethylene due to thermal oxidative decomposition and the crosslinking between produced radicals. With the increase in the degree of crosslinking and branching in a molecular-chain which has low bond dissociation energy, thermal-deterioration of polyethylene proceeded more rapidly. The deterioration depended mainly on the accumulated holding time at the highest temperature, and this was shown by comparison with a continuous heating experiment at the highest holding temperature, 150°C. Polyethylene pellets can endure long periods of practical heat-cycling as a thermal storage material if they are treated with radical scavengers and if the degrees of their crosslinking are properly controlled. © 1985, The Society of Polymer Science, Japan.

One of the important reliability indices is the loss-of-load probability (LOLP), so its dependence on the design parameters is modelled. The special role that the battery storage can play to fulfil the desired reliability level (RL) is clearly demonstrated. For a given size of solar cells array (SCA), an econometric model of LOLP is developed to yield the incremental change in the system's total lifetime costs on modifying the LOLP level. The effect of the failure rate of each system component on the SPV reliability level has been estimated and is fully discussed. The behaviour of the SPV reliability level with SCA tilt angle and series-parallel configuration is established under the prevailing working conditions. The significance of the relationship between the preventive maintenance schedule for each of the system components and its reliability is analysed, resulting in a new chart that enables schedules which yield the required system reliability to be planned directly. © 1985.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; FAILURE ANALYSIS; RELIABILITY - Mathematical Models; PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER SYSTEM; SOLAR POWER PLANTS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022027969

There are two photomemory effects which are strongly dependent on the sample kind; so there are samples that — exhibit an enhancement of the 1 to 1.35 eV extrinsic photocurrent after sufficiently long excitation below 120 K, whereas other samples show optical quenching of the photocurrent under the same excitation conditions. These phenomena can be understood on the basis of strong changes on the configuration of deep traps under illumination with photons ranging from 1 to 1.35 eV. The new configuration of the deep traps can be originated by defect reactions involving association and/or dissociation of complex defects, when the electronic occupation is changed by these photons. In this context, it should be very interesting to test the behaviour of shallow traps during the defect reaction mechanism. Therefore the photocurrent is studied in the spectral region of the band gap edge, after excitation with 1 to 1.35 eV photons. The results obtained confirm that shallow trap concentrations are strongly influenced by variations in the charge state of deep traps. Thus samples characterized by optical quenching of the extrinsic photocurrent undergo a complete quenching of the near intrinsic photocurrent (1.45 eV band), whereas samples showing optical enhancement of the extrinsic photocurrent, exhibit an enhancement of the 1.45 eV near intrinsic photocurrent band, whose maximum is also shifted towards 1.475 eV.

The use of solar ponds for power generation involves heat rejection, for which the surface zone may be employed. However, it is very important to determine the effect of the discharge of hot fluid on the temperature field in the surface zone and on the stability of the nonconvective zone, which lies between the surface and storage zones. Of particular interest is the dependence of this flow on the inflow conditions, on heat loss at the surface and on the inflow-outflow configuration. The downward penetration of the flow is strongly governed by the buoyancy effects, and the study considers both the transient and the steady-state circumstances. The effect of the surface energy loss and of the conductive heat gained from below the surface zone is also studied. The flow is found to be strongly dependent on the inflow and outflow conditions and on the surface heat loss. The disturbance to the nonconvective zone is also studied.

Twelve severely injured patients, five critically ill patients with normal blood pressure, and six severely ill patients on 1 wk of total parenteral nutrition were investigated, and the results were compared with those in 14 normal controls. High-energy phosphates were not significantly changed in liver and muscle after severe injury; lactate and pyruvate levels in both tissues were increased; glycogen levels in the liver were decreased. In critical illness, muscle and hepatic adenosine triphosphate as well as adenosine diphosphate were decreased significantly; energy charge potential dropped; adenosine monophosphate, lactate, and the ratio of lactate to pyruvate were increased. Liver glycogen, but not muscle glycogen, dropped remarkably. The correlation coefficient between hepatic and muscle adenosine triphosphate was 0.61. In patients on 1 wk of total parenteral nutrition, hepatic and muscle high-energy phosphates were not significantly changed before or during total parenteral nutrition. Alterations in the adenosine triphosphate-adenosine diphosphate-adenosine monophosphate system in liver and muscle suggest a low-energy charge in severe injury and critical illness.

An increase in the intensity of physical activity may be counter-productive because of increased respiratory heat loss, increased air or water movement over the body surface, and a pumping of air or water beneath the clothing. Shivering can generate heat at a rate of 10 to 15 kJ/min, but it impairs skilled performance, while the resultant glycogen usage hastens the onset of fatigue and mental confusion. Non-shivering thermogenesis could arise in either brown adipose tissue or white fat. Brown adipose tissue generates heat by the action of free fatty acids in uncoupling mitochondrial electron transport, and by noradrenaline-induced membrane depolarisation and sodium pumping. The existence of brown adipose tissue in human adults is controversial, and although there are theoretical mechanisms of heat production in white fat, their contribution to the maintenance of body temperature is small. Acclimatisation to cold develops over the course of about 10 days, and in humans the primary change is an insulative, hypothermic type of response; this reflects the intermittent nature of most occupational and athletic exposures to cold. Nevertheless, with more sustained exposure to cold air or water, humans can apparently develop the humoral type of acclimatisation described in small mammals, with an increased output of noradrenaline and/or thyroxine. The associated mobilisation of free fatty acids suggests the possibility of using winter sport as a pleasant method of treating obesity. In men, a combination of moderate exercise and facial cooling induces a substantial fat loss over a 1- to 2-week period, with an associated ketonuria, proteinuria, and increase of body mass. Possible factors contributing to this fat loss include: (a) a small energy deficit; (b) the energy cost of synthesising new lean tissue; (c) energy loss through the storage and excretion of ketone bodies; (d) catecholamine-induced ‘futile’ metabolic cycles with increased resting metabolism; and (e) a specific reaction to cold dehydration. Current limitations for the clinical application of such treatment include uncertainty regarding optimal environmental conditions, concern over possible pathological reactions to cold, and suggestions of a less satisfactory fat mobilisation in female patients. Possible interactions between physical fitness and metabolic reactions to cold remain controversial. However, it is clear that short term cold exposure induces a modest increase of physical working capacity. Long term effects of cold upon fitness are probably mediated largely through associated changes in habitual physical activity. © 1985, ADIS Press Limited.

In organ culture experiments the central nervous system (CNS), in contrast to other tissues, both inhibits glycogen synthesis (measured as incorporation of [14C]glucose into glycogen) and stimulates glycogen breakdown in anterior mantle tissue (measured as a decreased retention of prelabeled glycogen). These effects are dose dependent, with saturation at the highest doses tested. High-potassium Ringer solution stimulates the secretion of a CNS factor which induces glucose release by anterior mantle tissue. This glucose-release-stimulating effect of the CNS is also dose dependent, but saturation of the response was not achieved. It is concluded that inhibition of glycogen synthesis and stimulation of glycogen breakdown and glucose release are probably effects of a single neurohormone which controls glycogen mobilization from the storage cells in the mantle. Like similar factors in other animal phyla, this putative neurohormone is referred to as a hyperglycemic factor. © 1985.",,"animal cell; animal experiment; endocrine system; glycogen synthesis; invertebrate; mobilization; nervous system; neuroendocrine system; nonhuman; Animal; Central Nervous System; Glucose; Glycogen; Lymnaea; Neurosecretory Systems; Organ Culture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021989146

Red cells stored in SAGM medium for 42 days at +4°C were rejuvenated by bicarbonate, pyruvate and adenosine. Autologous 24‐hour posttransfusion survival was determined in untreated as well as rejuvenated cells and showed an improvement from 77.4±4.7 to 89.2±7.2%. The erythrocyte adenylate energy charge decreased relatively more than the total adenylate concentration during storage, but the latter correlated better with posttransfusion red cell survival. Considerable deteriorations in red cell morphology (expressed as morphology index) and in deformability (measured as red cell fluidity) were observed during storage but were partly reversed by rejuvenation. The morphology index and the posttransfusion survival showed a significant correlation (r = 0.95, p<0.005) after, but not before, rejuvenation, indicating that the remaining changes are more permanent and decisive of survival. It is suggested that, in the proportion of stored erythrocytes which respond to rejuvenation, the capacity and time dependence of recovery of normal shape and flexibility are important. © 1985 S.

If a storage effect is needed, external heat or energy storage must be provided, which has some disadvantages. On the other hand, absorption and desorption processes make an intrinsic storage effect possible. A series of processes to achieve this is described. The storage heat pump is realized by an absorption process for the generation of heat during the duty (heating) phase. The regeneration during the charging phase is done by a compressor but practically without heat exchange with the surroundings. Thus, the heat pump can be powered by base load electricity even if the heat is wanted at peak load time. For refrigeration plants, a similar process is useful. So, refrigeration capacity, driving power, and waste heat capacity can be decoupled, both temporally (storage) and by quantity (control). This process is advantageous to use waste heat from refrigeration plants, if the requirements for cooling and heating do not occur simultaneously. The use of industrial waste heat for the generation of process heat is possible with another variant. Here too, the decoupling of energy flows (storage, control) is managed intrinsically. If additional cooling water is available, the driving energy needed can be reduced considerably below the level achievable by a conventional compressor heat pump. In those cases where the temperature drop of the external heat carrying media is not small compared with the difference between their temperature levels, these absorption-desorption processes, for fundamental thermodynamic reasons, yield better efficiencies than those available by condensation-evaporation processes. © 1985.","Absorption processes; Heat pumps; Heat transformers; Storage processes","ENERGY STORAGE - Applications; HEAT TRANSFORMERS; INTRINSIC STORAGE CAPABILITY; STORAGE HEAT PUMP; HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021976992

Alternative sources of energy such as thermal plants are becoming less attractive because of public opposition, spiraling costs, and excessive delays. Many utilities have actively explored the possibilities of increasing output at existing hydroplants by replacing or supplementing existing generating units. But hydroelectric plants are still utilizing only a portion of the river's hydraulic energy due to hydrologic and economic restraints. One possibility for increasing the efficiency of hydropower plants is the conversion of water to hydrogen through electrolysis by using the excess energy or wasted energy not yet utilized, and then conversion of hydrogen to electricity via a gas turbine or fuel cells. The electricity produced in the off-peak or no-demand time, or at the time of huge river flows in the spring can be stored in the form of hydrogen, and later, when the peak energy is needed, the hydrogen converted to electricity. One of the advantages of the proposed system is that the resource for production of hydrogen (the water) is available directly at the site. It appears that the conversion of electricity at hydro-power plants to hydrogen, and its utilization via a gas turbine, is technically and economically feasible. It is desirable to locate the electrolyzer near the hydro-plant if hydrogen is used only to generate electricity. The concept described in this paper would improve the economy of the project and generate additional revenues to the owner. © 1985.",,"ENERGY RESOURCES; FUELS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS - Energy Storage; HYDROPOWER PLANTS; RENEWABLE RESOURCE; HYDROGEN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021975454

When samples are thermally regenerated, the rate of desorption and the chemical species desorbed depend on the treatment prior to heating. It was found that only phenol is desorbed at temperatures in the range 110-200°C from samples prepared at 25°C and maintained in a desiccator at that temperature. Kinetics of desorption of such samples was studied by measuring weight and rate of weight change in runs at constant temperature (110-200°C) and at constant heating rate (6°C/min). The data did not agree with first order kinetics using a constant activation energy, but could be explained by employing an exponential distribution of sites over a range of activation energies. Desorption was not complete even when samples were heated to 800°C. Our results and that of others indicate that the residue is most likely formed by reaction of phenol during the adsorption stage and during storage of the samples. © 1985.",,"CARBON - Activated; CHEMICAL REACTIONS - Reaction Kinetics; DESORPTION; ACTIVATION ENERGY; DESORPTION KINETICS; THERMAL REGENERATION; PHENOLS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021975292

Accordingly, a hybrid scheme was developed in which the FNS calculations were only used for the recirculation region. Downstream of the recirculation region the parabolized form of the Navier-Stokes equations was used. Calculations were run on a dump combustor having an area ratio of approximately four. Comparisons were made of the radial profiles of velocity and turbulence kinetic energy with both the FNS calculations and with experimental data.

Rabbits fed in this way (double fed) were compared with littermate controls (single fed) at age 7,14, and 21 days. The double-fed rabbits gained weight more rapidly and at each age contained a higher percentage of fat than their single-fed counterparts. During the 1st wk the double fed rabbits stored some of their extra fat in the cervical and interscapular adipose lobes. Double-fed rabbits utilized their feeds more efficiently than single fed rabbits in that they gained more weight per unit milk intake and their gross energetic efficiency was 10-20% higher. In a second series of experiments oxygen consumption rate was measured in singleand double-fed rabbits at ages 7,14, 21, and 28 days. The relation between oxygen consumption and body weight were similar. We conclude that rabbits respond to overfeeding with an increased rate of weight gain associated with extra fat deposition, and this is associated with increased energy efficiency. © 1985 International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc.",,"adipose tissue; body weight; diagnosis; lipid storage; metabolism; newborn; nonhuman; overnutrition; oxygen consumption; priority journal; rabbit; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Animals, Newborn; Body Temperature Regulation; Body Weight; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Oxygen Consumption; Rabbits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021961135

The animals (Saimiri sciureus) were equilibrated for 90 min to a cool environment (Ta = 20°C) to elevate metabolic heat production (M). They were then exposed for brief (10‐min) or long (30‐min) periods to 2,450‐MHz continuous‐wave microwaves. Power densities (MPD) were 10, 14, 19, and 25 mW/cm2 during brief exposures and 30, 35, 40, and 45 mW/cm2 during long exposures (rate of energy absorption: SAR = 0.15 [W/kg]/ [mW/cm2]). Individual exposures were separated by enough time to allow physiological variables to return to baseline levels. The results confirm that each microwave exposure induced a rapid decrease in M. In a 20°C environment, the power density of a 10‐min exposure required to lower M to approximate the resting level was 35 mW/cm2 (SAR = 5.3 W/kg). During the long exposures, 20 min was needed to decrease M to its lowest level. Cessation of irradiation was associated with persistence of low levels of M for periods that depended on the power density of the preceding microwave exposure. Vasodilation, as indexed by changes in local skin temperature, occurred at a high rate of energy absorption (SAR = 4.5 W/kg) and was sufficient to prevent a dramatic increase in storage of thermal energy by the body; vasoconstriction was reinstated after termination of irradiation. Patterns of thermophysiological responses confirm the influence both of peripheral and of internal inputs to thermoregulation in squirrel monkeys exposed to microwaves in a cool environment.

A new design of heater in which the storage and collector are combined in one unit has been tested. The construction of the heater involves a rectangular box-like structure with the top face painted black and enclosed behind a single or double sheet of glass. The back surface and sides are insulated, with the assembly inclined at a suitable angle. The main advantages of such a heater are higher collection efficiency, due to direct contact of water with the absorber plate, and the absence of pipes connecting the collector to storage. In this study, the effect of storage volume/collector area ratio, number of glazings and mode of operation on the heater's performance was experimentally investigated. The work involved construction of three built-in-storage heaters, two of which had depths of 8 cm and one of 6 cm. The heaters were operated concurrently for 5 months in which measurements of heated water temperature, ambient temperature and insolation were made. Experimentation was carried out to study the effect of storage tank depth (volume/collector area) over a 4-month period by side-by-side operation of 6-cm and 8-cm heaters. The maximum and minimum temperatures recorded for the 6-cm heater were 76 and 46°C, respectively, while the corresponding temperatures for the 8-cm heater were 70 and 41°C, respectively. The day-average maximum efficiencies of the 6-cm and 8-cm heaters were 65 and 73%, respectively, with a difference of 8-10% throughout the observation period. The study of stratification on the two heaters showed no significant influence of the depth. The effect of glass covers was studied by tests on two heaters, both of 8-cm depth. One of these had a single glass cover while the other was double-glazed. The double-glazed heater performed better with a difference of 1-10°C in water temperature. Different modes of operation were studied by concurrent tests on two heaters of 801. capacity. The results showed that best performance could be obtained by drawing off all heated water into a separate storage as soon as it reached a pre-set temperature level (in this study 35°C). The heater was also found to be capable of handling intermittent loads quite easily. Finally, it is concluded that the built-in-storage heater performs quite well under Benghazi conditions, and the choice of 8-cm depth with double-glazing seems a good design optimum. © 1985.","Bread box heaters; Solar domestic water heaters; Solar energy; Solar energy utilization","SOLAR ENERGY - Applications; BREAD-BOX SOLAR HEATERS; BUILT-IN STORAGE HEATERS; OPTIMUM DESIGN; WATER HEATERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021938356

Thirty-five dogs (18-28 kg) underwent left nephrectomy and 30 min of warm ischemia followed by Collins C-4 flush and 24 hr of cold-storage preservation. Heterotopic autotransplantation and immediate contralateral nephrectomy was then performed. Seven equal groups were evaluated: group A-controls, group B-adenosine pretreatment (1.0 g), group C-dipyridamole pretreatment (10 mg), group D-adenosine (1.0 g), and dipyridamole (10 mg) pretreatment, group E-adenosine (200 mg) and EHNA (2.5 mg/kg) pretreatment, group F-adenosine (200 mg) and EHNA (2.5 mg/kg) in the Collins C-4 flush, and group G-adenosine (200 mg) and EHNA (2.5 mg/kg) at the time of autotransplantation. All kidneys underwent cortical biopsies at the end of preservation and 1 hr after restoration of blood flow for determinations of AMP, ADP, and ATP. In the pretreatment groups (groups B through E) there was 60% graft survival whereas the controls (group A) and the groups treated after ischemia (groups F and G) had 0, 0, and 20% graft survival, respectively. In groups B and E, ATP levels were greater than controls after preservation and 1 hr after restoration of blood flow. Group C AMP and ADP levels and group D energy charge were greater than controls in the post-transplantation biopsies. Administration of adenosine and EHNA after ischemia was not associated with increased intracellular nucleotide levels. One hour post-transplantation biopsies demonstrated greater ability to regenerate cortical nucleotides in the surviving animals but no absolute value could be identified as a predictor of viability. In conclusion, pretreatment with adenosine, dipyridamole, and EHNA alone and in combination is beneficial in ischemically injured kidneys undergoing cold-storage preservation. © 1985.",,"9 (2 hydroxy 3 nonyl)adenine; adenosine; dipyridamole; heparin; mannitol; nucleotide; protamine sulfate; biological model; dog; drug efficacy; kidney; kidney function; kidney transplantation; nonhuman; priority journal; Adenine; Adenosine; Animals; Dipyridamole; Dogs; Female; Graft Survival; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; Nucleotides; Organ Preservation; Transplantation, Autologous",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021923080

The nuclear receptor for triiodothyronine is an integral component of a larger chromatin fragment. A stereospecific energy-dependent transport system appears responsible for translocation of triidothyronine from cytosol to nucleus. In the liver, a multiplicative interaction between a signal from the triiodothyronine-nuclear receptor complex and a signal generated from carbohydrate metabolism results in the induction of specific mRNAs. Two-dimensional mRNA activity profiles suggest that approximately 8% of the visible mRNA sequences are differentially accepted by alterations in thyroid states. Almost 30% to 40% of these changes are mediated by an increase in pituitary growth hormone induced by triidothyronine. Sequential analyses of mRNA activity profiles have identified an mRNA sequence (mRNA(S14)) coding for a protein (S14) with Mr 17 010 and pI 4.9 which responds to triiodothyronine with a lag time of less than 20 minutes. The coordinate regulation of mRNA(S14) by carbohydrate and triidothyronine and its presence in lipogenic tissues (fat, liver, lactating mammary tissue) suggests that S14 is involved in some aspect of fatty acid synthesis degradation or storage.",,"cell nucleus receptor; leucine c 14; liothyronine; liothyronine i 125; messenger RNA; methionine s 35; radioisotope; thyroid hormone; unclassified drug; drug efficacy; drug receptor binding; drug therapy; endocrine system; fatty acid synthesis; heredity; hormone action; human; nonhuman; pharmacokinetics; priority journal; review; therapy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021922733

Descriptive analysis is overemphasized at present, and more stress on synthesis of existing data and experimental testing of new ideas should generate new theories that will give us insights into the mechanical behavior of structures and the kinetics and kinematics of sports movements. One area where this approach may be especially helpful is in studying the question of what makes movements energetically economical. Twenty-six behavioral and mechanical factors have been shown to have an association with the economy of movement. A synthesis should be undertaken which probes the meaning of these various data. Trends in these findings point to intra- and intersegmental energy transfer, center of mass excursion, and elastic energy storage as potential areas for expanding our understanding of the biomechanics of economical movement. These possibilities might be explored by enhancing link-segmental mathematical models to predict what makes movements economical and then testing these predictions by using biofeedback techniques to train subjects to perform the correct movements while being monitored. Optimization models might offer an additional strategy for developing a theory of mechanically and energetically economical movement. © 1985 by the American College of Sports Medicine.","Biomechanics; Energetic economy; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Kinematics; Kinetics; Modelling; Synthesis","biomechanics; human; musculoskeletal system; normal human; sport; theoretical study; Biomechanics; Energy Metabolism; Exertion; Feedback; Human; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Movement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021911059

The hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique has been used to measure one component of the thermic effect of food, insulin and insulin-mediated glucose disposal. We used this technique to measure the thermic responses to insulin and glucose infusions in 120 glucose-toleranct Pima Indians, a population with a high prevalence of obesity. During high-dose insulin infusions (400 mU/m2 per min) the measured increase in energy expenditure (MEE), 150 ± 6 cal/min, was greater than the predicted increase in energy expenditure (PEE), 72 ± 2 cal/min, for glucose storage as glycogen. During low-dose insulin infusions (40 mU/m2 per min) the mean MEE, 6 ± 5 cal/min, was not significantly different from zero and was not greater than the mean PEE, 9 ± 1 cal/min. These data were in contrast to results obtained from Caucasians by others and suggested a markedly reduced thermic effect of low-dose insulin and glucose infusions in Pima Indians. We also studied 23 glucose-tolerant male Caucasians and compared their results with the results from male Indians matched for glucose storage rates and obesity. The results showed that the thermic response to insulin and glucose infusions was similar in the two racial groups during high-dose insulin infusions but was markedly reduced in the Indians compared with the Caucasians during low-dose insulin infusions.",,"glucose; glucose h 3; insulin; radioisotope; unclassified drug; article; central nervous system; drug efficacy; endocrine system; ethnic or racial aspects; etiology; human; human experiment; Indian; intravenous drug administration; obesity; priority journal; therapy; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021910440

Recognizing that most conventionally designed systems have effective relaxation times that are long relative to the time scale of variations in insolation, but short compared to the time scale for day-to-day variations in insolation, we invoke a constant radiation model and solve the problem within that framework. The results of the analytic method are simple closed-form expressions which enable the user to understand clearly the dependence of system performance on the physically important variables. Good agreement is found between the predictions of the analytic method and the corresponding results of the F-f-chart method and computer simulations.

Incident solar radiation, ambient and room temperatures and the constant flow rate of the pump are the input to the computer model based on the usual heat and mass balances. First the system is optimised by running the model at average conditions and selecting the best values of the design parameters-heat exchanger UA-values, mass flows, etc. System component temperatures, energy flows and coefficient of performance can be predicted. Next the dynamic model is developed with hourly average data for a typical house in Melbourne to predict the feasibility of the refrigerant storage for matching the heating load of the house during the off-generation period by careful control of the refrigerant flow from the store. The system is shown to be technically feasible and to be marginally more effective than other storage alternatives. Its economic feasibility will depend on the cost benefits that can be attributed to the advantageous storage volume and the low storage losses. © 1985.",,"HEATING - Solar; REFRIGERANTS - Ammonia; ABSORBERS; CONDENSERS; INTERNAL/REFRIGERANT STORAGE; SOLAR HEAT PUMP; SYSTEM MODELLING; HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021899313

For a start, it seems likely that the hydrogen will be stored as a compressed gas, using the latest developments in lightweight pressure vessels, although other methods of hydrogen storage will probably follow, for example metal hydrides. It is suggested that fuel cells are still in an early stage of development, and that considerable improvements should be achieved in the future, as experience is accumulated from the use of fuel cells in space, and other special applications. The use of pure hydrogen in fuel cells probably means that this will provide a new and improved method of energy storage, when compared with conventional storage batteries; and advantage would naturally be taken of the great improvements which are now being made in the design of electrolyzers, which should help to reduce the cost of pure hydrogen, especially in countries such as Canada, which have large reserves of hydro-electric power and a successful nuclear power industry. © 1985.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; HYDROGEN - Storage; ELECTROLYZERS; HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS; METAL HYDRIDES; FUEL CELLS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021898833

The accumulation of 3H derived from 3H-A (10-8 M; 1 h) was dependent on the bath temperature (1-37 °C). The accumulation increased continuously from 1.1 ml·g-1 (1 °C) to 11.1 ml·g-1 (37 °C). Storage of tissue (0-5 days in salt solution without equilibration with 95% O2/5% CO2; 4 °C) did not affect the accumulation of 3H derived from 3H-A (10-8 M; 1 h). Thereafter (7-14 days), the accumulation decreased. The inhibitory potency (IC5o; -log M) of desimipramine, cocaine, (-)-propranolol, (-)-isoprenaline, and (±)-normetanephrine on accumulation of 3H derived from 3H-A (10-8 M; 1 h) was found to be 8.26; 6.50; 5.48, 4.88, and 4.02, respectively. The maximal degree of inhibition was almost the same for these drugs, while that of clonidine and corticosterone was 50 and 20%, respectively. In the presence of desimipra-mine (10-6 M), either clonidine (10-5-10-3 M), corticosterone (10-6-10-4 M) or (-)-isoprena-line (10-5-10-3 M) reduced the accumulation of 3H derived from 3H-A (10-8 M; 1 h). Oua-bain (3 × 10-4 M) and iodoacetic acid (10-3 M), but not sodium cyanide (10-3 M) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (10-3 M), reduced the accumulation of 3H derived from 3H-A (10-8 M; 1 h). Anoxia (95% N2/5% CO2; 37 °C; 1-24 h) did not alter the accumulation of 3H derived from 3H-A (10-8 M; 1 h). D-(+)-Glucose deprivation alone or combined with anoxia markedly reduced the 3H-accumulation. These results suggest that adrenaline is transported into neu-ronal and extraneuronal sites via a carrier mechanism which is energy-dependent. © 1985 S.

As the amplitude of the stretch is increased from 1.5 to 9% of the initial length: (1) the amount of rapid isotonic shortening increases up to 9-10 nm per half sarcomere and (2) the stiffness of the fibre (an indication of the number of bridges attached) decreases to a value about equal to that measured during an isometric contraction. If a 5-10 ms delay is left between the end of stretch and release, the amount of rapid isotonic shortening increases to about 12 nm hs-1. A 300-500 ms delay, however, results in a decrease in rapid isotonic shortening to about 5 nm hs-1 and also results in velocity transients against P0 that are similar to those described during release from a state of isometric contraction. It is concluded that the force attained after large, fast stretches is due to a greater force developed by each bridge and not to a greater number of bridges. After the elastic recoil (when the force is suddenly reduced to P0), these strained bridges are able to shorten by about 12 nm hs-1, suggesting that, during and immediately after stretching, they are charged to levels of potential energy greater than those attained in an isometric contraction.",,"animal experiment; muscle; muscle cell; muscle isometric contraction; nonhuman; priority journal; animal; article; frogs and toads; in vitro study; muscle contraction; physiology; Animalia; Anura; Animal; Anura; In Vitro; Muscle Contraction; Muscles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021891085

If a robot is to be designed which can independently travel from one place to another, using a city map with specific landmarks stored in its memory and obstacle information gathered by the sensors on board the robot, these pieces of information acquired and used by the robot provide one solution to the first problem. In this paper, a guide dog robot (MELDOG) is described which approaches the first problem in this manner. MELDOG intends to enhance mobility aids for the blind by providing them with the functions of guide dogs, i.e., obedience in navigating its blind master, intelligent disobedience in detecting and avoiding obstacles in his/her path, and companionship in communicating between the master and the robot. For the second problem of displaying the information acquired, the electrocutaneous communication systems being developed, based on the fundamental experiments on electrocutaneous stimulation, are explained. These include constant pulse energy circuits which keep the perceived sensational magnitude constant despite the change of the skin impedance, and two-dimensional phantom sensations which reduce the number of the electrodes used.

This amorphous phase was physically unstable and converted on storage to crystalline indomethacin forms II and I. Co -spray drying indomethacin with up to 20% PVP also gave a fused amorphous solid. Apparent solubility and dissolution studies illustrated the higher energy of indomethacin in these systems. The presence of PVP in the solid retarded conversion of indomethacin to a crystalline phase, the effect increasing with increasing PVP content. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the growth, with time, of needle-like whiskers on the surface of the amorphous products. Co-spray drying indomethacin with more than 20% PVP resulted firstly in products composed of a fused network of spherical particles, then partially coalesced spheres and ultimately, above 25% PVP, in individual agglomerated microspherical particles. The spray drying of either naproxen, ketoprofen or ibuprofen did not result in the formation of an amorphous glassy solid, Co-spray drying with PVP led to reduced crystallinity; the size of the melting endotherm decreased with increasing PVP content and became absent at 50% PVP.

Fourteen severely injured and five critically ill patients with normal blood pressure were investigated: the results were compared with 14 normal controls. ATP and ADP levels in the muscle were significantly changed in acutely severe injury: lactate and pyruvate levels in the liver and muscle increased; glycogen level in the liver decreased. Meanwhile, high-energy phosphates in both liver and muscle were not significantly changed in ongoing severe injury. Lactate level increased and glycogen level decreased in both tissues. In critical illness, hepatic and muscle ATP and ADP decreased significantly. The energy charge potential dropped. AMP, lactate, and the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio increased. Hepatic, but not muscle, glycogen dropped markedly. The correlation coefficient between hepatic and muscle ATP was 0.61; between hepatic ATP and hepatic glycogen was 0.60.

The opposite trend was seen with acylglycerols, which were highest in the high glucose and high fat groups. The highest acylglycerol content was found in the high fat group at the high energy level.

The manifold is characterised by the absence of partitioning of the inner volumes of the absorber tubes into inlet/outlet channels and buoyancy effects are utilised to convey heat to a header pipe at the open end of the tubes. Solar energy input to the tubes has been simulated by electric heating. The thermosiphon system design is unusual in that there are no risers within the collector tubes, thus, the pressure head responsible for thermosiphon flow originates entirely from relatively short pipe runs between manifold and storage tank. Thermosiphon flow has been measured for a number of system designs and a wide range of operating conditions. The relative impedances of the system components has been evaluated allowing optimization of the system design. An investigation of the effect of withdrawal of hot water from the storage tank, with associated injection of cold water to the bottom of the tank, has illustrated that the self-regulating nature of the thermosiphoning system results in a large proportion of heat stored in the wate filled collector tubes being effieciently transferred to the storage tank, providing some water is drawn off intermittently. © 1985.",,"FLOW OF FLUIDS; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; EVACUATED TUBULAR COLLECTORS; THERMOSIPHON CIRCULATION; THERMOSIPHON FLOW RATE; WATER DRAWOFF; WATER-IN-GLASS MANIFOLD; WATER HEATERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021863351

Consequently, it is often too expensive to carry out parametric design studies on such systems. This paper presents a general technique for linearizing the non-linear element forces using equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients with energy dissipation and energy storage-release concepts. The approach is illustrated and tested for both centrally preloaded squeeze-film dampers and for squeeze-film dampers without centralizing springs under a combination of unidirectional and unbalance loading. The results predicted by using such equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients agree quite well with those obtained from the full transient solution, even where the unidirectional load exceeds the dynamic load and the damper is operating at high eccentricity. An iterative procedure is proposed which, with the aid of such stiffness and damping coefficients, should significantly reduce the computation time presently needed to carry out parametric design studies on general multi-degree of freedom systems incorporating non-linear elements such as squeeze-film dampers. © 1985, Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

These shells are usually made of thin sheets of metal; therefore, in many instances these structures have failed due to buckling. In this paper, the stability of cylindrical shells under the action of wind load is investigated. Often these shells are constructed of corrugated steel sheets; therefore, the shells are analyzed by considering the material as orthotropic. This analysis can also be used for other orthotropic materials. The principle of minimum potential energy in conjunction with Ritz's approach is used. The buckling loads, as well as the buckling configurations, are obtained for short cylinders made of corrugated steel sheets subjected to wind pressure. The present study is made on cylindrical shells of various dimensions, which are simply supported at the base and are open or closed at the top. For practical use, buckling load curves for these shells are given for different length-to-radius and radius-to-thickness ratios. © ASCE.",,"CYLINDERS - Buckling; BUCKLING ANALYSIS; CYLINDRICAL SHELLS; WIND PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION; DOMES AND SHELLS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021861582

Monochromatization of the excitation beam by a crystal monochromator is effective in improving the signal to background ratio, while the synchrotron continuum excitation attains an absolute detectability of better than pg. Trace elements in a thin sample down to 60 ppb are detected by monochromatic excitation when there is no line interference. The experimental geometry optimal for a high signal to background ratio is investigated experimentally. The practical advantages of monochromatic excitation for the selective excitation of a particular element are demonstrated; these include enhanced sensitivity, suppression of the effects of the matrix element, and removal of overlapping peaks.

During the conceptual phase in 1980, the Illinois Commerce Commision (utility commission) warned the Capital Development Board that the electrical rates would favor 'load shifting' in the future. Desiring an energy and cost effective building, the Capital Development board commissioned Knight to produce one. Several studies were made. Even in 1980, the advantages of thermal storage, load shifting, heat recovery, and operational flexibility were obvious from the studies. The problem was: Were the energy and operation cost savings enough to offset additional first costs? The system as designed is probably as energy and cost effective as could have been designed in the spring of 1980. It is complex. The system is currently in the start-up mode. Being able to operate the system as an example of what can be accomplished without excessive first costs in load shifting and energy conservation, while reducing operating costs is anticipated. The thermal storage technology has changed dramatically since the spring of 1980. In the future we probably would not build ice on the heat transfer surface and use a daily cycle, but would use icemakers and a larger tank to take advantage of the off-peak rates over weekends and holidays. Nearly double the cooling load can be handled totally off peak with the same installed compressor, condenser, and evaporator capacity.

The formation of metal hydrides and their thermodynamic and kinetic properties have been investigated by electrochemical methods employing a low temperature molten salt galvanic cell of the type (-) Na/Na+H-in NaAlEt4/metal alloy (hydride) (+) The choice of the electrolyte is of great importance in this method. Besides having to be thermodynamically stable when in contact with the electrodes, it must conduct charge by transport of hydrogen containing species. For this purpose, the low temperature organometallic salt NaAlEt4(melting point 128°C) has been synthesized. It is saturated with NaH, the hydride ions of which act as hydrogen transmitters. This electrolyte has the additional advantage that its oxygen activity is extremely low, so that no oxide layers form which could block hydrogen reaction with the alloy and thus reduce its apparent capacity. It even cleans the surface of oxide layers which may have been present initially. This technique allows easier investigation of metal hydrides than the conventional pressure-temperature experiments and, in addition, avoids the main problems involved in using aqueous solution electrolytes, i. e., the corrosion of the metal alloys and, especially, the formation of oxide or hydroxide layers. With the aid of this cell, charge/discharge experiments have been carried out and hydrogen has been added to and deleted from the hydride forming metal alloy systems Mg-Ni, Mg-Cu, and Mg-Al at 142° and 170°C. Equilibrium open-circuit voltage measurements provide information about the thermodynamic properties as a function of the overall composition of the electrode material. Thermodynamic data for the different metal hydride systems have been determined as a function of hydrogen content and interpreted in terms of the corresponding ternary phase diagrams (Mg-Ni-H, Mg-Cu-H, and Mg-Al-H, respectively). The Gibbs free energies corresponding to the various reactions of hydrogen with the binary metal alloys measured in this way have been found to be in good agreement with data determined by conventional pressure-temperature experiments. For the Gibbs free energy of formation of MgH2, for instance, we find ΔGf= -4.8 kcal/mol at 142°C, whereas the data reported in literature range from -4.2 to -5.0 kcal/mol. The results are also in accordance with a model in which these systems are treated as ternaries rather than as pseudo-binary reactions. Using this new approach, the relevant three-phase triangles and two-phase tie lines of the ternary phase diagrams can be calculated from the Gibbs formation energies of the phases present in these systems. The hydrogen capacities in these several metal alloy systems are also readily interpreted in terms of the phase boundaries of the corresponding three-phase equilibria. © 1985, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

The stores are compared, through variation of design parameters for both charging and discharging in order to find exergy extrema, i.e. operating conditions that maximize the exergy yield in the transfer of heat to and from the stores. Reference is made to the stratified sensible heat store. The overall conversion efficiency for the thermal exergy supplied by the heat source to the heat load via the heat store is of the order of 10% at NTU = 1. The stratified store is the most efficient at high NTU values. For the charging operation there exists exergy extrema for both the well-mixed sensible store and the PCM store. An energy analysis of the charging of the PCM store shows that the transition temperature should be low. From an exergetic point of view the transition temperature should be the geometric mean of the charging and the initial temperatures, if the charging temperature is fixed. When the end temperature of a store in a changing operation is fixed the transition temperature should be low. Charging with a constant heating rate is advantageous if the transition temperature is low. No optimal stopping time can be recognized for the discharging operation. The merit of a high exergy content is that of a high thermal power during discharging. This favours a PCM store with a high transition temperature. © 1985.",,"HEAT EXCHANGERS - Optimization; HEAT TRANSFER - Computer Simulation; EXERGY YIELD; INTERNAL ENERGY; PHASE CHANGE; SENSIBLE HEAT UNITS; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021835341

There was no other particular anomaly, however: the correlation between uplift and reservoir level was kept linear and the toatal leakage from drain was confined to around 97 l/min. The major cause of the phenomenon of high uplift at the foot of the dam is considered to be the low permeability of the bedrock of the river bed located upstream of the energy dissipator drain which made the drainage to the energy dissipator drain unsatisfactory relative to the seepage of storage water. Also, consolidation grouting could play a part. As a remedial measure to reduce uplift, a sub-drain was drilled from the energy dissipator, as a result of which the uplift was successfully reduced below the design assumption.

Isolated vesicles of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) from lobster muscle (Hoinanis americanus) were employed to study changes in structure and function during rapid freeze-thaw conditions. Both proline and trehalose were shown to effectively preserve the structure (assessed with freeze fracture) and function (assessed by the ability of the membranes to transport calcium) in the frozen vesicles. As a first step toward determining the mechanism of cryoprotection by these compounds, we have investigated their effectiveness in inhibiting freezing induced fusion between phospholipid vesicles. Pamiltoyloleoyl-phosphatidylcholine: phosphatidylserine (85:15 mole ratio) small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were made incorporating one of the following fluorescent probes, and energy donor, cholesteryl anthracene-9-carboxylate, or an energy acceptor, nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole phosphatidylethanolamine to investigate the amount of membrane mixing during rapid freeze-thaw cycles, and storage at -20 °C. Membrane mixing was measured as an energy transfer from donor to acceptor when donor vesicles and acceptor vesicles were mixed before a particular freezing treatment.

The rate of energy storage in growing low birth weight infants depends on the rate of energy intake and on the rates of energy excretion and expenditure, both of which (on a body weight basis) are much higher than in adults, and both of which increase with increments of gross energy intake. Energy-balance studies of growing low birth weight infants on gross energy intakes approximating 500 kJ·kg-1·d-1 of mothers' milk or of infant formula indicate that the composition of extrauterine weight gain of the low birth weight infant differs from that of the fetus of similar gestation, in that the energy storage cost of growth is much higher. Attempts to increase metabolizable energy intake beyond 500 kJ·kg-1·d-1 by energy supplementation alone do not result in proportionately increased rates of weight gain; low birth weight formulae, in which energy, protein, and mineral contents are all increased can result in large weight gains with proportionate increases in rates of protein and fat accretion.",,"body weight; child; child growth; clinical article; energy expenditure; energy transfer; human; human experiment; low birth weight; normal human; priority journal; short survey; weight gain",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021821021

The cogeneration of solar power plant was designed to be the main energy supplier for an agricultural desert settlement 35 km south-west of Kuwait City. The power plant produces both the electric and thermal energy needs for its own internal uses and those of the food/water/power complex. The electric users, outside the power plant's own needs, include water pumping from a 110 metre deep water well, an outdoor irrigation network, four desert greenhouses, a walk-in cooler, air conditioning, a reverse osmosis (R.O.) desalination plant, as well as the electric power needs for a multistage flash (M.S.F.) desalination plant, offices, workshop, data acquisition and lighting. The reject thermal energy from the power plant is utilized to power an M.S.F. desalination plant, and the domestic hot water needs. The power plant operational strategies are aimed at satisfying the energy needs for this food/water/power complex under prevailing solar radiation conditions while minimizing the inconvenience to the user (the complex) and maximizing the percent of the total energy derived from the sun (solar fraction). Surplus energy is stored as electric energy, thermal energy, or used to desalinate additional volumes of brackish water which can be stored in strategic water reservoirs. During periods of low solar radiation the power plant may be operated at partial load to supply the essential electric energy needs, charge the thermal storage, or provide the thermal energy needs for the MSF desalination system. An energy cost accounting system was developed to encourage the user to minimize his electric consumption during periods of low solar radiation. A mathematical energy model for the power plant was utilized to predict its output and suggest the optimum operational strategy according to the user's priorities, and predict surpluses or shortages that have to be accommodated by the emergency secondary energy source. © 1985.",,"AIR CONDITIONING - Solar Energy Systems; COGENERATION PLANTS; DESALINATION; SOLAR ENERGY - Energy Storage; OPERATIONAL STRATEGIES; SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANT; SULAIBIYA SOLAR COMPLEX; SOLAR POWER PLANTS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021820031

Also a high solar fraction can be obtained with relatively small areas of collectors, even when the collectors are of the inexpensive type. The interesting feature was that the system operated at design load conditions with generator temperatures as low as 80°C owing to the fact that very low cooling water temperatures are available in the dry conditions of the Sahara.

Cats were trained to jump from a force plate and touch a cotton ball suspended as high as 1.6 m. Force-plate reaction forces and double-joint hamstring muscle activity observed early in propulsion varied from one maximal jump to another. This variability is consistent with theory (31, 32, 42); that is, different coordination strategies can be implemented prior to the heels losing contact with the force plate (heel-off). 2. Single-joint hip extensor and double-joint posterior thigh (hip extensor-knee flexor) muscles were coactivated prior to heel-off. This coactivation is probably partially responsible for the observed backward rotation of the trunk. Forepaws, observed to contact the force plate prior to heel-off, probably assist the hindlimbs in generating trunk rotation. 3. Both single-joint knee extensor and hip extensor muscles exhibited greatest activation between heel-off and body lift-off. Single-joint flexor muscles were inactive throughout propulsion. Double-joint posterior thigh muscles were deactivated at heel-off and remained inactivated until lift-off. These observations agree with the theoretical notion that muscles should be either fully activated, inactivated, or switched from one extreme to the other (i.e., bang-bang control) between heel-off and body lift-off (31, 32, 42, 44). 4. All seven muscles studied shortened while activated. Using computations based on muscle geometry, fiber architecture, and joint angle trajectories, I propose that sarcomeres shorten along the flat and ascending regions of the force-length curve. 5. De- and inactivation of double-joint posterior thigh muscles between heel-off and lift-off coincided with muscle stretch. The reason for inactivation of these muscles is that the negative work that would have been generated had these muscles stayed activated would have hindered propulsion. 6. Contractions preceded by active stretch were not observed. Enhancement of positive work by previous storage of energy in elastic musculotendinous structures is thus not used by cat thigh musculature in jumps starting from the squat. 7. Adductor femoris, semimembranosus anterior, and biceps femoris anterior muscles were activated synergistically as one group yet differently from the synergistic activation of gracilis, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris posterior muscles. The separation of these muscles into two groups based on their activation patterns during jumping is compatible with the classification of these muscles into hip extensor and knee flexor muscle groups, respectively, based on their reflex patterns (37), spinal cord reflex connectivity (18, 30), and firing patterns during locomotion (20). 8. In submaximal jumps both coordination and level of neural drive to muscles deviated from the control strategy used in maximal jumps.",,"animal experiment; cat; extensor muscle; flexor muscle; hamstring; hip; hip muscle; joint; jumping; knee; knee muscle; locomotion; muscle; muscle contraction; musculoskeletal system; nonhuman; preliminary communication; priority journal; sarcomere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021814008

The physiological energy expenditure involved in common activities such as running, walking, or cycling can be influenced by a variety of biomechanical factors. In evaluating changes in mechanical energy in order to derive a measure of mechanical power which is more directly related to metabolic energy cost, it is necessary to be able to identify the source of these changes. Factors such as concentric and eccentric muscular contractions, transfer of energy, elastic storage and reuse of energy, and joint range of motion limitations can all change the mechanical energy of a segment, but each involves a different metabolic energy expenditure. While a number of computational methods have been suggested for the calculation of mechanical power, each incorporates a different set of assumptions involving the factors just mentioned, and widely varying results for mechanical power have been obtained. The lack of definitive information concerning the relationship between mechanical and physiological energy changes limits the accuracy, meaningfulness, and usefulness of measures of mechanical power and muscular efficiency. © 1985 by the American College of Sports Medicine.","Cycling; Efficiency; Mechanical power; Metabolic energy cost; Running; Running economy; Walking","biomechanics; controlled study; cycling; energy expenditure; etiology; exercise; human; musculoskeletal system; running; walking; Bicycling; Biomechanics; Efficiency; Energy Metabolism; Gait; Human; Locomotion; Muscles; Running",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021812870

Literature is cited to show that a slurry containing a phase-change material as the dispersed phase promises to have much higher heat-transfer coefficients than conventional single-phase working fluids. Because of the latent heat, the phasechange slurry also requires lower pumping rates and smaller storage tanks than single-phase fluids for the same energy content. These benefits are documented by comparisons of temperature drops, pumping rates, pumping powers, and the sizes of storage tanks for a generic energy collection system operating with and without a slurry. © 1985 by ASME.",,"FLOW OF FLUIDS - Two Phase; WASTE HEAT UTILIZATION - Heat Transfer; END-USE TEMPERATURE; HEAT CAPACITY; INTEGRAL-STORAGE CONCEPT; PHASE-CHANGE SLURRY; SOLAR ENERGY; waste heat recovery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021804887

Twenty-six preschool children were divided in two groups according to their initial iron reserves, as estimated from serum ferritin concentration, using a cutoff criterion of 30 ng/ml. The low ferritin (LF) group had a mean serum ferritin level of 12 ± 8 ng/dl, and the high ferritin (HF) group, 86 ± 32 ng/dl. Both groups had similar degrees of malnutrition and of anemia, as defined by hemoglobin concentration. All children received an adequate therapeutic diet and 60 mg iron daily as ferrous sulfate. The recovery of biochemical and anthropometric indicators of nutritional status, as well as of hemoglobin concentration, was similar in both groups. On the contrary, the LF group showed a marked increase in serum ferritin concentration from the onset of treatment, whereas the HF group had a net The difference in serum ferritin concentration between groups was maintained until day 60, and both groups ended the study (90 days) with similar levels. Estimation of the utilization of exogenous iron from changes in total-body iron during the first 60 days of recovery showed the LF group to retain an average of 9.3% of iron intake, whereas the HF group retained only 1.4%. These results confirm that similar degrees of anemia in severe malnutrition can be associated with markedly different iron reserves, and suggest that the homeostatic regulation of intestinal iron absorption by the storage iron pool may produce a lower utilization of oral iron supplements in malnourished children with high iron reserves at the onset of treatment. © 1985 Raven Press.","Anemia; Exogenous iron; Protein-energy malnutrition; Serum ferritin; Total iron-binding capacity","ferritin; iron; anemia; blood and hemopoietic system; clinical article; etiology; human; infant; iron binding capacity; malnutrition; preschool child; priority journal; therapy; Anemia, Hypochromic; Child, Preschool; Ferritin; Ferrous Compounds; Hemoglobins; Homeostasis; Human; Infant; Intestinal Absorption; Iron; Protein-Energy Malnutrition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021798428

An analysis of the effects of cooperative energy storage on the tertiary structure around the heme is made and used to interpret this resonance Raman data. The differences between the spectra of the deoxygenated preparations and the photoproducts provide evidence that a fraction of the free energy of cooperativity, ΔG, is located away from the heme. These data support models for cooperativity in which the cooperative energy is distributed over many bonds or is localized in protein bonds only, such as those at the subunit interface. In addition, the local changes in amino acid positions, which must occur following the change in the state of ligand binding, may drive the changes in the structural relationships of the subunits and hence form one of the initial steps for triggering the quaternary structure transition. © 1985, The Biophysical Society.

(2) The program of windpower storage developed by the Science and Technology Agency.

With conventional solar heating systems that use water or as their working fluid, the collector inlet temperature is equal to that of the storage outlet temperature. Operating the system on a cold day can result in large thermal losses to the surroundings and, thus, low useful heat gains. A vapor-compression cycle may be attractive because it allows the collector inlet temperature to be lowered so that the heat gain of the collector can be increased. Such a system is simulated and a preliminary economic analysis performed. The results indicate that the vapor-compression system can collect almost 50% more solar energy than a conventional system if the collector area of the two systems are the same. © 1985.",,"SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; SOLAR HEATING SYSTEMS; SPACE HEATING COSTS; VAPOR-COMPRESSION CYCLES; WATER HEATERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021787652

To be able to determine the energy changes in fuel during the storage period, we have analysed moisture content, matter loss and heat value before as well as after storing. If branches and tops are stored in piles for 6-9 months, no particular energy change takes place. While the logging residues are reduced into chiplike fractions, the energy loss varies between 7 and 21% during 6-9 months of pile storage. In connection with the energy change, heat was created which caused temperatures up to 90°C. During storage great amounts of microfungi are formed, which can cause allergic reactions in those who handle the material. A heating plant's ability to pay for comminuted logging residues in relation to oil is between SEK 100 and 115 per m3 stacked, at the oilprice SEK 2000 per m3. © 1985.","energy production; Forest residues; storage","AGRICULTURAL WASTES - Energy Utilization; FUELS; WOOD - Energy Utilization; ENERGY PRODUCTION; FOREST RESIDUES; LOGGING RESIDUES; FORESTRY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021787524

This reaction has been widely viewed as a potential means for the conversion of solar energy to useful heat. Using a xenon lamp as a radiant energy source in lieu of natural sunlight, 1-M acetophenone-norbornadiene and benzophenone-norbornadiene solutions were irradiated for 2-h periods with 1-5-mW radiant power levels delivered in 4-nm bandwidths centered on 300 nm, 350 nm, 400 nm and 450 nm. In each case the reaction was carried out batchwise at four temperatures in the liquid-phase range of the solutions, namely, 278 K, 298 K, 318 K and 333 K, controlled to within ±2 K. The results indicate that about 8.8% of the total available incident light contained in the region from 300 nm (lower end of the solar spectrum that impinges upon the earth's surface) to 425 nm (approximate absorption threshold of the sensitizers acetophenone and benzophenone; maximum wavelength capable of promoting the reaction under the conditions of this study) can be stored in the chemical bonds of quadricyclane in the acetophenone-sensitized isomerization and about 14.5% when benzophenone is utilized. Based on the entire solar spectrum, these energy storage efficiencies translate into 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively. Efficiency values were estimated by determining the quantum yield of the reaction as a function of wavelength and temperature. While the data show no definitive temperature dependence, it has been established that the functional relationship with wavelength follows the same pattern as the absorption spectra of the sensitizers themselves. © 1985.",,"ENERGY STORAGE - Efficiency; HEATING - Solar; NORBORNADIENE (NBD); PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTORS; PHOTOISOMERIZATION; QUADRICYCLANE (QDC); SOLAR HEATING SYSTEM; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021787468

Higher storage temperatures resulted in more rapid rates of textural deterioration. Larger activation energy constants for toughness of cod muscle as compared to cohesiveness indicated that toughening was more temperature dependent than cohesiveness.

Its reduction to trimethylamine by such bacteria can constitute a major spoilage reaction during the storage of marine fish. In the Enterobacteriaceae, anaerobic respiration with TMAO has been shown to support oxidative phosphorylation. Electron transport to TMAO in these bacteria involves flavin nucleotides, menaquinones, both b- and c-type cytochromes, and a molybdoenzyme reductase. Formate, hydrogen, lactate, and glycerol all serve as electron donors for TMAO respiration. Electrophoretically distinct constitutive and TMAO-induced reductases are synthesized by both E. coli and S. typhimurium. Electron transport to TMAO is repressed both by air and by nitrate. A number of genes involved in TMAO respiration have been mapped, but the structural gene for the inducible TMAO reductase has not yet been firmly established. Oxidative phosphorylation is also supported by TMAO reduction in Alteromonas. In this organism, which is nonfermentative, TMAO respiration resembles aerobic respiration in that intermediates of the TCA cycle are excellent electron donors. Alteromonas exhibits a requirement for NaCl for growth on TMAO and certain electron donors. As in the Enterobacteriaceae, air and nitrate both interfere with TMAO reduction. The role of TMAO reduction in the anaerobic metabolism of nonsulfur purple bacteria has not yet been resolved; it is not clear if TMAO serves simply as an accessory oxidant for fermentation or if TMAO reduction is associated with energy-yielding membrane-bound electron transport. Some of the confusion regarding this bacterial group stems from the fact that much of the work to date has involved parallel studies of TMAO and dimethyl sulfoxide reduction, and it is not yet known whether the two compounds are reduced by the same enzyme. Although our understanding of bacterial TMAO reduction lags far behind our knowledge of bacterial nitrate reduction, it is unlikely that this will always be the case.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"dimethyl sulfoxide; methylamine; oxidoreductase; trimethylamine; trimethyloxamine; bacterium; Enterobacteriaceae; genetics; metabolism; mutation; oxidation reduction reaction; review; Rhodopseudomonas; Vibrio; Bacteria; Dimethyl Sulfoxide; Enterobacteriaceae; Methylamines; Mutation; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases; Rhodopseudomonas; Vibrio",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021778428

On an average, T. flavescens exchanged almost all of its endogenous carbon after 3.4 moults. In periods of starvation the interval between two ecdyses increased from 5.2 to 6.1 days (17°C). The assimilation efficiency was determined in three independent ways (carbon use of different algal components; A=C-FU; C=P+R+FU, A=P+R): it ranged from 0.34 to 0.40 (converted to energy values 0.30 to 0.45). It could be raised in phases of high mobility and in periods of food shortage by lowering the gut passage rate. The decrease in feeding activity (demonstrated by gut contents analyses) in case of a detoriation of the food quality and the food availability can be partly compensated in this way. For individuals which did not reproduce, the ratio of production to assimilation was 0.24 (converted to energy values 0.31). T. flavescens showed an increased body growth in connection with reaching sexual maturity. Specific demands of nutritive substances in periods of physiological changes could possibly be compensated by a more efficient resource use as well as by differences in resource allocation. The studied population of T. flavescens was compared both with that of a Danish beech forest and general data from the literature. The production of few eggs rich in energy, the high weight of newly hatched individuals, the high growth as well as the storage of carbon connected with egg production, the comparatively low respiration metabolism and the high amount of energy invested in search for food have to be regarded as an adaptation to the habitat. According to conservative estimates climbing individuals of this species consume 0.83 g of the algal dry mass growing on one beech tree during one summer. T. flavescens mainly uses the ethanol-soluble components of the algae. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021569955

Pith volume per amount of leaf area increases with elevation resulting in significantly larger water storage capacity at higher elevations. Thickness of leaf pubescence and, therefore, leaf boundary layer resistance, also increases with elevation resulting in both potentially higher leaf temperatures relative to air temperature and higher leaf to air vapor pressure gradients. The net effect on transpiration rate would depend on ratios of stomatal to boundary layer resistance and leaf energy balance. At higher elevations the central rosette leaves are more vertically oriented and the leaf bases show a pronounced curvature as the intersection with the main axis is approached. This gives these rosettes a distinctly paraboloid appearance and probably enhances capture and retention of incident long and shortwave radiation by the apical bud and expanding leaves. Features which result in enhanced water storage capacity and higher plant temperatures relative to air temperature without greatly increasing water loss are adaptive in high altitude paramo habitats where water availability and growth are limited by year round low temperatures (mean 2-3° C). © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",,"Andes; Espeletia schultzii; Venezuela",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021558012

When the illumination is resumed, however, the recovered exoelectron emission shoots up to a value significantly higher than before and then decreases gradually - a fact overlooked by previous researchers. To explain this ""storage effect"" in PSEE (photo- stimulated exoelectron emission), the authors have proposed a model, according to which there are two excitation processes competing during PSEE; one is the photoexcitation of the electrons at energy levels within the band gap of surface oxide layers, and the other is the tunneling transition of electrons in bulk metals to occupy the vacant levels of the oxide layers. From the rate equations based on this model and also from the PSEE data obtained for scratched aluminum and zinc, three kinds of quantities, i.e., the number of exo-active sites, the emission rate from the sites and the rate of activating exo-inactive sites, are successfully estimated. Other PSEE phenomena such as the peculiar emission intensity versus time profiles can also be elucidated in view of this model. © 1985.",,"ELECTRONS - Emission; BAND GAP; BULK METALS; EMISSION INTENSITY; EXOELECTRON EMISSION (EEE); SCRATCHED METALS; METALS AND ALLOYS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021420005

The Soudan 2 experiment will have more than three mil1ion potential data words per event to examine, while less than one percent of these data words will have valid data for typical events. In an effort to reduce the amuount of data to be stored and analyzed, a data preprocessor was developed which scans the data words. If a data word is valid (ADC count above a preset threshold), that data word is passed to the host computer for experiment monitoring and storage on magnetic tape. To obtain fast data compression, a hardware comparator is used. The hardware comparator places valid data into a FIFO (first in first out stack) where the host computer can acquire the data through CAMAC. The comparator and FIFO are controlled by a microprocessor (8086 CPU), and the microprocessor is programnmed for decision-making and comnmunication between the compactor, CAMAC, the host computer and a local terminal.

Although chemical reactions leading to electrolyte degradation and lithium corrosion are known, the rates of these reactions are slow. While the normal temperature cell reaction produces lithium dithionite, discharge at 60 °C leads to a reduction in capacity due to side reactions involving sulfur dioxide and discharge intermediates. Lithium/thionyl chloride and lithium/sulfuryl chloride cells have the highest practical gravimetric and volumetric energy densities when compared with aqueous and most other nonaqueous systems. For thionyl chloride, discharge proceeds through a series of intermediates to sulfur, sulfur dioxide and lithium chloride. Catalysis, leading to improved rate capability and capacity, has been achieved. The causes of rapid reactions leading to thermal runaway are thought to be chemical in nature. Lithium/sulfuryl chloride cells, which produce sulfur dioxide and lithium chloride on discharge, experience more extensive anode corrosion. An inorganic cosolvent and suitable salt are capable of alleviating this corrosion. Calcium/oxyhalide cells have been studied because of their promise of increased safety without substantial sacrifice of energy density relative to lithium cells.

For stand alone PV systems, a comparative economic analysis with diesel generators is given. Different types of loads to be supplied by the stand alone PV or diesel systems are considered. Each load type is characterised by the ratio between energy demand during day time to that during a complete day. This ratio is denoted by ""load factor"". The load factor plays a major role in determining both array and storage size. A fixed array tilted at an appropriate angle is considered for stand alone systems to minimize maintenance and operating costs for applications likely to be in remote areas where no technician is available. The impact of power availability on PV system cost has been thoroughly investigated herein. For PV grid connected central power plant a rather sophisticated, elaborate and efficient tracking system is considered to minimize the overall cost of 1 kWh produced by the power plant. The major factor in grid connected systems is how much oil can be saved by installing such a power plant so that a developing country government can export more oil (or decrease their oil import) to improve its balance of payment. The advantages of large scale PV grid connected systems are: (1) no storage batteries are needed and (2) prices of PV modules drastically drop when large systems (MW range) are required. An extremely important factor for a large scale PV grid connected power plant is that about 50% of the overall cost can be paid in local currency.

This important aspect has been neglected in previous investigations of materials for fuel-producing and energy-storing photoelectrochemical reactions. In order to emphasize this statement the progress of experiments with two groups of photoelectrodes which undergo strong interaction with reactants in the electrolyte is discussed. The first group consists of d band semiconductors (e.g. PtS2 and RuS2) in which the photogeneration of holes in the valence band derived from transition metal d states leads to the formation of interfacial coordination complexes with electron donors (e.g OH-). The second group consists of electrodes exhibiting combined electronic and ionic conduction which are able to photo-intercalate guest species (e.g. Cu+ into Cu6-xPS5I or Cu3PS4). The behaviour of anodically polarized RuS2 (ΔEG = 1.2 eV) as a stable photoelectrode which is able to liberate oxygen from water with a high quantum efficiency during illumination with visible and near-IR light confirms that complicated energy conversion reactions can take place in the presence of strong interactions even with thermodynamically unstable materials. By comparing the performances of various ruthenium dichalcogenides it is shown that the photoelectrochemical reaction path depends strongly on the d state density in the upper region of the valence band. Energy losses due to kinetic inhibition (unfavourable energetic position of the intermediate states) can be reduced by using semiconductors containing transition metal pairs or clusters in their crystal structure. Semiconductor materials which are able to photo-intercalate or photo-insert cations as a result of strong electron transfer interactions could be developed for light-powered ion pumps, intercalation batteries which can be charged by solar energy and systems capable of storing optical information. Photoelectrode systems which undergo strong interactions with redox systems open up new perspectives for photoelectrochemical energy conversion and storage but also demand major research efforts. New materials with specific electronic and interfacial properties for which simplified electron transfer models are not adequate need to be developed. It will also be necessary to deal with high concentrations of surface states. © 1985.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010177945

The radiation would also be broadly tunable and subject to full polarization control. Radiation with these properties could be used for phase- and element-sensitive microprobing of biological assemblies and material interfaces as well as research on the production of electronic microstructures with features smaller than 1000 angstroms. These short wavelength capabilities, which extend to the K-absorption edges of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are neither available nor projected for laboratory XUV lasers.

One fraction contained a H+-ATPase activity that was inhibited by NO3- while the other contained a H+-ATPase inhibited by vanadate. We have previously proposed that these H+-ATPases are associated with tonoplast (N03-sensitíve) and plasma membrane (vanadate-sensitive), respectively. Both ATPases were examined to determine to what extent their activity was Influenced by variations in the concentration of ATPase substrates and products. The substrate for both ATPftses was MgATP2-, and Mg2+ concentrations in excess of ATP had only a slight inhibitory effect on either ATPftse. Both ATPases were inhibited by free ATP (i.e. ATP concentrations in excess of Mg2+) and ADP but not by AMP. The plasma membrane ATPase was more sensitive than the tonoplast ATPase to free ATP and the tonoplast ATPase was more sensitive than the plasma membrane ATPase to ADP. Inhibition of both ATPases by free ATP was complex. Inhibition of the plasma membrane ATPase by ADP was competitive whereas the tonoplast ATPase demonstrated a sigmoidal dependence on MgATP2- in the presence of ADP. Inorganic phosphate moderately inhibited both ATPases in a noncompetitive manner. Calcium inhibited the plasma membrane but not the tonoplast ATPase, apparently by a direct interaction with the ATPase rather than by disrupting the MgATP2- complex. The sensitivity of both ATPases to ADP suggests that under conditions of restricted energy supply H+-ATPase activity may be reduced by increases in ADP levels rather than by decreases in ATP levels per se.

These data were obtained using the CLEO detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) and provide information on the production of π, K, ρ, K*, φ, p, Λ, and Ξ in quark and gluon jets. The average multiplicity of hadrons per event for upsilon decays (compared with continuum annihilations) is 11.4 (10.5) pions, 2.4 (2.2) kaons, 0.6 (0.5) ρ0, 1.2 (0.8) K*, 0.6 (0.4) protons and antiprotons, 0.15 (0.08) φ, 0.19 (0.07) Λ and Λ̄, and 0.016 (0.005) Ξ- and Ξ̄ +. We have also seen evidence for η and f0 production. The most significant differences between upsilon and continuum final states are (1) the inclusive energy spectra fall off more rapidly with increasing particle energy in upsilon decays, (2) the production of heavier particles, especially baryons, is not as strongly suppressed in upsilon decays, and (3) baryon and antibaryon are more likely to be correlated at long range in upsilon decay than in continuum events. © 1985 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003186813

The physical system modelled consisted of a 6·7 × 12·2 m greenhouse with a 3·0 × 10·0 × 1·8 m rockbed attached via insulated ducts. Provisions were made to circulate air from the greenhouse through the rockbed and back whenever heating or cooling were required. When the capacity of the bed was reached, heating and cooling were accomplished in the normal manner. The computer model was based upon two existing models, one for the greenhouse and one for the rockbed. Modifications were made to each to increase their efficiency and to account for the unique aspects of this system. Validation was accomplished for three separate days comparing observed data with predicted results. Fossil fuel consumption was predicted to within 8·3% and solar energy storage and recovery to within 10·6% and 9·6% respectively. Mean differences between predicted and observed inside temperature, inside relative humidity, and rockbed temperature were 0·4°C, 4·0%, and 0·4°C respectively. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying the rate of moisture evaporation within the rockbed, the rate of air infiltration within the greenhouse, the outside convection coefficients of the greenhouse cover, and the rate of moisture input to the system from the plants (stomatal diffusion resistance). The results showed that only greenhouse relative humidity was greatly affected by the evaporation rate within the rockbed, but that relative humidity and rockbed temperature were very sensitive to infiltration rates and outside convection coefficients. Rockbed temperature, and therefore total energy stored, was only slightly sensitive to the rate of moisture input from the plants; however, fossil fuel energy consumed was significantly affected. Inside temperature was relatively insensitive to all of the factors varied. © 1985.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003122417

By using positive displacement energy recovery pumps and operating at lower than usual pressures on high rejection membranes, reverse osmosis desalination systems can achieve specific energy consumptions below 4 kWh/m3 of product water converted from sea water, less than half the energy requirement without energy recovery. These pumps can be operated at variable speed, permitting variable capacity production over a wide range. As working pressure and permeate flow both vary linearly with pump speed, energy requirements are greatly reduced at part load. The basic control options are to use storage batteries for energy retiming, or to run the reverse osmosis unit at variable speed to use the solar generated power directly. Experimental performance data and an optimization analysis of the several control options are provided. The energy recovery pump enables significant reductions in the cost of water desalted by solar photvoltaic energy. © 1985.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002287353

The objective of this investigation is to select the best initial purity for the stabilizer aluminum used in energy storage magnets. Monolythic centimeter diameter specimens were fatigued at 4.2 K to strains (ε) reaching 0.3 percent. The resistivity ratio rapidly decreases during the first 100 cycles and approaches saturation (RRRf) after about 1000 cycles for all strains tested. The RRRf values are different for different initial resistivity ratio (RRRi) values, but all tend to come together at 0.3% strain independent of RRRi. The maximum specimen stress (σmax) is reached after about 1000 cycles also and approaches a common value (σmax = εE/2, where ε is the strain range and E the elastic modulus) independent of RRRi. Thus high purity aluminum becomes “fully hard” at equili-brium and behaves elastically. The impact of fatigue damage on conductor design and choice of stabilizer purity is considered.

One experiment was under conditions of good moisture supply (a deep Vertisol site in the high rainfall year of 1978) but the other experienced early moisture stress and had much lower end-of-season soil moisture storage (an Alfisol site in 1979). In 1978 the proportional sorghum yield was not affected by row arrangement (86 and 85% of the sole crop yield for the SSP and SP treatments respectively). Under the drier Alfisol conditions of 1979, the proportional sorghum yield was lower, probably because of the increased competitive ability of the drought resistant pigeonpea, and it was adversely affected by the alternate row arrangement (72% for SSP and 60% for SP). Compared with the SSP arrangement, the SP arrangement increased the level of light interception by the intercropped pigeonpea immediately after the sorghum harvest from 30 to 48 % in 1978 and from 44 to 60 % in 1979; the total energy intercepted during the whole post-sorghum period was increased by 23 and 12 % in the 2 years, respectively. However, these improvements in canopy cover were associated with only small increases in total dry matter of the intercropped pigeonpea at final harvest, from 69 to 74 % of the sole crop in 1978 and from 60 to 65 % in 1979. The increase in seed yield was even less than that in total dry matter in 1978 (from 90 to 93% of the sole crop) but similar in 1979 (71 to 76 %); the value of this increase in 1979 was insufficient to offset the decrease in sorghum yield. None of the increases in total dry matter or seed yield of pigeonpea reached significance. It is concluded that with a good moisture supply alternate rows could be an alternative to the 2 sorghum: 1 pigeonpea arrangement, though it offers no additional yield advantage. With poorer moisture supply, alternate rows are not a worthwhile option because of the risk of reducing sorghum yield to an extent that cannot be offset by the small increase in pigeonpea yield. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

A Nd-YAG laser of wavelength 1.0641µm has been used with output power 0.7 1.2 W. The resultant photon spectra are measured with a pure Ge detector, some of which are presented in the present report together with some description on the experimental methods. The absolute yieldsare being measured by the use of an 8 inch Ø x 8 inch long NaI scintillation counter.

Reactivity is evidenced in Mo-3d and S-2p core level lineshapes and intensities. It is found that this system largely follows the simple thermodynamic model, based on bulk heats of formation of admetal-chalcogenides and admetal-cation alloys, which proved adequate in analysing related interfaces at the basal face of gallium selenide. An exception is the Al MoS2 interface, where it is suggested that a combination of effects prevents the observation of reaction by SXPS. These studies are important in understanding Schottky Barrier formation at the more complex surfaces of Groups IV and III-V semiconductors. The results are also the first solid state data obtained with the new 16 metre high energy toroidal grating monochromator (HE-TGM) at BESSY which uses the electron bunch of the storage ring as entrance slit. © 1985.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000149352
