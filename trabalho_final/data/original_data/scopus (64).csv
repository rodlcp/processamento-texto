This latter requires memory access and memory control overheads while the processor is fetching task instructions from the memory. The programmer describes all the tasks as instructions in the program memory. On the other hand data-stream-driven computer is already configured or hardwired for a specific computing operation, no memory is required apart from data storage. In some contexts we refer to data-stream-driven computers as accelerators or single-purpose processors. This chapter discusses the benefit of data-stream-driven computing for better power and energy efficiency. We took matrix multiplication as an example application to compare the power and energy dissipations between load/store and non-instruction fetch-based architectures. We witnessed that single-purpose processor reduces almost 100% of the dynamic power when replacing the general-purpose processor. With the current mainstream transistor technology, morphware platforms that allow massive parallelism are the potential key for data-stream-driven computer implementations to saving energy in battery-powered embedded systems and to solve the dissipated power dilemma, as the heat becomes the bottleneck of traditional high frequency processors. If the same strategy is applied to mainstream computers and data center servers, we will not only reduce electricity bills but we will also contribute to greener computing by lowering the IT sector's CO2 emissions. © 2014, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944873632

Advanced energy storage device (ESD) such as lithium-ion batteries and super-capacitors however have low terminal voltages. Connecting many ESD cells in series is an acceptable solution but requires complex cell equalization circuitry to keep the state-of-charge of each cell balanced. The alternative is to develop a bidirectional DC-DC converter to interface the low terminal voltage ESDs to the high voltage DC bus. The dual-active-bridge (DAB) topology is suited for bidirectional DC-DC conversion due to its simple structure and soft switching nature. However reactive power is a major drawback when using traditional phase shift (TPS) control. In this paper, a hybrid of phase shift and PWM (HPSP) control strategy is proposed to eliminate the reactive power. Comparing with the TPS control, smaller rms current is required for the same power rating, which will improve the system efficiency. Mathematical model of transmission power is established for the TPS and the HPSP control. Simulation results verifying the excellent performance of the proposed control method are presented in this paper. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Bidirectional DC-DC converters; Control strategies; Dual active bridges; Energy storage devices (ESD); Energy storage systems; High voltage DC bus; Lithium-ion battery; Transmission power; DC-DC converters; Distributed power generation; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatic discharge; Energy conversion; HVDC power transmission; Mathematical models; Phase shift; Reactive power; Phase shifters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891141870

The installation of BESS units at non optimal places can result in an increase in cost, including the system losses and larger battery capacity and therefore, having an effect opposite to the desired. For this reason, the use of a methodology capable of analyzing the influence on some system characteristics of BESS allocation and sizing is very useful for system planning.

The MJPV receiver, which integrates cell and bypass diode, is then mated with its concentrating optic to form a channel, and several such channels form a CPV module, in which the receivers are connected electrically in series. The two ends of the module receiver string are brought out to a single pair of electrical connections, at which point the lightcurrent- voltage (L-I-V) response of the entire module can be tested. With commercial CPV modules commonly sealed against outdoor exposure, there are no other accessible test points, and field installation on trackers further complicates access to performance data. There are many physical phenomena influencing module performance, and in early development and commercialization some of these may not yet be completely under control. Unambiguous diagnosis of such phenomena from one full-module L-I-V curve is problematic. Simple, fast test methods are needed to develop more detailed information from full-module on-tracker testing, without opening up modules in the field. We describe a test protocol, using a simple optical shutter array constructed to fit mechanically over the module. When module L-I-V curves are recorded for each of various combinations of open and closed shutters, the information can be used to identify one or more anomalous channels, and to further identify the kind of anomaly present, such as optical misalignment, conductor failure, series or shunt resistance, and so on. Simulated results from anomaly models can be compared with the measured results to identify the anomalous behaviour. Results herein are compared with direct singlechannel measurements to verify the technique. The L-I-V response curves were obtained in continuous real time, an approach found to be more helpful than single-shot capture in understanding field response. A triangular wave function generator is used to drive the DC power supply, and a four-channel digital sampling oscilloscope displays and stores the real time response. Where modules exhibit unstable or intermittent response under certain conditions, this is immediately obvious in real-time display. © 2013 SPIE.","Concentrator photovoltaic; Continuous dynamic display; CPV; L-I-V curve; Shutter array technique; Solar energy; Test method","Concentrator photovoltaics; Continuous dynamics; CPV; L-I-V curve; Shutter arrays; Test method; Cathode ray oscilloscopes; Computer simulation; Concentration (process); Digital storage; Electric connectors; Solar energy; Testing; Photonics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890919198

We introduce a day-ahead charging scheduling strategy that minimizes system generation costs, enforces network and PEV end-use constraints, and at the same time enables the fleet to compensate deviations of wind power output from its day-ahead forecast. For this purpose, a probabilistic wind power forecast model is integrated into an Optimal Power Flow based smart-charging scheme. The fleet is modeled as a set of virtual storages whose characteristics depend on individual driving patterns.

In this paper an explicit cost function considering battery degradation is developed, which sufficiently captures the nonlinearities and is applicable for arbitrary battery load patterns.

In this context, the paper focuses on the problem of the optimal siting and sizing of distributed storage systems. In particular, the paper proposes the formulation of a problem that accounts: (i) the voltage support of storage systems to the grid, (ii) the network losses and (iii) the cost of the energy-flow towards the external grid. As the formulated problem is mixed-integer, non-convex and non-linear, its solution requires the adoption of heuristic techniques. In this respect, a two-stage iterative procedure is proposed. The first stage of the procedure utilizes a genetic algorithm to provide locations and sizes of the distributed storage systems; the second stage evaluates the fitness of the solution provided by the first part by solving a daily AC optimal power flow. An application example, referring to the IEEE 13 busses test feeder, is included in order to demonstrate and discuss the efficiency of the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Ac optimal power flows; Active distribution networks; Application examples; Distributed storage system; Formulated problems; Heuristic techniques; Optimal locations; Siting and sizings; Heuristic methods; Iterative methods; Location; Multiprocessing systems; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890874947

At least 80% of the Australian cotton-growing area is irrigated using gravity surface-irrigation systems. This review found that, over 23 years, cotton crops utilise 6-7ML/ha of irrigation water, depending on the amount of seasonal rain received. The seasonal evapotranspiration of surface-irrigated crops averaged 729mm over this period. Over the past decade, water-use productivity by Australian cotton growers has improved by 40%. This has been achieved by both yield increases and more efficient water-management systems. The whole-farm irrigation efficiency index improved from 57% to 70%, and the crop water use index is >3kg/mm.ha, high by international standards. Yield increases over the last decade can be attributed to plant-breeding advances, the adoption of genetically modified varieties, and improved crop management. Also, there has been increased use of irrigation scheduling tools and furrow-irrigation system optimisation evaluations. This has reduced in-field deep-drainage losses. The largest loss component of the farm water balance on cotton farms is evaporation from on-farm water storages. Some farmers are changing to alternative systems such as centre pivots and lateral-move machines, and increasing numbers of these alternatives are expected. These systems can achieve considerable labour and water savings, but have significantly higher energy costs associated with water pumping and machine operation. The optimisation of interactions between water, soils, labour, carbon emissions and energy efficiency requires more research and on-farm evaluations. Standardisation of water-use efficiency measures and improved water measurement techniques for surface irrigation are important research outcomes to enable valid irrigation benchmarks to be established and compared. Water-use performance is highly variable between cotton farmers and farming fields and across regions. Therefore, site-specific measurement is important. The range in the presented datasets indicates potential for further improvement in water-use efficiency and productivity on Australian cotton farms. © 2013 CSIRO.","cotton; efficiency; irrigation; water; yield","cost-benefit analysis; cotton; crop production; crop yield; evapotranspiration; growth response; optimization; rainfall; seasonal variation; standardization; water use efficiency; Australia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890853191

Design and Setting: Cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study at Tehran Blood Transfusion Center Tehran, Iran. Methods: Between July and September 2011, 117 male blood donors were selected and divided into four groups according to their frequency of blood donation. Thirty male non-donors were also recruited as controls after adjusting for age, weight, height, smoking habits and monthly income. Iron status indices and some criteria such as general health and dietary measurements were determined among all subjects. Results: The values of the iron-related parameters were significantly lower among donors than among non-donors. Only total iron binding capacity (TIBC) was found to be significantly higher among different donor groups than in the controls. A significant positive correlation was observed between age and serum ferritin (SF) only among the donors who had donated once within the preceding year. The iron status indices did not show any significant relationship with BMI among donors or non-donors. Conclusion: A donation frequency of more than twice a year had a significant influence on iron-related parameters. Therefore, without annual measurement of these parameters, further phlebotomies may lead to iron deficiency and donor rejection in the future.","Blood donors; Ferritins; Iran; Iron; Male","ferritin; iron; transferrin; adult; article; blood donor; blood transfusion; body mass; controlled study; cross-sectional study; human; iron binding capacity; iron blood level; iron intake; male; middle aged; questionnaire; radioimmunoassay; Adult; Age Factors; Analysis of Variance; Anemia, Iron-Deficiency; Blood Donors; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Energy Intake; Humans; Iran; Iron; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Assessment; Reference Values; Smoking; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890842747

Results show that for the dipole, which generates the strongest field, the relative change of quadrupole strength is lower than 4.10-3. For the quadrupoles the sextupole component is within the relative range of less than 0.7.10-4. The impact on linear and non-linear optics at low energies has been accordingly studied.

Usually, the energy storage system (ESS) is used to store the excess power generated during off-peak hours, and to return it to the system when power from PV is not enough for the system, or generation is more expensive. A real-time dynamic programming algorithm for energy storage in a PV/battery system, based on the battery charge and discharge characteristics, and current and temperature dependence of the capacity of the battery, is presented in this paper. The work aims to extend existing battery- aware programming techniques. It differs from previous works, as it takes into consideration many aspects of battery characteristics that were not considered previously. This allows better use of the battery bank and can prolong the battery service time. This paper also builds a simple PV/battery system in an island microgrid. In this paper, fuel cell power plants (FCPPs) are permanently used to operate in island microgrids, and 2 batteries are used as reserves for charge and discharge in various hours. © 2015, Walailak J Sci & Tech.

In particular, iron is tightly bound to host proteins such as transferrin to maintain homeostasis, to limit potential damage caused by iron toxicity under physiological conditions and to restrict access by pathogens. Therefore, iron acquisition during infection of a human host is a challenge that must be surmounted by every successful pathogenic microorganism. Iron is essential for bacterial and fungal physiological processes such as DNA replication, transcription, metabolism, and energy generation via respiration. Hence, pathogenic bacteria and fungi have developed sophisticated strategies to gain access to iron from host sources. Indeed, siderophore production and transport, iron acquisition from heme and host iron-containing proteins such as hemoglobin and transferrin, and reduction of ferric to ferrous iron with subsequent transport are all strategies found in bacterial and fungal pathogens of humans.

Some of these challenges can be mitigated by using demand response (DR) and energy storage to provide power system services. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework that allows us to assess different types of DR and energy storage resources and determine which resources are best suited to which services. We focus on four resources: batteries, plug-in electric vehicles, commercial buildings, and thermostatically controlled loads. We define generic power system services in order to assess the resources. The contribution of the paper is threefold: (i) the development of a framework for assessing DR and energy storage resources; (ii) a detailed analysis of the four resources in terms of ability for providing power system services, and (iii) a comparison of the resources, including an example case for Switzerland. We find that the ability of resources to provide power system services varies largely and also depends on the implementation scenario. Generally, there is large potential to use DR and energy storage for providing power system services, but there are also challenges to be addressed, for example, adequate compensation, privacy, guaranteeing costumer service, etc. © 2013 IEEE.","Demand response; demand side management; energy storage; renewable energy integration","Commercial building; Demand response; Demand side managements; Electricity industry; Fluctuating renewable energy sources; Plug-in Electric Vehicles; Renewable energy integrations; Thermostatically controlled loads; Electric power distribution; Office buildings; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; System theory; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890495733

For some species, the energy accumulated during the growing season, and stored primarily as lipids, is crucial to preventing starvation mortality over winter. Thus, in order to understand the adaptive responses of fish life history to climate, it is important to determine how energy should be allocated to storage and how it trades off with the other body components that contribute to fitness. In this paper, we extend previous life history theory to include an explicit representation of how the seasonal allocation of energy to storage acts as a constraint on fish growth. We show that a strategy that privileges allocation to structural mass in the first part of the growing season and switches to storage allocation later on, as observed empirically in several fish species, is the strategy that maximizes growth efficiency and hence is expected to be favored by natural selection. Stochastic simulations within this theoretical framework demonstrate that the relative performance of this switching strategy is robust to a wide range of fluctuations in growing season length, and to moderate short-term (i.e., daily) fluctuations in energy intake and/or expenditure within the growing season. We then integrate this switching strategy with a biphasic growth modeling framework to predict typical growth rates of walleye Sander vitreus, a cool water species. and lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, a cold water specialist, across a climatic gradient in North America. As predicted, growth rates increased linearly with the duration of the growing season. Regression line intercepts were negative, indicating that growth can only occur when growing season length exceeds a threshold necessary to produce storage for winter survival. The model also reveals important differences between species, showing that observed growth rates of lake trout are systematically higher than those of walleye in relatively colder lakes. This systematic difference is consistent with both (i) the expected superior capacity of lake trout to withstand harsh winter conditions, and (ii) some degree of counter gradient adaptation of lake trout growth capacity to the climatic gradient covered by our data. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Biphasic growth model; Energy budget; Fish bioenergetics; Life history optimization; Seasonal environments","adaptation; bioenergetics; energy budget; fitness; growing season; growth modeling; growth rate; life history theory; natural selection; optimization; salmonid; seasonal variation; stochasticity; adaptation; article; caloric intake; climate; conceptual framework; controlled study; energy metabolism; energy storage; fish; growing season; growth; growth rate; lake; life history; natural selection; nonhuman; North America; priority journal; Salvelinus namaycush; Sander vitreus; seasonal variation; simulation; survival; trout; winter; North America; Salvelinus namaycush; Sander vitreus; Stizostedion vitreum; Biphasic growth model; Energy budget; Fish bioenergetics; Life history optimization; Seasonal environments; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Fishes; Lakes; Models, Biological; Seasons; Species Specificity; Stochastic Processes; Temperature; Trout",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887134711

Genetically modified C57BL/6J mice were produced by targeted disruption of the mct1 gene in order to understand the role of this transporter in energy homeostasis. Null mutation was embryonically lethal, but MCT1+/- mice developed normally. However, when fed high fat diet (HFD), MCT1+/- mice displayed resistance to development of diet-induced obesity (24.8% lower body weight after 16 weeks of HFD), as well as less insulin resistance and no hepatic steatosis as compared to littermate MCT1+/+ mice used as controls. Body composition analysis revealed that reduced weight gain in MCT1+/- mice was due to decreased fat accumulation (50.0% less after 9 months of HFD) notably in liver and white adipose tissue. This phenotype was associated with reduced food intake under HFD (12.3% less over 10 weeks) and decreased intestinal energy absorption (9.6% higher stool energy content). Indirect calorimetry measurements showed ∼15% increase in O2 consumption and CO2 production during the resting phase, without any changes in physical activity. Determination of plasma concentrations for various metabolites and hormones did not reveal significant changes in lactate and ketone bodies levels between the two genotypes, but both insulin and leptin levels, which were elevated in MCT1+/+ mice when fed HFD, were reduced in MCT1+/- mice under HFD. Interestingly, the enhancement in expression of several genes involved in lipid metabolism in the liver of MCT1+/+ mice under high fat diet was prevented in the liver of MCT1+/- mice under the same diet, thus likely contributing to the observed phenotype. These findings uncover the critical role of MCT1 in the regulation of energy balance when animals are exposed to an obesogenic diet. © 2013 Lengacher et al.",,"carbon dioxide; monocarboxylate transporter 1; oxygen; animal experiment; animal model; article; body weight; caloric intake; energy absorption; energy balance; energy expenditure; female; gene; gene expression; gene frequency; genotype; glucose intolerance; haploinsufficiency; homozygosity; insulin resistance; intestine absorption; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; mct1 gene; metabolic rate; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oxygen consumption; phenotype; physical activity; protein expression; weight reduction; white adipose tissue; Animals; beta-Galactosidase; Body Composition; Diet, High-Fat; Eating; Female; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Mutant Strains; Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters; Obesity; Symporters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893177634

Two mechanisms control assurance of storage integrity, which are containment within the geological structure and minimizing the potential for wellbore leakage (Espie, 2005). This study is concerned with describing the wellbore leakage mechanism utilizing wellbore element, which will be extended to the whole wellbore system. To get a better chance of success in practice, successful CCS depends on the small-scale leakage problem associated with localized flow along wellbores. Our knowledge of wellbore performance for storage purposes is still weak. The paper is the first of a series to model wellbore element analytically by introducing wellbore sealing efficiency index. Wellbore sealing efficiency can be used as a ranking criteria between different wellbore elements in the same well and/or different wells in the same locality.",,,Abstract Report,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890280100

In charging mode, ETES operates as a transcritical CO2 heat pump, consuming electric energy which is converted into thermal energy stored in the form of hot water and ice on the hot and cold side of the cycle, respectively. On demand, the CO2 cycle is reversed for discharging during which ETES operates as transcritical CO 2 power generation plant, consuming the stored hot and cold sources. The target capacity of the ETES system is of the order of units of MW electric to ∼100 MW electric, with typical daily cycles and 4 to 8 hours of storage. The estimated electric-to-electric round trip efficiency of ETES is about 60%. A companion paper [1] presents the control concept of the ETES plant and discusses several issues specific to the ETES plant design and operation. This paper analyzes these particular requirements from the perspective of the CO 2 turbomachinery required for the storage plant, presenting the selection of the turbomachinery types and their shaft arrangement suitable for the ETES. The expected performance, main design features and challenges are discussed, together with questions related to the scalability of the turbomachines towards high power targets. Impacts of the turbomachinery designs on the ETES system performance, such as the sensitivity of the system electric-to-electric round trip efficiency on the turbomachinery efficiency are discussed.

In order to reduce the risks and to gain financial advantage for wind farm operators, the use of pumped hydro storage to adjust the delivery schedule of energy is proposed. An approach that systematically and rapidly addresses the economic, infrastructural, geographic and meteorological factors relevant to wind power plants and pumped hydro storage over large areas is required. An integrated Geographic Information System-based tool is developed to identify, on the scale of a country, wind power plants and pumped hydro storage facilities. Further, a decision algorithm that has inputs of the forecasted and actual wind energy productions, and the day- Ahead and intraday electricity market prices is also developed to optimise the use of pumped hydro storage. This approach is demonstrated for Germany, with the target of increasing electricity production from renewable energy sources. A countrywide portfolio of wind power plants that meets the increased electricity production target, and existing and potential pumped hydro storage facilities are identified. By optimizing the use of pumped hydro storage, it is shown that wind farm operators can achieve a 2- 4% gain on the Internal Rate of Return on investments. The improved financial performance with the use of pumped hydro storage increases the attractiveness for investments in the wind power sector and mitigates the adverse effects of the variability in the dispatch of wind-generated electricity.

The storage plant uses electrical energy with a standard vaporcompression heat pump/refrigeration cycle to store thermal energy as hot water and ice over a period of approximately 8 hours during low power demand. The power cycle is then reversed and operated as a simple Rankine cycle to produce ∼100 MWe for about 4.5 hours during peak demand. During the power generation cycle the storage plant uses the heat stored in the hot water tanks, together with ice melting, plus ambient heat rejection for the heat sink. For 100 MWe class power plants, the round trip efficiency is estimated to be up to 60%. CO2 was selected as the working fluid because it improves the ability of the plant to operate with high reversibility. In addition, it is compact and can operate below the freezing point of water. This report describes the major control characteristics of the plant, together with methods, tools, and results of the model. Because the plant is nearly ""closed"", it must operate only by consuming electrical energy during the charging cycle and by producing electrical energy plus some waste heat during the discharge cycle. All other heat transfer processes occurs solely within the storage plant itself and consists of either heating or cooling water and by making or melting ice. For the plant to operate continuously, both the water thermal storage and ice storage must be returned to their initial conditions after every 24 hour period. Otherwise, small changes in the thermal environment during waste heat rejection or performance variations of internal components will cause the storage system to drift from its designed operating temperature, pressure and energy storage capability, challenging its ability to operate. The control concept for the storage plant addresses both the operation of the plant during charging and discharging. It also addresses strategies for control during off-design situations or due to disturbances such as load following or changes in ambient heat rejection conditions. The process simulations described in the paper include models for the main physical components of the plant including the turbomachinery, the heat exchanger network, states of charge of the cold and hot storage, and CO2 inventory.

Multi-objective optimization has been used to identify Pareto-optimal designs and highlight the trade-offs between minimizing investment costs and minimizing specific CO2 emissions. The solar hybrid combined-cycle plant provides a 60% reduction in electricity cost compared to parabolic trough power plants at annual solar shares up to 20%. The storage integrated designs can achieve much higher solar shares and provide a 7-13% reduction in electricity costs at annual solar shares up to 90%.

Although the DC link inductor causes the inverter to be less efficient than an equivalent voltage-source inverter, it offers lower cost due to the zero-current switching and lower number of components. In addition, the output current is easily controlled using the boost switch and offers simple open-loop and feed-forward control.

We confirm that the critical element that allows the models to predict the growth as the CBL coalesces with the residual layer is the adoption of a variable lapse rate above the growing CBL. This is not a new finding per se, as several previous studies in the literature have adopted this strategy. Different parameterizations of a slab model, based on the turbulence kinetic energy budget at the top of the CBL, were tested, and the inclusion of the storage and dissipation terms did not improve the model. Among the alternatives for choosing the lapse rate as the CBL grows, fair results are obtained with a simple choice of two values, with absolute mean errors of the order of 270 m for cases with and without a residual layer. Both lapse rates, representative of the residual layer and the free atmosphere, are obtained from the first morning sounding. Finally, an alternative model for the CBL growth into a residual layer that assumes a zero-lapse rate above the CBL did not perform well with the FIFE data.

However, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of metal tolerance in these plants is necessary to allow full optimization of this approach. The present study was undertaken to gain insight into Hg and Cd accumulation and their effects in a representative macrophyte, Elodea nuttallii. Exposure to methyl-Hg (23ngdm-3) had no significant effect while inorganic Hg (70ngdm-3) and Cd (281μgdm-3) affected root growth but did not affect shoots growth, photosynthesis, or antioxidant enzymes. Phytochelatins were confirmed as having a role in Cd tolerance in this plant while Hg tolerance seems to rely on different mechanisms. Histology and subcellular distribution revealed a localized increase in lignification, and an increased proportion of metal accumulation in cell wall over time. Proteomics further suggested that E. nuttallii was able to efficiently adapt its energy sources and the structure of its cells during Hg and Cd exposure. Storage in cell walls to protect cellular machinery is certainly predominant at environmental concentrations of metals in this plant resulting in a high tolerance highlighted by the absence of toxicity symptoms in shoots despite the significant accumulation of metals. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Cadmium; Inorganic mercury; Lignin; Methyl-mercury; Toxicokinetics","Bioaccumulation; Bioremediation; Cadmium; Cells; Lignin; Machinery; Mercury (metal); Metals; Molecular biology; Plants (botany); Antioxidant enzyme; Different mechanisms; Environmental concentration; Inorganic mercury; Metal accumulation; Methyl mercury; Subcellular distribution; Toxicokinetics; Cytology; cadmium; mercury; antioxidant; bioaccumulation; cell organelle; enzyme activity; heavy metal; histology; macrophyte; metal; photosynthesis; physiology; phytoremediation; pollution exposure; proteomics; tolerance; toxicity; weed; adaptation; article; bioaccumulation; cell function; cell structure; cell wall; cellular distribution; controlled study; Elodea; Elodea nuttallii; energy resource; lignification; macrophyte; metal tolerance; nonhuman; photosynthesis; phytoremediation; proteomics; root growth; shoot growth; Elodea nuttallii; Cadmium; Inorganic mercury; Lignin; Methyl-mercury; Toxicokinetics; Antioxidants; Biodegradation, Environmental; Buthionine Sulfoximine; Cadmium; Cadmium Chloride; Cell Wall; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Gels; Hydrocharitaceae; Kinetics; Lignin; Mercuric Chloride; Mercury; Metals; Peroxidase; Photosynthesis; Phytochelatins; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Proteomics; Soil Pollutants; Superoxide Dismutase",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889078903

Cemented paste tailings (CPT) is an innovative form of amalgamated material currently available to the mining industry in developed countries. It is made usually from mill tailings mingled with a small amount of binder (customarily Portland cement) and water. The high cost associated with production and haulage of ordinary Portland cement and its alleged average performance as a sole binder in the long term (due to vulnerability to internal sulphate attack) have prompted users to appraise less expensive and technically efficient substitutes for mine tailings paste formulations. Generally, these binders include but are not limited to sulphate resistant cements, and/or as a partial replacement for Portland cement by artificial pozzolans, natural pozzolans, calcium sulphate substances and sodium silicates. The approach to designing environmentally efficient CPT is to ensure long-term stability and effective control over environmental contaminants through the use of composite binder systems with enhanced engineering properties to cater for inherit deficiencies in the individual constituents. The alkaline pore solution created by high free calcium rich cement kiln dust (CKD) (byproduct of cement manufacturing) is capable of disintegrating the solid glassy network of artificial pozzolans to produce reactive silicate and aluminate species when attacked by (OH-) ions. The augmented pozzolanic reactivity of CKD-slag and CKD-fly ash systems may produce resilient CPT. Since cemented paste comprising mine tailings and binders is a relatively new technology, a review of the binding materials used in such formulations and their performance evaluation in mechanical fill behaviour was considered pertinent in the study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Acid rock drainage; Binder; Cement kiln dust; Cemented paste tailings; Hydration activator; Paste backfill; Portland cement; Pozzolanic materials; Sulphate attack; Sulphidic mine waste","alkali; calcium; calcium silicate; calcium sulfate; cement; concrete; hydroxyl group; ion; iron; pumice; pyrite; sodium; sulfate; water; cementation; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; hydration; literature review; manufacturing; mining industry; pollution effect; sulfate; underground storage; waste disposal; biota; building material; cement industry; cemented paste tailing; chemical composition; chemical parameters; composite material; compressive strength; electric power plant; energy cost; engineering; environmental impact; fly ash; furnace; hydration; hydraulic conductivity; metallurgy; mine tailings; mining; oxidation; pozzolanic material; review; rigidity; scanning electron microscopy; shear strength; slag; sludge; surface property; tensile strength; waste disposal; waste management; water retention; Dorset [England]; England; Isle of Portland; United Kingdom; Acid rock drainage; Binder; Cement kiln dust; Cemented paste tailings; Hydration activator; Paste backfill; Portland cement; Pozzolanic materials; Sulphate attack; Sulphidic mine waste; Coal Ash; Construction Materials; Mining",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886245724

This global phenomenon has since received much attention from the scientific community. Better interpretation of the long-term trend of pan evaporation (involving seasonal and inter-annual variations) requires rigorous experimental investigation of the physics of pan evaporation. To do that, we constructed an instrumented US Class A pan that replicated an operational pan at Canberra Airport in Australia. We subsequently monitored pan evaporation and associated meteorological variables at half-hourly intervals over a three-year period (Oct 2007-Jan 2010).Extending our earlier work on the aerodynamics of pan evaporation, we conducted a theoretical and experimental study on the energy balance of the pan under non-steady state conditions. The theory considers heat exchanges at both the pan water surface and the pan wall. We formulate the radiative balance based on the geometry of the system (the pan diameter, the height of the water level, the height of the rim and solar zenith angle) and account for differences in albedo and emissivity between the pan water surface and the pan wall. The theory is used to compute all relevant energy fluxes and thereby close the energy balance. Integration of the half-hourly fluxes to a daily basis showed that we were able to close the energy budget with a RMSE of ~18Wm-2 or 7.5% of the net short-wave radiation. We find that evaporation from our pan is dominated (~80%) by the radiative exchanges at the pan water surface; those at the pan wall are smaller but also important. Contrary to expectation, there was little if any sensible heat exchange across the pan wall. Instead we found that the major sensible heat flux occurs across the pan water surface. Importantly, evaporative cooling at the pan water surface can result in a transfer of sensible heat from the (warmer) air to the (cooler) surface of the water body. The sensible heat flux from the overlying air to the pan water surface is minimal at low evaporation rates, but at higher evaporation rates (e.g., &gt;300Wm-2) it contributes the equivalent of up to 15% of the total evaporative flux. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Energy balance; Heat storage; Latent heat; Long-wave radiation; Pan coefficient; Pan evaporation; Sensible heat; Short-wave radiation","air temperature; annual variation; electromagnetic radiation; energy balance; energy efficiency; evaporation; experimental study; geometry; heat balance; instrumentation; observational method; sensible heat flux; zenith angle; Australia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885183377

The composite represents a promising cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. The preparation of the nanocomposite is achieved by combining a molten salt precipitation process and a radio frequency oxygen plasma for the first time. We demonstrate that clusters of α-LiFeO2 nanoparticles incorporated into MWCNTs are capable of delivering a stable and high reversible capacity of 147 mA h g-1 at 1 C after 100 cycles with the first cycle Coulombic efficiency of ∼95%. The rate capability of the composite is significantly improved and its reversible capacity is measured to be 101 mA h g-1 at a high current rate of 10 C.

The results showed that melting processes are not suitable for preparation of 9Ni-2Mg-Y alloy due to high losses of Mg and Y. Therefore, 9Ni-2Mg-Y alloy powder was prepared by three methods including: 1) mechanical alloying, 2) mechanical alloying + solid state reaction + ball milling, and 3) mixing + solid state reaction + ball milling. The prepared 9Ni-2Mg-Y alloy powders were compared for their catalytic effects on hydrogen desorption of MgH2. It is found that 9Ni-2Mg-Y alloy powder prepared by mechanical alloying + solid state reaction + ball milling method has a smaller particle size (1-5 μm) and higher surface area (1.7 m2 g-1) than that of other methods. H2 desorption tests revealed that addition of 9Ni-2Mg-Y alloy prepared by mechanical alloying + solid state reaction + ball milling to MgH2 decreases the hydrogen desorption temperature of MgH2 from 425 to 210 C and improves the hydrogen desorption capacity from 0 to 3.5 wt.% at 350 C during 8 min. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The characteristics of the electrode materials affect the stability and the energy efficiency of VRFB. Carbon materials are the best suited for VRFB applications. In this study, the calcined treatment, acid treatment and ozone treatment were used to modify the surface of carbon papers. The redox reaction of [VO]2+/[VO2]+ on the modified carbon papers was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The surface compositions of carbon materials were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS). The experimental results reveal that three oxidative methods enhance the redox reaction of [VO]2+/[VO2]+. The calcined treatments and acid treatments also enhanced hydrolysis reaction. The mole ratio of O/C apparently increased, but the binding energy of Cls and Ols were not chemically shifted in the acid treatment. The intensity of binding energy of Ols, between 532 eV and 534 eV, apparently increased in the ozone and calcined treatments. The Ox treated samples were more hydrophilic than the Oz treated samples.

In the current study, a lectin was extracted and purified from seeds of Citrullus colocynthis by Sepharose 4B-Galactose and DEAE-cellulose fast flow chromatographies. Different concentrations of the lectin were added to artificial diet of Ectomyelois ceratoniae larvae finding out its effect on some biological parameters, digestive physiology and amount of storage macromolecules. It was found that CCA (C. colocynthis Agglutinin) increased life span from 23.44 days in control to 28.59 days in the treated individuals. Survival of larvae on control and CCA diets were 93.3 and 66.6%, respectively. Different concentrations of CCA significantly affected a-amylase and general proteolytic activities except for TAG-lipase activity. Activities of all specific proteases decreased when larvae were fed on different concentrations of CCA except for aminopeptidase. Meanwhile, amount of storage macromolecules in the larvae fed on different concentrations of CCA statistically decreased vs. control. These results demonstrated that CCA could intervene in physiology of E. ceratoniae and survival of larvae.

Post-inspection, mask defects have traditionally been classified by operators manually based on visual review. This approach may have worked down to 65/55nm node layers. However, starting 45nm and smaller nodes, visually reviewing 50 to sometimes 100s of defects on masks with complex modelbased OPC, SRAF, and ILT geometries, is error-prone and takes up valuable inspection tool capacity. Both these shortcomings in manual defect review are overcome by adoption of the computational solution called Automated Defect Classification (ADC) wherein mask defects are accurately classified within seconds and consistent to guidelines used by production technicians and engineers. While mask shops have inspection, repair, and clean tools to ensure that all defects and repairs are fixed to within certain print tolerances, the emphasis in wafer fab is then for the reticle to not change. However, it is well known that extensive use of 193nm reticles in wafer fabs causes the growth of haze-like crystals on the mask. So even though the mask is free of any critical contaminations when initially shipped out from the mask shop to the wafer fab, its prolonged storage in the fab environment and extended exposures in 193nm scanners, causes the growth of these small contamination-looking haze defects. Once seeded, haze defects only increase in number and severity with further use of the reticle, often making it OOS (Out Of Spec) rather rapidly. Hence, it is crucial to monitor through periodic inspections, every reticle defect not just in terms of the number and severity in the current inspection, which is enabled by use of ADC, but also in terms of how these defects have potentially changed from previous inspection requals. The purpose of such monitoring is not only to verify that the reticle is currently in-spec but also predict if the mask will still stay in-spec before the next requalification cycle. Furthermore, defect repairs are being done in mask shops in increasingly high MEEF geometries. Repair sites tend to have very thin residues in and around the original defective regions, and contribute to the overall in-spec printability of the site. These thin residues however tend to become mobile under the high energy 193nm scanner exposures often causing the effective printability of the repair site to change. So even though the repair site may have originally met certain printability criteria, it can very well change and become OOS with extended scanner exposures. Hence, it has also become essential to monitor every reticle repair to ensure that it will not change with increasing scanner exposures. This is the essential concept behind Defect Progression Monitoring (DPM) in wafer fab environment. ADC-DPM is together implemented by first characterizing defects in the current inspection in terms of various metrics or gauges that indicate defect severity. All this information, including defect x,y locations are saved in an extensive database. Any critical defects in the current inspection are first highlighted based on certain guidelines specified through ADC. Next, through DPM, every one of these defects, including haze and repairs, are compared with their corresponding instances in previous inspections. Any substantial deviation in defect severity levels indicate that the repair or haze site is progressively degrading, and hence the reticle needs to be sent back to the mask shop for further analysis and repel. Introduction of ADC-DPM in high-volume N40 and N28 wafer manufacturing has detected all real haze defects and repair changes with minimal false alarms, establishing an effective early-warning system. It has provided an SPC-like system monitoring every reticle defect for change, and become quintessential for reticle requal defect disposition. © 2013 SPIE.","32nm and below; ADC; Automated Defect Classification; Computational Lithography; Computational Review; Defect progression; Defect Review; DPM; Haze growth; Repair degradation; Requal; Reticle Requalification","32nm and below; ADC; Computational lithographies; Defect classification; Defect review; DPM; R-equal; Re-qualification; Automation; Inspection; Optical instruments; Photomasks; Scanning; Wafer bonding; Repair",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889636397

There is sparse understanding of the molecular regulation at the protein level of bovine adipose tissues, especially within different fat depots under different nutritional regimes. The objective of this study was to analyze the differences in protein expression between bovine subcutaneous and visceral fat depots in steers fed different diets and to identify the potential regulatory molecular mechanisms of protein expression. Subcutaneous and visceral fat tissues were collected from 16 Britishcontinental steers (15.5 month old) fed a high-fat diet (7.1% fat, n=8) or a control diet (2.7% fat, n=8). Protein expression was profiled using label free quantification LC-MS/MS and expression of selected transcripts was evaluated using qRT-PCR. A total of 682 proteins were characterized and quantified with fat depot having more impact on protein expression, altering the level of 51.0% of the detected proteins, whereas diet affected only 5.3%. Functional analysis revealed that energy production and lipid metabolism were among the main functions associated with differentially expressed proteins between fat depots, with visceral fat being more metabolically active than subcutaneous fat as proteins associated with lipid and energy metabolism were upregulated. The expression of several proteins was significantly correlated to subcutaneous fat thickness and adipocyte size, indicating their potential as adiposity markers. A poor correlation (r=0.245) was observed between mRNA and protein levels for 9 genes, indicating that many proteins may be subjected to post-transcriptional regulation. A total of 8 miRNAs were predicted to regulate more than 20% of lipid metabolism proteins differentially expressed between fat depots, suggesting that miRNAs play a role in adipose tissue regulation. Our results show that proteomic changes support the distinct metabolic and physiological characteristics observed between subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue depots in cattle.

The ""omics"" approaches have greatly contributed to expanding the knowledge on these carbon-related cellular responses, reporting large data sets on microalgae transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. This review emphasizes the advances made on Chlamydomonas exploration; however, some knowledge acquired from studying this model organism, may be extrapolated to close algae species. The large data sets available for this organism revealed the identity of a vast range of genes and proteins which are integrating carbon-related mechanisms. Nevertheless, these data sets have also highlighted the need for integrative analysis in order to fully explore the information enclosed. Here, some of the main results from ""omics"" approaches which may contribute to the understanding of carbon acquisition and accumulation in Chlamydomonas were reviewed and possible applications were discussed. Biological significance: A number of important publications in the field of ""omics"" technologies have been published reporting studies of the model green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and related to microalgal biomass production.

Since the enteric nervous system is pivotal in regulating gastrointestinal functions alterations or neuropathy in the enteric neurons are suspected to occur in these conditions. Lipid induced intestinal changes, in particular on enteric neurons, were investigated in vitro and in vivo using primary cell culture and a high fat diet (HFD) mouse model. Design: Mice were fed normal or HFD for 6 months. Intestines were analyzed for neuronal numbers, remodeling and lipid accumulation. Co-cultures of myenteric neurons, glia and muscle cells from rat small intestine, were treated with palmitic acid (PA) (0 - 10-3 M) and / or oleic acid (OA) (0 - 10-3 M), with or without modulators of intracellular lipid metabolism. Analyses were by immunocyto- and histochemistry. Results: HFD caused substantial loss of myenteric neurons, leaving submucous neurons unaffected, and intramuscular lipid accumulation in ileum and colon. PA exposure in vitro resulted in neuronal shrinkage, chromatin condensation and a significant and concentration-dependent decrease in neuronal survival; OA exposure was neuroprotective. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 inhibition, L-carnitine- or alpha lipoic acid supplementation all counteracted PA-induced neuronal loss. PA or OA alone both caused a significant and concentration- dependent loss of muscle cells in vitro . Simultaneous exposure of PA and OA promoted survival of muscle cells and increased intramuscular lipid droplet accumulation. PA exposure transformed glia from a stellate to a rounded phenotype but had no effect on their survival. Conclusions: HFD and PA exposure are detrimental to myenteric neurons. Present results indicate excessive palmitoylcarnitine formation and exhausted L-carnitine stores leading to energy depletion, attenuated acetylcholine synthesis and oxidative stress to be main mechanisms behind PA-induced neuronal loss.High PA exposure is suggested to be a factor in causing diabetic neuropathy and gastrointestinal dysregulation. © 2013 Voss et al.",,"acetylcholine; carnitine; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; fat droplet; oleic acid; palmitic acid; palmitoylcarnitine; thioctic acid; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell count; cell loss; cell survival; cell transformation; chromatin condensation; coculture; colon; concentration response; controlled study; diabetic neuropathy; energy metabolism; enteric neuropathy; female; glia cell; ileum; immunocytochemistry; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; intestine innervation; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; mouse; muscle cell; nerve cell culture; nerve cell necrosis; neuropathy; neuroprotection; nonhuman; oxidative stress; rat; small intestine; stellate cell; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Ceramides; Coculture Techniques; Diet, High-Fat; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Enteric Nervous System; Enzyme Activation; Female; Intestine, Small; Intracellular Space; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Mice; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Neuroglia; Neurotoxins; Oleic Acid; Palmitic Acid; Palmitoylcarnitine; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Rats; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891817993

In order to reduce its impact on the system, the integration of magnetic bearings is frequently regarded as a valid solution. In rotating systems like flywheel energy storage systems (FESS), mechanical losses created by mechanical bearings greatly reduce the overall performance. Magnetic bearings are thus frequently integrated in FESS to eliminate mechanical losses. The simple design of passive magnetic bearings (PMBs), their inherent security, and their very low friction make them perfect candidates for FESS. The main objective, and most important contribution of this paper, is to document an innovative PMB that minimizes energy losses induced by the axial thrust bearing, and to document the methodology used to measure its stiffness and damping. Although PMBs are fairly well documented in literature, no other PMB is designed to reduce the friction generated by the thrust bearing. In order to promote their integration, it is critical to identify their mechanical properties such as stiffness and damping. Hence, another contribution of this paper is to propose a new way to easily characterize any magnetic bearing topology to replace available techniques that only provided the properties for a precise configuration of the bearing. The new technique provides an unprecedented mapping of the forces generated by complex combinations of permanent magnets. Experimental results show that the new PMB can be configured to effectively reduce the force applied to the thrust bearing, resulting in lower friction. This friction reduction is achieved while allowing the proper operation of the bearing. Results also show that the measured stiffness is different from those obtained analytically, suggesting that a magnetic bearing should always be characterized prior to its use. © 2013 by the authors.","Characterization; Damping; Magnetic bearing; Passive; Permanent magnet; Stiffness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930657184

Undulators are typically designed to operate with small deflection parameter to push the fundamental mode to high photon energies. This unusual choice of parameters is desirable for measurement of vertical emittance with a vertical undulator. We present 1-D and 2-D measured profiles of undulator radiation and show that this is reproduced in numerical models using the measured magnetic field of the insertion device. Importantly these measurements confirm that for these parameters, the spatial intensity distribution departs significantly from usual Gaussian approximations, instead resembling a double-slit diffraction pattern.

The proposed schematic layout of the ESS facility is based on a linear driver (linac) directing the proton beam (5 MW of 2.5 GeV) of 2.8 ms long pulses with a 20 Hz on a tungsten target where neutrons are produced via spallation reactions. Further the neutrons will be moderated to thermal and subthermal energies in a couple of moderators placed around the target. The moderators feed 22 beamlines guiding the neutrons to the scattering instruments, mainly for neutron scattering research, as has been previously mentioned. The objective of this work is to develop a waste management plan for ESS facility. In this respect two important aspects are analyzed. First the present status of the problem is outlined as follow. Estimate types and quantities of waste that the ESS project will generate at different stages: commission, operation, decommissioning were derived using: i) precise Monte Carlo calculations ii) scaling the activity from the operation experience of the existing spallation source installations for waste such it is difficult to predict level of activation or for components of the facility in stage of the preconceptual model.

However, these leaves contain high level of hydro-cyanic acid (HCN) and condensed tannins (CT). There are evidences that making hay can eliminate more than 90% of HCN and that long-term storage can reduce CT levels. A complete randomized design with four replicates was conducted to determine the effect of different storage times (0-control, 60, 90 and 120 days) on chemical composition, in vitro rumen fermentation kinetics, digestibility and energy value of cassava leaves hay. Treatments were compared by analyzing variables using the GLM procedure (SAS 9.1, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Crude protein (CP) and ether extract (EE) of the cassava hay were not affected (P > 0.05) by storage time (17.7% and 3.0%, respectively). Neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, total carbohydrate and non-fiber carbohydrate were not affected either (P>0.05) by storage time (47.5, 32.6, 72.3 and 25.8% respectively). However, other parameters were influenced. CT was lower (P<0.05) in hay after 120 days of storage compared with control (1.75% versus 3.75%, respectively). Lignin and insoluble nitrogen in neutral detergent, analyzed without sodium sulfite, were higher (P<0.01) after 120 days of storage, compared with the control (11.22 versus 13.57 and 1.65 versus 3.81% respectively). This suggests that the CT has bound to the fiber or CP and became inactive. Consequently, the in vitro digestibility of organic matter (50.36%), total digestible nutrients (44.79%) and energy (1.61 Mcal/KgMS), obtained from gas production data at 72 h of incubation, has increased (P<0.05) with storage times (56.83%, 51.53% and 1.86 Mcal/KgMS, respectively). The chemical composition and fermentative characteristics of cassava hay suffered variations during the storage period. The best values were obtained after 90 days of storage. This is probably due to the reduction in condensed tannins.","By products; Manihot esculenta; Proanthocyanin",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897899594

Existing routing protocols lack the efficiency in terms of energy consumption, accuracy and timing response. Data storage and processing constraints in sensor nodes also hinder the efficient and timely response in various applications, especially in healthcare, where, many vital data are collected from the patients using wireless devices. These data can be crucial for saving the patient's life. Thus, an efficient, accurate and fast routing protocol is of utmost importance in healthcare.

The conventional mechanism for electrical control of magnetism has to do with the sensitivity of magnetic anisotropy on the filling of d-bands in ferromagnetic metals and semiconductors. Such a mechanism can not be operative in insulators, implying that E-field control of magnetic order is a great challenge in these materials. An exception to this rule is the room temperature magnetoelectric material bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3 or BFO): In the past few years there were several demonstrations of the control of its magnetic properties by electrically switching its ferroelectric polarization P. Here I review the microscopic origin of these effects, that are mainly due to the electrical manipulation of the spin-current interaction. Nevertheless, the spin-current interaction is not the only magnetoelectric coupling present in BFO. I wil describe recent experimental and theoretical developments that showed that BFO has a strong magnetic anisotropy that scales linearly with an external E-field. This leads to a giant E-field effect on magnon spectra, that is 105 times larger than what is observed in other materials. The E field converts the antiferromagnetic spiral (cycloidal) ground state into a homogeneous antiferromagnet, with a weak ferromagnetic moment whose orientation can be controlled by the E field direction. Remarkably, this kind of E-field control of magnetism occurs without switching P, hence it is expected to be a low energy dissipation process. Thus it might have applications in spin-based devices made of insulators. © 2013 Copyright SPIE.","magnetic anisotropy; magnetism; magnetoelectric effect; multiferroic materials; Spintronics","Electric-field control; Electrical manipulation; Ferroelectric polarization; Low energy dissipations; Magnetoelectric couplings; Magnetoelectric materials; Multiferroic materials; Theoretical development; Electric fields; Energy dissipation; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Lanthanum compounds; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic storage; Magnetism; Magnetoelectric effects; Magnetoelectronics; Materials; Nanotechnology; Electric properties",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897640149

Temperature logging into old Precambrian granites beneath 0.5 km thin sedimentary column in the 2.35 km deep Hunt well near Fort McMurray shows that there is a rather limited amount of heat in granites. It would require drilling some 4-5 km to get to 80-100°C in Fort McMurray area and 120-150°C in Peace River area, respectively. This temperature is not sufficient to generate steam for the in-situ recovery of heavy-oil and bitumen but the demand for hot water for surface processing is limited to only 40-70°C. Our current effort is to generate hot-water through engineered gothermal systems (EGS) for surface processing of bitumen in the Fort McMurray area as an alternative to burning natural gas for this purpose. At the same time, relatively high temperature gradient areas can serve as a heat source for communities. In this paper, we propose a new concept for greening oilsand energy through the new EGS system. This system is planned to deliver heat for the processing of mined oilsands or pre-heating using inclined to horizontal drillholes used to create artificial heat exchange space and use deep underground heat beneath oilsand. In addition to this, tapping into naturally existing hot aquifers in the hotter Foreland Alberta basin to produce heat/electricity for communities in order to offset the CO2 emisions from oilsand operations is proposed as another option.","Alberta basin; Canadian sedimentary basin; ECS model; EGS; Geothermal energy potential; Oilsands recovery","Alberta basins; Crystalline basement; EGS; Heat exchange; Heat sources; High temperature gradient; Sedimentary basin; Surface processing; Aquifers; Bituminous materials; Carbon dioxide; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Granite; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Hydrogeology; Natural gas well drilling; In situ processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897598299

All of these energy conversion methods create different types of pollution. Fossil fuels are a finite resource of solar energy stored in floral and faunal fossils over many millions of years. The ever increasing demand for this finite and dwindling resource has the potential to significantly increase the cost of these resources. Additionally, an undesirable consequence of the thermo-chemical conversion of fossil fuels by combustion is environmental contamination. The reaction products from combustion can be harmful to the environment and us humans on a local scale, and may contribute to global climatic changes. Fossil fuel resources are unevenly distributed over the globe, leading to geopolitical unrest as a result of the competition for resource access. Clearly, the energy demands of our society need to be satisfied in a more appropriate, sustainable, and efficient way. Beyond the production and clean conversion of energy with low emissions, the storage and transmission of energy have to be solved sustainably. Nanowires made from carbon fibres have been proposed as modern transmission lines with the potential to significantly reduce the losses inside the distribution networks. Other smart materials developments can result in cleaner energy conversion for our society. This work builds on the pioneer work performed by Nobel Prize winner Richard Smalley, taking his vision of clean energy transmission through carbon structures into the second decade of the 21st century. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The aim here is to quantify pollutant masses from an urban snow deposit and to investigate the conditions when pollutant control was increased by turning a snow deposit into a snow cooling plant with permeable underground snow storage. Pollutant masses in an urban snow deposit in northern Sweden were: Cu = 67, Pb = 17, Zn = 160, P = 170, SS = 620, 000, Cl = 1, 200, N = 380 kg. A theoretical analysis showed that the fraction of surface runoff from a surface deposit largely depends on the hydraulic conductivity (K, m s-1) of the soil. For a melt rate of 30 mm, day-1, surface runoff would be about 97% for a soil with K = 10-8, while nonexistent for K&gt;10-6. Similar soil conductivities are needed to ensure that all snow melt could be transported as groundwater from an underground storage. The largest pollution-control advantage with underground snow storage compared to a surface deposit would thus be that piping and filters for operation of the plant could be used to filter surface snow melt runoff before rejection. © IWA Publishing 2014.","Alternative energy; Snow cooling plant; Snow deposit; Snow pollutants; Urban snow",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894278506

These methods are divided into four main categories associated with the radiation transfer medium: optical fibres, photonic crystal fibres, metal waveguides and light guides. The reviewed methods are novel compared to most rooftop solar concentrators that have a receiver and a thermal storage unit coupled by heat transfer fluids. Bundled optical fibres have the capability of transferring concentrated solar energy across the full wavelength spectrum with the maximum optical efficiency. In this study two different types of optical bundle, including hard polymer cladding silica (HPCS) and polymer clad silica (PCS) fibres are introduced which offer a broad spectrum transmission range from 300 to 1700 nm, low levels of losses through attenuation and the best resistance to heating. These fibres are able to transmit about 94% of the solar radiation over a distance of 10 m. The main parameters that determine the overall efficiency of the system are the concentration ratio, the acceptance angle of the fibres, and the matching of the diameter of the focus spot of the concentrator and the internal diameter of the fibre. In order to maximize the coupling efficiency of the system, higher levels of concentration are required which can be achieved through lenses or other non-imaging concentrators. However, these additional components add to the cost and complexity of the system. To avoid this problem we use tapered bundles of optical fibres that enhance the coupling efficiency by increasing the acceptance angle and consequently the coupling efficiency of the system. © 2013 Copyright SPIE.","bundles; optical fibers; Radiation; solar concentrators; tapered fibers",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893941306

To avoid spoilage, products must always be kept in a suitable temperature range, with the lowest possible temperature fluctuation. As these devices have to be kept constantly energized, its share of contribution to the total energy consumption is generally very significant. An effective control of temperature variations for each cooling unit by means of a continuous monitoring system, in real time, turns possible the tracing of the temperature at which each product was actually submitted and thereby ensure that the quality of the product has been maintained (or not). A feedback control system, duly designed and tuned, implies reduction of temperature variations and consumed energy besides improving the cooling condition and the product quality. This paper presents the results of a system capable of providing the monitoring and control of industrial refrigeration equipment using a dedicated platform in which measurements of the electrical current and of the internal and external temperatures are continuously taken. From these measurements, dynamic models, correlating the internal temperature of the chamber and the electric current, were established and an automatic control system implemented. Results of the application of this management system to the Blood Centre of the State of Minas Gerais (Hemominas) are presented. The use of energy is more intense in air-conditioned environments in the spaces used for collection and processing of blood and in cold chambers for storage of products. It has been observed that changes in inventories and in the external temperature have substantial impact on these loads. In order to check which variables or conditions affect the thermal and energy profile, special computer routines have been used to establish the existing correlations among the energy consumption, the air temperature and the thermal load, to which the refrigeration chamber is subjected. © 2013 IEEE.","efficient cooling control; intelligent measurement and control; rational use of energy; smart demand side management","Continuous monitoring systems; Cooling control; Demand side managements; Intelligent measurement; Monitoring and control; Rational use of energies; Temperature fluctuation; Total energy consumption; Adaptive control systems; Cooling; Energy utilization; Food preservation; Food products; Industrial applications; Industrial refrigeration; Temperature distribution; Blood",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893798185

However, the demand for electricity is an hourly variable and thus excess electricity is available at off-peak times on a given day. The price of this off-peak electricity is very low compared to the average price. Storing or utilizing this off-peak electricity for various processes will provide additional value to the electricity and will improve the overall economics of the nuclear power plant. This work looks at a few energy storage technologies suitable for large-scale electricity storage from base-load power plants such as nuclear power plants. A preliminary assessment of these technologies has been completed through a literature review. These technologies are categorized into three forms of energy: chemical, mechanical and hydrogen. Batteries are found to be too impractical for large-scale electricity storage until vast amounts of distributed battery storage is available through plugin electric vehicles. Pumped hydro storage is suitable in terms of energy storage capacity but not in terms of cost, construction time and location. Gaseous hydrogen storage in underground reservoirs is suitable at scale but not enough clean hydrogen production processes are ready for large-scale demonstration. Storing hydrogen in natural gas pipeline networks is promising in the short-term while deployment capabilities are being assessed by commercial companies. © 2013 IEEE.","large-scale energy storage; nuclear energy; off-peak electricity; review; utility scale storage","Electricity storages; Energy storage capacity; Energy storage technologies; Gas pipeline networks; Hydrogen production process; Literature reviews; Plug-in Electric Vehicles; Preliminary assessment; Electric energy storage; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Reviews; Underground reservoirs; Electricity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893775960

Here, various configurations for multiple TESs are proposed and investigated. Significant parameters for a TES, or a set of TESs, include discharging temperature and recovered energy. First, one TES is investigated to determine the final temperature and energy recovery. Next, characteristics for various configurations of multiple TESs are developed as functions of TES characteristics (e.g., charging and discharging temperatures and energy quantities). Series, parallel and general grid (simultaneous series and parallel) TES configurations are considered. In the parallel configuration, the TESs behave independently. This suggests that with the TES can consist of different storage media types and sizes, and that there is no restriction on initial temperature of the TES. In the series configuration, the situation is different because the TESs are connected directly or indirectly through a heat exchanger. If there is no heat exchanger between the TESs, the TES storage media should be the same, because the outlet of one TES is the inlet to the next one in the series. The initial temperature of the second TES must be smaller than the discharge temperature of the first. There is no restriction on the TES size for series configurations. The general grid configuration is observed to exhibit characteristics of both series and parallel configurations. © 2013 IEEE.","Compound; Configurations; Energy; Grid; Parallel; Serial; Thermal energy storage; Thermal network","Compound; Configurations; Energy; Grid; Parallel; Serial; Thermal network; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Thermal energy; Thermal insulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893745602

However, when the control signal is biased or substantially autocorrelated, they cannot provide services for extended periods of time because they have limited energy capacities. To improve the ability of batteries to provide frequency control, we can offset their frequency response so that they only respond to fast and zero-mean frequency deviations, while passing slower and biased deviations to other resources. We propose two new heuristics to offset frequency control signals, and a method to compare these heuristics to previously developed heuristics. This method allows us to quantify the heuristics from the point of view of both the storage unit operator (return on investment, ROI) and the transmission system operator (impact on the power system). Considering battery degradation, the new heuristics yield better ROIs, and we find that our results are not very sensitive to the battery's energy-to-power ratio around its optimum. We also find that the best choice of heuristic depends on what impact matters most to the transmission system operator. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Autocorrelated; Battery degradation; Control signal; Energy storage unit; Frequency deviation; Limited energies; Storage units; Transmission system operators; Energy storage; Frequency response; Smart power grids; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893619023

TES system is a key component in a solar energy power generation plant, but the main issue in designing the TES system is its thermal capacity of storage materials, e.g. insulator. This study is focusing on the potential waste material acts as an insulator for thermal energy storage applications. As the insulator is used to absorb heat, it is needed to find suitable material for energy conversion and at the same time reduce the waste generation. Thus, a small-scale experimental testing of natural cooling process of an insulated tank within a confined room is conducted. The experiment is repeated by changing the insulator from the potential waste material and also by changing the heat transfer fluid (HTF). The analysis presented the relationship between heat loss and the reserved period by the insulator. The results show the percentage of period of the insulated tank withstands compared to tank insulated by foam, e.g. newspaper reserved the period of 84.6% as much as foam insulated tank to withstand the heat transfer of cooking oil to the surrounding. The paper finally justifies the most potential waste material as an insulator for different temperature range of heat transfer fluid. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Experimental testing; Insulating properties; Natural cooling; Potential wastes; Temperature range; Thermal energy storage systems; Thermal storage; Waste generation; Energy conversion; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Mechanical engineering; Oils and fats; Solar energy; Tanks (containers); Materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893615860

We conduct two case studies, one for electric vehicle aggregations and one for air conditioner aggregations, in order to show specific examples that illustrate the causes and magnitude of uncertainty.

It has been known that high annealing temperature is needed to perform perfect crystal level of ferroelectric ceramic that is averagely 650°C done by using crystalline Si substrate with Pt/Ti as intermediate layer. This had been confirmed as the ideal process to have perfectly distribution of uniform grain size with tendency of stable dipole moment. However, high temperature does affect the nucleation site of domain wall where here lays the factor contributes to Pb volatilization and yields to thin films degradation. Further investigation of PbTiO3 thin films preparation at relatively lower temperature was at least 200°C could be the most desirable thin films ever to answer the limitation of source. Therefore, these temperatures make deposition of PbTiO3 possible for glass substrate which has low melting temperature. The current study investigates preparation of PbTiO3 thin films on platinum coated glass substrate through sol-gel spin coating method. The optimum thickness of thin films was achieved by five times of depositions and punctuated with drying process about 200°C for 10mins for each layer. Annealing process was carried out in hot furnace at temperature 300°C to 500°C for 30mins. The prepared thin films were then being measured by impedance analyzer under low frequency about 1000Hz for the dielectric property investigation. It was found that the dielectric constant have linear relationship with annealing temperature. Nevertheless, high dielectric constant resulted to the factor of high dielectric loss that plays a role as in AC signal. In addition, the capacitance value of PbTiO3 thin films is being obtained under low frequency of dielectric constant measurement. Concisely, both dielectric constant and nanometer scaled thin films had influenced much to the capability for high energy storage which will be discussed later in future investigation. © 2013 IEEE.","capacitive property; dielectric property; Lead titanate thin films; sol-gel","Annealing temperatures; capacitive property; Coated glass substrates; Dielectric-constant measurements; High dielectric constants; Lead titanate thin films; Low melting temperatures; Sol-gel spin coating method; Annealing; Capacitance; Deposition; Dielectric losses; Dielectric properties; Glass; Lead; Semiconducting lead compounds; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Substrates; Thin films; Film preparation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893603619

The voltage regulators control DC-DC boost converter and DC-AC inverter while the frequency regulator controls the bidirectional DC-DC boost converter. A conventional MPPT is used to adjust the reference for nonlinear PV voltage regulator. The voltage regulator is designed based on multi-input multi-output exact feedback linearization technique.

When the energy generated by PV units is greater than the aggregate load of households and the capacity of ESS, there will be a reverse energy flow from households to the substation. When the reverse energy flow exceeds a certain threshold, it will cause a voltage rise problem, which is a challenge for PV units to be effectively integrated with the distribution network. In this paper, we propose an energy consumption scheduling algorithm, which shifts the deferrable load (e.g., washing machines, dryers) from peak hours (e.g., 7 pm - 10 pm) to high solar radiation hours (e.g., 10 am - 2 pm) in order to jointly shave the peak load and reduce the reverse energy flow. We formulate the energy consumption scheduling problem as a stochastic optimization problem to capture the uncertainty of the amount of PV output power. The objective of our algorithm is to minimize the electricity bill for the household users which have PV units and ESS installed.

The grid power can also be used to charge the battery storage in case the energy stored is at the critical level and cannot be recovered immediately due to low/zero level of sun irradiation.

The European network infrastructure is changing towards more renewables, increasing the usage of co-generation while decreasing the capacity for conventional power plants (20-20-20 Energy Policy). However, these renewable sources have outputs which are characterized by poor controllability and unpredictability, thus making grid integration difficult. Battery energy storage is proposed to assist the regulating power plants in following the power output of renewables. In this paper, different control methods for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) for renewable smoothing applications are discussed. The novelty of this paper relies on the fact that each control algorithm is evaluated according to its effectiveness in smoothing and battery stress. A benchmark was performed where the power outputs are compared. The battery stress and lifetime were estimated using a rainflow cycle counting algorithm.

The high variability of renewable energy increases a microgrid's energy purchasing fluctuation over time and makes the main grid's energy generation and supply more unscheduled and risky. This paper proposes a dynamic contract mechanism to regulate microgrids' energy purchasing over time, while the mismatch between renewable supply and local demand in each microgrid is efficiently resolved. The contract sets time-specific purchasing commitments for a microgrid to fulfill, yet still provides the microgrid with flexibility to change future commitments. Under the contract, a stochastic dynamic program is formulated for each microgrid to update commitments according to current storage status and future load prediction. As the microgrid's optimal purchase planning is complex to analyze, we further propose a heuristic algorithm to develop a suboptimal purchasing policy which is threshold-based and easy to implement. Extensive simulations show that the proposed contract can significantly reduce microgrids' purchasing fluctuation even though a large flexibility is allowed to change commitments. The contract smoothes out more purchasing fluctuations when fewer microgrids connect to the main grid or the net load variation in each microgrid increases. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Energy generations; Extensive simulations; Limited storage; Load predictions; Load variations; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Stochastic dynamic program; Heuristic algorithms; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Smart power grids; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893527227

Two multiuser beamforming schemes are considered, namely, channel inversion (CI) and maximal ratio transmit (MRT) beamforming schemes. Power control policies are derived for both schemes, respectively, with the goal of maximizing the sum throughput by a deadline subject to energy causality and battery storage constraints. With CI beamforming, the power control problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, whose solution can be obtained using the directional water-filling algorithm. With MRT beam-forming, the power control problem becomes non-convex, due to interference between the signals intended for different users, and, thus, is difficult to solve exactly. However, an efficient solution can be obtained by performing successive approximation into a sequence of geometric programming problems, i.e., by employing the condensation method. Offline power control policies are first derived assuming non-causal knowledge of the energy arrival and channel coefficients over time.

By considering base-stations (BSs) that are supported by renewable energy, this work examines offline and online ZF beamforming designs based on two different objectives, namely, sum-rate maximization and energy-cost minimization. For offline policies, the channel states and the energy arrivals are assumed to be known a priori for all time instants whereas, in the online policies, only causal information is available. The designs are subject to energy causality and energy storage constraints, i.e., the constraint that energy cannot be used before it arrives and the constraint that the stored energy cannot exceed the maximum battery storage capacity. In the sum-rate maximization problem, the base-station is assumed to be supported only by renewable energy and the goal is to maximize the sum rate over all users by a predetermined deadline. The optimization of the ZF beamforming direction and power allocation can be decoupled, and the solutions can be found exactly. In the energy-cost minimization problem, the base-station is assumed to be supported by both renewable and power-grid energy, and the goal is to minimize the cost of purchasing grid energy subject to quality-of-service constraints at the users. The problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem and can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf solvers. Offline solutions are first obtained and the intuitions gained from their results are used to derive effective online policies. The effectiveness of the proposed policies are demonstrated through computer simulations. © 2013 APSIPA.",,"Convex optimization problems; Inter-user interference; Linear transmission; Minimization problems; Multi user multiple input single outputs; Storage constraints; Sum-rate maximizations; Zero-forcing beam-forming; Beamforming; Computer simulation; Convex optimization; Data processing; Quality of service; Signal receivers; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893244263

Aggregation of benefits of these complementary storage applications would have the potential for increasing the amount of EES that may be financially attractive to defer distribution network augmentation in QLD.

The proposed system assumes that each PHEV is interfaced with a network of DC lines, through a corresponding bidirectional DC-DC converter (battery charger). It also assumes that a central Voltage-Sourced Converter (VSC) provides the interface between the DC network and the host AC utility grid. The proposed system is expected to be more efficient and economical than an equivalent aggregate of AC-DC battery charges connected to the AC grid, since it relieves the battery chargers from the need for a bidirectional, front-end, power-factor correction (PFC) stage. Further, due to its DC nature, the proposed system is amenable to integration of Photovoltaic (PV) modules.

In several electricity markets, it is traded as an ancillary service and is procured by the independent system operator (ISO). Typically service providers are conventional generators with automatic governor control. In the recent past, energy storage devices such as flywheels have started offering frequency regulation service. With these devices capable of providing a better regulation in comparison with conventional generators, there has been a move to alter FERC regulations to remunerate ancillary service providers of frequency regulation based on their quality and quantity of service. This paper reviews various forms of energy storage systems that hold a promise for a role in electricity markets.

The combination of solar thermal and heat pump systems as a single solar-assisted heat pump (SAHP) system can significantly reduce residential energy consumption in Canada. As a part of Team Ontario's efforts to develop a high performance house for the 2013 DOE Solar Decathlon Competition, an integrated mechanical system (IMS) consisting of a SAHP was investigated. The system is designed to provide domestic hot water, space-heating, space-cooling and dehumidification. The system included a cold and a hot thermal storage tank and a heat pump to move energy from the low temperature reservoir, to the hot. The solar thermal collectors supplies heat to the cold storage and operate at a higher efficiency due to the heat pump reducing the temperature of the collector working fluid. The combination of the heat pump and solar thermal collectors allows more heat to be harvested at a lower temperature, and then boosted to a suitable temperature for domestic use via the heat pump. The IMS and the building's energy loads were modeled using the TRNSYS simulation software. A parametric study was conducted to optimize the control, sizing and configuration of the system. This paper provides an overview of the model and summarizes the results of the study. The simulation results suggested that the investigated system can achieve a free energy ratio of about 0.583 for a high performance house designed for the Ottawa climate.

It is revealed that capacity value of renewable energy resources has direct influence on RAPS system energy management. By utilising storage in conjunction with renewable energy resources, the RAPS system can cater load demand while achieving a higher reliability. A case study based on a remote village has shown that with the presence of a renewable energy resource with high capacity value can meet the load demand with a relatively small storage system for energy balance while maintaining the level of reliability target.

A big limiting factor is vehicle range. Range can be further limited if heating and air conditioning systems are powered by the electric vehicle's batteries. The use of electricity for HVAC can be minimized if a thermal battery can be substituted as the energy source to provide sufficient cabin heating and cooling. The aim of this project was to model, design, and fabricate a thermal storage battery for electric vehicles. Since cost and weight are the main considerations for a vehicular application - every attempt was made to minimize them in this design. Thus, the final thermal battery consists of a phase change material Erythritol (a sugar alcohol commonly used as artificial sweetener) as the storage medium sealed in an insulated, stainless steel cooking pot. Heat exchange to the thermal battery is accomplished via water (or low viscosity engine oil) which is pushed through a copper coil winding. A CFD model was used to determine the geometry (winding radius and number of coils) and flow conditions necessary to create adequate heat transfer. Testing of the fabricated design indicates that the prototype thermal battery module losses less than 5% per day and can provide enough heat to meet the demand of cruising passenger vehicle for up to 1 hour of full heating on a cold day. Other metrics, such as $/kJ and kJ/kg, are competitive with Lithium ion batteries for our prototype.

Reversible, non-catalytic gas-solid reactions are used to convert thermal into chemical energy during endothermic charging, and vice versa during exothermic discharging. To assist the experimental investigation of such chemical reactors, a numerical model of the heat and mass transfer in a tubular packed bed reactor has been developed. The fluid serves as both heat transfer medium and gas reactant supplier and is modeled as a homogeneous phase using unsteady one-dimensional mass and energy balances. Solid reactants are modeled as spherical porous granules. The unsteady radial energy and mass balances are solved in the granules. This allows for the accurate treatment of larger granules with a diameter in the range of mm to cm in which radial gradients may occur. The temperature profile within a granule is calculated from an energy balance, whereas mass balances track the local concentration of the gases within the pores, affected by diffusion and an eventual mass source/sink due to the gas-solid reaction. The fluid and granule phases are coupled through local mass and energy exchange terms. The numerical implementation of the model is tested through a thorough codeverification study and a general assessment on mass and energy conservation within the coupled fluid and granule phases.

Therefore, databases containing geomechanical properties of geological formations are extremely valuable for performing geomechanical studies for these activities.

The developed database includes geometric and geographic information for these wells and their intersecting formations, in addition to rock properties such as shear and compressional wave velocities, dynamic Poisson's ratios, and dynamic Young's moduli. It also includes statistical analyses of the log data to help the user to assess the reliability of the measurements. Empirical relations may also be employed to estimate strength properties of rocks based on the log data collected in this database.

However, the active mechanistic roles that lipids play in its progression are not understood. Accumulation of ceramide, the metabolic hub of sphingolipid metabolism, has been associated with metabolic syndrome and obesity in humans and model systems. Here, we use Drosophila genetic manipulations to cause accumulation or depletion of ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) intermediates. Sphingolipidomic profiles were characterized across mutants for various sphingolipid metabolic genes using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectroscopy. Biochemical assays and microscopy were used to assess classic hallmarks of obesity including elevated fat stores, increased body weight, resistance to starvation induced death, increased adiposity, and fat cell hypertrophy. Multiple behavioral assays were used to assess appetite, caloric intake, meal size and meal frequency.

Our results show that accumulation of ceramides is sufficient to induce obesity phenotypes by two distinct mechanisms: 1) Dihydroceramide (C14:0) and ceramide diene (C14:2) accumulation lowered fat store mobilization by reducing adipokinetic hormone- producing cell functionality and 2) Modulating the S1P: ceramide (C14:1) ratio suppressed postprandial satiety via the hindgut-specific neuropeptide like receptor dNepYr, resulting in caloric intake-dependent obesity. © 2013 Walls et al.",,"Akhpc protein; ceramide; ceramide diene; dihydroceramide; neuropeptide Y receptor; regulator protein; sphingolipid; sphingosine; sphingosine 1 phosphate; sphingosine delta 4 desaturase; sphingosine kinase 2; unclassified drug; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; appetite; article; caloric intake; cell swelling; controlled study; DNA microarray; Drosophila; eating habit; female; gene expression; genetic manipulation; lipid storage; lipogenesis; liquid chromatography; male; nonhuman; obesity; phenotype; signal transduction; tandem mass spectrometry; weight gain; Adipose Tissue; Adiposity; Animals; Appetite; Ceramides; Chromatography, Liquid; Disease Models, Animal; Drosophila melanogaster; Energy Intake; Humans; Lysophospholipids; Metabolic Syndrome X; Mutation; Obesity; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Sphingosine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892766248

Compression using the achromat scheme requires the electron bunch to be accelerated on a falling RF slope resulting in an energy chirp that longitudinal wakefields will boost along the linac. This permits a stronger compression. In this proceeding we will present how the longitudinal wakefields interact with the bunch compression in the double achromat scheme, compared with the chicane compression case.

However, employing GPUs for applications with irregular parallelism tends to be a risky process, involving significant effort from the programmer. One major, non-trivial effort/risk is to expose the available parallelism in the application as 1000s of concurrent threads without introducing data races or deadlocks via fine-grained data synchronization. To reduce this effort, prior work has proposed supporting transactional memory on GPU architectures. One hardware proposal, Kilo TM, can scale to 1000s of concurrent transaction. However, performance and energy overhead of Kilo TM may deter GPU vendors from incorporating it into future designs. In this paper, we analyze the performance and energy efficiency of Kilo TM and propose two enhancements: (1) Warp-level transaction management allows transactions within a warp to be managed as a group. This aggregates protocol messages to reduce communication overhead and captures spatial locality from multiple transactions to increase memory subsystem utility. (2) Temporal conflict detection uses globally synchronized timers to detect conflicts in read-only transactions with low overhead. Our evaluation shows that combining the two enhancements in combination can improve the overall performance and energy efficiency of Kilo TM by 65% and 34% respectively. Kilo TM with the above two enhancements achieves 66% of the performance of fine-grained locking with 34% energy overhead. © 2013 ACM.","GPU; transactional memory","Communication overheads; Concurrent transactions; GPU; Graphics processing units; Multiple transactions; Read-only transaction; Transaction management; Transactional memory; Computer architecture; Computer graphics; Program processors; Storage allocation (computer); Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892557977

This will to a large extent save our environment and human health. The challenges involved in the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass must be critically addressed to enhance the digestibility and accessibility of cellulose and hemicellulose, and the subsequent conversion to simple sugars usable by fermentation yeasts. Effective conversion relies on a number of factors: the composition and structure of the feedstock, particle size, pretreatment method used, and type and loading of enzymes. The highly organized crystalline structure of cellulose poses obstacle to hydrolysis. Cellulose and hemicellulose are largely protected from enzymatic attack. This inaccessibility to attack is primarily a result of the association of these polysaccharides with lignin, which acts as a barrier, shielding the polysaccharides. Optimization of the pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation processes with minimal production of inhibitors will contribute immensely to an efficient and cost-effective biorefinery industrial process. To mitigate the difficulty created by the bulky, loose, and disperse nature of lignocellulosic biomass, there is a need for pre-processing and densification for easy, economical, and efficient transportation, handling, and storage. It increases mass per unit volume and improves the convenience and accessibility of lignocellulosic biomass feedstock due to the uniform shape and size. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The proper controllability of the latter is crucial as it can be utilised to minimise the vertical bearing stress to improve the efficiency of the FESS. The method for controlling the speed and axial displacement of the machine is discussed. An inherent speed sensorless observer is also proposed for speed estimation.

The price of energy in such areas is highly influenced by the cost of fuel transportation to the place of consumption. We propose an approach to reduce this price by complementing the diesel generators with wind turbines and high-capacity energy storage devices. We create a model to define the proportion between the installed capacities and to provide the proper sizing of elements. The paper studies the case of an isolated area in central Russia, where the fuel transportation share of energy price reaches 65%. We propose a new energy supply system, which includes diesel generators, wind turbines and energy storage devices. We study the system statistically and model it in Homer software. To decrease the capital and operating costs, we introduce the specific algorithm: the diesel generator operates only when wind turbines are not covering the load and energy storage device is exhausted. We test the proposed algorithm using MATLAB to obtain both economic and technical operation results. The economic modeling then continues the system evaluation. We evaluate the investment criteria and define the new minimum price for electricity.

Among other tasks, the aggregator would be responsible for managing charging and for purchasing electricity on behalf of the vehicles. PEV load can be considered flexible since vehicles are typically used only intermittently and, therefore, their demand can be shifted in time. In this paper we consider the problem of an aggregator bidding into the day-ahead electricity market with the objective to minimize charging costs while satisfying PEVs' flexible demand. The available charging flexibility depends on vehicle driving patterns, which determine the arrival and departure times and trip energy consumption. To take driver end-use constraints into account the fleet is modeled as a virtual storage resource with power and energy characteristics that depend on vehicle behavior. The bidding strategy of the aggregator is modeled as a bilevel problem. The upper-level problem represents the charging cost minimization of the aggregator subject to the power and energy constraints of the fleet. The lower-level problem represents the market clearing where the bids of other market participants are not known ex ante. Mathematically this problem can be described as a mathematical problem with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), which is implemented in the form of a mixed-integer linear program. Results show that with flexible charging, costs can be significantly reduced compared to inflexible charging. Moreover, even with a simple mechanism to guess the bids of other market participants, results close to a perfect information benchmark can be achieved. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Day-ahead electricity market; Energy characteristics; Equilibrium constraint; Mathematical problems; Mixed integer linear program; Optimal bidding strategy; Perfect informations; Plug-in Electric Vehicles; Commerce; Costs; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Integer programming; Virtual storage; Fleet operations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891598288

In particular, we explore how different last-level cache configurations affect the idle periods of DRAM, and whether those idle periods can be exploited through the use of self refresh power down mode to enable maximum energy reduction in both the energy consumption of the last-level cache and DRAM. A suitable last-level cache configuration reduces active power consumption of DRAM by reducing read/write accesses to it and use of the self refresh power down mode reduces background power of DRAM, creating a possibility of significant energy reduction. We propose a power mode controller to adaptively transition DRAM to self refresh power down mode when a memory request hits the last-level cache, and activate the DRAM when a memory request misses the last-level cache. We experimented with eight applications from mediabench, and found that an optimal last-level cache configuration with self refresh power down mode can save up to 89% energy compared to a standard memory controller. Additionally, the use of self refresh power down mode degraded the performance by a maximum of 2% only. Thus, we conclude that exploration and optimization of last-level cache can result in significant energy savings for memory subsystem with little performance degradation. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Background power; Energy reduction; Idle periods; Last-level caches; Memory controller; Memory subsystems; Performance degradation; Power-down mode; Dynamic random access storage; Energy utilization; Optimization; Cache memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891376415

That is why feasibility of utilizing a solar energy storage system in greenhouses is studied here. As the low temperature heat is required for preheating the air in the greenhouse, a solar collector array is proposed to be utilized in order to displace heating demand of the heater and to reduce amount of fuel consumption.

As it is spread over a vast surface area, Australia has high car usage and ownership rates, and the inefficiency of the public transportation system contributes to this. Therefore, Australia has a very large potential market for EVs. In addition to the well-known advantages, such as zero direct emissions, reduced dependency on oil, cheaper fuel, and more silent operation through smart grids, EVs also offer a unique benefit called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. Through V2G technology, EVs can support better operation of the smart grids in terms of reliability and storage. Based on reliable statistics and social studies, this article studies the EV potential of Australia and envisages the impact of large EV utilization therein.

This article reviews the potential applications of concentrated solar thermal (CST) energy in the Australian minerals processing industry to reduce this impact. Integrating CST energy into these industries would reduce their reliance upon conventional fossil fuels and reduce GHG emissions. As CST technologies become more widely deployed and cheaper, and as fuel prices rise, CST energy will progressively become more competitive with conventional energy sources. Some of the applications identified in this article are expected to become commercially competitive provided the costs for pollution abatement and GHG mitigation are internalized. The areas of potential for CST integration identified in this study can be classed as either medium/low-temperature or high-temperature applications. The most promising medium/low-grade applications are electricity generation and low grade heating of liquids. Electricity generation with CST energy - also known as concentrated solar power - has the greatest potential to reduce GHG emissions out of all the potential applications identified because of the 24/7 dispatchability when integrated with thermal storage. High-temperature applications identified include the thermal decomposition of alumina and the calcination of limestone to lime in solar kilns, as well as the production of syngas from natural gas and carbonaceous materials for various metallurgical processes including nickel and direct reduced iron production. Hybridization and integration with thermal storage could enable CST to sustain these energy-intensive metallurgical processes continuously.

In this context, this paper presents an optimization framework for the DR aggregation in wholesale electricity markets. The proposed study focuses on the modeling strategies for energy markets. In the proposed model, DR aggregators offer customers various contracts for load curtailment, load shifting, utilization of onsite generation, and energy storage systems as possible strategies for hourly load reductions.

Due to this effect, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance are concerns in patients with endogenous overproduction of GCs and in patients prescribed GC-based therapy. In addition, hypercortisolemic conditions share many characteristics with the metabolic syndrome. This study reports on a thorough characterization, in terms of glucose control and lipid handling, of a mouse model where corticosterone is given via the drinking water. C57BL/6J mice were treated with corticosterone (100 or 25 mg/ml) or vehicle in their drinking water for 5 weeks after which they were subjected to insulin or glucose tolerance tests. GC-treated mice displayed increased food intake, body weight gain, and central fat deposit accumulations. In addition, the GC treatment led to dyslipidemia as well as accumulation of ectopic fat in the liver and skeletal muscle, having a substantial negative effect on insulin sensitivity. Also glucose intolerance and hypertension, both part of the metabolic syndrome, were evident in the GC-treated mice. However, the observed effects of corticosterone were reversed after drug removal. Furthermore, this study reveals insights into b-cell adaptation to the GC-induced insulin resistance. Increased pancreatic islet volume due to cell proliferation, increased insulin secretion capacity, and increased islet chaperone expression were found in GC-treated animals. This model mimics the human metabolic syndrome. It could be a valuable model for studying the complex mechanisms behind the development of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, as well as the multifaceted relations between GC excess and disease. © 2013 Society for Endocrinology.","Diabetes; Glucocorticoid; Insulin secretion; Islet cells; Obesity","corticosterone; drinking water; insulin; adaptive immunity; animal experiment; animal model; article; controlled study; drug induced disease; dyslipidemia; fatty liver; food intake; glucose tolerance test; humoral immunity; hypertension; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; skeletal muscle; weight gain; diabetes; glucocorticoid; insulin secretion; islet cells; obesity; Adiposity; Administration, Oral; Allostasis; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Disease Models, Animal; Dyslipidemias; Energy Intake; Glucocorticoids; Insulin Resistance; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Liver; Male; Metabolic Syndrome X; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muscle, Skeletal; Stress, Physiological; Stress, Psychological; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890160793

However, the ON-state current of the tunnel device is extremely low because of the poor tunneling efficiency of the BTBT. In this paper, a novel epitaxial tunnel layer (ETL) structure combining vertical tunneling orientation was proposed. The ETL structure performs more favorably than does the traditional lateral tunnel FET structure in an all-silicon device. By using low bandgap materials in the ETL, the ON-state BTBT current increases and an extremely low intrinsic OFF-state current is maintained because of the small low bandgap junction area. The onset voltage of the bipolar BTBT can also be postponed using ETL band engineering. The optimized parameters of the {\rm Si}-{\rm x}{\rm Ge}-{1\hbox{-}{\rm x}} ETL tunnel FET structure increase the ON-state current 10^{7}\hbox{-}108 times compared with that of the traditional lateral silicon tunnel FET.

Using a linear programming-based tool, BIOPLAN, this study investigated the impact of five operational factors: energy demand, moisture mass fraction, interest rate, transport distance, and truck payload on total forest residues supply chain cost in Western Australia. The supply chain consisted four phases: extraction of residues from the clear felled area to roadside by forwarders, storage at roadside, chipping of materials by mobile chippers, and transport of chips to an energy plant. For an average monthly energy demand of 5GWh, the minimum wood supply chain cost was about 29.4$t-1, which is lower than the maximum target supply cost of 30-40$t-1, reported by many industry stakeholders as the breakeven point for economically viable bioenergy production in Australia. The suggested volume available for chipping in the second year was larger than in the first year indicating that the optimisation model proposed storing more materials in the first year to be chipped in the second year. The sensitivity analysis showed no strong correlation between energy demand and supply chain cost per m3.

Exposure to a postnatal diet with low dietary omega-6 (n-6) or high omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid (FA) content resulted in reduced body fat accumulation when challenged with a moderate Western-style diet (WSD) beginning in adolescence. Objective: We determined whether this programming effect is accompanied by changes in hypothalamic neural projections or modifications in the postnatal leptin surge, which would indicate the altered development of hypothalamic circuits that control energy balance. Design: Neonatal mice were subjected to a control diet (CTR) or experimental diet with altered relative n-6 and n-3 FA contents [ie, a diet with a relative reduction in n-6 fatty acid (LOW n-6) or a diet with a relative increase in n-3 fatty acid (HIGH n-3) compared with the CTR from postnatal day (PN) 2 to 42]. Results: Compared with CTR mice, mice fed a LOW n-6 or HIGH n-3 during postnatal life showed significant reductions in the density of both orexigenic and anorexigenic neural projections to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus at PN 28. These impairments persisted into adulthood and were still apparent after the WSD challenge between PNs 42 and 98. However, the neuroanatomical changes were not associated with changes in the postnatal leptin surge. Conclusion: Although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, our data indicate that the quality of dietary FA during postnatal life affects the development of the central regulatory circuits that control energy balance and may do so through a leptin-independent mechanism. © 2013 American Society for Nutrition.",,"leptin; adulthood; animal experiment; article; body fat; caloric intake; controlled study; energy balance; fat intake; female; hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus; hypothalamus; lipid composition; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; perinatal period; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Appetite Regulation; Arcuate Nucleus; Axons; Behavior, Animal; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Fatty Acids, Omega-6; Female; Lactation; Leptin; Male; Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neurons; Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus; Random Allocation; Up-Regulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888268205

Although the utilization of the cloud services improves the processing and storage capacity of mobile devices, the migration of confidential information on untrusted cloud raises security and privacy issues. Considering the security of mobile-cloud-computing subscribers' information, a mechanism to authenticate legitimate mobile users in the cloud environment is sought. Usually, the mobile users are authenticated in the cloud environment through digital credential methods, such as password. Once the users' credential information theft occurs, the adversary can use the hacked information for impersonating the mobile user later on. The alarming situation is that the mobile user is unaware about adversary's malicious activities. In this paper, a light-weight security scheme is proposed for mobile user in cloud environment to protect the mobile user's identity with dynamic credentials. The proposed scheme offloads the frequently occurring dynamic credential generation operations on a trusted entity to keep minimum processing burden on the mobile device. To enhance the security and reliability of the scheme, the credential information is updated frequently on the basis of mobile-cloud packets exchange. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is compared with the existing scheme on the basis of performance metrics i.e. turnaround time and energy consumption. The experimental results for the proposed scheme showed significant improvement in turnaround time and energy consumption as compared to the existing scheme. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cloud computing; Mobile-cloud computing; Privacy; Security","Authentication; Cloud computing; Data privacy; Energy utilization; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Storage as a service (STaaS); Confidential information; Digital credentials; Malicious activities; Performance metrics; Resource limitations; Security; Security and privacy issues; Security and reliabilities; Mobile cloud computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888011760

Nevertheless, investment in large-scale Solar Power Generators (SPGs) is largely impeded by the intermittent nature of solar power. Since the electricity market has a critical responsibility to maintain the reliability of energy supply, the SPG can be registered only as the market semi-scheduled generator (AEMC, 2011). This option excludes the advantages of providing baseload supply, which in turn impedes efficient market contracting for SPGs. The existing approach relies on energy storage or co-generation facilities to be built at the same connection point as the SPG to compensate for output shortages when there is insufficient sunlight. The co-located facilities require significant additional investment in infrastructure.This paper proposes a market based financial approach that does not require an additional construction effort. The approach financially links solar or other intermittent power generation with a gas-fired station through a set of tailored swap-type instruments.These swaps (based on solar energy forecasting) are designed to insure and hedge the SPG against a drop in its output. They contractually link physically separated solar and gas generators to form a single entity termed the Virtual Generator (VG). The VG arrangement requires the SPG to provide solar power when possible and the gas generator to kick in when there is any shortfall due to random clouds or at nightfall. Thus the proposed VG will have the capacity to produce reliable baseload supply. The profitability and design of the proposed financial setup for both the solar and gas generator has been tested in this research. The model has been prototyped on real market and solar data, the results demonstrate the benefits of implementation. While the paper is focused on links with gas generators, the developed financial setup is applicable to a broad range of fast-ramping power generators, such as hydro, including pumped-hydro storage as well as electrical batteries and biofuels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Baseload; Energy demand forecasting; NEM; Power Purchase Agreement; Solar power; Virtual Generator","Additional construction; Base-loads; Energy demand forecasting; Energy technologies; Hedging instruments; Long-term investment; Power purchase agreement; Virtual generators; Commerce; Digital storage; Gas generators; NEMS; Solar energy; Investments; biofuel; electricity generation; energy; implementation process; infrastructure; instrumentation; investment; solar power; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887022236

However, in order to face or to limit the intermittent character of solar energy, storage is proposed as a solution. It is found that two ways are used for the thermal energy storage: thermal and chemical ways. Nevertheless, thermal way is the most useful for solar drying. We present, in this paper, a classification of the common methods of thermal energy storage applied to solar drying with the presentation of the optimum design parameters for the studied dryers. It was found that the most frequent materials used for energy storage during solar drying are packed-bed storage with the use of rocks, sands, or gravels. The packed bed can be added to the drying chamber, to the solar collector, or both of them. Also, desiccants, such as a mixture of several chemical products or wheat, can find applications as storage material used for solar drying process. Water is the other proposed storage material; it is used according to its availability, cost, and some of its thermo-physical characteristics. Latent heat storage has found a little application for solar drying. In general manner and depending on the dried product, the insert of the thermal energy storage increases the efficiencies of the solar dryers and allows recovering the surplus of solar radiations during sunshine periods for a reuse during the off-sunshine periods. The study is ended by an economic analysis of some developed solar dryers. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Design; Efficiency; Latent heat; Sensible heat; Solar energy","Chemical products; Chemical ways; Dried products; Drying chambers; Optimum design parameters; Sensible heat; Solar drying; Thermal heat; Agriculture; Design; Developing countries; Driers (materials); Economic analysis; Efficiency; Heat storage; Latent heat; Packed beds; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Sun; Solar dryers",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886731971

Hereby we review the current understanding of the SIRT-PARP interplay in regard to the biochemical nature of the interaction (competition for the common NAD+ substrate, mutual posttranslational modifications and direct transcriptional effects) and the physiological or pathophysiological consequences of the interactions (metabolic events, oxidative stress response, genomic stability and aging).

Capital breeding, however, may also enable preconceptive females to increase hormone production for ovulation, which has been linked to energetic condition in capital breeders, and/or allow females entering the subsequent HFP to increase their energetic condition in order to continue nursing unweaned infants. Here, we investigate whether capital breeding provides these additional benefits in 16 female Sanje mangabeys (Cercocebus sanjei) and determine the dietary strategies used to increase energetic condition (measured by urinary C-peptide: UCP) during the HFP. Fecal estradiol (fE2) and UCP were negatively correlated with number of cycles before conception (r=-0.591, r=-0.646, P&lt;0.01) and were highest in conceptive cycles. Both peri-conceptive (preconception and early gestation) and non-peri-conceptive (lactation) females increased energetic condition over the HFP (r=0.612, r=0.583, P&lt;0.001) by increasing dietary fat (r=0.619, r=0.703, P&lt;0.001) and, for non-peri-conceptive females, protein (r=0.437, P&lt;0.001). Feeding intake rate (FIR) and time spent foraging and feeding did not change over the HFP; however, non-peri-conceptive females exhibited a faster FIR compared to peri-conceptive females (t=-2.324, P&lt;0.05), consuming almost twice as much food per unit time. The results of this study confirm that Sanje mangabeys benefit in multiple phases of the reproductive cycle by using capital breeding, which may explain how this strategy promotes female reproductive success. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Capital breeding; Nutrition; Ovarian hormones; Urinary C-peptide","endangered species; feeding; female; food intake; lactation; nutrition; pregnancy; primate; reproduction; reproductive cycle; reproductive strategy; reproductive success; Cercocebus; animal; article; body composition; capital breeding; Cercocebus; diet; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; female; fruit; nutrition; ovarian hormones; physiology; reproduction; sexual behavior; urinary C-peptide; capital breeding; nutrition; ovarian hormones; urinary C-peptide; Animals; Body Composition; Cercocebus; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Female; Fruit; Reproduction; Sexual Behavior, Animal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885424847

Additionally, the existence of large, complex and world wide spread businesses implies a complex system to be managed where distribution can be seen as one of the key areas that needs to be efficiently and effectively managed. Different types of distribution modes characterize the oil supply chain where the pipeline mode is one of the most complex to operate when having multiproduct characteristics. This paper addresses the planning of a generic oil derivatives transportation system characterized by a multiproduct pipeline that connects a single refinery to a storage tank farm. Two alternative mixed integer linear programming models (MILP) that aim to attain a set of planning objectives such as fulfilling costumers' demands (which is mandatory) while minimizing the medium flow rate are developed. Additionally, final inventory levels are avoided to be excessively low.

The evolved organisms have developed sophisticated and perfect machineries and highly delicate mechanisms to carry out directional and coordinated movements which eventually lead to motion at the macroscopic length scale. By mimicking these natural machineries, attempts to design and synthesize similar molecular motors are made in relevance to their applications in drug delivery, data storage, and molecular sensing. It is highly desirable to establish the rules for controlling the conformational states of molecular motors by tuning some of the external variables which can be used for the design strategies. We contribute to this subject by looking into the solvent influence on the conformational states of a synthetic molecular rotor, namely, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based [2]rotaxane, using the force-field molecular dynamics approach. We study this system in three different solvents, and we report a strong solvent dependence in the population of three different translational isomers. In chloroform solvent we report the dominant population of the 2-P isomer which is in excellent agreement with experimental results based on H NMR spectra (Org. Lett. 2013, 15, 1274). However, there is a striking difference seen in the population of translational isomers in DMSO solvent, and we attribute these features to negligence of solvent hydrogen bonding induced upfield and downfield effects in the interpretation of experimental proton NMR spectra. In addition, we also report a solvent-polarity-induced fully unstretched to folded conformational transition in the [2]rotaxane system. On the basis of the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann (and generalized Born) surface area approach, we identify the driving force for the formation of the supramolecular guest-host [2]rotaxane system. Finally, we calculate the relative binding free energies for the macrocycle at different binding sites of the DPP skeleton using the molecular dynamics simulations performed for the macrocycle-rotaxane system in water solvent which suggests the increased stability of the 2-O isomer in polar solvent. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Chloroform solvents; Conformational state; Conformational transitions; Coordinated movement; Diketopyrrolopyrroles; Fundamental features; Macroscopic length; Molecular dynamics simulations; Binding energy; Biology; Drug delivery; Hydrogen bonds; Isomers; Linear motors; Machine design; Machinery; Molecular dynamics; Molecular electronics; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Solvents; Organic solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889585951

However, this technology is not widely used because of control issues, particularly for hydrogen refuelling stations. At present, direct or DC-DC converter couplings are the most common system configurations for hydrogen refuelling stations. However, these system configurations are costly and suffer from gas shortage at hydrogen refuelling stations. Furthermore, the hydrogen produced by such system configurations varies considerably depending on the levels of solar radiation. In order to address these issues, a new system configuration is proposed, incorporating the feedback signal of the storage level in the control system. The photovoltaic (PV) system, electrolyzer, and storage tank are integrated with a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to determine the backup current compensation for electrolyzer operation in order to obtain the minimum power required for hydrogen production. The proposed FLC is constructed with three input variables which are the PV current, hydrogen storage level, and the battery state of charge. The rules-based fuzzy inference process is based on the proposed configuration which combines the advantages of direct and DC-DC converter coupling configurations. The simulation results show that the proposed configuration offers better adaptability to variable radiation conditions compared to other methods. This gives a more promising option for ensuring the adequacy of hydrogen supply at hydrogen refuelling stations. © 2013 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Fuzzy logic; Hydrogen energy; Hydrogen refueling facility; Solar energy","Battery state of charge; Current compensation; Fuzzy logic controllers; Hydrogen Energy; Hydrogen production systems; Hydrogen refueling; Hydrogen refuelling stations; System configurations; DC-DC converters; Electrolytic cells; Fuzzy logic; HVDC power transmission; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Solar energy; Sun; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887919565

To overcome the frequent disconnections, DTN nodes are required to store data packets for long periods of time until they come near other nodes. Moreover, to increase the delivery probability, they spread multiple copies of the same packet on the network so that one of them reaches the destination. Given the limited storage and energy resources of many DTN nodes, there is a tradeoff between maximizing delivery and minimizing storage and energy consumption. In this paper, we study the routing problem in DTN with limited resources. We formulate a mathematical model for optimal routing, assuming the presence of a global observer that can collect information about all the nodes in the network. Next, we propose a new protocol based on social grouping among the nodes to maximize data delivery while minimizing network overhead by efficiently spreading the packet copies in the network. We compare the new protocol with the optimal results and the existing well-known routing protocols using real life simulations. Results show that the proposed protocol achieves higher delivery ratio and less average delay compared to other protocols with significant reduction in network overhead. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","Delay tolerant networks; Routing protocols; Social grouping","Delivery probabilities; End-to-end connections; Frequent disconnection; Network overhead; Optimal routing; Real life simulations; Routing problems; Social grouping; Digital storage; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Mathematical models; Routing protocols; Wireless networks; Delay tolerant networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887915958

The sensor nodes have severe constraints, such as: limited power supply, low network bandwidth, short wireless communication range, and limited CPU processing and memory storage. Communication in WSN consumes more energy than sensing and processing performed by the network nodes. Therefore, as the sensor nodes are battery-powered and recharging or replacing batteries, in most cases, is infeasible, maximizing the benefits of limited resources in WSNs have become one relevant and challenging issue. The WSN routing protocols must have autoconfiguration features in order to find out which is the best route for communication, thus increasing delivery assurance and decreasing the energy consumption between nodes that comprise the network. This paper presents a proposal for estimating the quality of routes using fuzzy systems to assist the Directed Diffusion routing protocol. The fuzzy system is used to estimate the degree of the route quality, based on the number of hops and the lowest energy level among the nodes that form the route.

However, the production of energy from both wind turbines and solar PV systems is weather-dependent. In this study, we developed an innovative Bio-Hydrogen Integrated Renewable Energy System (BHIRES) based on the integration of hydrogen generation from biomass fermentation, renewable energy power generation, hydrogen generation from water electrolysis, a hydrogen storage device, and a fuel cell providing combined heat and power. BHIRES can provide electric power, thermal energy, and hydrogen, with the additional function of processing biomass waste and wastewater. As indicated by results of the economic analysis conducted in this study, the cost of electricity and the average energy cost of using BHIRES are both lower than those for wind/PV/hydrogen HRES.

Understanding the elemental and compositional states of surfaces after various processing conditions is necessary when bonding dissimilar materials. Therefore, we investigated the elemental and compositional states of silicon (Si), silicon dioxide (SiO2) and glass surfaces exposed to oxygen reactive ion etching (O2 RIE) plasma followed by storage in controlled humidity and/or ambient atmospheric conditions to understand the chemical mechanisms in the direct wafer bonding. High-resolution X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of O2 RIE treated Si, SiO 2 and glass showed the presence of Si(-O)2 resulting in highly reactive surfaces. A considerable shift in the binding energies of Si(-O)2, Si(-O)4 and Si(-OH)x were observed only in Si due to plasma oxidation of the surface. The humidity and ambient storage of plasma activated Si and SiO2 increased Si(-OH)x due to enhanced sorption of hydroxyls. The amounts of Si(-O)2 and Si(-OH)x of Si varied in different humidity storage conditions which are attributed to crystal-orientation dependent surface morphology and oxidation.

Here, we used proteomics and transcriptomics to compare the mechanisms of ipt-transgenic and N6-benzylaminopurine (BA) CK treatment of broccoli during postharvest storage. The 2 treatments conferred common and distinct mechanisms. BA treatment decreased the quantity of proteins involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism, and ipt-transgenic treatment increased that of stress-related proteins and molecular chaperones and slightly affected levels of carbohydrate metabolism proteins. Both treatments regulated genes involved in CK signaling, sugar transport, energy and carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism, although ipt-transgenic treatment to a lesser extent. BA treatment induced genes encoding molecular chaperones, whereas ipt-transgenic treatment induced stress-related genes for cellular protection during storage. Both BA and ipt-transgenic treatments acted antagonistically on ethylene functions. We propose a long-term acclimation of metabolism and protection systems with ipt-transgenic treatment of broccoli and short-term modulation of metabolism and establishment of a protection system with both BA and ipt-transgenic treatments in delaying senescence of broccoli florets. Biological significance: Transgenic broccoli harboring senescence-associated-gene (SAG) promoter-triggered isopentenyltransferase (ipt), which encodes the key enzyme for cytokinin (CK) synthesis and N6-benzylaminopurine (BA) CK treated broccoli both showed retardation of postharvest senescence during storage. The mechanisms underlying the two treatments were compared. The combination of proteomic and transcriptomic evidences revealed that the 2 treatments conferred common and distinct mechanisms in delaying senescence of broccoli florets. We propose a long-term acclimation of metabolism and protection systems with ipt-transgenic treatment of broccoli and short-term modulation of metabolism and establishment of a protection system with both BA and ipt-transgenic treatments in delaying senescence of broccoli florets.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Translational Plant Proteomics. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Broccoli; Cytokinin; Isopentenyltransferase; Proteome; Senescence; Transcriptome","chaperone; cytokinin; acclimatization; amino acid metabolism; article; broccoli; carbohydrate metabolism; environmental protection; lipid metabolism; microarray analysis; nonhuman; postharvest period; priority journal; protein analysis; proteomics; senescence; sugar transport; transcriptomics; Brassica oleracea var. italica; Broccoli; Cytokinin; Isopentenyltransferase; Proteome; Senescence; Transcriptome; Alkyl and Aryl Transferases; Benzyl Compounds; Brassica; Cytokinins; Flowers; Food Storage; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Proteomics; Purines; Transcriptome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888032438

Unfortunately, the poor conductivity and dispersion could limit their practical application. Although incorporating with conductive materials such as graphene has proved to be an effective method to solve the above problems, the role of the graphene is not clear yet. This work provides a systematic study on graphene-decorated porous nickelian heterogenite ((Ni,Co)OOH). The dispersion of particles and conductivity is found to be significantly improved by the graphene-decoration, resulting in great enhancements of electrochemical properties. The contributed capacitance value of (Ni,Co)OOH in (Ni,Co)OOH-rGO-10 h (decorated with 10 h reduced graphene oxide) is 1045 F g-1, 3.5 times higher than that in the pure sample (296 F g-1). This is the best enhancement to our knowledge. A model is also proposed to illustrate that this enhancement in capacitance is attributed to extra and deeper redox reactions, which are due to the improvement of conductivity and dispersion by the incorporation of graphene. Therefore, the graphene-decorating is an essential and important way to improve the capacitance of metal oxidehydroxide. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper extends the breakage mechanics theory to unsaturated conditions, investigates the physical roots of hydro-mechanical coupling and elucidates the interplay between yielding locus and degree of saturation. For this purpose, energy storage mechanisms are hypothesized to consist of the sum of an elastic energy potential and a hydraulic contribution inspired by the capillary theory. Microscopic arguments are then used to define suitable grainsize scaling laws. These assumptions are finally combined with a statistical homogenization procedure, thus deriving a macroscopic Helmholtz free energy.

However, no clear definition of seasonality is given in the literature. This study investigated how the carbon footprint of yearly per capita consumption of tomatoes and carrots in Sweden was affected by seasonal consumption according to interpretations of seasonality found in communications from Swedish NGOs and authorities. The results showed that the carbon footprint of carrot and tomato consumption was strongly affected by consuming according to either a strict definition of seasonality, which excluded both production in heated greenhouses and long-distance transport, or a definition which only allowed Swedish produce. The reduction potential was approximately 60%, but the consumption pattern was also highly restrictive, with e.g. tomatoes only being consumed during three months according to the strictest definition. The reduction from eating only Swedish products was not due primarily to characteristics commonly associated with seasonal production (shorter transport or low energy demand in cultivation), but to the use of renewable fuel instead of fossil energy. The methodology chosen in this study resulted in carrots having a more distinct season than tomatoes, since the energy use for heating greenhouses (which are needed all year round in cold climates) was evenly allocated across all tomatoes harvested during one year, while the carbon footprint of carrots was assumed to increase with time due to increased energy demand for storage and storage losses. Hence, modern production techniques challenge the traditional concepts of seasonality. On an absolute scale including the whole food sector, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from eating seasonal is limited, as emissions from vegetable production make up a minor proportion of the total emissions from food consumption. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results predict high mobility for lithium atoms on the surface of silicene with energy barriers in the range of 0.28-0.30 eV. Further, we find that the diffusion barrier through silicene is significantly lower than the diffusion barrier through graphene, with a value of 0.05 eV for the double vacancy and 0.88 eV for the single vacancy. The low diffusion barriers, both on the surface and through the hollow site, suggest a suitable material for use in Li-ion batteries. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","defects in silicene; diffusion of lithium; first-principles calculations; lithium; silicene","Adsorption energies; Bulk cohesive energies; Defect formation energies; First-principles calculation; First-principles study; Li-ion batteries; Silicene; Single vacancies; Adsorption; Calculations; Diffusion barriers; Graphene; Lithium batteries; Lithium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887586243

H2 is a promising replacement energy storage molecule because it has the highest energy density of all common fuels by weight. One area in which replacing fossil fuels will have a large impact is in automobiles, which currently operate almost exclusively on gasoline. Due to the size and weight constraints in vehicles, on board hydrogen must be stored in a small, lightweight system. This is particularly challenging for hydrogen because it has the lowest energy density of common fuels by volume. Therefore, a lot of research is invested in finding a compact, safe, reliable, inexpensive and energy efficient method of H 2 storage. Mechanical compression as well as storage in chemical hydrides and absorption to carbon substrates has been investigated.

The hydrogen content in liquid ammonia is 17.6 wt% compared with 12.5 wt% in methanol. Although a large percentage of ammonia, produced globally, is currently used in fertiliser production, it has been used as a fuel for transport vehicles and for space heating. Ammonia is an excellent energy storage media with infrastructure for its transportation and distribution already in place in many countries. Ammonia is produced at present through the well known Haber-Bosch process which is known to be very energy and capital intensive. In search for more efficient and economical process and in view of the potential ammonia production growth forecast, a number of new processes are under development. Amongst these, the electrochemical routes have the potential to substantially reduce the energy input (by more than 20%), simplify the reactor design and reduce the complexity and cost of balance of plant when compared to the conventional ammonia production route. Several electrochemical routes based on liquid, molten salt, solid or composite electrolytes consisting of a molten salt and a solid phase are currently under investigation.

The use of hydrogen namely allows a much smaller wing area and span since the wing size is not restricted by its fuel storage capacity. At a given price per unit energy content, the smaller wings lead to a reduction of around 30% in take-off gross weight and 3% in direct operating costs for a given fuel price per energy content.

Both CO2 capture and CO2 storage are solubility problems. This paper reviews some important solubility aspects of CO2 capture and storage that are often overlooked. Until very recently, there was not a single CO2 solubility relationship that was both applicable in a wide temperature range and thermodynamically consistent with the enthalpy of solution of CO2. Furthermore, very often the relationship used for the first acidity constant of carbonic acid as a function of temperature is inconsistent with the relationship used for the solubility constant (or Henry constant) of CO2. The removal of CO2 from a gas stream with amine solutions is usually viewed as a chemical reaction, which leads to the practice of heating to remove the CO2 from the solvent. However, viewing this process as a solubility phenomenon suggests the practice of using vacuum to remove the CO2 from the solvent, a potentially more efficient approach. © 2013 IUPAC.","Calcite; Chemical equilibrium; CO2; Solubility; Solution chemistry","Chemical equilibriums; Energy productions; Enthalpy of solution; Mitigation strategy; Solubility constants; Solubility phenomenon; Solution chemistry; Wide temperature ranges; Calcite; Solubility; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887071332

We find that the intercalated Li atoms are energetically more stable than Li atoms adsorbed on the MoS 2 surface. The intercalated atoms interact with both graphene sheet and MoS2 layer, increasing the Li binding energies. However, the equilibrium geometries are ruled by the MoS2 layer, where the intercalated Li atoms lie on the top (LiT) and hollow (Li H) sites of the MoS2 layer. We calculate the Li diffusion barriers, along the LiT → LiH diffusion path, where we find similar energy barriers compared with that obtained for Li adatoms on the MoS2 surface. Our results allow us to infer that the Li storage capacity increases at MoS2/G interfaces, in comparison with Li adatoms on the MoS2 surface - however, with no reduction on the mobility of the intercalated Li atoms.

At the Kwinana refinery oxalate is removed from the Bayer Liquor via a separate side-stream as it increases the operating costs associated with the process and, at sufficiently high levels, may adversely affect the quality and yield of the final alumina product. The bioreactor process provides a more economic and environmentally friendly method for the treatment of removed oxalate compared with chemical conversion or storage of the solid byproduct. In previous studies, the microbial community composition of the bioreactor was investigated and was found to be largely dominated by microorganisms of the α-, β- and γ-Proteobacteria subgroups. During the present study, two bacteria that had the ability to use oxalate as a sole source of carbon and energy were isolated from samples obtained from the bioreactor. Phylogenetic and physiological analyses indicated that the two isolates were probably strains of a novel species of a novel genus within the β-Proteobacteria subgroup.

Extensive research has shown that large wood significantly impacts channel dynamics, especially in small and intermediate sized forested streams where wood pieces are similar in length to channel width, and many stream rehabilitation efforts now involve the addition of large wood to streams. The primary objective of this research is to investigate the relation between large wood and reach scale channel morphology and hydraulics using a physical model, in order to better inform stream rehabilitation programs and future modeling efforts. Four experiments, each comprising numerous five hour runs, were conducted using a Froude-scaled stream table with wood loads scaled to 0m3/m2, 0.011m3/m2, 0.016m3/m2, and 0.022m3/m2. The addition of large wood significantly decreased the reach-averaged velocity in all experiments, and was associated with decreased sediment transport and increased sediment storage in the reach. Increases in bed and water surface slope compensated for the loss of energy available to transport sediment, and enabled the system to reach a new steady state within the equivalent of 6 to 9years. Adding wood increased pool frequency, as well as the variability in cross-sectional depth, while causing the reach to undergo a transition from a plane-bed to a riffle-pool morphology. Retention of fine sediment increased the availability of fish spawning substrate, while increased water stage improved connectivity between the channel and the floodplain. The changes in habitat complexity were generally related to the wood load added to the reach, but were also dependent on the orientation and arrangement of the pieces. These results demonstrate that wood may exert a primary control on channel morphodynamics and the availability of aquatic habitat in intermediate sized streams, and suggest that the benefits from stream rehabilitation efforts are highly dependent on project scale. The relatively long time needed to realize habitat benefits demonstrates that long term monitoring of rehabilitation projects is necessary. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic habitat; Channel morphology; Large wood; Riparian disturbance; Stream restoration","channel hydraulics; channel morphology; floodplain; habitat restoration; modeling; morphodynamics; riparian zone; stream channel; wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886595700

A relationship exists between the mode of carbonate occurrence, the mineralogy and the isotopic fingerprint of carbonates from the tailings pile. Vertical carbonate crusts, covering most of the tailings, predominantly consist of the hydrated Mg-carbonate hydromagnesite (Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O), which has precipitated from evaporating meteoric waters incorporating atmospheric CO2, as reflected in high δ18O, δ13C and F14C signatures, respectively. Low and variable concentrations of magnesite, dolomite and calcite represent bedrock carbonate, which has formed during alteration of the serpentinite bedrock before mining and is characterised by moderately high δ18O, low δ13C and F14C, a signature typical for 'weathering-derived' magnesite deposits in the GSB. The carbonate fraction of deep cement samples, collected from 70 to 120cm below the surface, representing the bulk tailings material at depth, predominantly consists of pyroaurite (Mg6Fe2(CO3)(OH)16·4H2O) and, despite stable isotope signatures similar to bedrock, contains significant radiocarbon. This indicates that pyroaurite, forming under different conditions as hydromagnesite, may represent an additional trap for atmospheric CO2 in the Woodsreef mine tailings. The distribution of carbonates and quartz, together with the absence of isotopic mixing trends between bedrock carbonate and atmospheric-derived carbonate, strongly indicates that dissolution and re-precipitation of bedrock carbonate is not a dominant process in the Woodsreef tailings. The cations for carbonate formation are instead derived from the dissolution of serpentine minerals (lizardite and chrysotile) and brucite. The internal standard method and the reference intensity method have been used with X-ray diffraction data to estimate the abundance of the two major carbonate minerals hydromagnesite and pyroaurite, respectively. Considering the formation of hydromagnesite on the outer surface of the tailings pile alone or together with formation of pyroaurite within the tailings pile we conclude that, between 1400 and 70,000t of atmospheric CO2 have been sequestered in the mine tailings since closure of the mine 29a ago. Carbonation rates of 27gCm-2y-1 and 1330gCm-2y-1 are significantly higher than background rates of CO2 uptake by chemical weathering and demonstrate the potential of passive carbonation of mine tailings as a cost and energy effective alternative for storage of CO2 in carbonate minerals. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonation rate; Mine tailings; Mineral sequestration of CO2; Radiocarbon; Serpentinite; Weathering","Internal standard method; Isotopic fingerprinting; Mine tailings; Mineral sequestration of CO; New South Wales , Australia; Quantitative mineralogies; Radiocarbon; Serpentinite; Asbestos mines; Carbon dioxide; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Dissolution; Isotopes; Kaolinite; Magnesite; Quartz; Serpentine; Surfaces; Tailings; Weathering; X ray diffraction; Piles; bedrock; calcite; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; dissolution; dolomite; isotopic analysis; magnesite; meteoric water; mine waste; mineralogy; stable isotope; tailings; weathering; Australia; New South Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885156351

The LHTES system is integrated with a building mechanical ventilation system. Paraffin RT20 was used as a phase change material (PCM) and fins are used to enhance its performance. To reduce the computational time, artificial neural networks (ANN) was used to relate the relationships between the LHTES inputs and output parameters. Extensive CFD simulations were carried out to identify all the influential parameters for the development of ANN. They include phase change temperature range, air flow rate, the geometrical configuration of a LHTES system, fin size, and the unit's length. Further CFD simulations were carried out to provide sufficient data for proper training and testing of the ANN. The ANN model was used to predict the LHTES's outlet air-temperature. There was a good agreement between the ANN prediction and CFD model's prediction. The ANN model thenwas used to study the annual performance of a LHTES for application in Montreal. We found that the potential of use the centralized LHTES system to reduce the cooling load is high with a wider phase change temperature range.

Only switches based on optical phase change are treated, since these have the largest flexibility. Further, only switches that preserve input wavelength at the output are considered, due to cascadeability requirements. It is argued that as long as 'all-optical' switches need electronically controlled switches for information transfer to the optical signals controlling the all-optical switch, this will compromise any other advantages that the all-optical switch and the corresponding systems might have. A further application for all-optical switches, which currently are orders of magnitude faster than electronically controlled ones, would be in banks of electronically controlled slower alloptical switches which are all-optically multiplexed to drive all-optical switches to data rates not currently achievable by electronically controlled switches. It is argued that such systems will be complex, requiring sophisticated electronic synchronization and being inferior to corresponding wavelength division multiplexing systems. Power dissipation and switch energy are analyzed for two different physical mechanisms for controllably changing the refractive index in the all-optical and electronically controlled optical switches: Pockels and Kerr effects as well as the plasma or free carrier effect and the relative merits of electronically and optically controlled optical switches using these are discussed. It is shown that, in the former case, (Pockels and Kerr effects) using representative data, electronically controlled switches are generally more power efficient than the all-optical counterparts. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Electronic synchronization; Energy requirements; Free-carrier effects; Information transfers; Optical phase changes; Optically controlled; Orders of magnitude; Wavelength-division multiplexing system; Digital storage; Multiplexing equipment; Optical Kerr effect; Refractive index; Optical switches",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900573086

In subsurface volcanic environments (e.g., conduits and feeders), melts intersect the thermodynamically defined glass transition temperature to form glasses at elevated confining pressures and under differential stresses. We present a series of room temperature experiments designed to explore the fundamental mechanical and fragmentation behavior of natural (obsidian) and synthetic glasses (Pyrex™) under confining pressures of 0.1-100 MPa. In each experiment, glass cores are driven to brittle failure under compressive triaxial stress. Analysis of the load-displacement response curves is used to quantify the storage of energy in samples prior to failure, the (brittle) release of elastic energy at failure, and the residual energy stored in the post-failure material. We then establish a relationship between the energy density within the sample at failure and the grain-size distributions (D-values) of the experimental products. The relationship between D-values and energy density for compressive fragmentation is significantly different from relationships established by previous workers for decompressive fragmentation. Compressive fragmentation is found to have lower fragmentation efficiency than fragmentation through decompression (i.e., a smaller change in D-value with increasing energy density). We further show that the stress storage capacity of natural glasses can be enhanced (approaching synthetic glasses) through heat treatment.

Fiber length distribution study showed that more fiber degradation occurred during processing of the composites with higher fiber loading. Dynamic mechanical analysis carried out showed that magnitudes of storage and loss modulus of composites are improves with the presence of the glass fiber in the system. The incorporation of fibers into the composites has slightly shifted the glass transition temperature to lower values. On the other hand, the presence of the glass fiber reduces the magnitude of tan δ at α-transition dramatically due to the strengthening effect by the fibers. From impact test, it was found that increment in glass fiber loading leads to an increase in peak load, critical strain energy release rate and critical stress intensity factor indicating the improvement in the material toughness. However, there was no significant change observed in fracture energy. With respect to increasing in specimen geometry, despite an improvement in peak load and fracture energy of the impact specimen, the critical strain energy release rate and critical stress intensity factor values were decreased. On the other hand, increase in test temperature resulted in reduction of peak load and critical stress intensity factor due to increment in material ductility, whereby fracture energy and critical strain energy release rate improved. © 2013 The Korean Fiber Society and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Dynamic mechanical properties; Glass fiber composite; Impact properties; Specimen geometry; Temperature","Dynamics; Energy release rate; Fracture; Fracture energy; Geometry; Glass fibers; Injection molding; Polypropylenes; Reinforced plastics; Strain energy; Strain rate; Stress analysis; Stress intensity factors; Temperature; Critical strain energy release rates; Critical stress intensity factor; Dynamic mechanical property; Fiber length distributions; Fiber reinforced polypropylene composites; Glass fiber composites; Impact property; Specimen geometry; Glass transition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890348407

In the future, embedded platforms will have an even more increased processor core count, composing many-core platforms. In addition, applications are becoming more complex and dynamic and try to efficiently utilize the amount of available resources on the embedded platforms. Efficient memory utilization is a key challenge for application developers, especially since memory is a scarce resource and often becomes the system's bottleneck. To cope with this dynamism and achieve better memory footprint utilization (lowmemory fragmentation) application developers resort to the usage of dynamic memory (heap) management techniques, by allocating and deallocating data at runtime. Moreover, overall power consumption is another key challenge that needs to be taken into consideration. Towards this, designers employ the usage of Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) mechanisms, adapting to the application's computational demands at runtime. In this article, we propose the combination of dynamic memory management techniques with DVFS ones. This is performed by integrating, within thememorymanager, runtimemonitoringmechanisms that steer the DVFSmechanisms to adjust clock frequency and voltage supply based on heap performance. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a distributed shared-memory many-core platform composed of multiple LEON3 processors interconnected by a Network-on-Chip infrastructure, supporting DVFS. Experimental results show that by using the proposed method for monitoring and applying DVFS mechanisms the power consumption concerning dynamic memory management was reduced by approximately 37%. In addition we present the trade-offs the proposed approach. Last, by combining the developed method with heap fragmentation-aware dynamic memory managers, we achieve low heap fragmentation values combined with low power consumption. © 2013 ACM 1539-9087/2013/11-ART40 $15.00.","Dynamic memory management; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Many-core system-on-chip; Performance-energy trade-offs","Application developers; Computational demands; Distributed shared memory; Dynamic memory management; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Modern embedded systems; Performance-energy trade-offs; System on chips; Application specific integrated circuits; Commerce; Computer architecture; Industrial management; VLSI circuits; Storage allocation (computer)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890324254

Improved coordination requires sharing information, demanding a clear understanding of the potential gains and its distribution among the users to motivate engagement in coordinated operations and bearing of transaction costs. In a multiuser, multireservoir system, the evaluation of the potential coordination gains is not trivial because it requires the simultaneous evaluation of numerous trade offs. This paper presents a methodology to identify the likely upper and lower bounds in multireservoir system benefits, providing a reference framework for analyzing the economic value of coordination. The methodology is applied to a large-scale multireservoir system in Brazil. The methods rely on the comparison between two management scenarios. The first one mimics typical system operation based on individually designed rule curves, which are likely to perform on the lower bound. This is compared with fullscale system-wide optimization through an Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming algorithm to represent fully coordinated reservoir operation (upper bound). For our case study, results indicate that better coordination reduced spills and improved releases timing according to reservoirs characteristics and location, allowing overall gains between 3% and 8% in energy and 7.9% in revenues, with revenues mostly improved by coordination in dry years. Larger reservoirs presented the highest gains in absolute terms, while the smaller ones presented the highest relative increases. By indicating individual gains at each reservoir, valuable information is produced to support future negotiations and benefit sharing among different agents, being water agencies or power companies.

Storage oil in the oil palm mesocarp can make up a remarkable 80% of its dry mass, making it the oil crop with the richest oil content in the world. As such, there has been an ongoing interest in understanding the mechanism of oil production in oil palm fruits. To identify the proteome changes during oil palm fruit maturation and factors affecting oil yield in oil palm fruits, we examined the proteomic profiles of oil palm mesocarps at four developing stages - 12, 16, 18, and 22 weeks after pollination - by 8-plex iTRAQ labeling coupled to 2D-LC and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. It was found that proteins from several important metabolic processes, including starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis, pentose phosphate shunt, fatty acid biosynthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, were differentially expressed in a concerted manner. These increases led to an increase in carbon flux and a diversion of resources such as ATP and NADH that are required for lipid biosynthesis. The temporal proteome profiles between the high-oil-yielding (HY) and low-oil-yielding (LY) fruits also showed significant differences in the levels of proteins involved in the regulation of the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. In particular, the expression level of the β subunit of the ATP synthase complex (complex IV of the electron transport chain) was found to be increased during fruit maturation in HY but decreased in the LY during the fruit maturation. These results suggested that increased energy supply is necessary for augmented oil yield in the HY oil palm trees. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","ATP; iTRAQ; lipid biosynthesis; MRM; oil palm mesocarp; proteomics","adenosine triphosphate; cosmetic; palm oil; proteome; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; starch; article; controlled study; crop; dry mass; Elaeis; electron transport; energy resource; fatty acid synthesis; fruit; fruit development; glycolysis; labeling index; lipogenesis; liquid chromatography; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; pentose phosphate cycle; plant yield; pollination; priority journal; protein analysis; proteomics; sucrose metabolism; Arecaceae; Chromatography, Liquid; Fruit; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Phosphorylation; Plant Oils; Plant Proteins; Proteomics; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887261062

Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy and gamma spectrometry were used to determine the elemental composition and radioactivity along the fuel rods. Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to evaluate crud morphology and X-ray diffraction analysis was employed to determine the crystalline phase. Most of the iron in the crud comprised irregular shapes and flakes, with a number of crystallites (e.g. small quantities of ferrites, MnFe2O4). The major constituent of the outer layer was a loosely attached, stable form of hematite (α-Fe2O3). The amount of deposition on the fuel rods following the fourth fuel cycle of HWC (~1.0 mg cm-2) was significantly greater than after the third cycle, due to extended burn-up time. In addition, the radioactivity ratio of 58Co to 60Co was lower for EOC22 than for EOC21, due to a longer storage period in the spent fuel pool. No apparent changes were observed in the characteristics (composition or oxidizing nature) of crud in the fuel bundles. Finally, no direct negative impact was observed on the fuel cladding surfaces following four fuel cycles of HWC, compared with normal water chemistry conditions. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Corrosion products; Crud; Fuel assembly; Hematite (α-Fe2O3); Hydrogen water chemistry (HWC); Normal water chemistry (NWC)","chromium; cobalt; copper; ferric oxide; fuel; iron; manganese; nickel; zinc; article; boiling water reactor plant; chemical analysis; chemistry; concentration (parameters); flame photometry; gamma spectrometry; hydrogen water chemistry; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy; morphology; nuclear power plant; radioactivity; radioassay; roentgen spectroscopy; scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886889846

The electricity distribution grid that services the region has a minimum annual electricity demand of 0.9MW. Policy limits the installation of renewable electricity generators to 0.9MW at this site. An existing 0.9MW WEC (wind energy converter) occupies this capacity, inhibiting further installations. The use of an ESS enables the installation of a 0.5MW TEC by ensuring the combined electricity output from WEC and TEC does not exceed 0.9MW. The objective of this study is to model the system and determine the characteristics of the ESS capacity, power, and cyclic nature. The WEC and TEC are modeled based on measured and simulated wind and tidal speed data respectively. An ESS is modeled to de-couple the TEC output from the grid demand. A curtailment analysis is conducted for various ESS capacity and power sizes to determine the economic benefit. Avoidance of all curtailment requires nearly 7MWh of storage. Significant economic benefit may be found by reducing the ESS to less than 3MWh, resulting in minor curtailment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy; Interconnection; Storage; Tidal; Turbine; Wind","Digital storage; Electric utilities; Electricity; Energy storage; Turbines; Wind; Wind power; Electricity distribution; Energy; Energy storage systems; Interconnection; Renewable electricity; Tidal; Tidal energy converters; Wind energy converters; Tidal power; annual variation; demand analysis; economic analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; installation; numerical model; tidal power; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Fundy; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885949246

Our aim was to study how a fish or meat diet perinatal and after weaning affects body composition, insulin sensitivity and the profile of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in breast milk, fat depots, skeletal muscle and liver in male adult mice offspring. Methods: During gestation and lactation, C57BL/6 dams were fed a herring- or beef-based diet. Half of the pups in each group changed diets after weaning. In offspring, body composition measured by DEXA, plasma lipid profile and insulin sensitivity measured by euglycemic clamp or QUICKI were monitored to adulthood. Analysis of total FAs by GC-MS were performed in the diet, breast milk and in different tissues. Results: At 9 week of age, offspring of herring-fed dams had less body fat than offspring of beef-fed dams. Mice fed herring after weaning had increased insulin sensitivity at 15 week of age, reduced total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and compared with beef-fed mice, larger interscapular brown adipose tissue depots. The FA composition of the maternal diet was mirrored in breast milk, and the herring diet significantly affected the FA profile of different tissues, leading to an increased content of n-3 PUFAs. Conclusion: A herring-based maternal diet reduces body fat in the offspring, but the insulin sensitivity, plasma lipids and amount of brown adipose tissue are affected by the offspring's own diet; the herring diet is more beneficial than the beef diet. © 2013 Scandinavian Physiological Society.","Body composition; Fatty fish; Insulin sensitivity; Maternal diet; N-6/n-3 ratio; Red meat","adiponectin; cholesterol; glucose; insulin; leptin; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; adulthood; age distribution; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; beef; biological monitoring; body composition; body fat; breast milk; brown adipose tissue; C57BL 6 mouse; cell size; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat intake; female; herring; insulin sensitivity; lactation; lipid blood level; lipid storage; liver; male; maternal nutrition; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; perinatal period; pregnancy; priority journal; progeny; sea food; skeletal muscle; weaning; white adipose tissue; body composition; fatty fish; insulin sensitivity; maternal diet; n-6/n-3 ratio; red meat; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Body Composition; Body Weight; Cattle; Cell Size; Diet; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Fatty Acids, Omega-6; Female; Fishes; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Meat; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Milk; Muscle, Skeletal; Pregnancy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885434980

The killing of trees is expected to change the vertical distribution of net radiation (Q*) and the partitioning of latent (QE) and sensible (QH) heat fluxes in the different layers of an attacked forest canopy. During an intensive observation period in the summer of 2010, eddy-covariance flux and radiation measurements were made at seven heights from ground level up to 1.34 times the canopy height in an MPB-attacked open-canopy forest stand (leaf area index = 0.55 m2m-2) in the interior of British Columbia, Canada. The lodgepole pine dominated stand with a rich secondary structure (trees and understorey not killed by the beetle) was first attacked by the MPB in 2003 and received no management. In this study, the vertical distribution of the energy balance components and their sources and sinks were analyzed and energy balance closure (EBC) was determined for various levels within the canopy. The low stand density resulted in approximately 60 % of the shortwave irradiance and 50 % of the daily total Q* reaching the ground. Flux divergence calculations indicated relatively strong sources of latent heat at the ground and where the secondary structure was located. Only very weak sources of latent heat were found in the upper part of the canopy, which was mainly occupied by dead lodgepole pine trees. QH was the dominant term throughout the canopy, and the Bowen ratio (QH/QE) increased with height in the canopy. Soil heat flux (QG) accounted for approximately 4 % of Q*. Sensible heat storage in the air (ΔQS,H) was the largest of the energy balance storage components in the upper canopy during daytime, while in the lower canopy sensible heat storage in the boles (ΔQS,B) and biochemical energy storage (ΔQS,C) were the largest terms. ΔQS,H was almost constant from the bottom to above the canopy. ΔQS,C, ΔQS,B and latent heat storage in the air (ΔQS,E) varied more than ΔQS,H throughout the canopy. During daytime, energy balance closure was high in and above the upper canopy, and in the lowest canopy level. However, where the secondary structure was most abundant, EBC ≤ 66%. During nighttime, the storage terms together with QG made up the largest part of the energy balance, while QH and QE were relatively small. These radiation and energy balance measurements in an insect-attacked forest highlight the role of secondary structure in the recovery of attacked stands. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Energy balance; Mountain pine beetle; Radiation balance; Secondary structure; Sparse canopy; Turbulent heat fluxes","Mountain pine beetle; Radiation balance; Secondary structures; Sparse canopy; Turbulent heat fluxes; Energy balance; Heat flux; Heat storage; Latent heat; Secondary recovery; Forestry; beetle; Bowen ratio; coniferous forest; energy balance; forest canopy; latent heat flux; net radiation; partitioning; radiation balance; secondary structure; sensible heat flux; vertical distribution; Forestry; Heat; Insects; Pinus Mugo; British Columbia; Canada; Coleoptera; Hexapoda; Pinus contorta; Pinus mugo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884976809

Various kinds of solar systems provide scope for several studies on energy and exergy analysis. Solar ponds are one of applications for collecting and storing solar energy simultaneously and are usable in regions with readily available land, much sunlight, and access to low-priced salt.In the present work, an experimental investigation of the energetic and exergetic performance of two prototype solar ponds with square and circular cross sections has been carried out. The solar ponds were built at Bafgh city, a city near Yazd in the central part of Iran. The cross sectional area and depth of both prototype solar ponds are 3m2 and 1.5m, respectively. During 11months of energy storage operation, a data acquisition system was used to measure the temperature variations along the height of the solar ponds and to capture the development of thermal stratification. Data collection is done with 10min intervals.Thermal analysis of an experimental solar pond is usually a complicated task due to variations of many involved factors such as solar radiation, thermophysical properties of operating fluid, climatic changes etc. The energy performances of the solar ponds under investigation are carried out by modeling the solar incident radiation on the ponds surface, calculating energy exchange within each zone and thermal energy losses to the environment. Although the data are collected for almost one year of operation, however, the energy analysis is performed for some warmer months of the year during which the ponds are in the charging or energy storing period.An exergy balance model is also developed to investigate the exergetic performance of solar ponds. Monthly averaged exergy efficiencies are obtained for different regions of the ponds and compared with the corresponding energy efficiencies. The monthly average temperature of ambient is considered as the reference environment temperature for the exergy analysis. It was demonstrated that the circular solar pond has superior thermal performance than the square one. Stored water in the storage zone of the circular solar pond reaches to a higher temperature in comparison with the square one. It is attributed to the different shading effect in the two solar ponds. The maximum energy efficiencies for NCZ and HSZ of circular solar pond are found to be 17.25% and 25.8%, respectively while the corresponding values for the square solar pond are 17.39% and 23.65%. Maximum exergy efficiency for NCZ and HSZ are 0.86% and 2.44% for circular solar pond and 0.71% and 1.91% for the square solar pond. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy analysis; Exergy analysis; Solar energy; Solar pond","Circular cross-sections; Data acquisition system; Energy analysis; Energy and exergy analysis; Exergetic performance; Exergy Analysis; Experimental investigations; Reference environments; Digital storage; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Exergy; Incident solar radiation; Lakes; Solar energy; Sun; Thermodynamic properties; Solar ponds; climate change; energy efficiency; exergy; experimental study; numerical model; performance assessment; renewable resource; solar power; solar radiation; solar system; temperature effect; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884138501

These can derive from both simulations and measurements. Analysis of such data requires the availability of scalable algorithms. In this contribution, we propose a scalable algorithm that partitions instantaneous observations (snapshots) of a complex system into kinetically distinct sets (termed basins). To do so, we use a combination of ordering snapshots employing the method's only essential parameter, i.e., a definition of pairwise distance, and annotating the resultant sequence, the so-called progress index, in different ways. Specifically, we propose a combination of cut-based and structural annotations with the former responsible for the kinetic grouping and the latter for diagnostics and interpretation. The method is applied to an illustrative test case, and the scaling of an approximate version is demonstrated to be O(NlogN) with N being the number of snapshots. Two real-world data sets from river hydrology measurements and protein folding simulations are then used to highlight the utility of the method in finding basins for complex systems. Both limitations and benefits of the approach are discussed along with routes for future research. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As such a quantity has greater benefit to the wider system than the individual responses of many uncoordinated energy sites, the Virtual Power Station can improve the payback period for renewable energy systems. This paper describes a Virtual Power Station deployment with a diverse range of sites, and PV output, which are then coordinated together with an intelligent battery controller. We also introduce an optimal control strategy that manages the energy storage to allow a firm commitment of output energy from the Virtual Power Station. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy aggregation; Energy coordination; Genetic algorithm; Optimization; Renewable energy; Virtual Power Station","Energy coordination; Optimal control strategy; Photovoltaic generation; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy systems; Renewable generators; Virtual power; Aggregates; Electric generators; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Optimal control systems; Optimization; Power plants; Renewable energy resources; control system; energy market; energy resource; optimization; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877034775

The proposed probabilistic framework requires 2. m runs of the deterministic framework to consider the uncertainty of m uncertain variables in the terms of the first three moments of the relevant probability density functions. Therefore, the uncertainty regarding the load demand forecasting error, grid bid changes and WT and PV output power variations are considered concurrently. Investigating the MG problem with uncertainty in a 24h time interval with several equality and inequality constraints requires a powerful optimization technique which could escape from the local optima as well as premature convergence. Consequently, a novel self adaptive optimization algorithm based on θ-Particle Swarm Optimization (θ-PSO) algorithm is proposed to explore the total search space globally. The θ-PSO algorithm uses the phase angle vectors to update the velocity/position of particles such that faster and more stable convergence is achieved. In addition, the proposed self adaptive modification method consists of three sub-modification methods which will let the particles choosel the modification method which best fits their current situation. The feasibility and satisfying performance of the proposed method is tested on a typical grid-connected MG as the case study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Renewable micro-grid; Self adaptive modified θ-particle swarm optimization (SAM-θ-PSO); Storage device; Two point estimate method (PEM); Uncertainty","Micro grid; Optimization techniques; Point estimate method; Pre-mature convergences; Probabilistic framework; Self-adaptive; Two-point estimate methods; Uncertainty; Algorithms; Constraint theory; Data storage equipment; Energy management; Forecasting; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Probability density function; Virtual storage; Electric power transmission networks; algorithm; energy planning; energy resource; error analysis; estimation method; fuel cell; optimization; probability density function; renewable resource; storage; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876716385

This device has the capability to drive one light-stimulating LED and, at the same time, capture and send back neural signals recorded from two microelectrode readout channels. Light stimulation uses flexible patterns that allow for easy tuning of light intensity and stimulation periods. For driving the LED, a low-pass filtered digitally-generated PWM signal is employed for providing a flexible pulse generation method that alleviates the need for D/A converters.

Moreover, this conservation law can be applied to identify through energy-loss measurement the parametric modelling upon flow leakage at the load end. Meanwhile, with the spatiotemporal transfer-function, the coupling of Rijke chamber dynamics and load dynamics is represented by feedback interconnection, which transforms the overall design into a feedback system.

On the other hand, modern applications require dealing with complex data, such as images, videos and genetic sequences, in which exact match of two elements seldom occurs and, generally, is meaningless. Thus, it makes sense that sets of complex data should not include two elements that are ""too similar"". How to create a concept equivalent to ""sets"" for complex data? And how to design novel algorithms that allow it to be naturally embedded in existing DBMS? These are the issues that we tackle in this paper, through the concept of ""similarity sets"", or SimSets for short. Several scenarios may benefit from our SimSets. A typical example appears in sensor networks, in which SimSets can identify sensors recurrently reporting similar measurements, aimed at turning some of them off for energy saving. Specifically, our main contributions are: (i) highlighting the central properties of SimSets; (ii) proposing the basic algorithms required to create them from metric datasets, which were carefully designed to be naturally embedded into existing DBMS, and; (iii) evaluating their use on real world applications to show that our SimSets can improve the data storage and retrieval, besides the analysis processes.

In skeletal muscle cells, Nor-1 expression is important for the regulation of oxidative metabolism. Transgenic skeletal muscle-specific expression of activated Nor-1 resulted in the acquisition of an endurance phenotype, an increase in type IIA/X oxidative muscle fibers, and increased numbers of mitochondria. In the current study, we used dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging analysis to demonstrate decreased adiposity in transgenic (Tg) Nor-1 mice relative to that in wild-type littermates. Furthermore, the Tg-Nor-1 mice were resistant to diet-induced weight gain and maintained fasting glucose at normoglycemic levels. Expression profiling and RT-quantitative PCR analysis revealed significant increases in genes involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation, and glycogen synthesis, in concordance with the lean phenotype. Moreover, expression profiling identified several Z-disc and sarcomeric binding proteins that modulate fiber type phenotype and endurance, eg, α-actinin-3. In addition, we demonstrated that the Tg-Nor-1 mouse line has significantly higher glycogen content in skeletal muscle relative to that in wild-type littermates. Finally, we identified a decreased NAD+/NADH ratio with a concordant increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γcoactivator-1α1 protein/ mRNA expression. Increased NADH was associated with an induction of the genes involved in the malate-aspartate shuttle and a decrease in the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle, which maximizes aerobic ATP production. In conclusion, skeletal muscle-specific Nor-1 expression regulates genes and pathways that regulate adiposity, muscle fiber type metabolic capacity, and endurance. © 2013 by The Endocrine Society.",,"alpha actinin 3; carbon dioxide; glucose transporter 4; glycerophosphate; glycogen phosphorylase; glycogen synthase kinase; insulin; myoglobin; nuclear receptor NR4A3; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; phosphoprotein phosphatase 1; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; aerobic metabolism; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; brown adipose tissue; citric acid cycle; controlled study; down regulation; endurance; energy expenditure; fatty acid oxidation; food intake; gastrocnemius muscle; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; glycogen analysis; glycogen synthesis; glycogenolysis; glycolysis; insulin blood level; insulin sensitivity; insulin tolerance test; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; metabolism; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative phosphorylation; oxygen consumption; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; quadriceps femoris muscle; skeletal muscle; transgenics; upregulation; weight gain; white adipose tissue; Adipose Tissue; Adiposity; Animals; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Diet, High-Fat; DNA-Binding Proteins; Glycogen; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Muscle, Skeletal; NAD; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Obesity; Organ Specificity; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Endurance; Receptors, Steroid; Receptors, Thyroid Hormone; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886418313

As a result, the green concept of energy saving has emerged. Among the current green energies, solar power is not cost effective, and wind energy has great potential in terms of cost and efficiency. Most of wind energy is used for wind power generation, however, the wind energy is also applicable to heating, and the generated heat energy can be used for hot water supply and temperature regulation. The wind heating modes include fluid mixing and solid friction modes. This study used natural wind to design a machine producing heat energy by solid friction. The energy transfer mode of the wind heating system was to convert the blade extracted wind energy into mechanical energy, and use friction to generate mechanical energy generates. The heat energy was transferred to the water through heat exchange to increase the water temperature. The friction mode was to rub the brake pad against the disc to produce heat, and using the compression spring to adjust the magnitude of the friction. The pump circulated water to implement forced convection, and the heat exchange was designed as flowing water channel increasing the heat transfer time.

These devices are primarily used for heating purposes. A double layer quintuplet solar oven was researched; the objectives were to study performances of the solar oven in harvesting sunlight to reach the highest temperature and heat storage, and to compare theoretical models against actual experimental data. The solar oven was fabricated using glass panels and supported by a trolley for mobility. The solar oven in-field testing was set at 08:00 to 18:00 hours to ensure maximum exposure to daytime direct sunlight, thus maximum heat captured. A temperature sensor (thermocouple) was used to measure the temperature changes inside the oven. A XR440 Pocket Logger was connected to the sensor to record the measured temperature on an hourly basis. The experimental data were then collated and presented in a graphical format to visualize the trend. A numerical analysis based on theoretical modeling was done to compare with the experimental data which was affected by actual weather conditions. The experimental data showed that the maximum temperature captured inside the solar oven was 80°C. In principle, the temperature inside the solar oven will increase proportionately to the increments of the solar radiation from sunlight. This experimental study concluded that the maximum heat gained by this double layer quintuplet solar oven was 80°C or at solar irradiance value of 578.04W/m2. This experimental irradiance value when compared against the irradiance value calculated based on the theoretical model shows a variance of 8.44%. This parametric research study is worth exploring further as a research frontier in alternative sustainable energy in Malaysia. Similar research by other scholars reported that the solar oven will function effectively as a cooking device if the solar irradiance heat generated inside it is more than 800W/m2. With this finding, a further enhancement can be made to the oven design to improve the maximum heat gain. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Solar oven; Solar radiation; Solar thermal","Experimental analysis; Highest temperature; Maximum temperature; Measured temperatures; Solar oven; Solar thermal; Temperature changes; Theoretical modeling; Heat storage; Mechanical engineering; Research; Solar heating; Solar radiation; Sun; Temperature sensors; Thermocouples; Ovens",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886256177

ORC engines require certain threshold to operate as the organic fluid generally boils at more than 50 °C, and fails to operate at lower temperature. Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) can operate at very low temperature differences and can be good candidate to replace ORC for power generation at low temperatures. In this paper, the potential of power generation from TEG and salinity-gradient solar pond (SGSP) was investigated. SGSP is capable of storing heat at temperature up to 80 °C. The temperature difference between the upper convective zone (UCZ) and lower convective zone (LCZ) of a SGSP can be in the range of 40 °C-60 °C. This temperature difference can be used to power thermoelectric generators (TEG) for electricity production.

This idea allows for bit-interleaving that makes the SRAM more reliable against the soft errors. One of the challenges of a conventional 6 transistor (6T) SRAM cell in sub-threshold region is sizing of its access transistors. Here by separating access transistors of reading and writing, we mitigate this challenge. By using a minimum-size access transistor for reading, probability of unsuccessful read reduces. To have a more successful write operation, we make one of the inverters of the cell that is fighting with the write access transistor, weaker during write operation by floating its supply voltage and ground rails. After write operation, this inverter returns back to normal mode. Simulation results in 90 nm CMOS technology show that our design satisfies 4.5-sigma criterion for reading and writing at supply voltage of 300 mV. Compared to conventional 6T SRAM cell, our design improves read-time and write-time significantly. For example at supply voltage of 500 mV, these improvements are 137 and 83 percents, respectively. Comparing power and energy consumption for single write operation of the proposed 7T SRAM cell at supply voltage of 300mV with conventional 6T SRAM cell at 800mV (i.e. minimum achievable voltage for this SRAM cell) shows improvements of 133.4X and 266.78X, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.","Memory; Sense Amplifier; SRAM; Virtual Ground; Virtual Supply Voltage","Bit-interleaving; Power and energy consumption; Sense amplifier; Static random access memory; Sub-threshold regions; Supply voltages; Virtual Ground; Write operations; CMOS integrated circuits; Data storage equipment; Design; Electrical engineering; Energy utilization; Threshold voltage; Transistors; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886941806

This is true, in particular, for the challenge of planning for final disposal of long-lived wastes from nuclear power production. Today, there are countries preparing for the large scale introduction or expansion of nuclear energy in order to expand carbon-free production of electricity. For example, the UAE has started construction on the first of 8 planned reactors, Saudi Arabia is considering a 16 GWe programme and China intends a massive expansion. These countries have an opportunity to plan from the outset an integrated back-end program that considers all relevant facilities and activities required for waste production, treatment, storage, transport, packaging and disposal. We have been involved in various strategic planning initiatives aimed at optimizing the back-end of the fuel cycle in countries with new or expanding nuclear programmes. Our approach has been to consider a series of key questions related to all of the waste management activities mentioned above. For each of these activities, and for each waste stream, the questions are: • What wastes arise? • How will these be treated, characterised, stored and disposed? • Where should the necessary facilities be located? • When is the optimal time to bring each type of facility on line? The strategic analyses consider all nuclear options kept open by the country in question. These can include direct disposal of spent fuel, reprocessing (foreign or domestically), early or late disposal of wastes, separated or co-located storage, conditioning and disposal facilities, and purely national facilities or the use of shared regional stores or repositories. Key outputs from such assessments are a compilation of key decision points and a roadmap extending out for many decades. The paper describes the assessment methodology that we have used and outlines high-level recommendations for new waste management programmes.",,"Assessment methodologies; Disposal facilities; Integrated waste management; Management activities; Nuclear power production; Nuclear programmes; Nuclear technology; Strategic planning initiatives; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Optimization; Radioactive wastes; Safe handling; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886913339

Zero-point and room-temperature vibrations strongly affect both. Magnitude of the effect depends on the type of dopant and is affected by neighbouring dopant atoms. Vibrations lower the Helmholtz free energy of formation and more so for Na and Mg than for Li. The effect is stronger for dopants at neighbouring sites. Interactions between the metal atoms can locally reduce the diffusion barriers. Vibrations have a strong, dopant-type and temperature dependent lowering effect on the diffusion barrier, reaching > 0.07 eV for Li at room temperature.

Electrochemical anodization was employed for the direct growth of TiO2NTs. The PdNP functionalized TiO2NTs (TiO 2NT/Pd) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The hydrogen sorption behaviours and stability of the TiO2NT/Pd nanocomposites were investigated and compared with nanoporous Pd networks that were deposited on a bulk titanium substrate (Ti/Pd) using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA).

Recent direct measurements of evaporation made at the Stannard Rock Lighthouse have provided new information on the physical controls on Lake Superior evaporation, in particular that evaporation can react within hours to days to a change in synoptic conditions. However, the large heat capacity of the lake creates a strong seasonal cycle of energy storage and release. There is a complex interaction among heat storage, evaporation, and ice cover that is highly dependent on atmospheric conditions in the spring and autumn ''shoulder seasons.'' Small changes in conditions in November and March caused by synoptic-scale events can have profound impacts on annual evaporation, the extent of ice cover, and the length of the ice-covered period. Early winter air temperatures in November and December dictate the nature of ice formation and much of the winter evaporative flux. Decreased ice cover, by itself, does not necessarily lead to enhanced annual evaporation losses. Rather, a combination of low ice cover and warm spring air temperatures, leading to an early breakup, can significantly lengthen the next evaporation season and cause greater cumulative water loss the subsequent year. The influence of individual synoptic events on annual evaporation is notable enough that the research community should ensure that their role is properly captured in numerical models to provide sound predictions of future Laurentian Great Lakes evaporation regimes. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.",,"air temperature; autumn; evaporation; ice cover; lake; latent heat flux; spring (season); synoptic meteorology; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Superior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885916396

We focus on two types of available side information at the sensor, i.e. (1) causal side information involving the present and previous channel states and the previous values of the harvested energy and (2) full (non-causal) side information, under both finite and infinite energy storage capacity at each sensor's battery. The derivations and some structural properties of the optimal energy allocation schemes are discussed, and numerical results presented. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Best linear unbiased estimator; Causal side informations; Distortion minimization; Energy storage capacity; Finite time horizon; Multiple sensors; Numerical results; Optimal energy allocations; Energy harvesting; Optimization; Random processes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Sensors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885819507

Various metal atoms including Li, Na, K, Be, Mg, and Ca are doped into the most stable configuration of silicene. The corresponding binding energies and charge-transfer mechanisms are discussed from the perspective of hydrogen-storage compatibility. The Li and Na metal dopants are found to be ideally suitable, not only for strong metal-to-substrate binding and uniform distribution over the substrate, but also for the high-capacity storage of hydrogen. The stabilities of both Li- and Na-functionalized silicene are also confirmed through molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that both of the alkali metals, Li+ and Na+, can adsorb five hydrogen molecules, attaining reasonably high storage capacities of 7.75 and 6.9 wt %, respectively, with average adsorption energies within the range suitable for practical hydrogen-storage applications. Hoovering up hydrogen: A systematic density functional theory investigation shows alkali-metal doped silicene to be a promising hydrogen-storage material.

In this article, we investigate the use of multilevel spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) cells in the design of processor caches. We start with examining the access (read and write) scheme for multilevel cell (MLC) STT-RAM from a circuit design perspective, detailing the read and write circuits. Compared to traditional SRAM caches, a multilevel cell (MLC) STT-RAM cache design is denser, fast, and requires less energy. However, a number of critical architecture-level issues remain to be solved before MLC STT-RAM technology can be deployed in processor caches. We shall offer solutions to the issue of bit encoding as well as tackle the write endurance problem. In particular, the latter has been neglected in previous works on STT-RAM caches. We propose a set remapping scheme that can potentially prolong the lifetime of a MLC STT-RAM cache by 80× on average. Furthermore, a method for recovering the performance that may be lost in some applications due to set remapping is proposed. The impacts of process variations of the MLC STT-RAM cell on the robustness of the memory hierarchy is also discussed, together with various enhancement techniques, namely, ECC and design redundancy. © 2013 ACM.","Cache; Memories; MLC; Spintronic; STT-RAM","Cache; MLC; Multi level cell (MLC); Process Variation; Spin transfer torque; Spintronic; Stt rams; Technology nodes; Computer architecture; Data storage equipment; Design; Static random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885659072

In this study, effect of technology scaling to anomalous threshold voltage (Vt) variability is investigated thoroughly on postcycled and baked nitride based charge storage NVM devices. After long annealing bake of high temperature, cell's Vt variability of each subsequent bake increases within stable Vt distribution and found exacerbate by technology scaling. Apparent activation energy of this anomalous Vt variability was derived through Arrhenius plots. Apparent activation energy (Eaa) of this anomalous Vt variability is 0.67 eV at sub-40 nm devices which is a reduction of approximately 2 times from 110 nm devices. Technology scaling clearly aggravates this anomalous Vt variability, and this poses reliability challenges to applications that demand strict Vt control, for example, reference cells that govern fundamental program, erase, and verify operations of NVM devices. Based on critical evidence, this anomalous Vt variability is attributed to lateral displacement of trapped charges in nitride storage layer. Reliability implications of this study are elucidated. Moreover, potential mitigation methods are proposed to complement technology scaling to prolong the front-runner role of nitride based charge storage NVM in semiconductor flash memory market. © 2013 Meng Chuan Lee and Hin Yong Wong.",,"Apparent activation energy; High temperature; Lateral displacements; Mitigation methods; Nitride storage; Nonvolatile memory devices; Technology scaling; Threshold voltage variability; Application programs; Arrhenius plots; Flash memory; Nitrides; Nonvolatile storage; Threshold voltage; Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885628075

One challenge is that the existing methods do not consider the time-varying characteristics of the renewable sources and the energy demand over a year, while the mean and variance of a power source of demand are different over the period, and multiple power sources can often times complement one another.

However, little is known about the metabolic pathways whose transcription levels are most significantly altered following ND in green microalgae, especially the nonmodel species.Results: To start gaining knowledge on this, we performed transcriptome profiling of the nonmodel green microalga Botryosphaerella sudeticus cells in response to ND. Transcriptome of B. sudeticus is de novo assembled based on millions of HiSEQ short sequence reads using CLC Genomics Workbench software. The resulting non-redundant ESTs are annotated based on the best hits generated from the BLASTX homology comparison against the "" best"" proteins in the model microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella variabilis. By using a pathway-based approach according to KEGG databases, we show that ESTs encoding ribosomal proteins and photosynthetic functions are the most abundantly expressed ESTs in the rapidly growing B. sudeticus cells. We find that ESTs encoding photosynthetic function but not the ribosomal proteins are most drastically downregulated upon ND. Notably, ESTs encoding lipid metabolic pathways are not significantly upregulated. Further analyses indicate that chlorophyll content is markedly decreased by 3-fold and total lipid content is only slightly increased by 50%, consistent with the transcriptional profiling. On the other hand, carbon content and photosynthesis efficiency are only marginally decreased by 7% and 20%, respectively, indicating that photosynthesis is only slightly reduced upon drastic downregulation of photosynthetic ESTs and chlorophyll content upon ND. In addition, TAG content is found to be greatly increased by 50-fold, though total lipid content is only slightly increased by 1.5-fold.Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest that light-harvesting proteins and chlorophylls are in excess in B. sudeticus. Degradation of excess photosynthesis proteins is most likely a mechanism for recycling of nitrogen-rich molecules to synthesize new proteins for preparation of gametogenesis and zygospore formation in adaptation and survival upon ND. Furthermore, our analyses indicate that TAG accumulation is largely attributed to the modification of other pre-existing lipid molecules, rather than de novo synthesis. We propose that this is likely an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in many green microalgae species. © 2013 Sun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","B. sudeticus UTEX2629; De novo assembly; Metabolic pathways; Next-generation sequencing; Transcriptome profiling","carbon; chlorophyll; lipid; nitrogen; ribosome protein; transcriptome; triacylglycerol; ribosome protein; transcriptome; adaptation; animal cell; article; Botryosphaerella sudeticus; cell growth; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlorella; Chlorella variabilis; chlorophyll content; down regulation; expressed sequence tag; gametogenesis; genetic conservation; genetic database; green alga; light harvesting system; lipid composition; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; nonhuman; photosynthesis; protein degradation; protein expression; protein function; protein synthesis; sequence analysis; sequence homology; survival rate; upregulation; zygospore; cluster analysis; energy metabolism; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; green alga; metabolism; molecular genetics; photosynthesis; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlorella (Chlorellales); Chlorella (Prasiolales); Chlorella (unclassified Chlorophyceae); Chlorella (unclassified Trebouxiophyceae); Chlorophyta; Chlorophyta; Cluster Analysis; Energy Metabolism; Expressed Sequence Tags; Gametogenesis; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Nitrogen; Photosynthesis; Ribosomal Proteins; Transcriptome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885516516

With the aim of minimizing the mean squared error at the receiver, two types of side information (SI) available to the transmitter are considered: causal SI (energy harvested in the past) and non-causal SI (energy harvested in the past, present and future). For the case where non-causal SI is available and battery storage is unlimited, it is shown that the optimal power allocation can be attained by a simple water-filling-like procedure, where the water level follows a non-decreasing staircase function. Dynamic programming is used to optimize the allocation policy when causal SI is available.

A SGO/Nafion mixture with low SGO content exhibits unique viscosity behavior and allows for better SGO dispersion within the Nafion. After film casting, the composite membranes show lower methanol and water uptakes, a reduced swelling ratio, improved proton conductivity in low relative humidity, and extremely high methanol selectivity, which can be implemented in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The regular backbone of the composite membrane shows a higher storage modulus, increased α-relaxation (transition temperature), and improved tolerance to pressure during membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The small angle X-ray spectra indicate the shrinkage of the ionic clusters in the composite membranes, which thus reduce methanol crossover.

As computing and storage facilities migrate to a shared pool of resources which are mainly hosted in the data centers, the traffic intensity in the backbone is expected to increase tremendously. Consequently, power consumption of the network equipment, as well as the data centers, is expected to increase the operational costs of the network and data center operators. In this paper, we present possible solutions to reduce the operational costs of the operators via virtualization of an IP over WDM backbone network with optical bypass in the presence of dynamic electricity pricing. Based on the cyber-physical properties of the data centers and look-ahead demand profile of the cloud-based services, virtualization of the optical backbone network is reconfigured in order to accommodate all demands with the objective of minimum operational cost for the network and data center operators.

Previous models proposed in the literature used short plastic chains, which are appropriate for interaction modeling. In the present work, a model with a single, long chain was built, which is more appropriate for modeling mechanical properties. The representative hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)/dioctyladipate (DOA)/cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) system was used (81.4 w/w% of RDX and 18.6 w/w% of the amorphous HTPB/DOA phase, with a 60/40 ratio between the polymer and plasticizer). The HTPB chain was composed of 48 trans groups, 16 cis groups, and 16 vinyl groups. Due to the length of the chain, superposing the crystalline RDX cell [cleaved at the crystalline (2 0 0), (0 2 0), and (2 1 0) planes] to the amorphous HTPB/DOA cell introduced considerable void, and therefore resulted in low density-much more so than when using models with shorter chains. A compression/minimization iterative procedure was used to converge to the optimal density. Pair distributions were calculated to verify that the procedure did not lead to abnormal changes in the RDX crystal model. Comparable energies were obtained for models built with each cleavage plane, contrary to previous work with small molecules. Long chains have lower entropy and are less able to change conformations and maximize interactions with the crystal surface. Models with densities higher than the minimum value were shown to have energy stored in two main components; i.e., the internal energy was stored mainly in the bond and torsion contributions, whereas the external energy storage was performed by van der Waals interactions. These preliminary models show the potential for studying the sensitivity of explosives through molecular modeling. © 2013 by Begell House, Inc.","Energetic materials; HTPB; Plastic-bonded explosives; RDX; Sensitivity; Simulation and modeling","HTPB; Plastic bonded explosives; RDX; Sensitivity; Simulation and modeling; Biomechanics; Crystalline materials; Explosives; Mechanical properties; Molecular modeling; Van der Waals forces; Chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885221107

All calculations have been performed within the Perdew-Burke-Erzenhof functional as implemented in the SIESTA package, with a double-ζ plus polarization basis set. Several starting configurations were considered for interacting systems. The results show that the Li atom is strongly adsorbed on a pure graphene with a binding energy of about -0.85 eV. However, the binding energy enhances to -2.58 eV when Li binds to a PGNB at the hollow site above the center of the nonagon ring. It was found that the increase in binding is due to significant charge transfer from the Li to the PGNB. The stability of the Li/PGNB system was evaluated within ab initio molecular dynamics simulation which has been carried out at room temperature. The very favorable binding energy obtained as well as high specific surface of PGNB (due to attached fullerenes) suggest a considerable possibility to experimentally apprehend these novel systems as a superior media for Li ions storage. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The XRD analysis revealed that the deposited hydroxide has a pure brucite-like phase of Co(OH) 2 . Morphological characterization by SEM and TEM revealed that the prepared β-Co(OH) 2 is composed of well-dispersed ultrafine particles with size of about 5 nm. The energy storage ability of the prepared nanoparticles was studied by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests in 1 M KOH. The nanoparticles showed an excellent energy storage ability, where they delivered an energy density of 0.105 Wh/g with coulombic efficiency of 91.8%.

These conditions are unfavorable for proton transfer across ITIES because of positive Galvani potential difference.

There are two main types of adipose tissue: WAT (white adipose tissue) and BAT (brown adipose tissue). WAT from certain depots, in response to appropriate stimuli, can undergo a process known as browning where it takes on characteristics of BAT, notably the induction of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) expression and the presence of multilocular lipid droplets and multiple mitochondria. How browning is regulated is an intense topic of investigation as it has the potential to tilt the energy balance from storage to expenditure, a strategy that holds promise to combat the growing epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome. This review focuses on the transcriptional regulators as well as various proteins and secreted mediators that have been shown to play a role in browning. Emphasis is on describing how many of these factors exert their effects by regulating the three main transcriptional regulators of classical BAT development, namely PRDM16 (PR domain containing 16), PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ) and PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ coactivator 1α), which have been shown to be the key nodes in the regulation of inducible brown fat. © 2013 The Author(s).","Beige fat; Browning; Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ); Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor ? coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α); PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16); White adipocytes","cardiac natriuretic peptide; cyclooxygenase 2; fibroblast growth factor 21; insulin; microRNA; mitochondrial transcription factor A; natriuretic factor; nuclear receptor coactivator 2; osteogenic protein 1; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; PR domain containing 16; steroid receptor coactivator 1; transcription factor; transcription factor FOXC2; transcription factor T box 15; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; vanilloid receptor 4; hormone; transcription factor; adipogenesis; brown adipose tissue; browning; energy balance; energy expenditure; human; insulin sensitivity; metabolic syndrome X; mitochondrion; nonhuman; obesity; protein expression; protein function; protein secretion; review; tissue differentiation; tissue structure; transcription regulation; white adipose tissue; animal; cell transdifferentiation; cytology; gene expression regulation; lipid metabolism; physiology; Adipocytes, White; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Cell Transdifferentiation; Gene Expression Regulation; Hormones; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Transcription Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884840427

In this paper, we report a simple and facile exfoliation method for the production of a stable dispersion of high-quality graphene sheets using the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIBF4). Subsequently formed graphene papers exhibited the electrical conductivity value of 1800 S cm-1 in conducting graphene films after being air-dried. The suspensions of the exfoliated graphene were derived from crystalline graphite and found to be stable for more than one month. Successful intercalation of the ionic liquid between the graphite interlayers through liquid-state diffusion of imidazolium cations was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The chemical composition demonstrates that the exfoliated graphene sheets preserve their pristine properties without any degradation. To demonstrate the diverse functionality of the exfoliated graphene sheets, a graphene-based electromechanical actuator was constructed. The high-performance ""dry"" graphene-based actuator showed a large bending movement of up to 15 mm in the strip response to an applied bias voltage of 2 V under ambient conditions. The overall results indicate that this solution-based method can be a scalable and low-cost route to the mass production of high-quality graphene.

This paper reports a method to produce reversible Li-ion storage hosts as nanoparticles furnished with their own current collectors. The consequent decrease in interparticle electrical resistance enabled SnO2 to be used as a lithium-ion battery anode without conductive additives, even surpassing the rate performance of SnO2 with 10 wt % (typical value) carbon black conductive additive. The “current collector” in this case was a thin, conductive LiyTi1−yO2 shell on a core aggregated from SnO2 nanoparticles. Good electrical connectivity in the electrode was maintained even with the expansion and contraction of the Li-ion storage host during discharging and charging. The composite fabricated as such delivered a charge (delithiation) capacity of 743 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 in the first cycle and 518 mAh g−1 at the end of 30 cycles without conductive additives. The charge capacity after increasing the current density by a factor of five was similar: 735 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the first cycle and 505 mAh g−1 at the end of 30 cycles. Hence the design was effective in minimizing the capacity loss in cycling at high current densities. Impendence measurements indicated that the charge transfer resistance of the composite without conductive additives was even smaller than the charge transfer resistance of pristine SnO2 mixed with carbon black. The TiO2-coating method can therefore be an effective approach for the preparation of conductive additive-free high-power-density anode materials. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In regions with temperate climate drying of cereal grains can require approximately 60% of the total energy input during plant husbandry. In tropical regions, drying can be incomplete due to high air humidity and improper handling of the material, resulting in a risk for contamination with mycotoxine forming moulds or pathogenic microorganisms. Microbial enzyme activities on feed and activation of intrinsic enzymes in plant material stored wet, increase the bioavalability of minerals and nutrients. For instance phytases can decrease the phytate content. Phytate is the main phosphate storage molecule in plants. It is only partially degraded in non-ruminants, resulting in phosphate release and eutrophication of water environments. Phytate is also an antinutrient, binding minerals and proteins and its degradation will improve the bioavailability of those substances. Biopreservation biomass can also be a locally produced protein source, which can replace soya. Soya production is frequently associated with negative environmental and socioeconomic consequences, and its worldwide trading requires energy for transport and handling. Translocation of nutrients between countries also precludes nutrient recirculation on arable land. Biopreservation often relies on spontaneous microbial developments, thus storage stability, feed hygiene, palatability and nutritional value may vary depending on the microbial composition. Microbial populations in feed are often monitored by traditional plate counting methods, but species identification of isolates demonstrated substantial changes in microbial populations even when plate counting indicated a stable flora. From economical, environmental and animal welfare perspectives it is of great interest to obtain a stable and predictable microbial population in the feed, which can be achieved by developing starter cultures. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

As a result of the earlier formation of the Swiss Jura, potential relief energy in the piggy-back North Alpine Foreland Basin (NAFB) of northern central Switzerland south of the Jura fold belt was built up after 11-10 Ma. It was suddenly released by river capture at about 4.2 Ma when the Aare-Danube was captured by a tributary of the Rhône-Doubs river system which rooted southeast of the Black forest. This event triggered rapid denudation of weakly consolidated Molasse sediments, in the order of about 1 km, as constrained by apatite fission track data from drillholes in the NAFB. Likely mechanisms of river capture are (a) headward erosion of Rhône-Doubs tributaries, (b) uplift and rapidly increasing erosion of the Swiss Alps after about 5.3 Ma, and (c) gravel aggradation at the eastern termination of the Jura fold belt in the course of eastward and northward tilt of the piggy-back NAFB. A morphotectonic event between 4.2 and 2.5 Ma, probably at about 2.8 Ma, caused a phase of planation, accompanied by local gravel aggradation and temporary storage of Alpine debris. Between 2.8 and 2.5 Ma, the Aare-Rhône river system is cannibalised by the modern Rhine River, the latter later connecting with the Alpine Rhine River. © 2013 Swiss Geological Society.","Apatite fission track age dating; North Alpine foreland basin; Nuclear waste disposal; Sedimentation; Tectonic geomorphology; Uplift and erosion","aggradation; apatite; fission track dating; foreland basin; geomorphology; landscape evolution; paleosurface; Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary; uplift; Baden-Wurttemberg; Black Forest; Germany; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890611829

Despite these findings, it remains unclear whether changes in IMTG accumulation and metabolism per se influence muscle-specific and systemic metabolic homeostasis and insulin responsiveness. By mediating the rate-limiting step in triacylglycerol hydrolysis, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) has been proposed to influence the storage/production of deleterious as well as essential lipid metabolites. However, the physiological relevance of ATGL-mediated triacylglycerol hydrolysis in skeletal muscle remains unknown. To determine the contribution of IMTG hydrolysis to tissue-specific and systemic metabolic phenotypes in the context of obesity, we generated mice with targeted deletion or transgenic overexpression of ATGL exclusively in skeletal muscle. Despite dramatic changes in IMTG content on both chow and high-fat diets, modulation of ATGL-mediated IMTG hydrolysis did not significantly influence systemic energy, lipid, or glucose homeostasis, nor did it influence insulin responsiveness or mitochondrial function. These data argue against a role for altered IMTG accumulation and lipolysis in muscle insulin resistance and metabolic complications of obesity. © 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.",,"fat droplet; insulin; triacylglycerol; signal peptide; triacylglycerol; signal peptide; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; brown adipose tissue; caloric intake; cellular distribution; controlled study; energy balance; fat mass; fatty acid oxidation; female; gastrocnemius muscle; gene deletion; gene overexpression; glucose homeostasis; glucose tolerance test; heart muscle; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin tolerance test; lipid diet; lipid hydrolysis; lipid storage; lipid transport; lipolysis; metabolic disorder; mitochondrial respiration; mitochondrion; mouse; muscle mass; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; protein expression; skeletal muscle; adipose tissue; animal; energy metabolism; homeostasis; hydrolysis; insulin resistance; knockout mouse; lipid metabolism; metabolism; phenotype; phosphorylation; physiology; transgenic mouse; adipose tissue; metabolism; obesity; skeletal muscle; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Energy Metabolism; Homeostasis; Hydrolysis; Insulin Resistance; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Muscle, Skeletal; Obesity; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Triglycerides; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Energy Metabolism; Homeostasis; Hydrolysis; Insulin Resistance; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Muscle, Skeletal; Obesity; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888130465

High resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping showed the formation of a highly developed core-shell structure with uniform PPy coating on the surface of sulfur particles. The electrochemical properties of the resulting PPy@S composite cathode have been evaluated by cyclic voltammograms and galvanostatic discharge-charge cycling. The results show that the PPy@S composite exhibits a reversible capacity of 1,200 mAh g -1 at the initial cycle, with 913 mAh g-1 remaining after 50 cycles. Even up to 2.5 C, a reversible capacity of 437 mAh g-1 is obtained. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the conductive PPy-coating nanolayer, which provides both an effective electron conduction path and a strong physical and chemical confinement setting for elemental sulfur and resident polysulfides, minimizing the loss of active material during cycling. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Core-shell structure; Energy storage; Lithium/sulfur battery; Nanostructured sulfur cathode; Sulfur/polypyrrole composite","Cathodes; Coatings; Electric discharges; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Energy storage; Lithium batteries; Polypyrroles; Shells (structures); Core shell structure; Core-shell nanocomposites; Electrochemical performance; Galvanostatic discharge; In-situ polymerization; Lithium/sulfur batteries; Sulfur cathodes; Sulfur/polypyrrole composites; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; lithium; molecular layer; nanocomposite; polypyrrole coated sulfur nanocomposite; sulfur; unclassified drug; article; cyclic potentiometry; electric battery; electric conductivity; electrochemical analysis; electron; Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy; one pot synthesis; polymerization; priority journal; surface property; transmission electron microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887062326

Energy storage represents a promising solution to overcome this obstacle. Among energy storage solutions, pumped hydro energy storage is largely considered the most technologically and financially feasible, though having some drawbacks. In this paper, a new design is introduced to address the major challenges associated with the conventional pumped hydro energy storage. The proposed storage solution does not require tall water tank towers or long piping; rendering it more cost effective and implementable. It is also scalable to operate over a wide range of capacities depending on the electrical surpluses. Beyond this, the design provides a constant pressure and faster discharge, furnishing a quick response to instantaneous demand fluctuations. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Energy storage; Hydraulic lifting; Pumped hydro","Constant pressures; Cost effective; Demand fluctuations; Electrical market; Pumped hydro; Pumped-hydro energy storages; Renewable energy source; Storage solutions; Renewable energy resources; Water tanks; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886422935

In terms of the charge carriers transport through the electrolyte microstructure, AC impedance spectroscopy has been applied to address useful concerns about the transport properties over electrolytic and mixed conduction regimes. The impedance spectra at lower temperature and oxygen partial pressure show the electrochemical response of separated bulk and grain boundary contributions. The increase in the electronic conductivity from 250 to 400 C shows that the electrochemical reduction Ce4+/Ce3+ is as kinetic as thermodynamically favorable in the experimental conditions. In a typical Nyquist plot of an impedance diagram, until temperatures as low as 400 C, the high and low frequency arcs can be accessed and the influence of reducing atmosphere over both the components is presented. The apparent activation energy for the electronic process (ΔE) extracted from the total conductivity is 2.54 eV. Distinguished bulk (2.34 eV) and grain boundary (2.63 eV) activation energies point the latter as an energetic barrier in the redox reaction. The oxygen partial pressure dependence of individual capacitances suggests storage of electrical charge along grain boundaries which can potentially behave as a chemical capacitor. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Defect chemistry; Doped ceria electrolyte; Impedance spectroscopy; Mixed conduction","Ac impedance spectroscopy; Apparent activation energy; Defect chemistry; Doped ceria electrolytes; Electrochemical behaviors; Electrochemical reductions; Impedance spectroscopy; Mixed conduction; Activation energy; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Partial pressure; Positive ions; Redox reactions; Spectroscopy; Transport properties; Grain boundaries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886092307

However, it remains challenging to materialise the VGNS-based supercapacitors due to their poor specific capacitance, high temperature processing, poor binding to electrode support materials, uncontrollable microstructure, and non-cost effective way of fabrication. Here we use a single-step, fast, scalable, and environmentally-benign plasma-enabled method to fabricate VGNS using cheap and spreadable natural fatty precursor butter, and demonstrate the controllability over the degree of graphitization and the density of VGNS edge planes. Our VGNS employed as binder-free supercapacitor electrodes exhibit high specific capacitance up to 230 F g-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 and &gt;99% capacitance retention after 1,500 charge-discharge cycles at a high current density, when the optimum combination of graphitic structure and edge plane effects is utilised. The energy storage performance can be further enhanced by forming stable hybrid MnO 2/VGNS nano-architectures which synergistically combine the advantages from both VGNS and MnO2. This deterministic and plasma-unique way of fabricating VGNS may open a new avenue for producing functional nanomaterials for advanced energy storage devices.

Mathematical models for predicting the power outputs of the PV and FC systems are presented. The results reported include the PV output and the shares attributable to the battery and the SOFC in supplying the electrical demand. Moreover, to study the performance of the hybrid system in supplying the daily demand, results are presented for two typical days in summer and winter. An exergoeconomic analysis is performed to determine the electricity unit cost over the system lifetime. The PV-electrolyzer system is not able to produce a sufficient amount of hydrogen during winter days, so seasonal hydrogen storage is required to feed the FC. Power penetrations of the PV and the battery systems are at maxima during the summer months, while the penetration of the FC system reaches 67% in January and December. Due to its low efficiency (16%), the maximum exergy destruction occurs in the PV modules (86%). The unit cost of electricity varies on a monthly basis, reaching a minimum of 0.26 kWh -1 in July and a maximum of 1.8 kWh-1 in January and December. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

The anthropogenic heat flux and horizontal net heat advection were not considered. The parameterisation method, based on the objective hysteresis model, used net all-wave radiation and land use information inferred from a 1-km radius area centred at the main observational site. Using the residual balance method, the maximum diurnal evolution in monthly average hourly values of energy flux storage occurred approximately 2. h earlier than the net all-wave radiation. Using the parameterisation method to estimate energy flux storage, the daytime integrated values correspondedto approximately 51% of the net all-wave radiation and daily values to approximately 27%.

It is found that the Si atom is strongly adsorbed at the bridge site of the C-C bond with binding energy of about -26.75 kcal/mol. We show that Si decorating turns Si:graphene complex into an electron-deficient system and significantly enhances the Li-storage capacity on the graphene. The obtained results indicate that up to eight Li-ions being adsorbed onto the Si-decorated graphene can form the stable complex. It is found, interestingly, that two Si atoms coated onto double-side of the graphene can strongly adsorb sixteen Li-ions. The analyses of electronic structures show a strong interaction between Li-ions and Si-decorated graphene leading to a high exothermicity. The stability of the sixteen Li-ions adsorbed on the Si:graphene system was evaluated with ab initio molecular dynamics simulation which have been carried out at room temperature.

However, several biomechanical and physiological factors are involved. This article provides an overview of muscle and tendon properties and how these interact during vertical hopping. Muscle properties discussed are force-velocity and force-length relationships, electromechanical delay, muscle fiber type, stretch induced contraction amplification, and muscle spindle afferent feedback. Tendon properties include storage and reuse of elastic energy, tendon stiffness, afferent information from Golgi tendon organs, and failure points. These muscle and tendon properties interact to generate vertical hopping force and power. In addition to these basic properties, there are other more complicated factors to consider when analyzing vertical hopping such as balance and coordination. A wealth of information can be gathered by studying vertical hopping. Caution should be taken, however, to prevent inappropriate conclusions being drawn about hop performance due to oversimplification. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"biomechanics; elasticity; electromyography; human; joint; leg; movement (physiology); muscle contraction; physiology; review; skeletal muscle; tendon; Biomechanical Phenomena; Elasticity; Electromyography; Humans; Joints; Lower Extremity; Movement; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Tendons",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885010921

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting University hospital outpatient clinic. Patient(s) Sixty-one women with PCOS and 44 nonhirsute women with ovulatory cycles. Intervention(s) Metabolic work-up, biochemical and hormonal assays, assessment of body composition and rest metabolic rate, physical activity (pedometer), and food consumption (food frequency questionnaire). Main outcome measure(s) GI, glycemic load, dietary intake, and hormone and metabolic profile in PCOS versus control and in PCOS women stratified by tertiles of GI and PCOS phenotype. Result(s) Mean age was 23.7 ± 6.3 years. Participants with PCOS had higher body fat percentage, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, lipid accumulation product, and androgen levels compared with control women. PCOS and control women in the highest tertile of GI had higher body mass index and waist circumference than those in the lowest tertile. Dietary GI was higher in the classic PCOS group. Obesity and this more severe PCOS phenotype explained 28.3% of variance in dietary GI. Conclusion(s) Dietary GI is increased in the classic PCOS phenotype and associated with a less favorable anthropometric and metabolic profile. Obesity and classic PCOS phenotype are age-independent predictors of higher dietary GI.

The impregnation method was done to prepare shape stabilized PCM with GNPs for three different specific surface areas of 300, 500 and 750 m2/g. The maximum mass percentage of PA absorbed by GNPs was 91.94 wt% without leakage of PA in molten state as proven by dropping point test. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FT-IR) were applied to determine microstructure and chemical structure of palmitic acid (PA)/GNPs composites, respectively. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) test was done to investigate thermal properties which include melting and solidification temperatures and latent heats. The thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) results show that thermal stability of PA was increased by using GPNs. The thermal reliability and chemical stability of composite PCM were determined by cycling test for 2500 cycles of melting and freezing. The improvement of thermal conductivity was calculated to be 10 times that of the PA. As a result, due to their acceptable thermal properties, good thermal reliability, chemical stability and great thermal conductivities, we can consider the prepared shape-stabilized composites as highly conductive PCMs for thermal energy storage applications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, to understand the reproductive processes, including those of the oviparous dermatophagic species, it is important to know the dynamics of storage and mobilization of energetic substrates to gonads and skin during the reproductive cycle of males and females, as well as the endocrine control associated. For the present study, total lipids and proteins were measured during the annual cycle in the plasma, liver, muscle, testes, ovaries and skin of Siphonops annulatus in captivity. Plasma levels of gonadal steroids (estradiol, testosterone and progesterone) were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Histological analyses of ovaries and testes were performed to classify the maturation stages of the animals during the reproductive cycle. Gonadal maturation in males and females of S. annulatus was accompanied by metabolic changes in reserve tissues, which supported gonadal development and prepared the females' epidermis for skin feeding by the offspring. Even in confinement conditions, females and males synchronized the reproductive period. However, due to the absence of environmental cues in captivity inadequate levels of the hormones responsible for gamete release were triggered, leading to a lack of reproductive success. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","Dermatophagy; Gonadal steroids; Reproductive cycle; Siphonops annulatus; Skin feeding","Amphibia; Animalia; Gymnophiona; Siphonops annulatus; protein; sex hormone; Amphibia; animal; article; blood; body weight; Dermatophagy; energy metabolism; female; gonad; Gonadal steroids; lipid metabolism; male; metabolism; ovary cycle; reproduction; sexual maturation; Siphonops annulatus; skin; Skin feeding; Dermatophagy; Gonadal steroids; Reproductive cycle; Siphonops annulatus; Skin feeding; Amphibians; Animals; Body Weight; Energy Metabolism; Female; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Gonads; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Proteins; Reproduction; Sexual Maturation; Skin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884592499

Here we review the metabolomic data for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), hepatitis B and C, cholecystitis, cholestasis, liver transplantation, and acute hepatotoxicity in animal models. A metabolomic window has permitted a view into the changing biochemistry occurring in the transitional phases between a healthy liver and hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma. Whether provoked by obesity and diabetes, alcohol use or oncogenic viruses, the liver develops a core metabolomic phenotype (CMP) that involves dysregulation of bile acid and phospholipid homeostasis. The CMP commences at the transition between the healthy liver (Phase 0) and NAFLD/NASH, ALD or viral hepatitis (Phase 1). This CMP is maintained in the presence or absence of cirrhosis (Phase 2) and whether or not either HCC or CCA (Phase 3) develops. Inflammatory signalling in the liver triggers the appearance of the CMP. Many other metabolomic markers distinguish between Phases 0, 1, 2 and 3. A metabolic remodelling in HCC has been described but metabolomic data from all four Phases demonstrate that the Warburg shift from mitochondrial respiration to cytosolic glycolysis foreshadows HCC and may occur as early as Phase 1. The metabolic remodelling also involves an upregulation of fatty acid β-oxidation, also beginning in Phase 1. The storage of triglycerides in fatty liver provides high energy-yielding substrates for Phases 2 and 3 of liver pathology. The metabolomic window into hepatobiliary disease sheds new light on the systems pathology of the liver. © 2013 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Caustic (NaOH) can be generated in-situ from sewage using a divided electrochemical cell, which avoids the need for transport, handling and storage of concentrated caustic solutions. In this study, we investigated the impact of caustic strength in the cathode compartment and the impact of sodium concentration in sewage on the Coulombic efficiency (CE) for caustic generation. The CE was found to be independent of the caustic strength produced in the range of up to ~3wt%. Results showed that a caustic solution of ~3wt% could be produced directly from sewage at a CE of up to 75±0.5%. The sodium concentration in sewage had a significant impact on the CE for caustic generation as well as on the energy requirements of the system, with a higher sodium concentration leading to a higher CE and lower energy consumption. The proton, calcium, magnesium and ammonium concentrations in sewage affected the CE for caustic generation, especially at low sodium concentrations. Economical assessment based on the experimental results indicated that sulfide control in sewers using electrochemically-generated caustic from sewage is an economically attractive strategy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Caustic; Corrosion; Electrochemical; Sewer; Sulfide; Wastewater","Corrosion; Electrochemical corrosion; Energy utilization; Impact strength; Sewers; Sodium; Sodium hydroxide; Sulfur compounds; Wastewater; Ammonium concentrations; Attractive strategies; Caustic; Coulombic efficiency; Economical assessments; Electrochemical; Energy requirements; Sulfide; Sewage; ammonia; calcium; caustic agent; hydrogen sulfide; magnesium; proton; sodium; biofilm; chemical composition; concentration (composition); corrosion; electrochemical method; electrode; energy conservation; experimental study; hydrogen sulfide; pH; sewage; sodium; sulfide; water industry; article; biochemical composition; controlled study; energy consumption; membrane transport; pH; priority journal; sewage; storage; strength; Caustic; Corrosion; Electrochemical; Sewer; Sulfide; Wastewater; Sewage; Sulfides; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884411557

Atherosclerosis is the major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease based on arterial endothelial dysfunction caused by the impairment of endothelial-dependent dilation. Atherosclerosis is a complex vascular disease resulted from the harmful interactions between genetic and environmental factors. There is a growing body of evidence in support of a non-redundant role of mitochondrial factors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Impaired mitochondrial function and structural and qualitative changes in mitochondrial components such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may be directly involved in the development of multiple atherogenic mechanisms including advanced oxidative stress, abnormalities in glucose and fat metabolism, and altered energy homeostasis. Recent findings showed that the heteroplasmy level of some somatic mtDNA is associated with coronary atherosclerosis. Although this field should further widely elaborated, heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations could represent a new promising molecular biomarker of genetic susceptibility to atherosclerosis and related pathologic conditions. In this review, we critically consider the contribution of mitochondria-related factors to the pathogenesis of the arterial vascular pathology. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Atherogenesis; Atherosclerosis; Cell functions; Heteroplasmy; Mitochondrial DNA; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Mutations; Oxidative stress","adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; apoptosis inducing factor; cytochrome b; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; mitochondrial DNA; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase 1; nuclear respiratory factor 1; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1beta; protein Bak; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase; RNA 12S; succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); superoxide dismutase; transfer RNA; ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; adipocyte; apoptosis; atherosclerosis; calcium signaling; cardiovascular risk; carotid atherosclerosis; chromatin structure; coronary artery disease; DNA damage; dyslipidemia; electron microscopy; genetic polymorphism; genetic transcription; glucose metabolism; heteroplasmy; homeostasis; human; intron; Leigh disease; leukocyte; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; macrophage; membrane permeability; mitochondrial DNA depletion; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial membrane; mitochondrial outer membrane permeability; mitochondrion; mutational analysis; NARP syndrome; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; review; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; smoking; somatic mutation; wild type; Animals; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Atherosclerosis; Biomedical Research; DNA, Mitochondrial; Gene-Environment Interaction; Humans; Mitochondria; Mutation; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884218330

This unit consumes minimal energy and is available at an optimal cost. This minimal consumption system uses newly developed white light or Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). These types of diodes have p- n junction and the voltage drop across the junction is around 3 Volts. So the batteries used in such illumination devices also have approximately 3 Volts. The utility of such devices (LED based) has increased in recent times because these are replacing kerosene lanterns in many countries around the world. The governments in such countries are reducing or eliminating the subsidies on kerosene, diesel etc (fossil fuels) due to a continued high price of crude oil. The challenge with the 3 Volt batteries is that their ratio of cost / total charge holding capacity is very high. They also pose problems with their disposal and repair.

While repeated soil tillage is a fundamental part of the integrated control of these species, it is highly energy consuming and inefficient during periods when little sprout regrowth occurs. Substituting cultivation with mowing will reduce the environmental impact and labour costs, but its efficiency will still depend on the capacity of plants to sprout. Therefore, we studied the seasonal pattern in emergence and rhizome biomass allocation from July to April in six populations for each of the species. Plants were grown outdoors in pots buried in soil and exhumed at regular intervals in a two-year experiment. In all three species, biomass allocation to rhizomes continued until late in the autumn. Emergence was severely impaired in E. arvense and T. farfara in September-October, while in E. repens, there was no such reduction in the number of emerged shoots. However, in the latter species, the shoot/rhizome ratio decreased and remained low until the plants had been exposed to a period of low temperatures. The increase in shoot/rhizome ratio for E. repens coincided with the resumed capacity to emerge for E. arvense and T. farfara. These results imply that there is no need to repeat a defoliation of E. arvense and T. farfara, if carried out in September-October. However, removal of the aerial plant parts early in the autumn is important to interrupt the upload of storage compounds to the rhizome systems of all species. © 2013 European Weed Research Society.","Coltsfoot; Common couch; Endodormancy; Field horsetail; Vegetative reproduction; Weed biology","autumn; biomass allocation; cultivation; defoliation; emergence; environmental impact; mowing; rhizome; seasonal variation; soil; tillage; vegetative reproduction; weed; Elymus repens; Equisetum; Equisetum arvense; Tussilago; Tussilago farfara",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883446034

Nonetheless, it is not yet commercially viable on a large scale, and its inclusion into countries' energy planning agendas depends on realistic assessments of its emission reduction benefits. The use of CCS leads to energy penalties resulting from direct consumption of additional energy, and results in indirect CO2 equivalent emissions outside plant boundaries, due to both energy consumption and leakages. Accounting for these emissions allows for an evaluation of the mitigation benefits of CCS. This study performs a life-cycle assessment (LCA), with and without CCS, for a coal-fired power plant located in Brazil. Findings show that when indirect emissions are taken into account, a plant which captures 90% of its CO2 will have its CO2 equivalent emissions capture potential, based on a global warming potential metric with a 100-year time horizon, reduced to 72%. The advantage of the use of carbon capture towards climate change mitigation is reduced mainly as a result of an increase in CH4 emissions, significant in the coal-mining stage, an effect which is only taken into account when a LCA is performed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Coal-fired power plant with carbon capture; Emissions reduction; Life-cycle assessment","Carbon capture and storage; Climate change mitigation; Coal-fired power plant; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Energy penalties; Global warming potential; Life-cycle assessments; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Mining; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; coal-fired power plant; environmental assessment; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881664529

This study uses a multi-objective planning method to minimize the cost of power generation and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by decreasing the dual objective of building the power supply scheduling model and the target year. This is conducted according to simulations of future carbon emission reduction policies for the scheduling of power supply situations. The results show that nuclear units will be able to reduce the power generation electricity costs and carbon dioxide emissions effectively; renewable energy has excellent potential to reduce emissions, and the cost of solar power technology with high fossil fuel prices will gradually enhance its cost competitiveness. Gas, although the cleanest fossil fuel, cannot be underestimated for its carbon dioxide emissions. As fossil fuel prices increase, gas will gradually experience a reduction in carbon reduction benefits; integrated gasification combined cycle with carbon capture and storage technology will replace part of the oil and gas power generation, and in addition to the reduction of carbon dioxide and costs, will achieve the goal. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 emission reduction benefit; Multi-objective planning; Power supply planning","Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emission reductions; Emission reduction; Integrated gasification combined cycle; Multi-objective planning; Power supply; Solar power technologies; Carbon dioxide; Cost accounting; Electric power generation; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Planning; Scheduling; Solar energy; Cost reduction; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; computer simulation; emission control; energy planning; energy policy; fossil fuel; power generation; renewable resource; solar power; transaction cost; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881660163

The 3D reference configuration of CCNTs is determined based on a 2D graphene layer using conformal mapping. Three sets of analyses are performed to fully describe the mechanical response of (n, n) CCNTs under elongation up to the bond breaking point and compression down to the solid length or the onset of buckling instability. First, the strain dependency of the mechanical properties of individual CCNTs during deformation is investigated by calculating the stress-strain curve and the spring constant of the CCNTs for the entire load range. Significant responses including brittle fracture under tension and buckling instability under compression are observed. Second, to examine the size dependence of the mechanical properties, several CCNTs with different geometric parameters are constructed, and their spring constant, fracture strain, fracture load, and energy storage density are determined. All CCNTs exhibit a superelasticity of 50-66%. A comparison between the mechanical properties of CCNTs and those of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) reveals that the fracture load and energy storage per atom of CCNTs is lower than that of the corresponding armchair CNTs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Coiled carbon nanotube; Fracture; Molecular dynamics finite element method (MDFEM); Nonlinear analysis","Axial deformations; Bond-breaking points; Buckling instabilities; Coiled carbon nanotube; Energy storage density; Mechanical response; Spring constants; Strain dependencies; Brittle fracture; Carbon nanotubes; Conformal mapping; Deformation; Density (specific gravity); Energy storage; Finite element method; Fracture; Nonlinear analysis; Springs (components); Strain; Stress-strain curves; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881227704

VDR null mice exhibit enhanced energy expenditure and reduced adiposity even when fed high fat diets. Adipocyte-specific transgenic-expression of human VDR in mice enhances adipose tissue mass, indicating that VDR activation in adipocytes enhances lipid storage in vivo. In these studies, we conducted genomic profiling and differentiation assays in primary cultures of human adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells to define the role of the VDR and its ligand 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) in adipogenesis. In the presence of adipogenic media, 1,25D promoted lipid accumulation and enhanced the expression of FABP4, FASN, and PPARγ. Mesenchymal cells derived from 6-month old VDR null mice exhibited impaired adipogenesis ex vivo but differentiation was restored by stable expression of human VDR. STEAP4, a gene that encodes a metalloreductase linked to obesity, insulin sensitivity, metabolic homeostasis and inflammation, was highly induced in human adipose cells differentiated in the presence of 1,25D but was minimally affected by 1,25D in undifferentiated precursors.

Static compression of materials may result in significant changes in the structures, properties and performance that are important for hydrogen storage applications, and often lead to the formation of unprecedented phases or complexes that have profound implications for hydrogen storage. In this perspective article, 22 types of representative potential hydrogen storage materials that belong to four major classes - simple hydride, complex hydride, chemical hydride and hydrogen containing materials - were reviewed. In particular, their structures, stabilities, and pressure-induced transformations, which were reported in recent experimental works together with supporting theoretical studies, were provided.

The effects of Ziprasidone, an atypical antipsychotic, on metabolic syndrome has yet to be evaluated. Here in, we evaluated lipid accumulation and behavioral changes in a new experimental model, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Behavioral parameters in the worms were evaluated 24 h after Ziprasidone treatment. Subsequently, lipid accumulation was examined using Nile red, LipidTox green and BODIPY labeling. Ziprasidone at 40 μM for 24 h effectively decreased the fluorescence labeling of all markers in intestinal cells of C. elegans compared to control (0.16% dimethyl sulfoxide). Ziprasidone did not alter behaviors related to energetic balance, such as pharynx pumping, defecation cycles and movement. There was, however, a reduction in egg-production, egg-laying and body-length in nematodes exposed to Ziprasidone without any changes in the progression of larval stages. The serotoninergic pathway did not appear to modulate Ziprasidone's effects on Nile red fluorescence. Additionally, Ziprasidone did not alter lipid accumulation in daf-16 or crh-1 deletion mutants (orthologous of the transcription factors DAF-16 and CREB, respectively). These results suggest that Ziprasidone alters reproductive behavior, morphology and lipid reserves in the intestinal cells of C. elegans.

Design/methodology/approach - The problem is addressed by two complementary approaches. First, numerical simulations based on an asymptotic approximation derived from the Smoluchowski theory are used to calculate the pore generation, growth and size evolution at the membrane of a spherical cell model, immersed in a suspension medium and consisting of cytoplasm and membrane. The numerical calculations are solved using the finite difference method. Second, an in vitro experiment with LLC-MK2 cells is carried out in which electroporation was monitored with molecules of propidium iodide. This part also comprehended the design and manufacturing of a portable electric pulse generator capable of providing rectangular pulses with amplitude of 1,000?V and duration in the range of 1-μs to 100-μs. The pulse generator is composed of three modules: a high voltage DC source, a control module, and an energy storage and high voltage switching. Findings - The numerical simulations considered a 5-μm radius cell submitted to a 500?kV/m rectangular electric pulse for 1-μs. The results indicate the formation of around 3,500 pores at the cell membrane, most of them, around 950, located at the poles of the cell aligned to the applied electric pulse, with radii sizes varying from 0.5-nm to 13-nm. The in vitro experiment considered exposition of LLC-MK2 cells to pulses of 200 V, 500 V, and 700 V, and 1-μs. Images from fluorescence microscopy exhibit the LLC-MK2 cells with intense red, a strong evidence of the electroporation. Originality/value - The work presents a thorough study of the electroporation phenomenon combining two complementary approaches, a rigorous numerical simulation and a detailed in vitro experiment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Electric fields; Electroporation; Finite difference methods","Asymptotic approximation; Design/methodology/approach; Electroporation; High voltage DC sources; High-voltage switching; Numerical calculation; Rectangular pulse; Suspension medium; Cell membranes; Computer simulation; Electric fields; Electricity; Experiments; Finite difference method; Fluorescence microscopy; Numerical models; Pulse generators; Cytology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884151183

Because it is less polluting and constitutes a source of renewable energy, biodiesel has an important role in the fuel sector. The biodiesel by itself or mixed in different proportions with diesel can replace the diesel oil whether in automotive engines (trucks, tractors, vans, cars) or in stationary engines (electricity or heat generators). However, data on the corrosion of metals when in contact with biodiesel/diesel blends as well as information about the influence of the metallic corrosion products in biodiesel/diesel blends quality are still poorly understood. Therefore, the objective of this work was to study the compatibility between biodiesel/diesel blends and different metallic materials with focus on the blend quality and on the integrity of facilities used during transportation and storage.

Different types of phase change materials (PCMs) along with the different geometries of TES system have been investigated for this application. In this work, a theoretical model was used to analyse the TES system for air cooling-heating application. The heat transfer phenomena in a phase change material (PCM) outside a double wall circular tube with heat transfer fluid (HTF) as air inside the tube were studied. Potassium fluoride tetrahydrate was used as a PCM for the TES system. Laminar forced convection with varying wall temperature was considered to analyse this system. Here, some important design parameters like inner radius and thickness of the tube for HTF flow were also investigated. It was found that an optimum inner radius and thickness of the tube should be considered to design a TES system. Since, significant change in outlet air temperature from the system was observed for reducing inner radius and increasing the thickness of the tube. The coefficients of performances (COPs) for cooling were found 8.79 and 7.20 for 15 mm and 25 mm inner radiuses of the PCM container respectively. Hence, the system can be optimized by reducing the volume of the PCM container. Furthermore, better COP was observed for higher inlet air temperature while the outlet air temperature was almost identical. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Air heating and cooling; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage","Air heating; Alternative solutions; Building energy consumption; Coefficients of performance; Inlet air temperatures; Laminar forced convections; Thermal energy storage systems; Varying wall temperature; Atmospheric temperature; Containers; Cooling; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Heating; Phase change materials; Thermal energy; Walls (structural partitions); Tubes (components)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883860251

We report double perovskites (Ln0.5Ba0.5)CoO3 δ (Ln = Pr, Sm, Gd and Ho) as a family of highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction upon water oxidation in alkaline solution. These double perovskites are stable unlike pseudocubic perovskites with comparable activities such as Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O 3-δ which readily amorphize during the oxygen evolution reaction. The high activity and stability of these double perovskites can be explained by having the O p-band centre neither too close nor too far from the Fermi level, which is computed from ab initio studies. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Graphene oxides and reduced graphenes are typically prepared by oxidizing graphite in strong mineral acid mixtures with chlorate (Staudenmaier, Hofmann) or permanganate (Hummers, Tour) oxidants. Herein, we reveal that graphene oxides pose inherent electrochemistry, that is, they can be oxidized or reduced at relatively mild potentials (within the range ±1a V) that are lower than typical battery potentials. This inherent electrochemistry of graphene differs dramatically from that of the used oxidants. Graphene oxides prepared using chlorate exhibit chemically irreversible reductions, whereas graphene oxides prepared through permanganate-based methods exhibit very unusual inherent chemically reversible electrochemistry of oxygen-containing groups. Insight into the electrochemical behaviour was obtained through cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. Our findings are of extreme importance for the electrochemistry community as they reveal that electrode materials undergo cyclic changes in charge/discharge cycles, which has strong implications for energy-storage and sensing devices. Electrochemical devices: Graphene oxides prepared with different oxidants show distinct electrochemistry; those prepared using chlorate exhibit chemically irreversible reductions, whereas graphene oxides prepared through permanganate-based methods exhibit very unusual inherent chemically reversible electrochemistry of their oxygen-containing groups (see figure).

During validation of the model, discrepancies between the forecasted and observed electricity demand profiles were observed. To overcome forecast model limitations, future work will involve more precise clustering of demand profiles according to additional temporal and environmental variables.

They are emerging the market with rapid pace and very soon the supporting equipment will be necessary. As a part of that, the EV charging stations are maybe the most important ring in the chain of complete transportation system's replacement. The EV PV public charging station is conceived as a contactless power transfer post that will be located in the parking areas of large shopping centers, touristic sites, sports venues, airports, etc. With its most important difference from on-road high-power charging station, this type of system will provide only partial charging of the EV's energy storage system (ESS), for example, 30% of the battery capacity during one to two hours period. The station will be equipped with energy storage system consisting of serial-parallel bank of Li-Ion batteries. It will be supplied by PV system and a grid interface. The power transfer from the station to the EV will be conducted through Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) system, consisting of resonant converter and air-core transformer (ACT). The IPT may be the most convenient way for EV charging. It has many advantages, including the convenience of being cordless and the safety during the charging. Most of the problems connected to plugging the charging plug are eliminated (possible sparking and mechanical damage of the electrical contacts). However, the IPT must be designed as high efficient system where several important issues must be considered: large air gap, good tolerance to misalignment, safe electromagnetic radiation and system's compactness. The project will be basic (generic) approach how the EV public charging stations should be designed. The assessment of the system elements according to the pre-determined parameters will be confirmed by its layout design and simulation. They will be the source for determining the system efficiency and cost during standard conditions of exploitation. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Air-core transformers; Contactless power transfer; Energy storage systems; Environmental concerns; Hybrid-electric vehicles; Inductive power transfer; Inductive powertransfer (IPT); Transportation system; Computer simulation; Electric utilities; Electromagnetic waves; Energy storage; Exhibitions; Hybrid vehicles; Power electronics; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883711414

Commercial ventures in the development of Energy Management Systems are also reviewed. As microgrids become more prevalent, scenarios where multiple microgrids operate in a coordinated fashion may arise. We also review the literature on operation and control of multiple microgrids. © 2013 IEEE.","Energy Management; Energy Storage; Microgrid; Multi Microgrids; Network of Microgrids; Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Smart Grid","Economically viable; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy storage technologies; Micro grid; Multi micro-grids; Operation and control; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Smart grid; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Exhibitions; Power electronics; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883674568

Mapping and scheduling of these applications on an MPSoC to minimize energy consumption while guaranteeing to satisfy the performance requirement is an NP-hard problem. This is coupled with the run-time variability associated with MPSoC resource availability due to the occurrence of faults. The existing studies on fault-tolerance and energy minimization are either based on static (offline) analysis which fails to capture application dynamism or do not consider throughput degradation. This paper proposes an execution trace-based run-time technique to reconfigure application mapping to minimize communication energy of an application, simultaneously dealing with the occurrence of transient, intermittent and permanent faults. Experiments conducted with synthetic and real-life applications modeled using Synchronous Data Flow Graphs (SDFGs) demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves significant improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of throughput and storage overhead with less than 10% energy overhead. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Dynamic re-configuration; Multiprocessor systems on chips; Performance requirements; Real-life applications; Resource availability; State-of-the-art approach; Synchronous data flow graphs; Throughput degradation; Computational complexity; Dynamic models; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Fault tolerance; Microprocessor chips; Multiprocessing systems; Communication",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883669232

This situation is to be achieved mostly by an installation of renewable energy technologies, storage systems, and improved insulations. As a result, the capital cost of these building systems and thus the potential for optimization will grow significantly. In addition, on the electric supply side, a smart grid with time-varying electricity tariffs may be established. These two directions of impact offer the opportunity to optimize the interactions between the so-called smart building and the distribution grid. Due to the stringent requirements for such future building systems, their complexity of design and control will increase inevitably. Therefore, in this paper a design framework for the optimal selection and sizing of a smart building system is presented. Various building services such as thermal and electrical storages, heating and cooling systems, and renewable energy sources are modeled and implemented using mixed-integer linear programming techniques. In order to enable a reasonable comparison of various configurations, optimal operating strategies are computed in parallel.

Results indicated that students' intentions to use bioenergy were mostly guided by their perceptions of the socio-environmental aspects related to bioenergy.

Environmental issues like climate change, global warming and Green House Gases (GHGs) and also social issues like dramatic increase in global population and increasing energy demand are the main causes of global concerns about energy resource management. In this regard, Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) are the suitable substitution to replace the conventional generating units that emit GHGs due to the use of fossil fuels. Among all RESs, wind energy seems to be promising for generating emission-free electrical energy. However, it is naturally unpredictable due to its intermittency which leads to some technical problems such as generation imbalance as well as optimal reserve allocation.

On the one hand, supply voltage scaling down to the near-threshold (near-VT) or even to the sub-threshold (sub-VT) domain is a commonly used, efficient technique to reduce both leakage power and active energy dissipation. On the other hand, emerging CMOS-compatible device technologies such as Resistive Memories (ReRAMs) enable non-volatile, on-chip data storage and zero-leakage sleep periods. For the first time, we present a ReRAM-based non-volatile flip-flop which is optimized for sub-VT operation. Writing to the ReRAM devices works with a CMOS-compatible supply voltage. Thanks to near-VT and sub-VT operation and as compared to the write energy, which depends on the ReRAM technology, the read consumes only 5.4% of the total read+write energy. Monte Carlo simulations accounting for parametric variations in both the MOS transistors and the ReRAM devices confirm reliable data restore operation from the ReRAM devices at a sub-VT voltage as low as 400 mV, and a standard deviation of up to 5% of the nominal value of the ReRAM resistance. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Device technologies; Non-volatile flip-flops; Parametric variation; Pipeline registers; Resistive memory; Standard deviation; Supply-voltage scaling; Systems on chips; Energy dissipation; Flip flop circuits; Monte Carlo methods; MOS devices; Threshold voltage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883471343

It was determined that different models were necessary to fit the hydrogen desorption data collected at different temperatures on the same sample, indicating that desorption mechanisms changed with respect to temperature. Addition of (9Ni-2Mg-Y) alloy as a catalyst to MgH2 increased the hydrogen desorption capacity of MgH2 from zero (for as-received MgH2) to about 5 wt% at 350 C within 500 s. The activation energy value was determined as 187 kJ/mol H2 for the as-received MgH 2, 137 kJ/mol H2 for 20 h ball milled MgH2, and 62 kJ/mol H2 for 20 h ball milled MgH2-10 wt% (9Ni-2Mg-Y) nano-composite by the Arrhenius and Kissinger methods.

The all electron full potential linear augmented plane wave method was employed. The local density approximation (LDA), the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the Engle Vosko generalize gradient approximation (EVGGA) were used to treat the exchange-correlation potential. The calculations show that the MgH2 compound is indirect gap semiconductor as the conduction band minimum (CBM) situated at R point of the Brillouin zone (BZ), while the valence band maximum (VBM) located between Λ and Γ points of the BZ, whereas LiH is a direct gap material as the CBM and the VBM located at X point of BZ. The values of the calculated energy band gap of MgH2 (LiH) compounds are 3.372 (2.769), 3.735 (3.067) and 5.104 (4.488) eV for LDA, GGA, and EVGGA, respectively. From the partial density of states and the electronic charge density in (0 0 1) and (1 0 1) crystallographic planes we conclude that there exists strong ionic bonds. The bond lengths were calculated and compared with the available experimental and theoretical results, our results show better agreement with the experimental values than the other theoretical results. The frequency dependent dielectric function's dispersions were calculated and analyzed so as to obtain further insight into the electronic structure.

Commercial production utilizing Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) commenced in 1985. By the end of 2010 over 159x106 m3 (1 billion barrels) of bitumen had been produced. The Cold Lake Heavy Oil field currently produces approximately 24,000 m3/d (150,000 barrels per day). The geological models and concepts that supported early production were based on well log and core data only. Early use of 2D scismic data showed limited utility for imaging the high net-To-gross reservoir. However, the advent of high-resolution 3D and 4D seismic in the early 1990's provided renewed interest in seismic data for imaging thermal processes. These early ""4D"" surveys were small in area but provided data critical for imaging the steam heated regions (thermal conformance) in the reservoir and managing follow-up drilling and completion strategies. Recent advances in 3D and 4D seismic processing and analysis now allow quantifiable estimations of thermal reservoir conformance to guide enhanced recovery methods and depletion planning. A novel use of microseismic technology was developed in the mid 1990's to assist in the early detection of casing failures and fluid releases into the overlying shales and aquifers to mitigate environmental, safety and economic consequences . Since 1998 microseismic monitoring has been integrated into commercial operations and with our interpretation of depositional geometries to further our understanding of steam migration. Today, Cold Lake has more than 100 dedicated microseismic monitoring wells making it one of the largest microseismic monitoring networks in the oil and gas industry. In the mid 2000's larger, high-frequency 3D seismic surveys were acquired for reservoir characterization. 3D seismic data are integrated field-wide with other data to build predictive geologic models and to assess recoverable bitumen volumes for multiple extraction technologies. These models enable maximum efficiency of resource development while reducing reliance on relatively expensive core data. Several enhancements to the recovery process are in the testing stage today to improve existing development or facilitate future developments in more challenging resource areas. Continued geoscience data collection and integration will drive efficient development of these new opportunities.

This required faster generation of robust cost effective development plans through efficient, strong techno economic analysis followed by rapid implementation in project management. In response to management's call to mitigate the national shortfall in oil production, the hydrocarbon potentials of Angsi were evaluated. Approved dynamic models were not available to guide. The drive to get faster oil led to investigation for opportunities within known reservoirs supported by seismics. A new approach of classical reservoir engineering techniques was used to understand undrained/bypassed and/or new oil, thus reserves. An innovative method to combine the production data with the static geological parameters was used to understand potential drainage areas of existing wells. The expected rates for the identified opportunities were estimated by another novel reservoir engineering technique. Anticipating possibility of higher project risks compared to conventional approach, the team deliberated the subsurface and operation risks through a series internal and external risk assessments which helped to prioritise risk and thus build in mitigation plans. The FDP with infill opportunities thus could be completed with critical analysis of available data without the dynamic model. These fast track wells were very successful in increasing production, reserves and thus provided higher economic returns. Based on the success currently a number of this early monetisation projects have been initiated. This paper details the novel engineering techniques used for study and the methods adopted for this early monetisation approach.

The process of storing CO2 into deep geological formations is defined as geological CO 2 sequestration or CO2 geo-sequestration. Injecting CO2 into a reservoir does not guarantee safe storage because CO 2 could leak back to the surface and/or may contaminate specific strata where other energy, mineral and/or groundwater resources are present. Two mechanisms control assurance of storage integrity, which are containment within the geological structure and minimizing the potential for wellbore leakage (Espie, 2005). This study is concerned with describing the wellbore leakage mechanism utilizing wellbore element, which will be extended to the whole wellbore system. To get a better chance of success in practice, successful CCS depends on the small-scale leakage problem associated with localized flow along wellbores. Our knowledge of wellbore performance for storage purposes is still weak. The paper is the first of a series to model wellbore element analytically by introducing wellbore sealing efficiency index. Wellbore sealing efficiency can be used as a ranking criteria between different wellbore elements in the same well and/or different wells in the same locality. Moreover, safety performance of wellbore element can be assessed.

Road IV, Hsinchu 30077, Taiwan","In semiconductor packaging technology, replacement of bonding wire material has received much attention in recent years due to the expensive gold price. Although many novel wire materials, such as Cu, Pd coated Cu, Ag, Pd coated Ag and Ag alloy, had been proposed to be substitute for the conventional gold wire, a comprehensive, industrial standard reliability testing and verification of bonding interface properties must be conducted before widely use in mass production. In this paper, a novel Ag-Au-Pd alloy bonding wire with excellent reliability performance is demonstrated. This bonding wire has been successfully used in mass production and it is fully comparable to the existing gold wire bonding processing. The bonding interface properties between the Ag alloy wires and the Al pads under thermal and humidity condition were systematically investigated. To verify the capability of Ag alloy bonding wire, the bonded test chips were tested under harsh environmental conditions, including 600 hours highly accelerated temperature and humidity stress test (HAST), 600 hours pressure cooker test (PCT), 2000 cycles temperature cycle test (TCT), 200 °C and 2000 hours high temperature storage life test (HTSL), 2000 hours high temperature operation life test (HTOL), and 6000 hours mother board test (MBT). Ag-Au-Pd bonding wires pass all these packaging reliability and product life testing. The interface microstructures and composition of the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focus ion beam (FIB), scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Emphasis in this exercise was on the possible interface corrosion, oxidation, segregation and intermetallic compounds (IMCs) formation behaviors after thermal and humidity stress conditions. TEM and EDS mapping results indicated two interface layers were formed between Ag alloy wire and Al pad. EDS analysis revealed that the layer close to Ag alloy wire side could possibly be Ag2Al alloy phase while the layer close to aluminum pad side could possibly be metastable Ag3Al electronic compound. In addition, the concentrations of Au and Pd elements were uniformly distributed in Ag alloy wire and Ag2Al alloy region. Moreover, there exist some oxygen-rich clusters in between the Ag2Al and Ag3Al layers, while the oxygen level in another region was barely detectable. This demonstrates that the addition of Pd and Au elements can support better oxidation resistance. The aluminum element could diffuse across the interface to form Ag2Al, Au-Al, and Pd-Al related intermetallic compounds during wire bonding. The coexistence of multi-phase intermetallic compounds can suppress the interface corrosion and provide excellent adhesion with Ag-Au-Pd alloy wire and Al pad. In the meantime, the Ag, Pd and Au could diffuse across the native oxygen-rich aluminum surface to form Ag3Al intermetallic phase during bonding action. The formation of Ag3Al metastable phase is speculated to be correlated with the possible existence of temperature difference between two ends. It can provide good adhesion and contact for electrical conduction. The existence of Pd in Ag3Al IMC layer could possibly limit the growth rate of IMCs under further stressing. It is concluded that Ag-Au-Pd alloy wire had been proven to be a low cost, highly reliable bonding wire material and can be widely used in packaging industry. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Bonding interface properties; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; High temperature operation lives; High temperature storage lives; Highly accelerated temperature and humidity stress test; Interface mi-crostructure; Multi-phase intermetallics; Scanning transmission electron microscopy; Adhesion; Aluminum; Bonding; Chip scale packages; Coated materials; Corrosion; Gold; Gold coatings; High temperature operations; Interfaces (materials); Intermetallics; Materials testing; MOS devices; Oxygen; Palladium; Production engineering; Scanning electron microscopy; Silver alloys; Transmission electron microscopy; Wire; X ray spectroscopy; Aluminum alloys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883329152

It is well known that SRAM power consumption can be reduced by employing a banked structure, where unused banks are switched into the low leakage retention mode. In this work, we propose a new strategy for memory banking, taking advantage of the software properties of WSN, and achieving aggressive power savings. We present a detailed model for the energy saving for equally sized banks with two power management schemes: a best-oracle policy and a simple greedy policy. Thanks to our modeling, at design time the optimum number of banks can be estimated, and the design can reach huge energy savings. The memory content allocation and the power management problem were solved by an integer linear program formulation for two real wireless sensor network application (based on TinyOS and ContikiOS).

The reservoir is approximately 2000 m below sea-level where the water depth is approximately 120m. A study for CO2 geological storage has been carried out to address the feasibility of injecting and storing CO2 in the M4 depleted carbonate gas reservoir using 3D coupled geomechanical modeling. The water level in the reservoir has risen close to the cap-rock which implies a strong aquifer. Laboratory tests were carried out on core samples before and after injection of a CO2 saturated brine solution, and the results were used in the determination of material property strength and elastic property degradation due to acid-carbonate interaction. Triaxial compression tests on carbonate samples from three different depths at the peak loading stage of the tests for different confining pressures were performed. The effects of CO2 saturation on UCS, Youngf<s modulus and Poisson' ratio were determined. The permeability measurements from the pore volume compressibility tests and permeability measurements obtained during the measurements of petrophysical properties were used to evaluate the effects of acid- carbonate interactions. The 3D geomechanical model coupled the reservoir pressures derived from a dynamic model with a stress simulator in order to calculate changes in effective stress and volumetric strain within the 3D model. The derived changes in volumetric strain were related to a change in porosity and permeability which were then passed back to the dynamic model in a staggered solution scheme. At each ""stress step"" in the solution process, a further modification was made to geomechanical material properties due to the increased CO2 saturation from injection. The material parameter modifications were based on the results of the laboratory tests above. In this way, the material property degradation due to CO2 injection was accounted for during the coupled reservoir geomechanical simulations. The paper discusses the results of these tests and the derived variation of material permeability, elasticity and strength parameters with CO2 saturation for subsequent input to the coupled geomechanical solution scheme. In this way, the potential risk due to the chemical interaction from CO2 injection could be evaluated quantitatively.

The use of embedded processors in safety-critical applications implies including fault tolerance in the design of SPM. This paper proposes a method, called FTSPM, which integrates a multi-priority mapping algorithm with a hybrid SPM structure. The proposed structure divides SPM into three parts: 1) a part is equipped with Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) which is immune against soft errors, 2) a part is equipped with Error-Correcting Code, and 3) a part is equipped with parity. The proposed mapping algorithm is responsible to distribute the program blocks among the above three parts with regards to their vulnerability level. The simulation results demonstrate that the FTSPM reduces the SPM vulnerability by about 7x in comparison to a pure SRAM-based SPM. In addition, the dynamic energy consumption of the proposed method is 77% and 47% less than that of a pure NVM-based SPM and a pure SRAM-based SPM, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.","Mapping of SPM; Non-Volatile Memory; Reliability; SPM","Dynamic energy consumption; Embedded processors; Error correcting code; Mapping algorithms; Non-volatile memory; Safety critical applications; Scratch pad memory; SPM; Data storage equipment; Reliability; Conformal mapping",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883316487

Electrochemical capacitors (ECs, also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors) are one of the electrochemical energy storage systems that can store and release energy at a pulse power. Commercial ECs based on activated carbon electrodes have a fairly low energy density, which is mainly due to the ill-defined physical and chemical properties of the activated carbon. Hence, the past decade has witnessed a rapid growth in the R&D of new carbon and carbon-based materials for ECs. Ideally, a carbon electrode should possess a high specific surface area (SSA) accessible to electrolyte ions, three-dimensional pores of appropriate sizes, good electrical conductivity, excellent stability against harsh environments (e.g., a wide range of temperatures, various electrolytes, and stress), flexibility, easy processability, compatibility with other materials (e.g., a current collector), and of course low cost. Integrating these features (and sometimes beyond) in one solid is one of the research frontiers.

Storage of the lutein extract at low temperature (4 or -20. °C) with antioxidant addition (around 0.01% BHT) can maintain 90% lutein stability after 80 days. Addition of a suitable amount of the antioxidant could promote the stability of lutein extracts under the exposure of light. The protocol developed in this work allows efficient lutein extraction from S. obliquus CNW-N at a lower cost. Further purification was employed to elevate the purity of lutein and its commercial value. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Bioseparations; Extraction kinetics; Lutein; Microalgae; Purification; Scenedesmus obliquus","Bio separation; Extraction kinetics; Lutein; Micro-algae; Scenedesmus obliquus; Extraction; Microorganisms; Purification; Algae; beta carotene; carotenoid; neoxanthin; violaxanthin; xanthophyll; Acutodesmus obliquus; article; cell disruption; cell wall; energy conservation; environmental temperature; light exposure; light intensity; microalga; priority journal; protein analysis; protein purification; saponification; solvent extraction; storage temperature; Scenedesmus obliquus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882567190

However, it is not certain whether afforestation with willow plantations will enhance or diminish soil C storage and nutrient availability. Trees are known to have pronounced effects on biologically mediated nutrient cycling processes which can increase nutrient availability, but willows are known to be nutrient demanding. In this paper, the net effect of plantation establishment is examined at nine sites across the prairie and southern Ontario regions of Canada. Carbon, N, P, K, Ca and Mg levels in soils and harvestable biomass were compared between willow plantations and paired reference sites at the end of the first three-year rotation. Soils were depleted in total C (-2.22 mg.g-1, p &lt; 0.05), inorganic N (-3.12 μg.N.g-1, p &lt; 0.10), exchangeable K (-0.11 cmolc.kg-1, p &lt; 0.10) and leachable P (-0.03 mg.g-1, p &lt; 0.10). Exchangeable Ca was found to be consistently depleted only at the 20-40 depth. Depletion of soil K was more heavily influenced by disturbance, whereas soil N was directly affected by willow N uptake. Sites with greater growth and biocycling stabilized soil P concentrations. © 2013 by the authors.","Base cations; Biomass energy; Carbon sequestration; Fast growth; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Salix; Short rotation intensive culture; Soil nutrient depletion","Base cations; Bio-mass energy; Carbon sequestration; Fast growths; Salix; Short-rotation intensive cultures; Soil nutrient depletion; Biomass; Calcium; Carbon; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Reforestation; Soils; afforestation; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); growth response; nitrogen; nutrient availability; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; plantation; soil carbon; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Salix; Salix purpurea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876310325

This paper reports on an experimental study to investigate the inherent operational characteristics of a new direct-expansion air conditioning system combined with a vacuum solar collector. Mathematical models of the system components are firstly derived and then validated against experimental results. To investigate the potential of energy savings, the hybrid solar-assisted air-conditioner is installed and extensively equipped with a number of sensors and instrumentation devices, for experimentation and data collection. The influence on the system energy usage of the average water temperature, storage tank size and room set-point temperature are then analyzed. Once the air-conditioned room has achieved its desired temperature, the compressor turns off while the cooling process still continues until the refrigerant pressure no longer maintains the desired temperature. The advantages of the proposed hybrid system rest with the fact that the compressor can remain off in a longer period by heat impartation into the refrigerant via the water storage tank.

These materials were prepared by mechanochemical synthesis from LiBH4, MCl2 or M(BH4) 2, and ZnCl2. The compounds are isostructural, and their crystal structure was characterized by in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray and neutron diffraction and DFT calculations. While diffraction provides an average view of the structure as hexagonal (a = 15.371(3), c = 8.586(2) Å, space group P63/mcm for Mg-compound at room temperature), the DFT optimization of locally ordered models suggests a related ortho-hexagonal cell. Ordered models that maximize Mg-Mg separation have the lowest DFT energy, suggesting that the hexagonal structure seen by diffraction is a superposition of three such orthorhombic structures in three orientations along the hexagonal c-axis. No conclusion about the coherent length of the orthorhombic structure can be however done. The framework in Li 3MZn5(BH4)15 is of a new type. It contains channels built from face-sharing (BH4)6 octahedra. While X-ray and neutron powder diffraction preferentially localize lithium in the center of the octahedra, thus resulting in two weakly interconnected frameworks of a new type, the DFT calculations clearly favor lithium inside the shared triangular faces, leading to two interpenetrated mco-nets (mco-c type) with the basic tile being built from three tfa tiles, which is the framework type of the related bimetallic LiZn2(BH 4)5. The new borohydrides Li3MZn 5(BH4)15 are potentially interesting as solid-state electrolytes, if the lithium mobility within the octahedral channels is improved by disordering the site via heterovalent substitution. From a hydrogen storage point of view, their application seems to be limited as the compounds decompose to three known metal borohydrides. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883495115

Motivated by the conference key establishment scheme proposed by Harn and Gong in [11], we propose LPKM (Lightweight Polynomial-based KeyManagement Protocol), a key management scheme for distributed WSNs. LPKM enables sensor nodes to establish different types of keys to bootstrap trust and secure one-to-one and one-to-many communications in a flexible, reliable, and non-interactive way. Moreover, LPKM can effectively mitigate or thwart the most common attacks to WSNs such as node clone attacks, node impersonation attacks, etc. In addition, LPKM can tolerate changes of network topology and incurs little computational and communication overhead. Our experimental results on MICAz motes show that LPKM can be efficiently implemented on low-cost sensor nodes. In particular, a MICAz mote running at a frequency of 8MHz can generate required group keys of 128-bit in a few milliseconds, at a cost of 6.12 KBytes ROM and 68 Bytes RAM. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2013.","Authentication; Key management; Security; Wireless sensor networks","Communication overheads; Distributed wireless sensor networks; Impersonation attack; Key management; Key management protocols; Key management schemes; Security; Wireless sensor node; Ad hoc networks; Authentication; Electric network topology; Random access storage; Wireless sensor networks; Sensor nodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883128654

The increasing capacity of the power storages in the electric vehicles (EV) motivates this concept and makes it more feasible. However, the privacy of the customers can be compromised by tracing the stations that an EV has been connected to during a period of the time. The stations that are providing power charging as well as purchasing the power back from EVs can be owned by third party businesses. EVs should be authenticated through these stations in order to give or receive appropriate credit for the power. In this paper, we identify potential privacy issues and propose a robust privacy-preserving authentication scheme for communication of the EV and the station to prevent customer information leakage. In our approach, the EV and the station communication utilizes pseudonym of the EV, in which only the smart grid server (a trusted entity) can map the pseudonym to the real vehicle identity and provide the identity management. The pseudonym of an EV changes when the EV moves from one station to another, which prevents the adversary from tracing foot prints of the EV. Our analysis shows that our model is robust enough to make sure the privacy of the customers is fully preserved, and at the same time, it is efficient by consuming very limited resources. © 2013 IEEE.","Electric Vehicle; Identity Management; Privacy; Pseudonymity; Security; Smart Grid; Untraceability","Identity management; Pseudonymity; Security; Smart grid; Un traceabilitys; Authentication; Communication; Data privacy; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Sales; Smart power grids; Vehicle to vehicle communications",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883108018

Brazil and the United States are world leaders in ethanol production, using as raw material sugar cane and corn, respectively. In Brazil, ethanol is used as automotive fuel in two forms: hydrated, used in ethanol-using cars and flex fuel cars; or anhydrous alcohol, which is added to gasoline. Ethanol is capable of being metabolized by various microorganisms serving as a carbon source for them. Under favorable conditions, bacteria and fungi can form biofilms and participate actively in the process of biocorrosion. The presence of some microorganisms in the biofilms may enhance corrosion by the production of corrosive metabolites such as organic acids. Given the scarcity of studies in the area, this work aimed to study the diversity of microorganisms present in samples of ethanol in order to identify possible causes of the process of biocorrosion. For this, several samples of ethanol from different origins were received and analyzed. The main groups of cultivable microorganisms related to biocorrosion were quantified. Furthermore, analyses of non-cultivable microorganisms were performed using molecular biology techniques. The results allow a better assessment of the susceptibility of storage tanks and pipelines to microbiological corrosion in the presence of ethanol. © 2013 by NACE International.","Acetobacter aceti; Biocorrosion; Cloning; Ethanol","Acetobacter aceti; Anhydrous alcohols; Biocorrosion; Different origins; Ethanol production; Favorable conditions; Microbiological corrosion; Renewable energy source; Automotive fuels; Biodegradation; Biofilms; Cloning; Corrosion; Microorganisms; Molecular biology; Renewable energy resources; Sugar cane; Ethanol",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883090667

Because it is less polluting and constitutes a source of renewable energy, biodiesel has an important role in the fuel sector. The biodiesel by itself or mixed in different proportions with diesel can replace the diesel oil whether in automotive engines (trucks, tractors, vans, cars) or in stationary engines (electricity or heat generators). However, data on the corrosion of metals when in contact with biodiesel/diesel blends as well as information about the influence of the metallic corrosion products in biodiesel/diesel blends quality are still poorly understood. Therefore, the objective of this work was to study the compatibility between biodiesel/diesel blends and different metallic materials with focus on the blend quality and on the integrity of facilities used during transportation and storage. For this purpose, the chosen metallic materials were carbon steel (UNS(1) no. G10200), copper (UNS no. C11000), brass (copper alloy UNS no. C26800), aluminum (UNS no. A91100) and stainless steel (UNS no. S31600). The study was conducted through laboratory immersion tests. © 2013 by NACE International.","Biodiesel; Biodiesel/diesel blend; Biofuel; Corrosivity","Biodiesel/diesel; Corrosivity; Different proportions; Energy productions; Metallic corrosion; Metallic material; Renewable energies; Stationary engines; Biodiesel; Biofuels; Carbon steel; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Digital storage; Heat engines; Tractors (truck); Corrosion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883089435

Moench] is among the most important warm-season forages that is grown in mainly arid and semiarid regions of southeastern Iran. Irrigation water is an energy-intensive input and it is also becoming scarce and costly in this country. Soil application of polymeric materials such as Superab A200 (SAP) can increase soil water storage capacity and increase water use efficiency (WUE). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of different rates of SAP and irrigation regimes on dry matter yield, WUE, and some physiological and yield-related traits of Speedfeed sorghum. The experiment was conducted in Zahedan, Iran, during the 2009 and 2010 seasons under limited irrigation regimes (irrigation after 40, 60, 80, and 100% crop evapotranspiration = ETc) and four rates of SAP application (0, 75, 150, and 225 kg ha-1). Results indicated significant effects of irrigation regimes, SAP levels, and their interaction. The analysis for dry matter, WUE, and benefit/cost ratio showed that applying SAP at 100% ETc had no effect on these traits, but in the treatments with water deficit, it improved all the studied traits of sorghum. With regard to economic analysis, applying 75 kg ha-1 SAP for a decrease in the sorghum's water requirement of as much as 20% is economically justified at moderate water deficits. © 2013 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

The benefit of lithium-air batteries is based on the assumption that the anodic lithium is completely reversible during the discharge-charge process. Here we report our investigation on the reversibility of the anodic lithium inside of an operating lithium-air battery using spatially and temporally resolved synchrotron X-ray diffraction and three-dimensional micro-tomography technique. A combined electrochemical process is found, consisting of a partial recovery of lithium metal during the charging cycle and a constant accumulation of lithium hydroxide under both charging and discharging conditions. A lithium hydroxide layer forms on the anode separating the lithium metal from the separator. However, numerous microscopic 'tunnels' are also found within the hydroxide layer that provide a pathway to connect the metallic lithium with the electrolyte, enabling sustained ion-transport and battery operation until the total consumption of lithium. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This would have implications in many studies in which the samples need to be stored until analysis. The aim of this study was to further evaluate if the crystallinity of extracted bone mineral increases over storage time. The extracted mineral was a biological bone-like apatite produced in osteoblast cell cultures. The overall characterization of the mineral was done by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. In order to evaluate possible changes in crystallinity over storage time, the same sample was analyzed by X-ray diffraction immediately after mineral extraction and after 18 months of storage. In conclusion, no statistically relevant changes were observed over storage time, although the occurrence of a slight increase in crystallinity could be discussed in the stored mineral sample. © 2013.","Biomineralization; Bone mineral; Crystallinity; Material storage; X-ray diffraction","Bone like apatite; Bone minerals; Crystallinities; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Material storages; Mineral extraction; Mineral samples; Osteoblast cells; Biomineralization; Bone; Cell culture; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Minerals; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray spectroscopy; Storage (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890039013

A storage tank together with an immersed heat exchanger is installed in the liquid line between the condenser and expansion valve to utilize the make-up water of the cooling tower. The heat exchanger uses the make-up water to reduce the refrigerant temperature leaving the condenser and thus enhance the refrigerant sub-cooling. For this purpose, an existing central cooling plant of a commercial building, located in a hot and dry climate region, is used for experimentation and data collection. The energy consumption and relevant data of the existing central cooling plant were acquired over the course of a typical week in summer. First, theoretical-empirical system models including mechanistic relations between components are developed. A numerical algorithm together with monitored data and mathematical model implemented on a transient system simulation tool is used to predict the performance of the new design under transient loads. The integrated simulation tool was validated by comparing predicted and measured power consumption of the central cooling plant. Comparison of the proposed system with existing cooling plant is included in this paper to demonstrate the advantages of our new configuration. Results show that about 9.7% in average and up to 14% power saving can be obtained by using our design while maintaining the comfort condition inside the building. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Comfort conditions; Commercial building; Cooling tower water; Design improvements; Integrated simulations; Numerical algorithms; Refrigerant temperature; Transient systems; Algorithms; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Heat exchangers; Mathematical models; Office buildings; Refrigerants; Cooling towers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887459930

It can thus be used as a valid alternative to Linear Variable Differential Transformers (LVDTs), which can show a position error in magnetic environments. In addition, since it retains the excellent properties of LVDTs, the I2PS can be used in harsh environments, such as nuclear plants, plasma control and particle accelerators. This paper focuses on the design optimization of the sensor, considering the CERN LHC Collimators as application. In particular, the optimization comes after a complete review of the electromagnetic and thermal modeling of the sensor, as well as the proper choice of the reading technique. The design optimization stage is firmly based on these preliminary steps. Therefore, the paper summarises the sensor's complete development, from its modeling to its actual implementation.

In this study we tried to prepare and fortify cherry juice by hops extract because of its functional property. Considering that beverage sugar is effective in diabetes, it is therefore necessary to use other sweeteners rather than sugar to decrease sugar in the formulation by replacing it with stevia. Methods. In order to optimise the formulation of the drink, response surface methodology was used considering physicochemical features such as antioxidant capacity, total sugar, brix, pH, color changes, opacity and sensory evaluation of the beverage. The effects of pasteurisation and storage conditions on the antioxidant activity and Vitamin C content of the product were investigated. Results. Results showed that the cherry concentrate had a significant effect on sensory evaluation, color changes and antioxidant parameters of fortified drinking. By increasing the hops extract, antioxidant capacity increased. Increasing stevia up to the average quantities, the sensory evaluation score was increased significantly (P<0.05). Conclusion. The best product, considering quality attributes, included 230-235 ppm hops, 45.38% cherry extract and 10 ppm stevia. The antioxidant activity and vitamin C content of the product were affected significantly by pasteurisation and storage conditions.","Energy drinks; Prunus; Stevia","antioxidant; ascorbic acid; hops extract; phenol derivative; plant extract; sugar; sweetening agent; unclassified drug; acidity; antioxidant activity; article; beverage; cherry; color; diabetes mellitus; diet supplementation; fruit juice; nonhuman; pasteurization; pH; physical chemistry; response surface method; sensory evaluation; Stevia; storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884965435

This work was performed as part of a US Department of Energy Joint Research Target in FY11 to identify physics processes that control the H-mode pedestal structure. The study included experiments on C-Mod, DIII-D and NSTX as well as interpretation of experimental data with theory-based modelling codes. This work provides increased confidence in the ability of models for peeling-ballooning stability, bootstrap current, pedestal width and pedestal height scaling to make correct predictions, with some areas needing further work also being identified. A model for pedestal pressure height has made good predictions in existing machines for a range in pressure of a factor of 20. This provides a solid basis for predicting the maximum pedestal pressure height in ITER, which is found to be an extrapolation of a factor of 3 beyond the existing data set. Models were studied for a number of processes that are proposed to play a role in the pedestal ne and Te profiles. These processes include neoclassical transport, paleoclassical transport, electron temperature gradient turbulence and neutral fuelling. All of these processes may be important, with the importance being dependent on the plasma regime. Studies with several electromagnetic gyrokinetic codes show that the gradients in and on top of the pedestal can drive a number of instabilities. © 2013 IAEA, Vienna.",,"Bootstrap current; Gyrokinetic codes; Modelling codes; Neoclassical transport; Pedestal pressure; Pedestal structure; Predictive capabilities; US Department of Energy; Digital storage; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884525705

To identify patterns in energy storage and feeding behaviour driven by different food conditions for the circumpolar deposit-feeding protobranch bivalve Yoldia hyperborea, we measured variations in cytological (digestive cell height) and biochemical (lipid class, fatty acid, glycogen, and protein content) components during controlled experiments. Three treatments with organisms in sediment with high refractory organic matter (12 % OM) were exposed to different feeding regimes resembling (a) the annual spring bloom settlement, (b) low food availability during winter, and (c) sporadic resuspension events. Yoldia exposed to a diatom-supplemented diet showed significantly higher mean values for digestive cell height (28.44 μm), glycogen (30.4 mg g-1 dry mass, DM), diatom-specific fatty acids, and total lipid (TL) levels (14.4 mg g-1 DM), but lower protein concentrations, than in non-supplemented treatments (digestive cell height 20.34 μm; glycogen 9.23 mg g-1 DM; TL 6.7 mg g-1 DM). All analyses showed no effect of resuspension events; thus, it was unlikely that resuspension improved sediment nutritional value. In the absence of recently deposited diatoms, Y. hyperborea did not increase nutrient storage, suggesting that significant amounts of older refractory OM are not used for growth or reproduction. The rapid storage of nutrients derived from diatoms demonstrates the role of seasonal episodic events of settling algae in the nutrition of subpolar Y. hyperborea and in the transfer of energy from the water column to the benthos. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Benthic-pelagic coupling; Cold ocean; Deposit-feeding; Digestive gland; Fatty acid; Glycogen; Lipid; Protobranch","algal bloom; benthic-pelagic coupling; benthos; bivalve; energy; fatty acid; feeding behavior; food availability; food supply; growth; nutrient uptake; nutrition; ocean; organic matter; phytodetritus; reproduction; resuspension; algae; Bacillariophyta; Bivalvia; Nuculanidae; Yoldia hyperborea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883767738

The temporary storage sites have been established as a buffer against fluctuations in energy demand throughout the year. Materials also need to be stored at temporary storage sites before recovery and recycling. However, regulations governing waste fuel storage and handling have not yet been developed, and, as a result, companies have engaged in risky practices that have resulted in a high number of fire incidents. In this study, a questionnaire survey was distributed to 249 of the 400 members of Avfall Sverige (Swedish Waste Management Association), which represents the waste management of 95% of the Swedish population. Information regarding 122 storage facilities owned by 69 companies was obtained; these facilities were responsible for the storage of 47% of the total treated waste (incineration + digestion + composting) in 2010 in Sweden. To identify factors related to fire frequency, the questionnaire covered the amounts of material handled and burnt per year, financial losses due to fires, storage duration, storage method and types of waste. The results show that 217 fire incidents corresponded to 170 kilotonnes of material burnt and cumulative losses of 49 million SEK (€4.3 million). Fire frequency and amount of material burnt per fire was found to be dependent upon type of management group (waste operator).

Elastic ankle exoskeletons reduce soleus muscle force but not work in human hopping. J Appl Physiol 115: 579-585, 2013. First published June 20, 2013; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00253.2013.- Inspired by elastic energy storage and return in tendons of human leg muscle-tendon units (MTU), exoskeletons often place a spring in parallel with an MTU to assist the MTU. However, this might perturb the normally efficient MTU mechanics and actually increase active muscle mechanical work. This study tested the effects of elastic parallel assistance on MTU mechanics. Participants hopped with and without spring-loaded ankle exoskeletons that assisted plantar flexion. An inverse dynamics analysis, combined with in vivo ultrasound imaging of soleus fascicles and surface electromyography, was used to determine muscle-tendon mechanics and activations. Whole body net metabolic power was obtained from indirect calorimetry. When hopping with spring-loaded exoskeletons, soleus activation was reduced (30-70%) and so was the magnitude of soleus force (peak force reduced by 30%) and the average rate of soleus force generation (by 50%). Although forces were lower, average positive fascicle power remained unchanged, owing to increased fascicle excursion (+4-5 mm). Net metabolic power was reduced with exoskeleton assistance (19%). These findings highlighted that parallel assistance to a muscle with appreciable series elasticity may have some negative consequences, and that the metabolic cost associated with generating force may be more pronounced than the cost of doing work for these muscles.

On the basis of Lennard-Jones potential function along with the continuum approximation and applied mathematics, single integrals are presented to formulate the van der Waals interaction energy and suction energy between a single methane molecule and a carbon nanotube. The preferred position and orientation of methane with regard to the nanotube axis has been fully investigated for different nanotube radii. To this end, it is assumed that the whole molecule rotates in all directions inside the nanotube. It is found that for certain radii of nanotubes in which the suction energy imparted to methane is negative, the whole methane molecule is symmetric with respect to the tube axis when it is inside the carbon nanotube. But, when the suction energy has positive values, as the tube radius increases the methane molecule gets closer to the wall of nanotube and finally locates near its wall in the form of a downward tripod. Furthermore, the optimum nanotube radius which gives rise to maximum suction energy has been calculated. The results obtained in this study can be conducted as means of further investigations for methane storage in carbon nanotubes. © 2013 American Scientific Publishers.

The oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle of transgenic carriers was reduced, as evidenced by altered expression of Cpt1, Acox1, and ACC. Hepatic triglycerides and glycogen were elevated (1.6- and 1.4-fold, respectively; P<0.05) and expression of key enzymes regulating lipogenesis (Fasn), glycogen synthesis (Gck), and gluconeogenesis (G6pc, Fbp1) was increased in the liver of the transgenic mice.

This is of particular importance where managers, due to financial considerations, may be forced to construct WDNs that are directly connected to water resources. In such WDNs there is no tank, leading to unreasonable water loss and excess pressure in the WDN. Also, in such circumstances, the size of the search space is reduced so that no need is felt to use optimisation algorithms to find the optimal pumping schedule. In this study, the pumping schedule was obtained for two real WDNs in Iran, using single-speed pumps and variable-speed pumps. The results showed that through smart scheduling energy cost savings can be up to 24%, and the existing leakage and excess pressure can be reduced by 11% and 53%, respectively. It was noted that an increase in the number of pumps could improve the amount of savings made. Finally, it was demonstrated that the pumping schedule obtained by the method suggested in this study was optimal and can still be functional when the demand pattern varies stochastically.",,"Demand pattern; Energy cost savings; Excess pressure; Optimal pumping schedule; Pumping stations; Search spaces; Variable-speed pumps; Water distribution networks; Algorithms; Information dissemination; Optimization; Scheduling; Water distribution systems; Water resources; Pumps; algorithm; operations technology; optimization; pumping; stochasticity; storage structure; water demand; water management; water resource; water supply; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883265964

Despite the discovery of several new classes of CP materials, the development of such materials with the required high performance is still a highly challenging task. Here, we propose a new electron-pinned, defect-dipole route to ideal CP behaviour, where hopping electrons are localized by designated lattice defect states to generate giant defect-dipoles and result in high-performance CP materials. We present a concrete example, (Nb+In) co-doped TiO 2 rutile, that exhibits a largely temperature-and frequency-independent colossal permittivity (&gt; 10 4) as well as a low dielectric loss (mostly &lt; 0.05) over a very broad temperature range from 80 to 450 K. A systematic defect analysis coupled with density functional theory modelling suggests that 'triangular' In 2 3+ V O •• Ti 3 + and 'diamond' shaped Nb 2 5+ Ti 3+ A Ti (A=Ti 3 +/In 3+/Ti 4+) defect complexes are strongly correlated, giving rise to large defect-dipole clusters containing highly localized electrons that are together responsible for the excellent CP properties observed in co-doped TiO 2. This combined experimental and theoretical work opens up a promising feasible route to the systematic development of new high-performance CP materials via defect engineering. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Natural populations of FAPs related to Chloroflexus spp. and Roseiflexus spp. have been well characterized in Mushroom Spring, where they occur with unicellular cyanobacteria related to Synechococcus spp. strains A and B′. Metatranscriptomic sequencing was applied to the microbial community to determine how FAPs regulate their gene expression in response to fluctuating environmental conditions and resource availability over a diel period. Transcripts for genes involved in the biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophylls (BChls) and photosynthetic reaction centers were much more abundant at night. Both Roseiflexus spp. and Chloroflexus spp. expressed key genes involved in the 3-hydroxypropionate (3-OHP) carbon dioxide fixation bi-cycle during the day, when these FAPs have been thought to perform primarily photoheterotrophic and/or aerobic chemoorganotrophic metabolism. The expression of genes for the synthesis and degradation of storage polymers, including glycogen, polyhydroxyalkanoates and wax esters, suggests that FAPs produce and utilize these compounds at different times during the diel cycle. We summarize these results in a proposed conceptual model for temporal changes in central carbon metabolism and energy production of FAPs living in a natural environment. The model proposes that, at night, Chloroflexus spp. and Roseiflexus spp. synthesize BChl, components of the photosynthetic apparatus, polyhydroxyalkanoates and wax esters in concert with fermentation of glycogen. It further proposes that, in daytime, polyhydroxyalkanoates and wax esters are degraded and used as carbon and electron reserves to support photomixotrophy via the 3-OHP bi-cycle. © 2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology.","filamentous anoxygenic phototrophs; metagenomics; metatranscriptomics; mixotrophy; phototrophy","bacteriochlorophyll; carbon; transcriptome; carbon dioxide; cyanobacterium; environmental conditions; fermentation; gene expression; metabolism; microbial community; microbial mat; mixotrophy; mushroom; photoautotrophy; resource availability; spring water; article; Chloroflexi; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; photoperiodicity; photosynthesis; thermal spring; Bacteriochlorophylls; Carbon; Chloroflexi; Environmental Microbiology; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Hot Springs; Photoperiod; Photosynthesis; Transcriptome; Basidiomycota; Chloroflexi; Chloroflexi (class); Chloroflexus; Cyanobacteria; Roseiflexus; Synechococcus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883152244

The idea of inducing white adipose tissue (WAT) to assume characteristics of brown adipose tissue (BAT), and thus gearing it to fat burning instead of storage, is receiving serious consideration as potential treatment for obesity and related disorders. Phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) links insulin- and cAMP-signaling networks in tissues associated with energy metabolism, including WAT. We used C57BL/6 PDE3B knockout (KO) mice to elucidate mechanisms involved in the formation of BAT in epididymalWAT(EWAT) depots. Examination of gene expression profiles inPDE3BKOEWATrevealed increased expression of several genes that block white and promote brown adipogenesis, such as C-terminal binding protein, bone morphogenetic protein 7, and PR domain containing 16, but a clear BAT-like phenotype was not completely induced. However, acute treatment of PDE3B KO mice with the β3-adrenergic agonist, CL316243, markedly increased the expression of cyclooxygenase-2, which catalyzes prostaglandin synthesis and is thought to be important in the formation of BAT in WAT and the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids 3, which is linked to BAT recruitment upon cold exposure, causing a clear shift toward fat burning and the induction of BAT in KO EWAT. These data provide insight into the mechanisms of BAT formation in mouse EWAT, suggesting that, in a C57BL/6 background, an increase in cAMP, caused by ablation of PDE3B and administration of CL316243, may promote differentiation of prostaglandin-responsive progenitor cells in the EWAT stromal vascular fraction into functional brown adipocytes.",,"5 [2 [[2 (3 chlorophenyl) 2 hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl] 1,3 benzodioxole 2,2 dicarboxylic acid; binding protein; C terminal binding protein; cilostamide; cyclooxygenase 2; fluorine 18; long chain fatty acid; long chain fatty acid 3; osteogenic protein 1; peptides and proteins; phosphodiesterase 3B; phosphodiesterase III; pr domain containing 16; unclassified drug; animal tissue; article; body weight; brown adipose tissue; controlled study; drug effect; epididymis; lipid oxidation; male; mouse; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; priority journal; white adipose tissue; Adipogenesis; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Adrenergic beta-3 Receptor Agonists; Adult Stem Cells; Animals; Biological Markers; Crosses, Genetic; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3; Cyclooxygenase 2; Dioxoles; Enzyme Induction; Epididymis; Gene Expression Profiling; Male; Mice; Mice, 129 Strain; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors; Quinolones",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883142792

The interaction between graphene and hydrogen molecules is described by the Lennard-Jones potential. The effects of pressure, temperature, number of layers in a FLG, and FLG interlayer spacing are evaluated in terms of molecular trajectories, binding energy, binding force, and gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (HSC). The simulation results show that the effects of temperature and pressure can offset each other to improve HSC. An insufficient interlayer spacing (0.35 nm) largely limits the HSC of FLG because hydrogen adsorbed at the edges of the graphene prevents more hydrogen from entering the structure. A low temperature (77 K), a high pressure, a large number of layers in a FLG, and a large FLG interlayer spacing maximize the HSC. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Adsorption; Few-layer graphene; Hydrogen; Molecular dynamics; Pressure","few layer graphene; graphene; hydrogen; unclassified drug; adsorption; article; binding affinity; chemical parameters; energy; hydrogen storage capacity; hyperbarism; low temperature; molecular biology; molecular dynamics; pressure; priority journal; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883019226

This kinase has pleiotropic functions, and the importance of its activity has recently been shown in neurons and platelets. In addition to its regulatory function in several physiological events, changes in GSK3β activity have been associated with many psychiatric and neurodegenerative illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and autism-spectrum disorders. Beside the reports of its involvement in several pathologies, it has become increasingly apparent that GSK3β might be a common therapeutic target for different classes of psychiatric drugs, and also that the GSK3β ratio may be a useful parameter to determine the biochemical changes that might occur during antidepressant treatment. Although GSK3β is commonly described as a key enzyme in a plethora of signaling cascades, originally it was identified as playing an important role in the regulation of glycogen synthesis, given its ability to inactivate glycogen synthase (GS) by phosphorylation. Acting as a constitutively active kinase, GSK3β phosphorylates GS, which results in a decrease of glycogen production. GSK3β phosphorylation increases glycogen synthesis and storage, while its dephosphorylation decreases glycogen synthesis. Inactivation of GSK3β leads to dephosphorylation of GS and increase in glycogen synthesis in the adipose tissue, muscle and liver. Glycogen levels are reduced by antidepressant treatment, and this effect seems to be related to an effect of drugs on GSK3β activity. Peripherally, glycogen is also abundantly found in platelets, where it is considered a major energy source, required for a variety of its functions, including the release reaction. Recently, analysis of platelets from patients with late-life major depression showed that active forms of GSK3β expression were upregulated by continuous treatment with sertraline. Here, we hypothesized that the quantification of glycogen in platelets might be used as a peripheral biomarker of GSK3β activity. Since it has been recently demonstrated that the modulation of GSK3β activity causes changes in glycogen stores, the glycogen levels in platelets could be used to assay the effects of drugs that have this kinase as a target, or diseases where its activity is affected. In conclusion, we hypothesized that the determination of glycogen peripherally may be useful to indicate a change in the activity of this enzyme, providing a faster and non-invasive approach to guide the therapeutic procedures for the patient. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"glycogen; glycogen synthase; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; adipose tissue; Alzheimer disease; article; autism; enzyme activity; enzyme inactivation; enzyme phosphorylation; human; liver; muscle tissue; protein dephosphorylation; protein targeting; schizophrenia; thrombocyte; Biological Markers; Blood Platelets; Glycogen; Glycogen Synthase; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; Humans; Models, Biological; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881556419

Deforestation losses include wildlife and human habitat, and myriad forest products on which rural and urban societies depend for food, fiber, fuel, fresh water, medicine, and recreation. Ecosystem services gained in the transition from forests to pasture and croplands, however, are often ignored in assessments of the impact of land cover change. The role of converted lands in tropical areas in terms of carbon uptake and storage is largely unknown. Pastures represent the fastest-growing form of converted land use in the tropics, even in some areas of rapid urban expansion. Tree biomass stored in these areas spans a broad range, depending on tree cover. Trees in pasture increase carbon storage, provide shade for cattle, and increase productivity of forage material. As a result, increasing fractional tree cover can provide benefits land managers as well as important ecosystem services such as reducing conversion pressure on forests adjacent to pastures. This study presents an estimation of fractional tree cover in pasture in a dynamic region on the verge of large-scale land use change. An appropriate sampling interval is established for similar studies, one that balances the need for independent samples of sufficient number to characterize a pasture in terms of fractional tree cover. This information represents a useful policy tool for government organizations and NGOs interested in encouraging ecosystem services on converted lands. Using high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery, fractional tree cover in pasture is quantified for the municipality of Rio Branco, Brazil. A semivariogram and devolving spatial resolution are employed to determine the coarsest sampling interval that may be used, minimizing effects of spatial autocorrelation. The coarsest sampling interval that minimizes spatial dependence was about 22 m. The area-weighted fractional tree cover for the study area was 1.85 %, corrected for a slight bias associated with the coarser sampling resolution.

Hydrogenation of a nanosized polyisoprene (PIP) emulsion was carried out in a Parr reactor. Rhodium trichloride (RhCl3×3H2O) and different ligand types, triphenylphosphine (PPh3), trisulfonated triphenylphosphine (TPPTS) and monosulfonated triphenylphosphine (TPPMS) were used as a catalyst precursor. The hydrogenated PIP (HPIP) was characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR). Low conversions of CC were observed when RhCl3/PPh3 or RhCl3/TPPTS was used as catalyst precursors, however, 96.0% hydrogenation (HD) was achieved when using RhCl3/TPPMS. The Hartley ionic spherical micelle model was proposed to explain the catalytic behavior. The process variables did not affect PIP particle size after hydrogenation. Mechanistic aspects of the hydrogenation of PIP in the presence of RhCl 3/TPPMS were proposed on the basis of the observed kinetic results. Kinetic experiments for PIP hydrogenation in aqueous media indicate that the hydrogenation rate is first order with respect to catalyst and carbon-carbon double bond concentration. The hydrogenation rate was dependent on catalyst concentration, temperature and hydrogen pressure, and PIP particle size. The apparent activation energy over the temperature range of 120-140 C was found to be 117.0 kJ/mol. HPIP (96%HD) has high thermal stability with a maximum decomposition temperature of 462 C and a glass transition temperature of -49 C. Dynamic mechanical analysis indicated that HPIP had a maximum storage modulus due to the saturated carbon domains of the ethylene segments in the polymer chains. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Such detailed investigation of metabolic processes is important background, with regard to understanding the vulnerability of corals to environmental change. Health indices in AD and AS were measured before and after spawning in austral autumn and winter 2010, and austral summer 2011 at six stations. Health indices showed seasonal and species-specific differences but negligible spatial differences across a reef section. For AD, autotrophic indices were negatively correlated with lipid ratios and metabolic indices. Metabolic indices were significantly higher in AS than AD. No correlation was observed between RNA/DNA ratios and lipid ratios with any autotrophic indices for AS. Lipid ratios were stable throughout the year for AS while they changed significantly for AD. For both species, indices of metabolic activity were highest during autumn, while autotrophic indices were highest in winter and summer. Results suggest that the impact of the broadcast spawning event on coral health indices at Ningaloo Reef occurred only as a backdrop to massive seasonal changes in coral physiology. The La Niña summer pattern resulted in high autotrophic indices and low metabolic indices and energy stores. Our results imply different metabolic processes in A. digitifera and A. spicifera as well as a strong impact of extreme events on coral physiology. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Coral; Energy; Health; Metabolism; Ningaloo Reef; Seasonality","autumn; coral; energy use; environmental change; metabolism; seasonal variation; spawning; vulnerability; winter; Australia; Ningaloo Reef; Western Australia; Acropora; Acropora digitifera; Acropora spicifera; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881219839

SEM (Scanning electronic microscope), FT-IR (Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope) and XRD (X-ray diffractometer) were applied to determine microstructure, chemical structure and crystalloid phase of palmitic acid/GO composites, respectively. DSC (Differential scanning calorimeter) test was done to investigate thermal properties which include melting and solidifying temperatures and latent heat.

The system is based on transcritical CO2 cycles, water storage and salt-water ice storage and is designed for a capacity of 2hdischarge and equal charge and discharge power of 50MW. A two-step optimization procedure is used. The system intensive design parameters are optimized at the master level through a genetic algorithm. The optimal cycle mass flow rates are calculated in a nested linear programming step where the heat integration between the cycles is optimized subject to the heat transfer feasibility imposed through Pinch Analysis cascade calculations. The synthesis of the heat exchanger network and of the storage tank systems was solved through a set of heuristic rules. Equipment purchasing costs were estimated by means of cost functions that were built upon vendors quotations. The results are discussed by showing the Pareto fronts of the three optimization cases and the trends of the decision variables along each optimal front. Nine solutions are discussed in more detail by showing the values of the design parameters and the process flow diagrams including storage and heat exchanger layouts. Design guidelines are then formulated which can be used in future works for detail plant design. The topological features that are found to maximize the system performance at the minimum costs are: superheating before the CO2 heat pump, two independent systems of hot water storage tanks above and below the ambient temperature, and air cooling at the heat pump side. The design parameters that affect significantly the costs and performances are the cycle pressures. These are in fact directly associated with temperature differences both at the cold and hot storage sides which should be carefully optimized to obtain the best trade-off between exergy losses and costs for heat exchangers. Due to the change in specific heat of the supercritical CO2 along the temperature range of hot water storage, a system of multiple storage tanks was used. Intermediate storage tanks help reduce significantly the temperature differences at the hot storage side and therefore their number represent another critical design parameter that must be optimized to achieve the best trade-off between costs and performances. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Pinch analysis; Synthesis; TEES; Thermoeconomic optimization","Carbon dioxide; Conceptual design; Cooling systems; Costs; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Heat pump systems; Large scale systems; Linear programming; Synthesis (chemical); Tanks (containers); Water; Critical design parameters; Heat transfer feasibilities; Hot water storage tanks; Pinch analysis; TEES; Temperature differences; Thermoeconomic optimization; Transcritical CO; Optimization; carbon dioxide; conceptual framework; cost-benefit analysis; design; electricity generation; optimization; trade-off; Polygala incarnata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881110702

A method for rapid enumeration of testis-ova was developed and applied that increased the capacity to quantify intersex prevalence and severity. Male rainbow darters (Etheostoma caeruleum) sampled downstream of the first major wastewater outfall (Waterloo) had a significant increase, relative to 4 upstream reference sites, in the mean proportion of fish with at least 1 testis-oocyte per lobe of testes (9-20% proportion with ≤ 1 testis-oocyte/lobe vs 32-53% and >1.4 testis-oocyte/lobe). A much higher mean incidence of intersex proportion and degree was observed immediately downstream of the second wastewater outfall (Kitchener; 73-100% and 8-70 testis-oocyte/lobe); but only 6.3 km downstream of the Kitchener outfall, the occurrence of intersex dropped to those of the reference sites. In contrast, downstream of a tertiary treated wastewater outfall on a small tributary, intersex was similar to reference sites. Estrogenicity, measured using a yeast estrogen screen, followed a similar pattern, increasing from 0.81±0.02 ng/L 17b-estradiol equivalents (EEq) (Guelph), to 4.32±0.07 ng/L (Waterloo), and 16.99±0.40 ng/L (Kitchener). Female rainbow darter downstream of the Kitchener outfall showed significant decreases in gonadosomatic index and liver somatic index, and increases in condition factor (k) relative to corresponding reference sites.

We have found the serpentinites from the Great Serpentinite Belt in New South Wales to be particularly suitable for heat activation, as opposed to the partly serpentinised ultramafic minerals of the Coolac Serpentinite Belt. The activation strategy comprises prograde heating to produce an active material with 20% OHres and the recovery of ~80% of the sensible heat from the dehydroxylated mineral. The strategy also involves direct combustion of natural gas to supply an energy input of at least 574MJ (tSerpentinite)-1, to minimise secondary CO2 emissions generated from the thermal activation of serpentinite. A CO2 penalty of about 7% yields 0.93 net tonne of available active serpentine per tonne of serpentinite feedstock. The cost for serpentinite heat activation for this practical heating strategy amounts to A$ 1.25 per tonne of available active serpentine. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 mineralisation; CO2 sequestration; Thermal activation","Active material; Direct combustion; Heat activation; Heating strategy; Mineralisation; New South Wales; New South Wales , Australia; Thermal activation; Chemical activation; Mineralogy; Serpentine; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; cost-benefit analysis; mineralization; natural gas; sensible heat flux; serpentine; serpentinite; serpentinization; Australia; New South Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879344312

The study focused on technical and cost issues of a pilot-project set up in an environmental protection area, located in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. A comparative analysis of the costs of the hybrid system after optimization was made with the aid of the HOMER© (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables) program. The analysis shows that the optimal system's initial cost, net present cost, and electricity cost with the hydrogen storage system is US$ 87,138; US$102,323; and US$ 1.351/kWh, respectively. Components are costly (fuel cell and electrolyzer), with the photovoltaic modules and the electrolyzer presenting the main cost of system.

The indirect heating flat plate integrated collector storage solar water heating system is one of the compact systems for domestic water heating. It incorporates the collection of a solar energy component and a hot water storage component in one unit. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of different parameters on the thermal performance of this system with the aim of reducing both the initial and the running costs. The outlet service water temperature was used as a measure of performance, because it is an indicator of the energy acquired from the solar radiation. The continuity, momentum and energy equations of the fluids involved in the system were numerically solved in a steady state condition, using FLUENT software. Three-D CFD models were developed and validated using previous experimental results. A standard k-ω turbulent model was used in the optimization of the heat exchanger because it produced good agreement with the experimental results. The surface-to-surface radiation model was included. The effect of single and double row heat exchangers with different lengths was investigated. Circular and elliptic cross-section pipes were also examined. Mass flow rates of 500 and 650 L/h were chosen. The results showed that the single row HX of 10.8 m length for both the elliptical and type B tube gave high service water outlet temperature (acceptable for heat exchanger design) and with low pumping power. This resulted in an increase in the thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in both the initial and the operating costs of the system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","CFD; FLUENT; Heat exchanger; Solar water heater system","CFD models; Compact system; Domestic water heating; Elliptic cross-sections; Energy components; Energy equation; Energy usage; Flat plate; FLUENT; FLUENT software; Heat exchanger design; Hot water storage; Integrated collector storage; Mass flow rate; Measure of performance; Outlet temperature; Pumping power; Radiation models; Renewable energy source; Running cost; Solar water heating systems; Steady-state condition; Thermal efficiency; Thermal Performance; Turbulent models; Water temperatures; Computational fluid dynamics; Environmental impact; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Solar water heaters; Sun; Heat exchangers; computational fluid dynamics; cost-benefit analysis; design; environmental impact; heat balance; heating; integrated approach; momentum; numerical model; optimization; pumping; renewable resource; software; solar power; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874814773

Wind farms and solar power plants will supply load centers with green power over long distances. This paper focuses on the introduction of the concept, showing that a globally interconnected network can be technologically feasible and economically competitive. We further highlight the multiple opportunities emerging from a global electricity network such as smoothing the renewable energy supply and electricity demand, reducing the need for bulk storage, and reducing the volatility of the energy prices.

However, a number researchers have recently pointed out that ad-supported free apps involve hidden costs to the users. Costs are primarily associated with the loss of privacy due to personal data collection, using data from the mobile data quota and draining of smartphone battery. The alternative proposals for the problem do not address all of these issues. We propose a novel ads delivery architecture, which addresses all these issues, by extending the users' personal domain to the cloud through personal cloudlets. Personal cloudlets preserve user privacy by only releasing high level user information to the ad network, reduce energy consumption by performing the computations, communications and storage in the ""cloud"", and minimize the bandwidth usage by passing only selected information between personal cloudlet and the smartphone. Furthermore, the proposed architecture, provides a number of incentives for ad networks to use the architecture. © 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

These nanowires exhibit higher activity for methanol and ethanol oxidation in alkaline media compared to pure Pd, quantified by cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, the Pd-BMG nanowire electrocatalyst has a 300 mV lower onset potential for CO oxidation suggesting improved poisoning resistance beyond pure Pd. The Pd-BMG electrocatalyst activation energies for methanol and ethanol oxidation of 22 and 17 kJ mol-1 are lower than the pure Pd values of 38 and 30 kJ mol-1, respectively. Unique properties of BMGs (homogeneity, viscosity, surface tension) facilitate the formability into high surface area electrocatalysts at low processing temperatures.

However, the effect of preparation methods and conditions on morphology and energy storage characteristic has not been extensively investigated and will be explored in this project. InVO4 anode material was prepared using five different preparation methods: solid state, urea combustion, precipitation, ball-milling, and polymer precursor methods. Morphology and physical properties of InVO4 were then analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area method. XRD patterns showed that orthorhombic phased InVO4 was synthesized. Small amounts of impurities were observed in methods II, III, and V using XRD patterns. BET surface area ranged from 0.49 to 9.28 m2 g-1. SEM images showed slight differences in the InVO4 nanosized crystalline structures with respect to preparation methods and conditions. Energy storage studies showed that, among all the preparation methods, the urea combustion method produced the best electrochemical results, with negligible capacity fading between the 2nd and 50th cycles and high capacity of 1241 mA h g -1 at the end of the 20th cycle, close to the theoretical capacity value. Precipitation method also showed good performance, with capacity fading (14%) and capacity of 1002 mA h g-1 at the 20th cycle.

The system used was comprised of six double-pass solar collectors with porous media in the second channel, which were connected in a series of three collectors in two banks and a drying chamber. Two conditions of the EFB sample were considered in the drying test; treated and untreated. A simple water washing treatment was used to treat the first sample to reduce its ash content whereas the second sample was untreated in its original condition.

However, the sensor nodes have severe constraints, such as: low network bandwidth, short wireless communication range, and limited CPU processing capacity, memory storage and power supply. Therefore, maximizing the benefits of limited resources in WSNs have become one relevant and challenging issue. One of the most relevant problem is related with the energy consumption during data transmission, since, sensor nodes are battery-powered and recharging or replacing batteries, in most cases, is infeasible. Communication in WSN consumes more energy than sensing and processing performed by the network nodes. The strategy proposed in this paper, to reduce the energy consumption, consists in optimizing the operations of routing protocols. The WSN routing protocols must have self configuration features in order to find out which is the best route for communication, thus increasing delivery assurance and decreasing the energy consumption between nodes that comprise the network. This paper presents a proposal for estimating the quality of routes using fuzzy systems to assist the Directed Diffusion routing protocol. The fuzzy system is used to estimate the degree of the route quality, based on the number of hops and the energy level of the nodes that compose a route. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to adjust, in an automatic way, the rule base of the fuzzy system in order to improve the classification strategy of routes, hence increasing the energy efficiency of the network. The simulations showed that the proposal is effective from the point of view of three metrics: packet loss rate, message delay to the sink node and time of death of the first sensor node. © 2013 IEEE.","Ant Colony Optimization; Fuzzy Inference Systems; Routing; Sensor Nodes; Sink Nodes; WSN","Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Fuzzy inference systems; Routing; Sink nodes; Wireless communications; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); WSN; Wsn routing protocols; Algorithms; Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Communication; Data handling; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuzzy systems; Routing protocols; Wireless telecommunication systems; Sensor nodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881607903

We use the descriptors PTtCz, PT(tCz)0.9(DBT) 0.1, PT(tCz)0.64(DBT)0.36, PT(tCz) 0.45(DBT)0.55, and PTDBT to identify each of these conjugated polymers, with the names denoting the compositions of the bulky pendants. The tunable energy levels of the PTs were accomplished by incorporating both tCz as a donor pendant and DBT as an acceptor pendant, while retaining the low-lying HOMO levels (-5.26 to -5.39 eV). Furthermore, lower bandgaps were observed for the DBT-derived PTs because of stronger donor-π-acceptor characteristics and more efficient intramolecular charge transfer. Conventional PSCs were fabricated by spin-coating the blend of each PT and the fullerene derivative (PC71BM). The conventional PSC devices exhibited high open circuit voltages (Voc) of around 0.79-0.91 V. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs based on PTtCz : PC 71BM (w/w = 1 : 2.5) reached 2.48% with a Voc of 0.91 V, short circuit current (Jsc) of 6.58 (mA cm-2) and fill factor (FF) of 41% under the illumination of AM1.5, 100 mW cm-2.

However, the maximum energy density of lithium-ion batteries is insufficient for the extended range of EVs propulsion. On the other hand, metal-air batteries have a greater power storage capacity, a few times more than the best performing lithium-ion batteries. Mechanically rechargeable zinc (Zn)-, magnesium (Mg)-, and aluminum (Al)-air batteries are receiving increasing attention, due to the advantages of using safe, low cost and abundant materials. If successfully developed, these batteries could provide an energy source for EVs comparing that of gasoline in terms of usable energy density. Nevertheless, there are still numerous scientific and technical challenges that must be overcome, if this alluring promise can be turned into reality.

One possible solution involves converting and reusing RO elements for ultrafiltration (UF) applications. This study aims to systematically investigate the treatment of used RO elements with 300,000ppmh sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) to remove the active polyamide layer thus exposing the microporous polysulfone (PSf) UF support layer. An optimised conversion method is proposed by determining the initial membrane condition and corresponding performance in terms of rejection of proteins and humic compounds, pathogen removal and fouling rate. A number of different membrane types and conditions were studied and their permeability performance varied from 9.3 to 116.3Lm-2h-1bar-1 for pre-wetted samples. It was shown that flux recovery of dedicated RO membranes was unsuccessful and that storage conditions and dryness affected the conversion process. The converted membranes demonstrated a 2.4log removal of virus sized particles, and were comparable to 10kDa UF in terms of protein and humic substance rejection and fouling propensity. A number of applications and the limitations of this novel concept are also discussed, including preliminary results for a gravity fed drinking water treatment system for decentralised applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Conversion; Membrane; Reuse; Reverse osmosis; Storage","Chemical conversions; Conversion methods; Conversion process; Fouling propensities; Reuse; Sodium hypochlorites; Storage condition; Water and wastewater; Energy storage; Proteins; Reverse osmosis; Ship conversion; Viruses; Wastewater disposal; Membranes; hypochlorite sodium; polyamide; polysulfone; article; biofouling; humic substance; membrane biology; membrane permeability; particle size; priority journal; reverse osmosis; storage; virus particle; waste component removal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881516110

This paper evaluates the biochemical methane (CH4) potential, apparent first-order hydrolysis rate coefficient, and losses in organic content of manure as it ages on feedlot pads and in stockpiles. Chemical characterization of fresh, pad, and stockpiled manure isassessed. Biochemical CH4 potential on volatile solids (VS) almost always decreased significantly from fresh to pad and from pad to stockpile, ranging (in mL CH4 g VS-1 fed) from 230 to 360 in fresh manure, from 70 to 280 in pads, and from 60 to 200 in stockpiles. Kinetics of degradation also varied with manure age (fresh: 0.12 ± 0.01 d-1; pad: 0.06 ± 0.02 d-1; and stockpiled: 0.05 ± 0.04 d-1). At least 50%, and up to 80%, of the original biochemical CH4 potential of the manure (i.e., degradable material) was lost on drying in pads, and the loss after stockpiling was much greater (&gt;85%). The loss of N was 15 to 60% as manure dried on pads and was much greater after stockpiling (40-90%).

To reduce the emission, the eco-friendly electric vehicles (EVs) have been introduced in underground mining. This EV consists of a wheel/axle, final drive, traction motor and energy storage. The model of this vehicle is developed based on the ADVISOR platform, where the model mainly focuses on the low speed and heavy load driving cycle (with steep gradients and bumpy roads) which is designed with variable rolling resistance and variable gradients to simulate the real road condition in underground mines and a four wheel drive (4WD) vehicle is adopted by modifying the EV model in ADVISOR. Given current commercial EV batteries with the main concerns of the safety in underground mining, the LiFeP04 battery is chosen for this vehicle. The extra weight added over that of a conventional battery and motor systems to enhance the anti-explosion performance is considered in the model. The simulation is conducted to evaluate the operation performances of the proposed vehicle (i.e. acceleration, gradient, motor performance, energy storage). The results show that the vehicle is suitable for the low speeds and steep roads under the specific driving conditions in underground mines. © 2013 IEEE.","4WD; anti-explosion; electric vehicle; LiFePO4 battery; underground mines; variable rolling resistance","4WD; Anti-explosion; Anti-explosion performance; Conventional batteries; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Four-wheel drive (4WD); LiFePO4; Underground mine; Commercial vehicles; Diesel engines; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Industrial electronics; Rolling resistance; Underground equipment; Underground mine transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881467974

In particular, many of these require the bulk production of graphene materials, using approaches such as the oxidation of graphite to graphite oxide with chlorate or manganate oxidants in the presence of strong acids. This is followed by its reduction via thermal exfoliation, or through chemical and electrochemical reduction methods. Elemental potassium is a very strong reducing agent with a chemical potential of ca. E = -2.93 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode. Therefore, in this paper we evaluate the effects of the presence of elemental potassium as a strong reductant during the thermal exfoliation of graphite oxides. We employ both the Hofmann (concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids with KClO4) and Hummers (concentrated sulfuric acid with NaNO3 and KMnO4) methods of graphite oxidation, followed by their thermal reduction at 500°C both in the absence and presence of elemental potassium. Collectively, these treatments invariably result in differences in morphologies, defect densities and the quantities of oxygen-containing groups within these materials, thus affecting their heterogeneous electron transfer rates and electrochemistry. Extensive analyses with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET surface area analysis, combustible elemental analysis and cyclic voltammetry (CV) are performed to elucidate the different properties and characteristics of our materials. We observed that the elemental potassium-assisted thermal reduction of graphene oxide led to a product with increased heterogeneous electron transfer rates towards the Fe(CN)64-/3- redox probe, despite having more oxygen-containing groups. This is in contrast to prior reports where larger amounts of oxygen groups corresponded to poorer electrochemistry. There were also no significant differences in the density of sp3 defects between the graphene materials. Hence, this improved electrochemistry may be attributed to the formation of stable complexes between potassium and oxygen groups on the graphene surface in a manner we propose to be similar to carboxylic acid salts. These results would therefore have important implications in our understanding of oxygen-containing groups in graphene materials and their influence on their inherent electrochemistry. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",,"Concentrated sulfuric acids; Electrochemical reductions; Electron transfer kinetics; Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy; Heterogeneous electron transfer; Oxygen containing groups; Powder X ray diffraction; Standard hydrogen electrodes; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrolytic reduction; Electron transitions; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Graphene; Graphite; Oxygen; Photoelectrons; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Electrochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881462787

Due to the nature of the incident, a continuous supply of relatively fresh, unemulsified oil was available for burning. Once the source of fresh oil was controlled, the ISB operations were quickly curtailed by the ongoing emulsification of the remaining oil. The objective of this scoping study was to determine, through tank testing, whether proven, broad-spectrum emulsion breaking chemicals could be applied to emulsified oil contained in a fire boom to reduce its water content sufficiently to allow ignition and efficient burning. Future work is necessary to refine and define the parameters necessary for applying to a response scenario. Small-scale and wave tank experiments were undertaken at the SL Ross lab. In the first series of experiments, small standardized tests were undertaken to identify three crude oils in storage at the SL Ross lab that formed stable, high water content emulsions for the experiments. In the second series, small amounts of a contained emulsion were placed in an enclosed flexible, rectangular floating containment system (100 cm long, × 20 cm wide) constructed of 30-cm height boom material on the surface of the new wind/wave tank. Demulsifier was placed drop wise onto the surface of the slick which was then subjected to wave action. Small grab samples of the slick were taken over a period of one hour, and then analyzed to monitor water content. Final testing involved bench scale ignition tests using emulsion samples collected from selected wave tank tests. The test matrix included varying demulsifier dosage, wave energy, slick thickness, oil type, and initial water content of the emulsion. Some positive results in the water content and ignition tests indicated that the demulsifier was starting to have a beneficial impact in breaking the emulsion but the right mixing energy may not have been imparted to the emulsions during the wave tank tests. This was reinforced by the observations of the emulsions breaking readily when they were siphoned off the water surface during cleanup between test runs. Additional testing to evaluate if higher wave energy would be sufficient to increase the positive impact of the demulsifier is recommended.",,"Containment systems; Emulsified oil; Gulf of Mexico; High water content; Initial water contents; Mixing energies; Standardized tests; Wave tank tests; Contamination; Demulsification; Emulsification; Experiments; Production platforms; Starting; Tanks (containers); Technical presentations; Wave energy conversion; Oil booms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881419437

In this study, MnO2 microspheres (MS-MnO2) with a 3D spinel phase and 0.5-4.0 μm size were constructed from small MnO2 nanoparticles by a rapid and facile solvothermal process in which tetraethylammonium (TEA) was used as the template. The properties of the synthesized spinel MS-MnO2 for use in supercapacitors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements using a three-electrode system in a neutral 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The synthesized spinel MS-MnO 2 exhibited faster charge/discharge rates and higher capacitance than commercial MnO2 materials. The obtained results showed that the as-prepared spinel MS-MnO2 possessed good specific capacitance (SC) of ∼190 F/g at 0.5 A/g. The spinel MS-MnO2 also exhibited excellent SC retention and Coulombic efficiency of ∼100% and ∼95%, respectively, after 1000 cycles at 1 A/g, suggesting its potential application in supercapacitors.

Therefore, the multi-mode fiber which has much larger core diameter has been widely used in high data traffic application. The quality of end surface of fiber dominates the data transmitting efficiency. But the quality of cutting end surface which cut by the traditional mechanical fiber cleaving method was not good enough for the requirement of multimode fiber. In the recent year, the pulse CO2 laser was introduced to cleave the fibers. The optical system setup, laser pulse parameters, such as laser pulse energy, pulse width and number of laser pulse, will affect the quality of end surface of fiber. In this paper, the pulse CO2 laser fiber cleaving technology will be developed and the experimental setup will be introduced. And the relationships between the quality of cutting end surface and the cleaving parameters will be studied.

In recent years, the switching behavior has been widely reported, and understanding the switching mechanism can improve the stability and scalability of devices. We designed an innovative sample structure for in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to observe the formation of conductive filaments in the Pt/ZnO/Pt structure in real time. The corresponding current-voltage measurements help us to understand the switching mechanism of ZnO film. In addition, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) have been used to identify the atomic structure and components of the filament/disrupted region, determining that the conducting paths are caused by the conglomeration of zinc atoms. The behavior of resistive switching is due to the migration of oxygen ions, leading to transformation between Zn-dominated ZnO1-x and ZnO. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","In situ TEM; nanofilament; redox; resistive switching; RRAM; unipolar","In-situ TEM; nanofilament; redox; Resistive switching; RRAM; unipolar; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; In situ processing; Nonvolatile storage; Random access storage; Transmission electron microscopy; Zinc; Zinc oxide; Switching systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881584143

In this paper we present the analysis of two of these short-term energy storage devices, namely double layer capacitors and thin-film batteries. We present different harvesting architectures using these buffer elements and compare their advantages and disadvantages in relation to being used in low-power wireless sensor network applications.

The underlying objective is to build a solar fuel generator which is economically viable and environmentally benign. Hydrogen generation by solar water splitting in photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) is currently experiencing a renaissance, and the search for high performance but low-cost photoelectrode materials is an on-going quest. We present here a photoanode heterostructure of hematite and NiO/α-Ni(OH)2, which is very efficient. We prepared the heterostructure by a ""two reactor"" hydrothermal modification of a pristine hematite film. The system shows promising current density of 16 mA cm-2, several times higher than that of the pristine hematite film. In addition, the system shows charge storing capacity once exposed to AM 1.5 simulated sunlight, along with electrochromic behaviour. Interestingly, the water splitting proceeds as a dark reaction after several hours of light exposure. The abrupt increase in current density originates from the oxidized Ni(OH)2 layer which is absent in the case of pn-junction-like devices made by mere deposition of NiO on hematite by thermal annealing. Hematite alone shows no such behaviour. This kind of new PEC electrode offers a low-cost and simple way for the dual purpose applications of water splitting and charge storage.

Weight losses of samples were determined by Thermal Gravimetry Analysis (TGA). The microencapsulated samples with 23% and 49% paraffin showed less decomposition after 330 °C than with higher percentage of paraffin. These samples were then subjected to a thermal cycling test. Thermal properties of microencapsulated paraffin wax were evaluated by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). Structure stability and compatibility of core and coating materials were also tested by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR), and the surface morphology of the samples are shown by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). It has been found that the microencapsulated paraffin waxes show little change in the latent heat of fusion and melting temperature after one thousand thermal recycles. Besides, the chemical characteristics and structural profile remained constant after one thousand thermal cycling tests.

This study is the first to examine the effect of temperature on jump energy at each life stage of any orthopteran. Ballistics and high-speed cinematography were used to quantify the energy, distance, and take-off angle of the jump at 15, 25, and 35°C in the locust Locusta migratoria. Allometric analysis across the five juvenile stages at 35°C reveals that jump distance (D; m) scales with body mass (M; g) according to the power equation D = 0.35M0.17±0.08 (95% CI), jump take-off angle (A; degrees) scales as A = 52.5M0.00±0.06, and jump energy (E; mJ per jump) scales as E = 1.91M1.14±0.09. Temperature has no significant effect on the exponent of these relationships, and only a modest effect on the elevation, with an overall Q10 of 1.08 for jump distance and 1.09 for jump energy. On average, adults jump 87% farther and with 74% more energy than predicted based on juvenile scaling data. The positive allometric scaling of jump distance and jump energy across the juvenile life stages is likely facilitated by the concomitant relative increase in the total length (Lf+t; mm) of the femur and tibia of the hind leg, Lf+t = 34.9M0.37±0.02. The weak temperature-dependence of jump performance can be traced to the maximum tension of the hind femur muscle and the energy storage capacity of the femur's cuticular springs. The disproportionately greater jump energy and jump distance of adults is associated with relatively longer (12%) legs and a relatively larger (11%) femur muscle cross-sectional area, which could allow more strain loading into the femur's cuticular springs. Augmented jump performance in volant adult locusts achieves the take-off velocity required to initiate flight. © 2013 Snelling, et al.",,"allometry; article; body mass; bone length; controlled study; energy expenditure; energy transfer; femur; jumping; life cycle; locomotion; Locusta migratoria; muscle contraction; nonhuman; temperature; temperature dependence; velocity; Animals; Body Weight; Female; Locomotion; Locusta migratoria; Male; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881538120

Studies suggest that it may be related to the presence of metabolic diseases, including obesity. Objective: A bibliographic survey was carried out upon the relationship between the intestinal microbiota and obesity and the possible impacts of the use of prebiotics and probiotics, aiming to understand this complex and promising interaction. Methods: A search was conducted in the Lilacs, PubMed, SciElo and ScienceDirect databases, using the keywords ""gut microbiota"" and ""obesity"". Results and discussion: We identified 613 original studies. After careful selection, 61 original articles were included in this review. The others indicated that there are differences in the microbial composition between obese and non-obese patients and the possible mechanisms involved. Alteration is caused in the energy homeostasis, in the use of dietary intake and storage of lipids due to the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Among the studies that evaluated the microbiota modulation, seven used probiotics; 24 used prebiotics, and five studies were performed using food. After dietary manipulation, the growth of bifidobacteria was obtained in 10 studies, in association with weight reduction, adipogenic effects of diet, intestinal permeability and inflammatory markers.

The exchange length is of primary importance because it governs the width of the transition between magnetic domains. Unfortunately, there is some confusion in the literature between the magnetostatic exchange length and a similar distance concerning magnetization reversal mechanisms in particles known as the characteristic length. This confusion is aggravated by the common usage of two different systems of units, SI and cgs.

The goal is to minimize the costs of purchasing electricity from the grid and the costs associated with battery aging (cost of battery degradation is modeled in daily dispatching). Grid-connected photovoltaic system assumed to be available in the typical residential consumer considered in our study. Electricity generated from the PV is used to charge the battery and supply the house's demand. If the consumer is net metered, any exceeding can be sold back to the grid. PV/Storage system can reduce costs of purchasing electricity from the grid through peak shaving and load shifting. The rate structure determines which application is being used. Load shifting application is implemented when time-of-use pricing is in effect and peak shaving application is beneficial when the consumers are charged for peak of the demand. Optimal sizing and dispatch scheduling of the battery for both pricing structures are determined and effectiveness of each application in reducing costs is evaluated.

Such migrants depend on the efficient packaging, storage and utilization of energy to succeed. A diverse assemblage of organisms accomplishes this through the use of lipid reserves; yet, it remains unclear whether the migrations of elasmobranchs, which include the largest gill breathers on Earth, depend on such a mechanism. We examine depth records from pop-up satellite archival tags to discern changes in buoyancy as a proxy for energy storage in Eastern Pacific white sharks, and assess whether lipid depletion fuels long-distance (approx. 4000 km) migrations. We develop new algorithms to assess body condition, buoyancy and drift rate during drift dives and validate the techniques using a captive white shark. In the wild, we document a consistent increase in drift rate over the course of all migrations, indicating a decrease in buoyancy caused by the depletion of lipid reserves. These results comprise, to our knowledge, the first assessment of energy storage and budgeting in migrating sharks. The methods provide a basis for further insights into using electronic tags to reveal the energetic strategies of a wide range of elasmobranchs. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Whilst the inclusion of small Reverse Osmosis (RO) units may function as a (useful) dump load, it also directly impacts the power management of remote hydrogen generation systems affecting operational characteristics. This research investigates the impact on the hydrogen generation system when simulations utilise different methods to account for solar power needed to drive the system as well as varying scales of (short-term) battery capacity. The simulations, in MATLAB/Simulink, utilise two specific methods of irradiance prediction (ASHRAE clear sky model and Neural Networks) and are benchmarked against measured irradiance data for Geraldton (Western Australia). This imposes different levels of accuracy and intermittency. Laboratory testing and device-level models help simulate the operational characteristics of a hydrogen generation system including on-site water production. Operational characteristics studied include: total energy available for PEM electrolysis, ontime of the electrolyser in steady-state, the number of start/stop cycles for the electrolyser and its duty factor (litres of hydrogen generated over the total number of start/stops). Results show that increasing systems' battery capacity only affects the operational characteristics of a PEM electrolyser up to a threshold capacity (Ah). Increasing battery capacity generally allows for more renewable energy penetration. Additionally, the hydrogen generation system behaviour is (generally) more accurately predicted, across all battery capacities, when Neural Networks are used to predict the availability of solar irradiance. The ability to predict accurate levels of solar irradiance becomes more important in winter when irradiance is at its lowest. The results also highlight the need to use highly resolved (temporal) simulations which are able to better capture device-level operational characteristics.

Among the many definitions of efficiency, exergetic efficiency is the most rigorous and often the most adequate for analyzing the efficiency of a process. Exergy is the maximum work obtainable from a system as it comes into equilibrium with its environment. Exergetic efficiency is illustrated here with the heating of buildings. The right concept to analyze the trade-off between efficiency and the initial capital cost of equipment is the net present value analysis. We discuss two examples, overhead power lines and energy storage. Electrothermal energy storage is a new energy storage technology that builds on both concepts, optimization of exergetic efficiency and balancing of initial cost with that efficiency.

This in large part is due to the filamentary nature of the RRAM element at the nanoscale. A filament-based resistive memory is based on the formation of current-conducting path (filaments) from defects, e.g., oxygen vacancies. The defects often lead to trap-limited current conduction.

Similar to other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease is the result of an immune response to self-antigens leading to tissue destruction and production of autoantibodies. Common diseases like celiac disease have a complex pattern of inheritance with inputs from both environmental as well as additive and non-additive genetic factors. In the past few years, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been successful in finding genetic risk variants behind many common diseases and traits. To complement and add to the previous findings, we performed a GWAS including 206 trios from 97 nuclear Swedish and Norwegian families affected with celiac disease. By stratifying for HLA-DQ, we identified a new genome-wide significant risk locus covering the DUSP10 gene. To further investigate the associations from the GWAS we performed pathway analyses and two-locus interaction analyses. These analyses showed an over-representation of genes involved in type 2 diabetes and identified a set of candidate mechanisms and genes of which some were selected for mRNA expression analysis using small intestinal biopsies from 98 patients. Several genes were expressed differently in the small intestinal mucosa from patients with celiac autoimmunity compared to intestinal mucosa from control patients.

The proposed converter has potential applications such as front-end dc/dc power conversion for fuel cell and photovoltaic inverters, bidirectional converters for fuel cell vehicles, energy storage, etc. This proposed converter provides a simple solution to the switch turn-off voltage spike problem without any additional components or snubber. It leads to reduced size, lower cost, compactness, and higher conversion efficiency. In addition, the proposed converter has reduced peak current through the components (semiconductor devices and transformer) that reduces their volt-ampere rating and size compared to active-clamped zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) current-fed converters. Voltage across the primary switches is naturally clamped without an additional active clamp or snubber circuit. In addition, voltage across the switch is independent of the duty cycle. ZCS of the primary switches, natural commutation of secondary diodes, and zero-current turn-on of secondary switches are achieved. Therefore, switching transition losses are significantly reduced. Steady-state analysis, operation with the proposed novel ZCS concept, and design of the converter are reported. A 200-W laboratory converter prototype has been built. Experimental results as well as simulation results are presented to validate the analysis and design. A comparison with existing active-clamped ZVS current-fed half-bridge converters has been discussed.

This paper presents an electricity and heat generation scheduling method coordinated with PEV charging in an IMG considering photovoltaic (PV) generation systems coupled with PV storages. The proposed method is based on dynamic optimal power flow (DOPF) over a 24-hour period and includes security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF), IMG's factories constraints, PV storage constraints and PEVs dynamic charging constraints. It will utilize the generators waste heat to fulfill thermal requirements while considering the status of renewable DERs to decrease the overall cost of IMGs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, detailed simulation results are presented and analyzed for an 18-bus IMG consisting of 12 factories and 6 types of PEVs without/with PV generation systems operating in grid-connected and stand-alone modes.

At low to moderate temperatures, serpentinization of peridotite produces alkaline fluids that are rich in CH4 and H2. Upon mixing with seawater, these fluids precipitate carbonate, forming an extensive network of calcite veins in the basement rocks, while H2 and CH4 serve as an energy source for microorganisms. Here, we analyzed the carbon geochemistry of two ancient peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems: 1) ophiolites cropping out in the Northern Apennines, and 2) calcite-veined serpentinites from the Iberian Margin (Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 149 and 173), and compare them to active peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems such as the Lost City hydrothermal field (LCHF) on the Atlantis Massif near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR).Our results show that large amounts of carbonate are formed during serpentinization of mantle rocks exposed on the seafloor (up to 9.6wt.% C in ophicalcites) and that carbon incorporation decreases with depth. In the Northern Apennine serpentinites, serpentinization temperatures decrease from 240°C to &lt;150°C, while carbonates are formed at temperatures decreasing from ~150°C to &lt;50°C. At the Iberian Margin both carbonate formation and serpentinization temperatures are lower than in the Northern Apennines with serpentinization starting at ~150°C, followed by clay alteration at &lt;100°C and carbonate formation at &lt;19-44°C. Comparison with various active peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems on the MAR shows that the serpentinites from the Northern Apennines record a thermal evolution similar to that of the basement of the LCHF and that tectonic activity on the Jurassic seafloor, comparable to the present-day processes leading to oceanic core complexes, probably led to formation of fractures and faults, which promoted fluid circulation to greater depth and cooling of the mantle rocks. Thus, our study provides further evidence that the Northern Apennine serpentinites host a paleo-stockwork of a hydrothermal system similar to the basement of the LCHF. Furthermore, we argue that the extent of carbonate uptake is mainly controlled by the presence of fluid pathways. Low serpentinization temperatures promote microbial activity, which leads to enhanced biomass formation and the storage of organic carbon. Organic carbon becomes dominant with increasing depth and is the principal carbon phase at more than 50-100m depth of the serpentinite basement at the Iberian Margin. We estimate that annually 1.1 to 2.7×1012g C is stored within peridotites exposed to seawater, of which 30-40% is fixed within the uppermost 20-50m mainly as carbonate. Additionally, we conclude that alteration of oceanic lithosphere is an important factor in the long-term global carbon cycle, having the potential to store carbon for millions of years. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Iberian Margin; Northern Apennine; Ocean Drilling Program; Ophiolites; Serpentinization","Carbon sequestration; Iberian Margin; Northern Apennine; Ocean drilling programs; Ophiolites; Serpentinization; Buildings; Calcite; Carbon; Carbonation; Clay alteration; Complex networks; Lithology; Pore pressure; Seawater; Submarine geology; Cooling systems; basement rock; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; carbonate; geochemistry; hydrothermal system; Ocean Drilling Program; oceanic crust; oceanic lithosphere; ophiolite; organic carbon; peridotite; precipitation (chemistry); serpentinite; serpentinization; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantis Massif; Iberian Margin; Mid-Atlantic Ridge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879010230

Specifically, new studies have revealed that the NR4A subgroup (of the NR superfamily) are strikingly sensitive to beta-adrenergic stimulation in skeletal muscle, and transgenic studies in mice have revealed the expression of these NRs affects endurance and glycogen levels in muscle. Furthermore, other studies have demonstrated that one of the NR coregulator class of enzymes that mediate chromatin remodeling, the histone methyltransferases (for example, protein arginine methyltransferase 4) regulates the expression of several genes involved in glycogen metabolism and glycogen storage diseases in skeletal muscle. Importantly, NRs and histone methyltransferases, have the potential to be pharmacologically exploited and may provide novel targets in the quest to treat disorders of glycogen storage. © 2013 IUBMB Life, 65(8):657-664, 2013 © 2013 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.","glycogen; nuclear receptors","catecholamine; cell nucleus receptor; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; histone methyltransferase; hormone receptor; hormone receptor 4a; nuclear receptor nr4a; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; protein arginine methyltransferase; protein arginine methyltransferase 4; unclassified drug; beta adrenergic stimulation; chromatin assembly and disassembly; energy metabolism; epigenetics; exercise; fatty acid oxidation; gene control; gene expression; glycogen metabolism; glycogen storage disease; human; oxidative phosphorylation; review; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; transcription regulation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886368558

Accumulating evidence suggests that nutrition during pregnancy and early postnatal life is one of the most important environmental cues that programs microbiological, metabolic, and immunologic development. The neonatal period is crucial for the early microbial colonization of the almost sterile gastrointestinal tract of the newborn infant. These first colonizers play an important role in host health because they are involved in nutritional, immunologic, and physiologic functions. Evidence from animal and human studies indicates that the composition of the gut microbiota has an effect on body composition, digestion, and metabolic homeostasis. Furthermore, the functionality of the metabolism develops after birth when the newborn is first exposed to nutrition via the gastrointestinal tract. Exposure to environmental microbial components is also suggested to have a key role in the maturation process of the immune system, and in turn the immune system shapes the composition of the microbiota. Therefore, the use of nutritional strategies to program the microbiota composition to favor a more beneficial bacterial population and to support the development of the metabolic and immune systems may provide a good opportunity to prevent later health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and allergy. © 2013 American Society for Nutrition.",,"arachidonic acid; essential fatty acid; lactoferrin; linoleic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; prebiotic agent; probiotic agent; synbiotic agent; transcription factor PDX 1; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; allergy; antibiotic associated diarrhea; antibiotic therapy; article; atopic dermatitis; atopy; bacterial cell; Bifidobacterium breve; bioavailability; birth; birth weight; body composition; body fat; body weight; brain development; carbohydrate metabolism; cell proliferation; child development; developmental stage; diet supplementation; digestion; DNA methylation; dyslipidemia; eczema; energy balance; energy expenditure; environmental change; environmental exposure; environmental factor; Escherichia coli; fat intake; fatty acid oxidation; gastrointestinal tract; gestational age; homeostasis; host pathogen interaction; human; immune response; immune system; immunocompetent cell; infection; infectious diarrhea; inflammation; insulin sensitivity; intestine flora; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; maternal obesity; metabolic disorder; microbial colonization; microflora; newborn period; nonhuman; obesity; perinatal development; perinatal period; physical activity; postnatal growth; prematurity; prenatal period; proadipocyte; protein expression; regulatory T lymphocyte; Staphylococcus; Th1 cell; third trimester pregnancy; weight gain; Breast Feeding; Dietary Fats, Unsaturated; Female; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Immune System; Infant; Infant Formula; Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Infant, Newborn; Metagenome; Nutritional Status; Prebiotics; Pregnancy; Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Probiotics; Synbiotics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881239290

FdhAB and FdhABC3 were recently shown to be the main enzymes present during growth with lactate, formate or hydrogen. To address the role of these two enzymes, ΔfdhAB and ΔfdhABC3, mutants were generated and studied. Different phenotypes were observed in the presence of either molybdenum or tungsten, since both enzymes were important for growth on formate in the presence of Mo, whereas in the presence of W only FdhAB played a role. Both DfdhAB and ΔfdhABC3 mutants displayed defects in growth with lactate and sulfate providing the first direct evidence for the involvement of formate cycling under these conditions. In support of this mechanism, incubation of concentrated cell suspensions of the mutant strains with lactate and limiting sulfate also gave elevated formate concentrations, as compared to the wild-type strain. In contrast, both mutants grew similarly to the wild-type with H2 and sulfate. In the absence of sulfate, the wild-type D. vulgaris cells produced formate when supplied with H2 and CO2, which resulted from CO2 reduction by the periplasmic FDHs. The conversion of H2 and CO2 to formate allows the reversible storage of reducing power in a much more soluble molecule. Furthermore, we propose this may be an expression of the ability of some sulfate-reducing bacteria to grow by hydrogen oxidation, in syntrophy with organisms that consume formate, but are less efficient in H2 utilization. © 2013 SGM.",,"formate dehydrogenase; lactic acid; molybdenum; sulfate; tungsten; article; cell suspension; deletion mutant; Desulfovibrio vulgaris; energy metabolism; oxidation; phenotype; priority journal; reservoir; wild type; Carbon Dioxide; Desulfovibrio vulgaris; Energy Metabolism; Formate Dehydrogenases; Formates; Gene Deletion; Hydrogen; Lactates; Molybdenum; Sulfates; Tungsten",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881225162

The search for efficient materials to satisfy the increasing demand for CCS has become extremely important. Porous materials, including porous silica, porous carbons, and newly developed metal-organic frameworks and porous organic polymers, possessing regular and well-defined porous geometry and having a high surface area and pore volume, have been widely studied for separations on laboratory scale. On account of the dipole-quadrupole interactions between the polarizable CO 2 molecule and the accessible nitrogen site, the investigations have indicated that the incorporation of accessible nitrogen-donor groups into the pore walls of porous materials can improve the affinity to CO2 and increase the CO2 uptake capacity and selectivity. The CO 2-adsorption process based on solid nitrogen-rich porous adsorbents does generally not require heating of a large amount of water (60-70 wt %) for regeneration, while such a heating approach cannot be avoided in the regeneration of amine-based solution absorption processes. Thus, nitrogen-rich porous adsorbents show good regeneration properties without sacrificing high separation efficiency. As such, nitrogen-rich porous materials as highly promising CO2 adsorbents have been broadly fabricated and intensively investigated. This Focus Review highlights recent significant advances in nitrogen-rich porous materials for CCS.

Design: Double-blind study was conducted to compare the influence on the biomechanics of gait of the CR Equipements SACH foot and the SACH foot. Setting: University hospital research center. Participants: Participants with unilateral transtibial amputation (N=15) were included. Interventions: Three-dimensional motion analysis system and 2 forceplates were used to capture body motion and ground reaction forces during gait at a self-selected speed and at 1.2m/s. Main Outcome Measures: Nonparametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests were used to compare the 2 prosthetic feet with respect to their spatiotemporal (gait velocity, stride length, and percentage of stance phase), kinematic (range and peak angles of the pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle), and kinetic (peak moment and power of the hip, knee, and ankle) parameters. Results: Compared with the SACH foot, the CR Equipements SACH foot demonstrated a significantly greater stance phase symmetry ratio (SACH: 94% vs CR Equipements SACH: 97%), a more extensive ankle range of motion in the sagittal plane (SACH: 7 vs CR Equipements SACH: 12), a greater maximal dorsiflexion angle during the terminal stance phase (SACH: 10 vs CR Equipements SACH: 13), and a higher ankle power (SACH:.31W/kg vs CR Equipements SACH:.40W/kg). No significant difference was found for the examined knee, hip, and pelvis parameters. Conclusions: The CR Equipements SACH foot provides more symmetry and improves ankle kinematics and kinetics in the sagittal plane compared with the SACH foot.

Validation of the unsteady flow computation results with experimental data found in the literature has shown a good agreement. Different computation test cases were run to systematically analyse the effects of key geometrical and operating parameters on the system performance. The CFD results confirmed the importance of combined effects on the performance of thermal storage tanks and showed that an appropriately designed storage tank can provide improved stratification conditions. Moreover, 3D transient CFD simulations can be used as an effective tool to optimise thermal storage tank parameters at early design stages, thus it may add to the value of the storage tank performance and efficiency, by optimising the whole solar thermal energy storage system design and size. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of torrefaction treatment on the weight loss and energy properties of fast growing species in Malaysia (Acacia spp., and Macaranga spp.) as well as oil palm biomass (oil palm trunk and empty fruit bunch). The lignocellulosic biomass was torrefied at three different temperatures 200, 250 and 300. °C for 15, 30 and 45. min. Response surface methodology was used for optimization of torrefaction conditions, so that biofuel of high energy density, maximized energy properties and minimum weight loss could be manufactured. The analyses showed that increase in heating values was affected by treatment severity (cumulated effect of temperature and time). Our results clearly demonstrated an increased degradation of the material due to the combined effects of temperature and treatment time. While the reaction time had less impact on the energy density of torrefied biomass, the effect of reaction temperature was considerably stronger under the torrefaction conditions used in this study. It was demonstrated that each biomass type had its own unique set of operating conditions to achieve the same product quality. The optimized torrefaction conditions were verified empirically and applicability of the model was confirmed. The torrefied biomass occurred more suitable than raw biomass in terms of calorific value, physical and chemical properties.

The torrefaction kinetic behavior of two woody biomass samples (aspen and birch) and their individual constituents (cellulose, xylan -hemicellulose proxy- and lignin) was studied in detail. The materials were torrefied in a fixed-bed reactor up to 280. °C and were characterized after 15. min and 60. min treatments in terms of their energy density, energy yield, H, O and C contents, humidity uptake and FTIR vibrational spectra. Regardless of mildness (240. °C) or severity (280. °C) of torrefaction, hemicellulose was the most reactive. Compared to torrefied cellulose, lignin exhibited considerable activity and increased heating value under severe torrefaction (280. °C). Likewise, the increase in heating value of torrefied cellulose was less significant than that of lignin due to cellulose energy loss because of production of tar compounds. The release of volatiles versus time for cellulose, xylan and lignin torrefaction reactions measured using a thermogravimetric method was also modeled for each lump by means of the distributed activation energy model and a three-parameter log-normal distribution function. The model was found to fit the experimental data for xylan and lignin torrefaction while it showed slight under-prediction in the case of cellulose torrefaction. The distributed activation energy models developed for the individual lumps were combined into a meta-model to apprehend the torrefaction kinetics of actual (aspen and birch) woody biomass by assuming parallel and independent involvement of their three constituents present under various compositions. The model was found to represent with very good agreement the experimental data of aspen and birch torrefaction. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Cellulose; Distributed activation energy model; Lignin; Lignocellulosic biomass; Torrefaction; Xylan","Distributed activation energy model; Fixed-bed reactors; Lignocellulosic biomass; Log-normal distribution; Thermochemical Conversion; Thermogravimetric method; Torrefaction; Xylan; Activation energy; Biomass; Digital storage; Energy dissipation; Kinetics; Lignin; Metal cladding; Cellulose",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880377223

The CF has high stiffness and strength-to-weight ratios and a carbonaceous microstructure which enables Li intercalation. An innovative in situ technique for studying the longitudinal expansion of the CF and the relationship with the amount of intercalated Li is described in the present paper. The polyacrylonitrile-based CFs, T800H and unsized IMS65, were chosen for their electrochemical storage capacities. It was found that the CF expands during lithiation and contracts during delithiation. At the first electrochemical cycle, the expansion is partly irreversible which supports that the first-cycle capacity loss partly relates to Li trapped in the CF structure. For the following cycles, the capacity and the expansion are reversible. The expansion, which might relate to tensile stress, increases up to 1% as the measured capacity approaches the theoretical limit of 372 mAh/g for Li storage in graphite. Minor additional expansions due to the uneven distribution of intercalated Li in the CF structure were measured before and after lithiations. Using scanning electron microscope images the transverse expansion of fully lithiated CFs was estimated to about 10% of the cross-section area. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Electrochemical cycle; Electrochemical storage; In-situ techniques; Lithium Intercalation; Longitudinal expansions; Scanning Electron Microscope; Strength to weight ratio; Theoretical limits; Carbon fibers; Expansion; Scanning electron microscopy; Lithium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877692135

One option is Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) which aims to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power generation and industry and store it permanently in geologic structures. For a comprehensive comparative assessment of the environmental performance of CCS technologies life cycle assessment (LCA) is required. This study provides a systematic comparison of LCA-based environmental performances of fossil and wood power plants as well as cement production in Europe for 2025 and 2050 with and without CCS. The implementation of CCS leads to life cycle GHG emission reductions of 68-92% for fossil power generation and 39-78% for cement production whilst to negative ones for wood power generation. There are trade-offs with respect to environmental and human health impacts due to direct (e.g. air emissions) and indirect (e.g. coal mining) impacts of the increase in fuel use and additional processes and materials necessary for CCS.

These meteorological changes will have associated impacts to surface and shallow subsurface thermal regimes, which are of interest to practitioners and researchers in many disciplines of the natural sciences. For example, groundwater temperature is critical for providing and sustaining suitable thermal habitat for cold-water salmonids. To investigate the surface and subsurface thermal effects of atmospheric climate change, seven downscaled climate scenarios (2046-2065) for a small forested catchment in NB, Canada were employed to drive the surface energy and moisture flux model, ForHyM2. Results from these seven simulations indicate that climate change-induced increases in air temperature and changes in snow cover could increase summer surface temperatures (range -0.30 to +3.49 C, mean +1.49 C), but decrease winter surface temperatures (range -1.12 to +0.08 C, mean -0.53 C) compared to the reference period simulation. Thus, changes to the timing and duration of snow cover will likely decouple changes in mean annual air temperature (mean +2.11 C) and mean annual ground surface temperature (mean +1.06 C). <br><br> Projected surface temperature data were then used to drive an empirical surface to groundwater temperature transfer function developed from measured surface and groundwater temperature. Results from the empirical transfer function suggest that changes in groundwater temperature will exhibit seasonality at shallow depths (1.5 m), but be seasonally constant and approximately equivalent to the change in the mean annual surface temperature at deeper depths (8.75 m). The simulated increases in future groundwater temperature suggest that the thermal sensitivity of baseflow-dominated streams to decadal climate change may be greater than previous studies have indicated. © Author(s) 2013.",,"Global climate model; Ground surface temperature; Groundwater temperatures; Mean annual air temperatures; Northern Hemispheres; Precipitation regimes; Surface temperatures; Thermal sensitivity; Catchments; Climate change; Climate models; Digital storage; Forestry; Groundwater; Runoff; Snow; Surface properties; Transfer functions; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; anthropogenic effect; baseflow; climate change; climate modeling; forested catchment; global climate; groundwater; hydrological response; hydrometeorology; Northern Hemisphere; salmonid; seasonality; snow cover; surface temperature; temperature effect; thermal regime; water temperature; Canada; New Brunswick",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880670323

In comparison to the mixture, the ryegrass showed lower crude ash, crude protein, crude fiber and digestible crude protein contents, but higher sugar and fructan contents and more digestible energy for horses, which was estimated on the basis of the nutritional values. The conservation systems either hay or haylage, had a significant effect on the crude protein, the digestible crude protein and fructan contents. The crude protein and digestible crude protein in the hay were lower than in the haylage; however, the fructan contents were higher. There were considerable differences in the microbiological quality of hay and haylage. The hay was not dry enough at baling (DM-content < 82%) and therefore, the hay had a high mould infestation after the storage period.

Recent research reveals that energy storage systems (ESSs) have a great potential to be used to mitigate power system vulnerability. However, their benefits greatly depend on the locations and capacities of ESSs installed. Therefore this study aims to find the optimal locations and capacities of ESSs for power system vulnerability mitigation. A vulnerability assessment is proposed in this study to calculate the impact factors for power systems based on generator and line outages. A bus impact severity (BIS) analysis is then designed and used to find the vulnerable buses in the power system. Formulations of optimal locations and capacities for ESS placement are derived and solved by a genetic algorithm-based method. Since better locations for ESS placement can be found, the search space for ESS placement can be reduced effectively. Accordingly, the computational time for finding the optimal solution can be saved and the possibility to obtain a global optimum solution can be improved. Test results show that the proposed method can be used to find the optimal locations and capacities for ESS placement and mitigate system vulnerability effectively. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",,"Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Global optimum solutions; Power system planning and operation; Power system vulnerability; System vulnerability; Vulnerability assessments; Vulnerability mitigation; Energy storage; Optimization; Electric power systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880379994

Also with the aim to study the apparent activation energies (Eaa) and its associated wearout mechanisms of both Au and Cu wire in semiconductor device packaging. This paper discusses the influence of wire type on the long-term reliability and mechanical performance after several component reliability stress tests. Design/methodology/approach - A fineline ball grid array (FBGA) package with Cu and Au wire bonds was assembled with green molding compound and substrate. Samples are subjected for long-term high temperature storage bake test at elevated temperatures of 150°C, 175°C and 200°C. Long-term reliability plots (lognormal plots) are established and Eaa of both ball bonds are determined from Arrhenius plots. Detailed failure analysis has been conducted on failed sample and HTSL failure mechanisms have been proposed. Findings - Reliability results show Au ball bond in FBGA package is observed with higher hour-to-failure compared to Cu ball bonds. The Eaa value of high temperature storage life (HTSL) reliability for Au ball bond is lower than Cu ball bond. Typical HTSL failure mechanism of Au ball bond is induced by micro-voiding and AuAl intermetallic compound (IMC) micro-cracks while CuAl IMC micro-cracking (induced by Cl- corrosion attack and micro-cracking) caused wearout opens in Cu ball bond. These test results affirm the test-to-failure data collected is a useful method for lifetime prediction and Eaa calculation. Practical implications - The paper reveals higher reliability performance of Cu ball bond in FBGA flash memory package which can be deployed in flash memory FBGA packaging with optimised package bill of materials. Originality/value - The test-to-failure methodology is a useful technique for wearout reliability prediction and Eaa calculation. Copyright © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

During the past decade, cold thermal energy storage (CTES) systems have been widely used for their significant economic benefits. However, there were always doubts about their energy saving possibilities. The main objective of the present work is to develop a computer model to determine the potential energy savings of implementing CTES systems in Malaysia. A case study building has been selected to determine the energy consumption pattern of an office building. In the first step the building baseline model was developed and validated with the recorded data from the fieldwork. Once the simulation results reach an acceptable accuracy, different CTES system configuration was added to the model to predict their energy consumption pattern. It was found that the overall energy used by the full load storage strategy is considerably more than the conventional system. However, by applying the load leveling storage strategy, and considering its benefits to reduce the air handling unit size and reducing the pumping power, the overall energy usage was almost 4% lower than the non-storage system. Although utilizing CTES systems cannot reduce the total energy consumption considerably, but it has several outstanding benefits such as cost saving, bringing balance in the grid system, reducing the overall fuel consumption in the power plants and consequently reducing to total carbon footprint. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The prediction of model is in good agreement with the experimental data. The effect of convective heat transfer on the melting rate of PCM is assessed. Through a parametric study, the effect of the temperature, PCM phase change temperature range, and the temperature difference of the incoming air and PCM melting temperature on thermal performance of PCM is undertaken. The temperature difference between the air as a heat transfer fluid (HTF) and the PCM melting point has a significant effect on the performances of a LHTES system. The thermal energy retrieved from the centralized LHTES system is the highest when the inlet air temperature is about 10 K higher than the PCM mean melting temperature. Correlations are obtained for the distribution of melting front and solid fraction as a function of time during charging and discharging of LHTES.

The H2 binding affinity is improved from about 0.72 kJ/mol (on the pristine (8, 0) CNT surface) to about 6.47-7.17 kJ/mol on the -NH2 and -OH functionalized CNTs. Additionally, the chemical functionalization leads to a dramatic HOMO-LUMO energy gap opening and also significant increase of the work function of the CNT. This will raise the potential barrier of the electron emission from the tube surface, making the field emission difficult. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Bandgap; DFT; Hydrogen storage","Binding affinities; Chemical functionalization; DFT; Functionalized carbon nanotubes; HOMO-LUMO energy gap; Hydrogen adsorption capacity; Molecular hydrogen; Potential barriers; Binding energy; Carbon nanotubes; Energy gap; Functional groups; Hydrogen storage; Adsorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880056112

To explore this possibility, a systematic study was performed on the type-II Si clathrate (Si136) using first-principles electronic structure calculations. The investigation focuses on five key properties of a good anode material, viz. structural stability, electrical conductivity, intercalation voltage, Li ion mobility, as well as storage capacity. Since pristine Si136 is thermodynamically less stable with respect to crystalline Si, we focus on clathrates which are stabilized by doping Ba atoms in the large cages of empty Si136. The lithiation of BaxSi136 (6 ≤ x ≤ 8) clathrates was then studied. It is found that the volume change associated with lithiation is negligibly small. The intercalation voltages are very low (∼0.4 V) and almost constant with Li concentration. Two distinct diffusion mechanisms for Li ion transport in the clathrates were identified. The lowest energy diffusion pathway (0.33 eV) is through the hexagonal face shared by two adjacent large 51264 cages. The Li diffusion between 512 and 512 or 512 and 51264 cages through a pentagonal face has a higher energy barrier of 0.73-0.85 eV. The Li diffusion through a pentagonal face is found to be a complicated process involving sequential breaking and reformation of a particular Si-Si bond from the clathrate structure. Moreover, the activation barrier is reduced substantially from 2.08 eV by the simultaneous presence of Ba atoms in the two neighboring 51264 cages connected by the Si-Si bond. Although the maximum theoretical capacity (123 mA h g-1) is lower than that of the graphite anode, it is still comparable with the current cathode materials. The information obtained in this study will be helpful to assess whether Si clathrates can be used as anode materials. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Activation barriers; Diffusion mechanisms; Electrical conductivity; Electronic structure calculations; Higher-energy barriers; Intercalation voltages; Maximum theoretical capacities; Structural stabilities; Anodes; Calculations; Cathodes; Chemical bonds; Diffusion; Electronic structure; Hydrates; Lithium; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Stability; Silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880054255

We choose three models based on different perspectives, i.e. thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, and mere observation (empiricism), and evaluate their applicability in order to describe the sorption behaviour. Additionally, we propose a model which is based on a cumulative distribution function. In order to evaluate the models, the hydrogen absorption and desorption isotherms of LaNi5 and LaNi4.5Co0.5 are measured by means of a gravimetric technique. A nonlinear regression is performed to fit the models to experimental data. The computed model parameters are compared to values reported in the literature.

Mussels are filter feeders and accumulate nutrients bound in e.g. phytoplankton. When harvested and used onshore, their accumulated nutrients are removed from the water, thus decreasing eutrophication. This LCA study assessed the environmental impact of mussel farming on the Swedish coast of the Baltic Sea for subsequent use as agricultural fertiliser. The functional unit was related to the agronomic value of the mussels, including plant-available nitrogen, phosphorus and liming effect. Flow of cadmium to soil was also assessed. In one scenario the mussels were composted and in another they were inertly stored to avoid nitrogen losses and other emissions from storage. Use of mussels on agricultural land fulfils three functions: fertilisation, liming and a reduction in eutrophication. The results clearly showed the importance of integrated assessment of these three functions. Due to significant nitrogen losses from the composting process, the compost scenario resulted in a higher impact on acidification, global warming potential and energy use than the inert storage scenario. Alternative techniques to composting for handling mussels should thus be developed, for example direct use of the mussels as fertiliser without prior storage, or inert storage. Energy use was strongly related to production of materials for mussel cultivation, so choice and life length of materials is important when introducing mussel farming. The cadmium content of mussels is relatively high, but they often supply less cadmium to the field than the fertiliser and liming products they replace. Reducing eutrophication by cultivating mussels for fertiliser proved more energy-efficient than reducing eutrophication in wastewater treatment plants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Structural/non-structural building fabric components, such as ventilated concrete slabs (VCS) can actively store and release thermal energy effectively by passing air through their embedded air channels. These building components can be described as ventilated BITES systems. To assist the thermal analysis and control of BITES systems, modeling techniques and guidelines for FR and LPFD models of VCS are presented in this two-part paper. In this first part, modeling techniques for FR and LPFD approaches based on network theory are presented. A method for calculating the heat transfer between flowing air and ventilated components is developed for these two approaches. Discretization criteria for explicit LPFD models are discussed. For the FR approach, discrete Fourier series in complex frequency form are used to represent the boundary excitations. In the treatment of heat injection from the flowing air as internal source in the VCS, network techniques such as Thévenin theorem, heat flow division, and Y-diakoptic transform are employed. The techniques presented in this paper are applicable to other BITES with hydronic or electric charging/discharging systems.

DDR-DRAM idle periods heavily depend on the last-level cache. Exhaustive search using processor-memory simulators can take several months. This paper for first time proposes a fast framework called XDRA, which allows the exploration of last- level cache configurations to improve DDR-DRAM energy efficiency. XDRA combines a processor-memory simulator, a cache simulator and novel analysis techniques to produce a Kriging based estimator which predicts the energy savings for differing cache configurations for a given main memory size and application. Errors for the estimator were less than 4.4% on average for 11 applications from mediabench and SPEC2000 suite and two DRAM sizes (Micron DDR3- DRAM 256MB and 4GB). Cache configurations selected by XDRA were on average 3.6 and 4 more energy efficient (cache and DRAM energy) than a common cache configuration. Optimal cache configurations were selected by XDRA 20 times out of 22. The two suboptimal configurations were at most 3.9% from their optimal counterparts. XDRA took a few days for the exploration of 330 cache configurations compared to several hundred days of cycle-accurate simulations, saving at least 85% of exploration time.

This occurs through screening of the internal electric field by the photoexcited carriers, leading to a larger, more stable polarization state that may be suitable for applications in areas such as data and energy storage. © 2013 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880798767

To avoid decreasing the stability margin at high energy, the longitudinal emittance must be continuously increased during the acceleration ramp. Longitudinal blowup provides the required emittance growth. The method was implemented through the summer of 2010. Band-limited RF phase-noise is injected in the main accelerating cavities during the whole ramp of about 11 min. Synchrotron frequencies change along the energy ramp, but the digitally created noise tracks the frequency change. The position of the noise-band, relative to the nominal synchrotron frequency, and the bandwidth of the spectrum are set by pre-defined constants, making the diffusion stop at the edges of the demanded distribution. The noise amplitude is controlled by feedback using the measurement of the average bunch length. This algorithm reproducibly achieves the programmed bunch length of about 1.2 ns2, at flat top with low bunch-to-bunch scatter and provides a stable beam for physics coast. The noise can be injected either in the beam phase loop or directly in the cavity voltage set point. These two different technical implementations are presented and their respective advantages analyzed. The performance of the algorithm and its further applications are also presented in this paper. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Accelerators; Beam dynamics; Collective effects and instabilities; Storage rings and colliders","Accelerating cavities; Beam dynamics; Collective effects; Large Hadron Collider; Large Hadron collider LHC; Longitudinal emittance; Longitudinal stability; Technical implementation; Algorithms; Particle accelerators; Microstrip devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879827412

In comparison to the bulk energy storage system, the VRESS is more agile smaller, faster, lower power. This new voltage regulation scheme reduces capacitance on the dc bus, with the aim of reducing peak discharge currents during faults. Sizing and rating of the VRESS must consider power ramp rates of both the generating units and the loads.

Storage at room temperature is one of the key requirements for the practical viability of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Be-BTB has an exceptional 298 K storage capacity of 2.3 wt % hydrogen. This result is surprising given that the low adsorption enthalpy of 5.5 kJ mol-1. In this work, a combination of atomistic simulation and continuum modeling reveals that the beryllium rings contribute strongly to the hydrogen interaction with the framework. These simulations are extended with a thermodynamic energy optimization (TEO) model to compare the performance of Be-BTB to a compressed H2 tank and benchmark materials MOF-5 and MOF-177 in a MOF-based fuel cell. Our investigation shows that none of the MOF-filled tanks satisfy the United States Department of Energy (DOE) storage targets within the required operating temperatures and pressures. However, the Be-BTB tank delivers the most energy per volume and mass compared to the other material-based storage tanks.

The milling energy in a magneto-mill is estimated by a semi-empirical method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) measurements show that for the molar ratios n &lt; 1.0 three new phases such as LiH, amorphous Mg(NH2)2 (a-Mg(NH2)2) and Li 2Mg(NH)2 are formed during ball milling depending on the injected quantity of milling energy. Hydrogen is not released during milling when the LiH and a-Mg(NH2)2 hydrides are being formed whereas the formation of the Li2Mg(NH)2 hydride phase is always accompanied by a profound release of hydrogen. For the molar ratios n ≥ 1.0, at a low level of injected milling energy, the hydride phases formed are LiH and a-Mg(NH2)2. The latter reacts with MgH 2 during further milling to form the new phase MgNH whose formation is also accompanied by a profound release of hydrogen.

The study is focused on the wall bistability, a factor of potential interest for information storage. A strong impact of elastic effects on the wall structure is demonstrated. It is shown that the conclusion derived earlier by Houchmandzadeh, neglecting the electrostictive coupling, that all the domain walls near the boundary between two ordered phases become bistable may not hold due to the elastic effects. Criteria for domain-wall bistability are formulated in terms of the materials thermodynamic properties and the wall orientation. The obtained general results are applied to the analysis of bistability of 180 domain walls in Pb(Zr c,Ti1-c)O3 near the tetragonal-rhombohedral morphotropic boundary. It is shown that, on the tetragonal side, the electrostrictive interaction suppresses the wall bistability that was predicted in terms of the theory neglecting the elastic effects. On the rhombohedral side, the domain walls are found bistable or not depending on the anisotropy of the correlation energy, the information on which is not presently available.

The thickness of the graphene encapsulation could then be varied by the amount of graphene oxide (GO) solution used in the preparation. Electron microscopy confirmed the successful coating of graphene as a thin layer on the NP aggregate surface.

Intracellularly they are enclosed by another larger vesicle, a so called ""storage vesicle"" equivalent to a multivesicular body of late endosomal origin. Prostasomes in their extracellular context are thought to play a crucial role in fertilization. Methods Prostasomes were purified according to a well worked-out schedule from seminal plasmas obtained from human, canine, equine and bovine species. The various prostasomes were subjected to SDS-PAGE separation and protein banding patterns were compared. To gain knowledge of the prostasomal protein systems pertaining to prostasomes of four different species proteins were analyzed using a proteomic approach. An in vitro assay was employed to demonstrate ATP formation by prostasomes of different species. Results The SDS-PAGE banding pattern of prostasomes from the four species revealed a richly faceted picture with most protein bands within the molecular weight range of 10-150 kDa. Some protein bands seemed to be concordant among species although differently expressed and the number of protein bands of dog prostasomes seemed to be distinctly fewer. Special emphasis was put on proteins involved in energy metabolic turnover. Prostasomes from all four species were able to form extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP formation was balanced by ATPase activity linked to the four types of prostasomes. Conclusion These potencies of a possession of functional ATP-forming enzymes by different prostasome types should be regarded against the knowledge of ATP having a profound effect on cell responses and now explicitly on the success of the sperm cell to fertilize the ovum. General significance This study unravels energy metabolic relationships of prostasomes from four different species. © 2013 The Authors.","Energy metabolism; Extracellular ATP; Microvesicles; Prostasomes; Seminal plasma","5' nucleotidase; 6 phosphofructokinase; adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); adenosine triphosphate; adenylate kinase; alpha enolase; aminopeptidase; annexin; beta actin; CD147 antigen; CD9 antigen; clusterin; cofilin 1; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; elongation factor; fructose bisphosphate aldolase; glucose 6 phosphate isomerase; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; hexokinase; lactate dehydrogenase; phosphoglycerate kinase; phosphoglycerate mutase; protein 14 3 3; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; pyruvate kinase; sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transporting adenosine triphosphatase; triosephosphate isomerase; tubulin; animal cell; article; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; fertilization; glycolysis; human; human cell; in vitro study; liquid chromatography; male; membrane vesicle; molecular weight; nonhuman; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; prostasome; protein purification; proteomics; seminal plasma; sperm; spermatocyte; tandem mass spectrometry; Energy metabolism; Extracellular ATP; Microvesicles; Prostasomes; Seminal plasma; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Cattle; Dogs; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Horses; Humans; Male; Organelles; Bovinae; Canis familiaris; Equidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879495832

Resonant spin depolarization was employed in the beam energy measurement, since it is presently the highest precision technique and an uncertainty of order 10-6 was achieved at SPEAR3 and AS. Using the resonant depolarization technique, the beam energy was measured at various rf frequencies to measure the linear momentum compaction factor. This measured linear momentum compaction factor was used to evaluate models of the beam trajectory through combined-function bending magnets. The main bending magnets of both lattices are rectangular, horizontally defocusing gradient bending magnets. Four modeling approaches are compared for the beam trajectory through the bending magnet: a circular trajectory, linear and nonlinear hyperbolic cosine trajectories, and numerical evaluation of the trajectory through the measured magnetic field map. Within the uncertainty of the measurement the momentum compaction factor is shown to agree with the numerical model of the trajectory within the bending magnet, and disagree with the hyperbolic cosine approximation.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883549451

Continuous monitoring is of paramount importance to reduce such irregularities, thus requiring reliable analytical methods, which should be simple, fast, and minimize both reagent consumption and waste generation. The potential for in-situ monitoring is also highly desirable. Flow analysis plays an important role in this sense, by means of automated sample processing in closed systems, under highly reproducible conditions. In spite of this potential, application for routine fuel analysis is yet limited and wide dissemination is desirable.

Options to produce greener, cost effective, and reliable source of alternative energy need to be explored and exploited. One of the major advances in the development of this sort of power source was done by integrating (or hybridizing) multiple different alternative energy sources (e.g., wind turbine generators, photovoltaic cell panels, and fuel-fired generators, equipped with storage batteries) to form a distributed generation (DG) power system. However, even with DG power systems, cost effectiveness, reliability, and pollutant emissions are still major issues that need to be resolved. The model development and optimization of the DG power system were carried out successfully in the previous work using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The goal was to minimize cost, maximize reliability, and minimize emissions (multi-objective function) subject to the requirements of the power balance and design constraints. In this work, the optimization was performed further using Hopfield neural networks (HNN), PSO, and HNN-PSO techniques.

Efficient operation of the converter is crucial in order to maintain the energy of traction battery for a longer time and for increasing driving distance. Light load efficiency of the dc-dc converter is especially important because this converter is lightly loaded most of the time while the car is being driven. The passive asymmetrical auxiliary circuit used to extend the soft switching range, produces extra circulating currents that increases conduction losses. A new technique for controlling circulating currents in the auxiliary circuit is introduced that with a small increase in controller complexity, reduces conduction losses and improves the converter efficiency especially at light load. By proper duty cycle control of the full bridge switches, auxiliary circulating currents are reduced to the minimum possible values required for ZVS. While phase shift angle mainly serves as the output regulation control parameter, duty cycle is varied to keep converter in the soft switching region with minimum conduction losses. Theoretical analysis and operating principles as well as soft switching operation are discussed. Experimental results for a 2KW converter are presented that validate the significant improvement in efficiency and considerable saving of valuable energy storage. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Circulating current; Converter efficiency; Full-bridge dc-dc converters; Light-load efficiency; Operating principles; Output regulation control; Plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV); Switching operations; DC-DC converters; Electric vehicles; HVDC power transmission; Power electronics; Soft switching; Zero voltage switching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879375702

Thermal hydraulic modeling of VRB energy storage systems is an important issue and temperature has remarkable impacts on the battery efficiency, the lifetime of material and the stability of the electrolytes. In this paper, a lumped model including auxiliary pump effect is developed to investigate the VRB temperature responses under different operating and surrounding environmental conditions. The impact of electrolyte flow rate and temperature on the battery electrical characteristics and efficiencies are also investigated. A one kilowatt VRB system is selected to conduct numerical simulations. The thermal hydraulic model is benchmarked with experimental data and good agreement is found. Simulation results show that pump power is sensitive to hydraulic design and flow rates. The temperature in the stack and tanks rises up about 10 C under normal operating conditions for the stack design and electrolyte volume selected. An optimal flow rate of around 90 cm3 s-1 is obtained for the proposed battery configuration to maximize battery efficiency. The models developed in this paper can also be used for the development of a battery control strategy to achieve satisfactory thermal hydraulic performance and maximize energy efficiency. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In the proposed design, coupled inductors are used to provide power factor correction (PFC) and to provide part of the required energy with the DC-link capacitor to the output. As a result, low ripple output current is still achieved even when the size of the DC-link capacitor is reduced, which allows the film capacitor to be used to replace the conventional unreliable electrolytic capacitor.

The options investigated include lignin extraction, electricity production, capturing of CO2 and black liquor gasification with production of electricity or biofuels, here DME. The investment options are compared with respect to annual net profit and global CO2 emissions for different future energy market scenarios. A further analysis of how different parameters such as policy instruments and investment costs affect the different technologies also is included. The results show that, generally, for reasonable levels of biofuel support, the best economic performance among the studied technologies is achieved by extraction of lignin valued as oil. However, if the level of support for biofuels is high, black liquor gasification with DME production generally has the best economic performance among the studied options. All the investment options investigated decrease global CO2 emissions significantly. Capturing and storing CO2 from the recovery boiler flue gases result in the highest CO2 emissions reduction and also is an economically attractive option in scenarios with a high CO2 emissions charge.

These three forms of energy were observed or estimated from observations taken during Joint Urban 2003 Campaign. The database includes net-radiation, soil temperature, ground heat flux, and turbulent fluxes. In most cases the estimates of the energy stored in the soil were obtained by assuming roughly a certain type of soil and an effective soil depth. From the residuals it seems to be possible to distinguish the urban boundary layer from the suburban boundary layer when plotted as a function of net-radiation. Hysteresis coefficients were computed for fits of net-radiation against R, ΔQS and Q G. In particular, the hysteresis patterns show that Q* vs. R represents clearer urban areas or suburban areas under the influence of an urban ""plume"". On the other hand, hysteresis curves obtained from ΔQS or Q G account for better the ground composition. A possible consequence is that the land use of urban areas could be roughly inferred from curve shapes such as Q* vs. R, or Q* versus another input variable representing the storage term. The objective is to show the variability of the subsurface-related energy fluxes across an urban area using these three different quantities and also to show that ΔQS, or R (and their corresponding hysteresis curves) are likely to be quantitatively different, which have not been clearly stated in the literature. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"boundary layer; energy flux; heat flux; net radiation; suburban area; urban area; Oklahoma [Oklahoma (STT)]; Oklahoma [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879156759

From the perspective of power systems, an introduction of plug-in electric vehicles presents many challenges but also opportunities to the operation and planning of power systems. On the one hand, if vehicles are considered regular loads without flexibility, uncontrolled charging can lead to problems at different network levels endangering secure operation of installed assets. However, with direct or indirect control approaches the charging of vehicles can be managed in a desirable way, e.g., shifted to low-load hours. Furthermore, vehicles can be used as distributed storage resources to contribute to ancillary services for the system, such as frequency regulation and peak-shaving power or help integrate fluctuating renewable resources. All these modes of operation need appropriate regulatory frameworks and market design if the flexibility of the vehicles is to be capitalized. In most of the proposed approaches, a so-called aggregator could be in charge of directly or indirectly controlling the charging of vehicles and serve as an interface with other entities such as the transmission system operator or energy service providers. However, fully decentralized schemes without an aggregator are also conceivable, for instance, to provide primary frequency control. Communication also plays a key role, as in most of the control schemes a significant amount of information needs to be transmitted between vehicles and control entities. The management of electric vehicles as distributed resources fits well in the paradigm of smart grids, where an advanced use of communication technologies and metering infrastructure, increased controllability and load flexibility, and a larger share of fluctuating and distributed resources are foreseen. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Amount of information; Communication technologies; Distributed resources; Distributed storage resources; Plug-in Electric Vehicles; Primary frequency control; Transmission system operators; Uncontrolled charging; Communication; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Global warming; Petroleum transportation; Smart power grids; Vehicle to vehicle communications",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878998896

The specially designed (512, 1,024) parity-check matrix is effective for partial parallel decoding by the min-sum algorithm (MSA). To increase throughput during decoding, two data frames are fed into the decoder to minimize idle time of the check node unit (CNU) and the variable node unit (VNU). Thus, the throughput is increased to almost two-fold. Unlike the conventional architecture, the message storage unit contains shift registers instead of de-multiplexers and registers. Therefore, hardware costs are reduced. Routing congestion and critical path delay are also reduced, which increases energy efficiency. An implementation of the proposed decoder using TSMC 0.18 μm CMOS process achieves a decoding throughput of 1.725 Gbps, at a clock frequency of 56 MHz, a supply voltage of 1.8 V, and a core area of 5.18 mm2. The normalized area is smaller and the throughput per normalized power consumption is higher than those reported using the conventional architectures. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Low-density parity-check codes; Shift-based LDPC decoder; VLSI decoder architectures","Critical path delays; LDPC decoder; Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes; Min-sum algorithms; Parallel decoding; Routing congestion; Variable node units; VLSI decoder architectures; CMOS integrated circuits; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Integrated circuit testing; Shift registers; Throughput; Decoding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878817018

We consider the reliability of two contract types: (1) fixed annual quantities, and (2) an inflow harvest function with storage. Our four-reservoir case in Sydney (Australia) has cross-correlated inflow data. To accommodate multi-reservoir cross-correlation we adapt Portfolio Theory from finance to lognormal reservoir inflows, re-framing traditional storage theory from the wholesaler's optimal operating policy to the retailer's optimal purchasing policy. We find that Reliability improves with access to a source pool (cf. fixed quantities from separate sources), demonstrating the 'insurance effect', and the portfolio that minimises lognormal variance also minimises harvest (and thus environmental impact). Reform direction in Australian (and other international) water markets is towards multi-provider vertical disintegration, which may reduce pool opportunities and negate the insurance effect. We consider diminishing reliability returns as reservoir harvesting increases, and conclude a retail portfolio of permanent contracts from reservoirs, plus short-term contracts from alternative sources (either independently or negatively cross-correlated) efficiently secures high reliability. The challenge in incomplete water markets remains in encouraging and sustaining supply diversification that may only be needed aperiodically during extreme droughts. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Contract; Cross-correlation; Hydrological volatility; Optimisation; Portfolio theory; Reliability; Retail water provider; Storage; Water supply system","Cross correlations; Hydrological volatility; Optimisations; Portfolio theories; Retail water provider; Commerce; Contracts; Digital storage; Energy storage; Environmental impact; Harvesting; Lakes; Optimization; Reliability; Reliability theory; Sales; Water supply systems; Reservoirs (water); modeling; optimization; policy approach; reliability analysis; retailing; theoretical study; water resource; water supply; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878755263

However, wind power is inherently intermittent and cannot be accurately predicted even in short time; thus increasing the imbalance costs paid by wind farm owners. To cope with these problems, some techniques have been proposed in literature including wind farm coupling to hydro units, energy storage facilities, and constructing a virtual power plant (VPP). This paper presents a stochastic profit-based model for day-ahead operational planning of a combined wind farm-cascade hydro system. The generation company (GenCo) that owns the VPP considers a portion of its hydro plants capacity to compensate the wind power forecast errors. The proposed optimization problem is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP), formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model. The day-ahead scheduling is a here and now decision and the optimal operations of facilities are resources variables. In order to protect the GenCo against low price scenarios and wind power variation, the conditional value at risk (CVaR) is used as the risk aversion criterion. The proposed model is successfully applied to a real case study and the results are presented and discussed. The results are illustrated varying in the risk aversion level and the penalty coefficients for negative/positive imbalances. It is shown that the bidding strategy of the GenCo varies significantly depending on the chosen penalty market mechanism. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cascade hydro system; Electricity market; Risk aversion; Virtual power plant; Wind power","Bidding strategy; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Day-ahead scheduling; Electricity market; Generation companies; Hydro plants; Hydro-system; Market mechanisms; Mixed-integer linear programming; Operational planning; Optimal operation; Optimal operation strategy; Optimization problems; Penalty coefficient; Risk aversion; Storage facilities; Two-stage stochastic programming; Virtual power plants; Wind farm; Wind power forecast; Wind power variations; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Optimization; Power plants; Profitability; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Wind power; decision making; electricity generation; electricity industry; market; optimization; risk assessment; stochasticity; strategic approach; wind farm",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872917714

Importantly, overweight and obese individuals often have higher circulating levels of the arachidonic acid-derived endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) and an altered pattern of receptor expression. Consequently, this leads to an increase in orexigenic stimuli, changes in fatty acid synthesis, insulin sensitivity, and glucose utilisation, with preferential energy storage in adipose tissue. As endocannabinoids are products of dietary fats, modification of dietary intake may modulate their levels, with eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid based endocannabinoids being able to displace arachidonic acid from cell membranes, reducing AEA and 2-AG production. Similarly, oleoyl ethanolamide, a product of oleic acid, induces satiety, decreases circulating fatty acid concentrations, increases the capacity for β-oxidation, and is capable of inhibiting the action of AEA and 2-AG in adipose tissue. Thus, understanding how dietary fats alter endocannabinoid system activity is a pertinent area of research due to public health messages promoting a shift towards plant-derived fats, which are rich sources of AEA and 2-AG precursor fatty acids, possibly encouraging excessive energy intake and weight gain. © 2013 Shaan S.

Moreover the assembled supercapacitor device yields a maximum energy density of 12 Wh kg-1, which is higher than that of commercially available supercapacitors. By taking advantage of the complex multilayered structure of a hemp bast fiber precursor, such exquisite carbons were able to be achieved by simple hydrothermal carbonization combined with activation.

In the past, complex material architectures have been achieved using a combination of top-down and bottom-up fabrication approaches. A remaining challenge, however, is the rapid, inexpensive, and simple fabrication of such materials systems using bench-top prototyping methods. To address this challenge, the properties of hierarchically structured electrodes are developed and investigated by combining three bench-top techniques: top-down electrode patterning using vinyl masks created by a computer-aided design (CAD)-driven cutter, thin film micro/nanostructuring using a shrinkable polymer substrate, and tunable electrodeposition of conductive materials. By combining these methods, controllable electrode arrays are created with features in three distinct length scales: 40 μm to 1 mm, 50 nm to 10 μm, and 20 nm to 2 μm. The electrical and electrochemical properties of these electrodes are analyzed and it is demonstrated that they are excellent candidates for next generation low-cost electrochemical and electronic devices.

In addition to their ecological benefits, aeolic and photovoltaic (PV) sources are highly scalable, and can be utilized for local generation and delivery, eliminating those energy losses normally associated with long-range grid distribution. This paper analyzes one specific type of renewable, local energy generation, applied to electric vehicle charging requirements. A PV source is explicitly posited, because solar panels can be placed above the vehicle parking space, and double as a shade provider. In the first part of this paper, the optimal requirements for overall system are derived. These will be used in the second part, in order to compare alternate power conditioning circuits for this task. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Battery storage; Charging; Dc-dc power conversion; Electric vehicles (EVs); Energy storage; Power electronics","Battery storage; Dc-dc power conversion; Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmentally responsible; Photovoltaic installation; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Transportation sector; Charging (furnace); Electric vehicles; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Power electronics; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879120929

The Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) is an important type of WG due to its robustness and versatility. Its accurate and efficient modeling is very important in distribution systems planning and analysis studies, as the older approximate representation method (the constant PQ model) is no longer sufficient given the scale of integration of WGs. This paper proposes a new three-phase model for the DFIG, compatible with unbalanced three-phase distribution systems, by deriving an analytical representation of its three major components, namely the wind turbine, the voltage source converter, and the wound-rotor induction machine. The proposed model has a set of nonlinear equations that yields the total three-phase active and reactive powers injected into the connected bus by the DFIG as a function of the bus voltage and wind speed. This proposed model is integrated with a three-phased unbalanced power flow method and reported in this paper. The proposed DFIG model is verified using Matlab-Simulink. IEEE 37-bus test system data from the IEEE Distribution System sub-committee is used to benchmark the results of the power flow method. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Since a CPL potentially threatens system stability, stability analysis of hybrid electric vehicle with CPLs becomes necessary. A new power buffer configuration with battery is introduced to mitigate the effect of instability caused by CPLs. Model predictive control (MPC) is applied to regulate the power buffer to decouple source and load dynamics. Moreover, MPC provides an optimal tradeoff between modification of load impedance, variation of dc-link voltage and battery current ripples. This is particularly important during transients or starting of system faults, since battery response is not very fast. Optimal tradeoff becomes even more significant when considering low-cost power buffer without battery. This paper analyzes system models for both voltage swell and voltage dip faults. Furthermore, a dual mode MPC algorithm is implemented in real time offering improved stability. A comprehensive set of experimental results is included to verify the efficacy of the proposed power buffer. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Battery energy storage; Constant power instability; Model predictive control (MPC); Power buffer","Battery energy storage; Constant power; Constant power load; Constant power load (CPLs); Increased momentums; Power buffers; Stability analysis; Vehicular systems; Electric load forecasting; Electric utilities; Hybrid vehicles; Model predictive control; Optimization; System stability; Predictive control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879092131

A novel secondary modulation technique is also proposed to clamp the voltage across the primary-side switches naturally with zero-current commutation. It, therefore, eliminates the necessity for an external active-clamped circuit or passive snubbers to absorb the switch turn-off voltage spike, a major challenge in current-fed converters. Zero-current switching of primary-side devices and zero-voltage switching of secondary-side devices are achieved, which significantly reduce switching losses. An interleaved design is adopted over a single cell to increase the power handling capacity obtaining merits of lower input current ripple, reduction of passive components' size, reduced device voltage and current ratings, reduced conduction losses due to current sharing, and better thermal distribution. Primary device voltage is clamped at rather low-reflected output voltage, which enables the use of low-voltage semiconductor devices having low on-state resistance. Considering input current is shared between interleaved cells, conduction loss of the primary side, a considerable part of total loss, is significantly reduced and higher efficiency can be achieved to obtain a compact and higher power density system. Steady-state operation, analysis, and design of the proposed topology have been presented. Simulation is conducted over software package PSIM 9.0.4 to verify the accuracy of the proposed analysis and design. A 500-W prototype has been built and tested in the laboratory to validate the converter performance. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Current-fed converter; Fuel-cell vehicle (FCV); Interleaving; Snubberless; Soft-switching","Current-fed converter; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Fuel cell vehicles; Interleaving; Low-voltage semiconductors; Power handling capacity; Snubberless; Zero-current commutation; DC-DC converters; Design; Electric vehicles; Fuel cells; Soft switching; Electric rectifiers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879077905

Internal, external, and internal-external fin enhancement techniques were studied to improve the heat transfer between the PCM and heat transfer fluid. Enhancement techniques were compared with the inside tube heating, outside tube heating, both tube heating as well as the finned and internally finned tube. The effects of fin length on the enhancement techniques were investigated.

From -21 through 10 days relative to parturition dairy cows were fed no supplemental LCFA (control), saturated LCFA (SFAT; mainly 16:0 and 18:0), or fish oil (FISH; high-PUFA). Twenty-seven genes were measured via quantitative RT-PCR in liver tissue on day -14 and day 10. Expression of nuclear receptor co-activators (CARM1, MED1), LCFA metabolism (ACSL1, SCD, ACOX1), and inflammation (IL6, TBK1, IKBKE) genes was lower with SFAT than control on day -14. Expression of SCD, however, was markedly lower with FISH than control or SFAT on both -14 and 10 days. FISH led to further decreases in expression on day 10 of LCFA metabolism (CD36, PLIN2, ACSL1, ACOX1), intracellular energy (UCP2, STK11, PRKAA1), de novo cholesterol synthesis (SREBF2), inflammation (IL6, TBK1, IKBKE), and nuclear receptor signaling genes (PPARD, MED1, NRIP1). No change in expression was observed for PPARA and RXRA. The increase of DGAT2, PLIN2, ACSL1, and ACOX1 on day 10 versus -14 in cows fed SFAT suggested upregulation of both beta-oxidation and lipid droplet (LD) formation. However, liver triacylglycerol concentration was similar among treatments. The hepatokine FGF21 and the gluconeogenic genes PC and PCK1 increased markedly on day 10 versus -14 only in controls.

Packaging of the herbs in high-or low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) has proven to be ineffective in preventing a significant loss of volatile components on storage. This study investigates and compares the effectiveness of alternate high-barrier property packaging materials, namely, polyvinylidene chloride coated polyethylene terephthalate/casted polypropylene (PVDC coated PET/CPP) and polyethylene terephthalate/polyethylene terephthalate/aluminum foil/linear low-density polyethylene (PET/PET/Foil/LLDPE), in prevention of volatile compound loss from the three native herbs stored at ambient temperature for 6 months. Concentrations of major volatiles were monitored using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques. After 6 months of storage, the greatest loss of volatiles from lemon myrtle was observed in traditional LDPE packaging (87% loss) followed by storage in PVDC coated PET/CPP (58% loss) and PET/PET/Foil/LLDPE (loss of 23%). The volatile loss from anise myrtle and Tasmanian pepper leaf stored in PVDC coated PET/CPP and PET/PET/Foil/LLDPE packaging was <30%.

Results obtained for LaNi4.78Al0.22 and LaNi 4.78Mn0.22 are used for comparison. It is observed that wet exposition to hydrogen or sodium borohydride lead to some hydriding of the metal hydride alloy particles, particularly that with a coating of Pt. In the presence of borohydride ions, the hydrided charged alloys present more negative potentials for the (boro)hydride oxidation process, and these enhancements are significantly larger for the Pt-coated material. In the potential range of interest, the results demonstrate considerable activity for the BOR, but just for the alloy with Pt. In the presence of borohydride ions in the solution there is a continuous hydriding the alloy during the discharge of the metal hydride electrode.

The advent of significant generation contributions by time variable renewable energy sources means that forecasting methods are increasingly required. Some of the earliest requirements will be for spatial-temporal estimation of solar irradiance and the resulting photovoltaic-generated electricity. Accurate forecasts represent an important step towards building a smart grid for renewable energy driven cities or regions, and to this end we develop forecasting tools that use data from ground-based irradiance sensors.Spatial-temporal datasets that enjoy the properties of stationarity, full symmetry and separability are in general more amenable to forecasting using time-forward kriging algorithms. Usually, none of these properties obtain in meteorological data such as wind velocity fields and solar irradiance distributions. In this paper, we construct a statistical forecast system to mitigate this problem. We first achieve temporal stationarity by detrending solar irradiance time series at individual monitoring stations. We then approximate spatial stationarity through deformations of the geographic coordinates. Various spatial-temporal variance-covariance structures are formed to explore full symmetry and separability. Finally, time-forward kriging is used to forecast the hourly spatial-temporal solar irradiance data from 10 Singapore weather stations. The aim of the proposed system is to forecast irradiance and PV electricity generation at arbitrary spatial locations within a monitored area. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Anisotropy; Full symmetry; Separability; Stationarity; Time-forward kriging; Variance-covariance structures","Covariance structures; Electricity generation; Geographic coordinates; Kriging; Power grid operations; Separability; Stationarity; Variance-covariance; Anisotropy; Digital storage; Interpolation; Meteorology; Renewable energy resources; Solar radiation; Velocity; Forecasting; algorithm; anisotropy; covariance analysis; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy resource; irradiance; kriging; photovoltaic system; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; timescale; variance analysis; weather station; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878837905

Based on the timing of the contact forces between the foot and the ground, a microprocessor released the spring at preset times later in the gait cycle. This mechanism was added to a Talux prosthetic foot and was employed by a user of a conventional energy-storage ankle-foot prosthesis. His gait was recorded using a motion analysis system. Five settings: 0, 55, 65, 75, and 85 ms delay were tested on separate days, and the standard kinematic and kinetic gait data were recorded. The user reported some settings were more comfortable than others. When these preferences were tested with a randomized doubleblind trial, the preferences were not consistent.

Moreover, climatic concerns force power system appliers to utilize these systems more environmental friendly. To obtain the mentioned aims, MGs (microgrids) act as key solutions. MGs are invented not only to operate power systems more reliable and efficient but also to penetrate CHP (combined heat and power)-based DG (distributed generation) into power systems with an optimal control on their generation. This paper presents a new optimal operation of a CHP-based MG comprising ESS (energy storage system), three types of thermal power generation units, and DRPs (demand response programs). In this paper, DRPs are treated as virtual generation units along with all of realization constraints. In a multi-objective self-scheduling optimization problem of a MG, the first objective deals with minimizing total operational cost of the CHP-MG in an OPF-based formulation and the second refers to the emission minimization of DGs. The proposed model implements a simple MIP (mixed-integer programming) that can be easily integrated in the MGCC (MG central controller).

Ghrelin is a peptide hormone that was first identified in fish 10. years ago and has important roles in the control of food intake and metabolism. Both ghrelin and its receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), have been found in numerous fish species. Their tissue distributions support the idea that ghrelin has an integrative role in the regulation of energy balance at both the central nervous system level and systemic level. In tilapia and goldfish, ghrelin treatment appears to increase food intake and to stimulate lipogenesis and tissue fat deposition to promote a more positive energy status. In rainbow trout, on the other hand, ghrelin decreases food intake. Goldfish and rainbow trout are the fish species in which the mode of action of ghrelin on food intake has been most thoroughly investigated. The results from these studies indicate that ghrelin alters food intake by acting on well-known appetite signals, such as CRH, NPY and orexin, in the hypothalamus in a species-specific manner. In goldfish, sensory fibres of the vagus nerve convey the signal from gut-derived ghrelin to modulate appetite. The data also indicate that ghrelin may modulate foraging/swimming activity and the perception of food in fish. Results related to the effects of energy status, temperature, and stressors on plasma ghrelin/tissue ghrelin mRNA levels are occasionally inconsistent between short- and long-term studies, between the protein and mRNA, and between species. Recent data also imply a role of ghrelin in carbohydrate metabolism. More functional studies are required to understand the role of ghrelin and its mechanisms of action in the regulation of energy balance among fish. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Adiposity; Aquaculture; Energy balance; Fish; Food intake; Ghrelin; Locomotor activity; Metabolism","carbohydrate; corticotropin releasing factor; ghrelin; ghrelin receptor; messenger RNA; neuropeptide Y; orexin; appetite; aquaculture; carbohydrate metabolism; energy balance; energy metabolism; fish; food intake; foraging; gene expression; goldfish; hormonal regulation; hormone action; hormone determination; hypothalamus; lipid storage; lipogenesis; locomotion; nonhuman; priority journal; rainbow trout; review; sensory nerve cell; signal transduction; species difference; stress; swimming; temperature sensitivity; tissue distribution; vagus nerve",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877040480

The degree of crystallinity of the WO3 electrodes was varied by altering the calcination temperature from 200 to 600 C. For the self-photochargeability phenomenon, the prevailing flexibility of the short-range order structure at low calcination temperature of 200 C favors the intercalation of the positive cations, enabling more photoexcited electrons to be stored within WO3 framework. This leads to a larger amount of stored charges that can be discharged in an on-demand manner under the absence of irradiation for H 2 generation. The stability of the electrodes calcined at 200 C, however, is compromised because of the structural instability caused by the abundance insertion of cations. On the other hand, films that were calcined at 400 C displayed the highest stability toward both intercalation of the cations and photoelectrochemical water splitting performance. Although crystallinty of WO3 was furthered improved at 600 C heat treatment, the worsened contact between the WO3 platelets and the conducting substrate as induced by the significant sintering has been more detrimental toward the charge transport. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","crystallinity; hydrogen generation; photoelectrochemical water splitting; self-photorecharge; tungsten oxide","Crystallinities; Hydrogen generations; Photoelectrochemical water splitting; self-photorecharge; Tungsten oxide; Calcination; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Hydrogen production; Positive ions; Sintering; Conversion efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879087575

The harvester consisting of an inductance and magnets utilizes the electromagnetic-induction approach to harvest the mechanical energy from the milling process and subsequently convert the mechanical energy to an electrical energy. Furthermore, through an energy-storage/rectification circuit, the harvested energy is capable of steadily powering both the accelerometer and wireless module. Through integrating the harvester, accelerometer, and wireless module, a self-powered wireless vibration-sensing system is achieved. The test result of the system monitoring the milling process shows the system successfully senses the vibration produced from the milling and subsequently transmits the vibration signals to the terminal computer. Through analyzing the vibration data received by the terminal computer, we establish a criterion for reconstructing the status, condition, and operating-sequence of the milling process. The reconstructed status precisely matches the real status of the milling process. That is, the system is capable of demonstrating a real-time monitoring of the milling process. © 2013 SPIE.","Electromagnetic; Energy harvester; Machining monitoring; Power generator; Self-powered; Vibration; Wireless sensor","Electromagnetic; Energy Harvester; Self-powered; Vibration; Wireless sensor; Accelerometers; Electric generators; Electromagnetic waves; Electromagnetism; Energy harvesting; Process monitoring; Sensors; Milling (machining)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878734467

To ensure efficient and safe operation, the storage reservoirs must be watertight and maintain watertightness over time. Traditional waterproofing solutions like concrete and bituminous concrete linings need periodical and/or accidental maintenance that may have significant impact on operation of the scheme. A viable alternative, based on well-proven systems adopted for new construction and rehabilitation of dams and reservoirs, is to use impervious flexible geomembranes, generally Polyvinylchloride (PVC) composite membranes embedding a backing geotextile for anti-puncture protection, which can be installed on fairly uneven base layers, reducing surface preparation. Several anchorage systems are available to maintain the liner taut to the surface under varying water level and against wind uplift. The advantages of a geomembrane system in pumped storage schemes are numerous: the geomembrane can be installed on very steep/vertical slopes unattainable with a bituminous concrete facing; being all components prefabricated and their assembly controlled at site by standardised methods, watertightness at completion of works can be checked, and monitored over service; installation times are much shorter and practically independent of weather conditions, cost advantage can be significant; one guarantee covers design, materials and installation; no maintenance needed, watertightness maintained for several decades; accidental damage can be repaired even underwater, no outage of scheme; with > 230 % 3-dimensional elongation a geomembrane liner can resist settlements/differential movements at concrete appurtenances that would cause failure of a bituminous concrete liner or a concrete facing. Design and installation aspects, and indications on future prospects, will be discussed through case histories in Italy, India, Germany and Iran.",,"Accidental damage; Anchorage systems; Energy productions; European Countries; Geomembrane liners; Standardised methods; Storage reservoirs; Surface preparation; Asphalt concrete; Composite membranes; Concretes; Facings; Machinery; Maintenance; Reservoirs (water); Storage (materials); Water levels; Wind power; Geomembranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878734064

Using a diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model, the acute effects of ASP on energy metabolism and inflammatory processes in vivo were evaluated. We hypothesized that ASP would specifically exert proinflammatory effects. C57Bl/6 wild-type mice were put on a high-fat-high-sucrose diet for 12 weeks. Mice were then subjected to both glucose and insulin tolerance tests, each manipulation being preceded by recombinant ASP or vehicle (control) bolus injection. ASP supplementation increased whole-body glucose excursion, and this was accomplished with reduced concomitant insulin levels. However, ASP did not directly alter insulin sensitivity. ASP supplementation induced a proinflammatory phenotype, with higher levels of cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-α in plasma and in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle mRNA. Additionally, ASP increased M1 macrophage content of these tissues. ASP exerted a direct concentration- dependent role in the migration and M1 activation of cultured macrophages. Altogether, the in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that ASP plays a role in both energy metabolism and inflammation, with paradoxical whole-body glucose-sensitizing yet proinflammatory effects. © 2013 Alexandre Fisette et al.",,"acylation stimulating protein; antiinflammatory agent; glucose; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; recombinant acylation stimulating protein; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; complement C3a, des-Arg-(77)-; complement component C3a; fat intake; insulin; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor alpha; complement C3a, des Arg (77); complement component C3a; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; article; cell migration; controlled study; energy metabolism; glucose tolerance test; in vivo culture; insulin sensitivity; insulin tolerance test; lipid diet; liver; macrophage; male; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; skeletal muscle; wild type; animal; blood; C57BL mouse; cell motion; cytology; drug effects; fat intake; human; insulin resistance; metabolism; obesity; physiology; drug effect; fat intake; Mus; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cell Movement; Complement C3a; Dietary Fats; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Interleukin-6; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cell Movement; Complement C3a; Dietary Fats; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Interleukin-6; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878666680

Transparent twin wall polycarbonate sheets have been selected as the external surface in order to let the bottles receive solar energy. The inner layer is opaque and fire resistant. A tarpaulin with a reflective inner face is used to prevent heat loss during cold and heat conditions. As the empirical results of the built sample (45 * 65 cm) indicate, in cold season, the wall stores the solar energy during the day and transfers the heat indoors (by conduction) at nights, when the tarpaulin covers the exterior. In hot season, the tarpaulin protects the wall from sunlight during the day. At night the wall transfers the heat outdoors in the absence of the tarpaulin.

However, tropical and subtropical fruits and vegetables stored below 10-12 °C develop chilling injury (CI) following storage beyond the CI threshold. CI as a physiological disorder greatly reduces fruits and vegetables quality and frequently renders the product not saleable. The increasing demand for consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, along with restriction on the use of synthetic chemicals to reduce CI, has encouraged scientific research to develop new technologies based on natural product such as salicylates and jasmonates. Membrane damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are multifarious adverse effects of chilling as oxidative stress in sensitive fruits and vegetables. Chilling alleviating in fruits and vegetables treated with salicylates and jasmonates could be attributed to (1) Enhancing membrane integrity by reducing phospholipase D and C (PLD and PLC) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes activities, enhancing unsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids (unSFA/SFA) ratio probably through increase of fatty acid desaturases (FAD) gene expression and maintaining energy status, ATP and adenylate energy charge (AEC). (2) Enhancing heat shock proteins (HSPs) gene expression and accumulation. (3) Enhancing antioxidant system activity. (4) Enhancing arginine pathways which led to accumulation of signaling molecules with pivotal roles in improving chilling tolerance such as polyamines, nitric oxide, proline and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

This paper presents an energy hub consisting of nuclear plants, wind turbines, solar panels, biomass reactors, electrolyzers, and fuel cells. The hub serves to replace existing coal-based power generating facilities to meet electricity and hydrogen demands for industrial and transportation sectors, as projected in 2030. Equipment sizing and costing analysis for different energy production technologies and hydrogen storage were considered using Matlab/Simulink. Several energy hub designs with various technological combinations were analyzed, and a profitability analysis was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of each energy hub. The proposed models also evaluate the environmental benefits of the future energy hub and outline the best hub configurations. It was found that the most economical energy hub is when nuclear reactor was operated throughout the year at a capacity near to the grid's average annual electricity demand.

Prior work is reviewed and compared with recent in-house results from DSCs based on three different solvents and two representative Ru dyes as well as the organic dye Y123. An ""industrial DSC toolbox"" of analysis methods, including IV testing at various light levels and in the dark, IPCE, EIS (at a single or at multiple cell voltages) and post mortem analysis, is used to better understand degradation mechanisms. For highly stable Z907-based cells, loss of performance due to high temperature ageing is dominated by loss of Voc, rather than Jsc or ff. Based on literature and this work, loss of I3-, resulting in partial bleaching of the electrolyte, appears to be strongly correlated with loss of performance upon high temperature storage, with the most stable systems investigated in this work displaying only marginal bleaching at temperatures above 80 C. Two in situ methods, EIS under light at zero DC current and IPCE in the sub 450 nm region were used to quantitatively or semi-quantitatively gauge electrolyte I2 concentration within the active area. The nature of I3- degradation products still remains unknown. A lower limit of 68 kJ/mol was estimated for the activation energy of the rate determining step, which leads to increased dark currents and thus lowered V oc upon high temperature storage. In addition there is evidence from IPCE of some changes to the dye structure, especially in MPN and GBL-based electrolyte systems. Dye desorption and degradation of platinum catalytic activity was shown to occur to some degree at the highest temperatures, but the impact on cell performance from these two mechanisms upon high temperature stress testing is only minor. Y123 showed particularly good stability at elevated temperature, surpassing even Z907 in terms of durability. Further improved device seals may lead to continued improvement of DSC stability under the harshest environmental conditions even for materials with a better performance-to-cost ratio than Z907 or Y123. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Molecular solar thermal (MOST) is a concept for long-term storage of solar energy in molecules and release of the energy as heat with full regeneration of the initial materials. The process is inherently closed cycle and emission free. No assessment of the fundamental efficiency limits of the technology has been made. In this report, efficiency limits and fundamental factors for molecular design of molecular solar thermal systems are discussed. Maximum efficiencies and potential temperature gradients are estimated using a number of basic assumptions on desired storage lifetimes and energy losses. The predicted maximum solar energy conversion efficiency is 10.6% at a S1-S0 gap of 1.89 eV. At this S1-S 0 gap, the stored energy is able to create temperature differences of ∼300 C.

It is a highly perishable material and having a short storage life. Therefore, the study of the drying kinetics of fish is necessary. In this study, the effect of microwave drying on drying rate, effective diffusivity, and energy consumption of sardine fish was examined at four different microwave powers (200, 300, 400 and 500 W). It was found that the moisture content was reduced from 2.76 to 0.01 (dry basis) and drying time of the samples was significantly reduced from 9.5 to 4.25 min as the power input increased. Five thin layer drying models were fitted to drying data. The Midilli model was selected as the best according to R2, χ2 and RMSE. The drying of fish samples took place in the falling rate period and was governed by moisture diffusion. The effective diffusivity varied from 7.158 × 10−8 to 3.408 × 10−7 m2/s over the microwave power range. No significant differences were observed between the specific energy consumption of microwave-dried sardine fish (α = 0.05).

As a fundamental study, the time-dependent kinetics was investigated to interpret its formation mechanism, which can be depicted as the curling of a two-dimensional precursor into a one-dimensional structure with a hollow interior. As a result of the nanotube structure, the active surface area of MnOOH is completely accessible to electrolyte ions and has a shorter charge-transport length and greater ability to withstand structural deformation. Hence, hollow-structured MnOOH shows great promise as an electrochemical system, which is reflected in its high specific capacitance of 1156 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. Furthermore, the high energy density of 1125 W h kg-1 and power density of 5.05 kW kg-1 reveal the outstanding energy-storage behavior of the MnOOH/GF composites as flexible supercapacitor electrodes.

Materials and Methods: Specimens (n = 10) were made with the teeth included individually in circular blocks of acrylic resin, leaving the labial surface exposed. Cycles of simulated chemical disinfection were accomplished with the specimens immersed in the solutions at room temperature for 10 minutes, followed by tap water washing for 30 seconds and storage in distilled water at room temperature for 7 days until the next disinfection. Simulated disinfection by microwave energy was carried out in a domestic oven with 1300 W at a potency of 50% for 3 minutes with the specimens individually immersed in 150 ml of distilled water. Control (no disinfection) and the experimental groups (first and third disinfection cycles) were submitted to Knoop hardness measurements with indentations at the center of the labial tooth surface. Data were submitted to repeated measure two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (α = 0.05). Results: Biocler, Magister, and Trilux showed lower surface microhardness when submitted to microwave. Lower microhardness for Biotone was promoted by hypochlorite, while no significant difference was shown for New Ace. The third disinfection cycle significantly decreased the tooth surface hardness only for microwave. Conclusions: Different disinfection methods promoted different effects on the microhardness of different types of artificial teeth. Surface microhardness of the teeth was less affected by the simulated chemical disinfections when compared to microwaved specimens. © 2013 by the American College of Prosthodontists.","Artificial teeth; Disinfection; Tooth hardness","acrylic acid resin; dental material; disinfectant agent; glutaraldehyde; hypochlorite sodium; organically modified ceramic; resin; water; article; chemistry; comparative study; disinfection; hardness; human; immersion; materials testing; methodology; microwave radiation; polymerization; radiation exposure; temperature; time; tooth prosthesis; Acrylic Resins; Composite Resins; Dental Disinfectants; Dental Materials; Disinfection; Glutaral; Hardness; Humans; Immersion; Materials Testing; Microwaves; Organically Modified Ceramics; Polymerization; Sodium Hypochlorite; Temperature; Time Factors; Tooth, Artificial; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879690316

Transient stability analysis of a large wind farm in the presence of superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), static synchronous compensator (STATCOM), static var compensator (SVC) and pitch controller is performed. The proposed control strategy of the STATCOM is based on PWM control; both the angle and the magnitude of the converter output voltage and the proposed SMES control system is based on a PWM voltage-source converter and a two-quadrant DC-DC chopper using an insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). Furthermore, robust control systems are designed for SVC and pitch controllers. To investigate the operation of the wind farm with contribution of these devices, two scenarios are considered and simulated. First, extensive analysis of a symmetrical three-phase fault and its effects on system operation is carried out. A permanent fault due to unsuccessful reclosing is analysed; this is one of the most noticeable features of this study. PSCAD/EMTDC software is used for modeling and simulation of the system components and proposed control strategies for power electronic interfaces.

Antagonism of histamine H1 receptors has been identified as a main cause of SGA-induced obesity, but the molecular mechanisms associated with this antagonism in different stages of SGA-induced weight gain remain unclear. This review aims to explore the potential role of hypothalamic histamine H1 receptors in different stages of SGA-induced weight gain/obesity and the molecular pathways related to SGA-induced antagonism of these receptors. Initial data have demonstrated the importance of hypothalamic H1 receptors in both short- and long-term SGA-induced obesity. Blocking hypothalamic H1 receptors by SGAs activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a well-known feeding regulator. During short-term treatment, hypothalamic H1 receptor antagonism by SGAs may activate the AMPK - carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 signaling to rapidly increase caloric intake and result in weight gain. During long-term SGA treatment, hypothalamic H1 receptor antagonism can reduce thermogenesis, possibly by inhibiting the sympathetic outflows to the brainstem rostral raphe pallidus and rostral ventrolateral medulla, therefore decreasing brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Additionally, blocking of hypothalamic H1 receptors by SGAs may also contribute to fat accumulation by decreasing lipolysis but increasing lipogenesis in white adipose tissue. In summary, antagonism of hypothalamic H1 receptors by SGAs may time-dependently affect the hypothalamus-brainstem circuits to cause weight gain by stimulating appetite and fat accumulation but reducing energy expenditure. The H1 receptor and its downstream signaling molecules could be valuable targets for the design of new compounds for treating SGA-induced weight gain/obesity. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,"aripiprazole; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; clozapine; haloperidol; histamine H1 receptor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; mepyramine; neuroleptic agent; olanzapine; quetiapine; reboxetine; risperidone; second generation antipsychotic; unclassified drug; ziprasidone; adipose tissue; adrenergic transmission; appetite; body weight; energy expenditure; food intake; globus pallidus; human; hypothalamus; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; medulla oblongata; obesity; priority journal; protein function; receptor blocking; review; side effect; signal transduction; thermogenesis; weight control; weight gain; Animals; Antipsychotic Agents; Benzodiazepines; Clozapine; Histamine H1 Antagonists; Humans; Hypothalamus; Obesity; Receptors, Histamine H1; Weight Gain",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879316703

The main electrode reactions of all battery chemistries are well known but are valid and reversible only at small currents. When batteries are used with nonzero current, gradients in voltage, current, and temperature will arise and initiate a number of less understood parasitic reactions. If all these rather complicated and interconnected reactions are not reversible upon charging/discharging, the battery will derail after a number of charging/discharging cycles. This article describes two ways to improve performance. One is to choose applications where the battery is not deeply discharged, such as in hybrid electric vehicles. In battery electric vehicle applications, this would correspond to working with a significantly oversized battery. The second way is to improve uniformity and quality of design and materials of metal hydride electrodes; however, this will also drastically increase cost, and for a battery application, the total throughput of available energy over the lifetime cost of the battery must be maximized. Uniform metal hydride particles with a large and uniform reaction surface are examples of how to increase battery performance by making the electrodes work under more ideal conditions, which slows down the deteriorating influence from the parasitic reactions. © 2013 Materials Research Society.","electrical properties; energy storage; hydrogenation; Metal; powder processing","Battery applications; Battery electric vehicles; Battery performance; Charging/discharging; Electrode reactions; Improve performance; Metal hydride electrodes; Powder processing; Electric vehicles; Electrodes; Energy storage; Hybrid vehicles; Hydrides; Hydrogenation; Metals; Secondary batteries; Electric properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878864974

Historically, the nutritional challenges experienced by pregnant and lactating women were largely those of insufficient calories and severe micronutrient deficiencies. More recently, however, Western societies have been confronted with a new nutritional challenge; that of maternal obesity and excessive maternal intake of calories, fat, and sugar. Exposure of the developing fetus and infant to this obesogenic environment results in an increased risk of obesity and metabolic disease later in life. Furthermore, increased caloric, fat, and sugar intake can occur in conjunction with micronutrient deficiency, which may further exacerbate these programming effects. In light of the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease, attention has now turned to identifying nutritional interventions for breaking this intergenerational obesity cycle. In this review, we discuss the approaches that have been explored to date and highlight the need for further research.","Fetal programming; Intervention; Maternal nutrition; Maternal obesity; Micronutrients; Obesity; Pregnancy","glucose; insulin; insulin receptor substrate 1; leptin; leptin receptor; omega 3 fatty acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; polyunsaturated fatty acid; appetite; body mass; caloric restriction; diet supplementation; energy balance; epidemic; exercise; feeding behavior; fetus growth; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; glycemic index; human; hyperglycemia; hyperphagia; hypophysis adrenal system; insulin blood level; insulin sensitivity; lipid diet; lipid storage; macrosomia; maternal nutrition; maternal obesity; metabolic disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; nutritional assessment; overnutrition; patient care; perinatal period; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; prevalence; priority journal; protein binding; review; sugar intake; weight gain; Animals; Caloric Restriction; Dietary Supplements; Female; Fetal Development; Glycemic Index; Humans; Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Micronutrients; Obesity; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878842039

Metal-doped graphene hybrid materials have been explored for this purpose, however, with much focus on noble metals, which are limited by their low availability and high costs. Transition metals may serve as promising alternatives. Here, transition metal-doped graphene hybrids were synthesized by a simple and scalable method. Metal-doped graphite oxide precursors were thermally exfoliated in either hydrogen or nitrogen atmosphere; by changing exfoliation atmospheres from inert to reductive, we produced materials with different degrees of oxidation. Effects of the presence of metal nanoparticles and exfoliation atmosphere on the morphology and electrocatalytic activity of the hybrid materials were investigated using electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Doping of graphene with transition metal nanoparticles of the 4th period significantly influenced the electrocatalysis of compounds important in energy production and storage applications, with hybrid materials exfoliated in nitrogen atmosphere displaying superior performance over those exfoliated in hydrogen atmosphere. Moreover, nickel-doped graphene hybrids displayed outstanding electrocatalytic activities towards reduction of O 2 when compared to bare graphenes. These findings may be exploited in the research field of renewable energy. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

A field testing program was developed to investigate wellbore integrity as a component of the International Energy Agency Green House Gas Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project. In support of this program, two downhole tools were designed and built: a pressure transient test (PTT) tool and a cement coring (CemCore) Tool. Site conditions required these tools to be operable in a 139.7mm (5.5in.) diameter cased borehole up to depths of 1450m (4757ft).The PTT tool is designed to seal two pseudo slots vertically offset by 1.45-3.68. m (57-145. in.), then to apply a user-controlled pressure to the upper slot while monitoring pressure responses at the lower slot. The two pseudo slots are created by penetrating through the casing and cement with an existing controlled perforation drilling tool. The final tool design consisted of four packers with maximal differential pressure rating of 6894. kPa (1000. psi), internal pressure and temperature sensors, and pulse injection and receiving ports. These elements are all monitored/controlled from surface and deployed on coiled tubing. The data generated using the PTT tool can be used to interpret vertical permeability of the near-well area and, most importantly, the cement sheath and its interface with casing and rock formation.The CemCore tool was developed based on an existing controlled perforation tool by adapting a cement core barrel to fit on the end of the tool's flexible drill shaft, which thus increases the radius of the tool's parallel to perpendicular transition zone. The tool was used successfully to cut 9.5. mm (3/8. in.) diameter samples that were 10.3. mm (13/32. in.) in length. In the field program the PTT tool was deployed three times with one successful test result and the CemCore tool was deployed five times with four successful core retrievals. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 storage; Wellbore cement samples; Wellbore integrity; Wellbore permeability","Cement sample; Differential pressures; Feasibility assessment; International energy agency; Pressure and temperature sensors; Pressure-transient tests; Vertical permeabilities; Wellbore; Carbon dioxide; Cements; Digital storage; Greenhouse gases; Oil field equipment; Software testing; Testing; Boreholes; borehole; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; cement; permeability; underground storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878116060

The IEA GHG Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project is in its second phase of research and, in order to refine the final model, adds new geological and hydrogeological data to the already rich dataset from Phase I.One aspect of geological characterization of the storage site in this phase of research was to further refine the geological model used in Phase I by examining more wells and including additional geological units. Well density has been increased from Phase I to more than 900 wells including 200 newly picked wells to more accurately locate the zero edges of these subcropping Mississippian units. Additionally, the model has been improved to integrate geological units not included in the Phase I model, including: (1) an "" Altered Zone"" of anhydrite and dolostone at the up-dip edge of the Weyburn-Midale reservoir that forms the caprock to the reservoir subjacent to the regional seal formed by the Watrous Formation; (2) the Frobisher Evaporite, a variably thick anhydrite unit present at the base of the reservoir beneath the northern portion of the field; and (3) the Oungre Evaporite, an anhydrite/dolomite unit within the Ratcliffe Beds present above the majority of the reservoir. Adding these units, with their irregular termination edges, into the Petrel model resulted in unrepresentative reservoir architecture as stacking the multiple Mississippian beds and then truncating them with the sub-Mesozoic unconformity created residual artefacts, which could not be correctly resolved in the resulting 3D grid. It was therefore necessary to delineate the zero edges by using false wells with zero isopach values, and then stack these isopach thicknesses to proportionately fill the 3D grid while maintaining their complex morphology. This resulted in an improved representation of the architecture of the hydrogeological flow units present in the Weyburn reservoir. Other challenges included the various types of data projections. This was resolved by using a consistent methodology for converting between all the coordinate systems.Pressure and hydrochemistry maps for the aquifers of interest (Midale, Frobisher and Ratcliffe) contain straddle tests and new wells drilled since Phase I was completed. Straddle drill stem tests were not included in Phase I of the project. Investigating these tests permits a better evaluation of the possibility of cross-formational flow between the Mississippian aquifers, and of the competency of inter- and intra-aquifer evaporites as potential barriers for fluid movement.Hydrogeological results from this study include: (1) hydrochemistry maps which indicate large variations in total dissolved solids (TDS) within the aquifers of interest (Ratcliffe, Midale and Frobisher) - the observed chemical and density variations have an influence on fluid movement; (2) pressure maps which illustrate unique variations between the aquifers of interest; (3) hydrochemical cross sections which display the lateral and vertical formational movement of fluids in the aquifers of interest; (4) pressure depth plots [P(d)] that demonstrate the original formation pressure present in the aquifers of interest as well as the current pressure regime present in the CO2 flood area; and (5) driving force ratio (DFR) maps that illustrate the combined forces acting on fluid movement within an aquifer and incorporate aquifer structure, TDS, temperature and pressure.The P(d) plots and the DFR maps add valuable insight regarding the fate of fluid movement in the aquifers of interest by locating regions that are in vertical communication as well as identifying areas where stagnation points or down-dip fluid movements are occurring. Additionally, the analysis of a recently completed observation well helps to gain insight into the pressure regime and fluid movement currently present in the storage unit. Results indicate that the Ratcliffe has predominantly horizontal flow and is isolated from the underlying Midale and Frobisher. These hydrogeological results can elucidate the movement of fluids in the Midale, as well as the vertical movement of fluids between the Midale, Frobisher and Ratcliffe.These new data and model were utilized by other research disciplines of the project including risk assessment and modelling of long-term storage. Results indicate that the Midale Beds at the IEA GHG CO2 Weyburn Monitoring and Storage Project are a secure location for CO2 sequestration. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 storage; Hydrogeology; Reservoir characterization; Weyburn-Midale","Hydrogeological Flows; Hydrogeological models; Pressure-depth plots; Reservoir architecture; Reservoir characterization; Total dissolved solids; Vertical communications; Weyburn-Midale; Aquifers; Data processing; Digital storage; Drill pipe; Geologic models; Hydrochemistry; Hydrogeology; Petroleum reservoirs; Research; Three dimensional computer graphics; Water injection; Carbon dioxide; aquifer; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; fluid injection; hydrochemistry; hydrogeology; reservoir characterization; underground storage; Canada; Midale; Saskatchewan; Weyburn",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878109933

Calculated travel time sensitivity values increase from 0.01ms/m to ∼0.25ms/m moving upward from the reservoir depth (1450m) to the shallowest aquifer considered (600m).

This is demonstrated for the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas (IEA-GHG) Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project (Saskatchewan) where fluid and gas samples from multiple wells were collected and analyzed for geochemical and isotopic compositions for more than a decade. Carbon isotope ratios of the injected CO2 (-20.4‰) were sufficiently distinct from median δ13C values of background CO2 (δ13C=-12.7‰) and HCO3- (δ13C=-1.8‰) in the reservoir to reveal the movement and geochemical trapping of injected CO2 in the reservoir. The presented 10-year data record reveals the movement of injected CO2 from injectors to producers, dissolution of CO2 in the reservoir brines, and ionic trapping of injected CO2 in conjunction with dissolution of carbonate minerals.

To achieve this, we have developed a new design for heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) efficiency improvement. A storage tank together with an immersed heat exchanger is installed in the discharge line between the compressor and condenser. The heat exchanger uses the make-up water of the cooling tower to reduce the refrigerant temperature entering the condenser. To investigate the potential of energy savings, we used a real-world commercial building with a central cooling plant, located in a hot and dry climate, for our case study. The energy consumption and relevant data of the existing central cooling plant were acquired over the course of a typical week in summer. The integrated system has been modeled and analyzed to achieve energy conservation. The performance of the proposed cooling system was simulated using a transient simulation software package. Comparison of the proposed system with existing cooling plant is included in this paper to demonstrate the advantages of our new configuration. Results show that up to 18% power saving can be obtained by using our design. © 2013 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","central cooling plant; design improvement; energy saving; modelling; performance prediction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877687330

The termite fat body is involved in multiple metabolic activities, including recycling of nitrogen. Termite fat body showed three different types of cells: adipocytes, urocytes and mycetocytes, the latter restricted to the species Mastotermes darwiniensis. Adipocytes synthesize and store lipids, glycogen and several proteins. These cells also elaborate important peptides, including some that act in immune processes. Urocytes are responsible for the storage of spherocrystals of urates, which vary quantitatively among the termite castes. The different metabolic functions of the fat body in the several castes and stages of termites are associated with specific adipocyte morphologies. The synthesis and storage of different compounds modify the structure of the fat body; this differentiation is coordinated by hormones involved with molting and reproductive cycles. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Adipocytes; Isoptera; Storage proteins; Termite queens; Ultrastructure; Urocytes","glycogen; insect protein; fat; hormone; immune system; molt; protein; queen; reproductive cycle; termite; ultrastructure; animal; cytology; fat body; growth, development and aging; Isoptera; lipid metabolism; metabolism; review; Animals; Fat Body; Glycogen; Insect Proteins; Isoptera; Lipid Metabolism",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877331060

There are at least three important factors that support this rationale. (i) Lipids are more reduced than carbohydrates and so they have more energy per unit of mass. (ii) Lipids are hydrophobic and thus take up less volume than hydrated carbohydrates on a mass basis for storage in tissues. (iii) Lipids are more easily extracted and converted into useable biofuels than cellulosic-derived fuels, which require extensive fractionation, degradation of lignocellulose and fermentation of plant tissues. However, while vegetative organs such as leaves are the majority of harvestable biomass and would be ideal for accumulation of lipids, they have evolved as ""source"" tissues that are highly specialized for carbohydrate synthesis and export and do not have a propensity to accumulate lipid. Metabolism in leaves is directed mostly toward the synthesis and export of sucrose, and engineering strategies have been devised to divert the flow of photosynthetic carbon from sucrose, starch, lignocellulose, etc. toward the accumulation of triacylglycerols in non-seed, vegetative tissues for bioenergy applications. © 2013.","Bioenergy; Carbohydrate metabolism; Leaves; Lipid metabolism; Storage lipids","lipid; biomass; carbohydrate metabolism; chemistry; lipid metabolism; metabolism; plant; plant leaf; review; Biomass; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Plant Leaves; Plants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876339644

In this communication, the electrochemical properties of sodium ion storage in reduced graphene oxide (RGO) were studied in an electrolyte consisting of 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC). The experimental results show that the RGO anode allowed significant sodium ion insertion, leading to higher capacity at high current density compared to the previously reported results for carbon materials. This is due to the fact that RGO possesses higher electrical conductivity and is a more active host, with large interlayer distances and a disordered structure, enabling it to store a higher amount of Na ions. RGO anode exhibits high capacity combined with long-term cycling stability at high current densities, leading to reversible capacity as high as 174.3 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C (40 mA g-1), and even 93.3 mAh g-1 at 1 C (200 mA g-1) after 250 cycles.

Several products from green algae which are used today consist of secondary metabolites that can be extracted from the algal biomass. The best known examples are the carotenoids astaxanthin and β-carotene, which are used as coloring agents and for health-promoting purposes. Many species of green algae are able to produce valuable metabolites for different uses; examples are antioxidants, several different carotenoids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, anticancer and antiviral drugs. In many cases, these substances are secondary metabolites that are produced when the algae are exposed to stress conditions linked to nutrient deprivation, light intensity, temperature, salinity and pH. In other cases, the metabolites have been detected in algae grown under optimal conditions, and little is known about optimization of the production of each product, or the effects of stress conditions on their production. Some green algae have shown the ability to produce significant amounts of hydrogen gas during sulfur deprivation, a process which is currently studied extensively worldwide. At the moment, the majority of research in this field has focused on the model organism, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, but other species of green algae also have this ability. Currently there is little information available regarding the possibility for producing hydrogen and other valuable metabolites in the same process. This study aims to explore which stress conditions are known to induce the production of different valuable products in comparison to stress reactions leading to hydrogen production. Wild type species of green microalgae with known ability to produce high amounts of certain valuable metabolites are listed and linked to species with ability to produce hydrogen during general anaerobic conditions, and during sulfur deprivation. Species used today for commercial purposes are also described. This information is analyzed in order to form a basis for selection of wild type species for a future multi-step process, where hydrogen production from solar energy is combined with the production of valuable metabolites and other commercial uses of the algal biomass. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Algae technology; Biomass; Green algae species; Hydrogen; Pharmaceuticals; Solar energy; Stress","Anaerobic conditions; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Commercial exploitation; Green alga; Nutrient deprivation; Optimal conditions; Secondary metabolites; Sulfur deprivation; Biomass; Biomolecules; Drug products; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Metabolites; Microorganisms; Optimization; Pigments; Polyunsaturated fatty acids; Solar energy; Stresses; Sulfur; Algae; algal extract; antibiotic agent; antifreeze protein; antifungal agent; antihypertensive agent; antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; antioxidant; ascorbic acid; astaxanthin; butylcresol; canthaxanthin; carotenoid; essential fatty acid; glutathione; glycerol; glycoprotein; hemagglutinin; hydrogen; lectin; phenol derivative; polysaccharide; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; retinol; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; unindexed drug; unsaturated fatty acid; violaxanthin; vitamin; zeaxanthin; anaerobic growth; Ankistrodesmus; antifungal activity; antihypertensive activity; antiinflammatory activity; antimicrobial activity; antineoplastic activity; antioxidant activity; aquaculture; biofuel production; Botryococcus; Botryococcus braunii; bronchodilating activity; carbon storage; chemical stress; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlorella; Chloromonas; Chlorosarcinopsis; Chodatella; Coccomyxa; Coelastrella; Coelastrum; Cosmarium; Desmococcus; Desmodesmus; Dictyococcus; diet supplementation; drug manufacture; drug screening; Dunaliella; Dunaliella tertiolecta; electron transport; energy resource; environmental stress; enzyme synthesis; Eudorina; eye disease; food; Golenkinia; Gonium; green alga; Haematococcus; Halochlorococcum; human; immunopotentiation; ion transport; Kirchneriella; light intensity; lipid composition; Lobochlamys; metabolite; microalga; Micromonas; Monoraphidium; nannochloris; Neochloris; Neospongiococcum; nonhuman; nutrient limitation; nutritional deficiency; Oocystis; osmotic stress; oxidative stress; Pandorina; Parachlorella; Parietochloris; Pediastrum; pH; photoinhibition; photosynthesis; photosystem II; Platymonas; priority journal; protein synthesis; Prototheca; Pseudospongiprotococcoides; Pyramimonas; review; salt tolerance; Scenedesmus; Scotiella; Selenastrum; Stichococcus; temperature sensitivity; Tetracystis; Tetraedron; Tetraselmis; Tetraspora; ultraviolet radiation; Biomass; Biotechnology; Chlorophyta; Hydrogen; Microalgae; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Photobioreactors; algae; Animalia; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlorophyta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875005543

To mitigate the PV system impacts particularly on a weak electricity network, battery energy storage (BES) system is an effective means to smooth out the power fluctuations. Consequently, the net power injected to the electricity grid by PV and BES (PV/BES) systems can be dispatched smoothly such as on an hourly basis. This paper presents an improved control strategy for a grid-connected hybrid PV/BES systems for mitigating PV farm output power fluctuations. A feedback controller for BES state of charge is proposed, where the control parameters are optimized using genetic algorithm (GA). GA-based multi objective optimization utilizes the daily average PV farm output power profile which was obtained from simulation using the historical PV system input data of Malaysia. In this way, the optimal size for the BES is also determined to hourly dispatch a 1.2 MW PV farm. A case study for Malaysia is carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme using PSCAD/EMTDC software package. Furthermore, the validation of results of the proposed controller and BES size on the actual PV system output data are also given. Finally, a simple payback calculation is presented to study the economical aspects of the BES investment on the proposed mitigation strategy under Malaysian Feed-in Tariff program. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This A8051, adopting a 4-phase dual-rail protocol, can operate up to 250 mV. A8051 has 67.53 μs as a critical path delay with 91.6 nW power consumption at 250 mV, which is equivalent to 12.88 kHz in synchronous systems. At 1.0 V, the delay of a critical path of A8051 microcontroller is 5.74 ns, which is equivalent to 151.55 MHz, with 8.98 mW power consumption. The proposed 16T SRAM cell is applied in memory blocks. The 16T SRAM structure eliminates charge contentions between devices during read and write operations so that SRAM can be operated fully in static mode, bringing about improved write margin (WM).

The gasifier has a direct quench that quickly cools the raw syngas when it leaves the hot reactor by spraying the gas with a water solution. As a result, the raw syngas becomes saturated with steam. Typically the gasifier operates at 30 bar which corresponds to a dew point of about 235 C and a steam concentration in the saturated syngas that is about 3 times higher than the total concentration of the other species in the syngas. After the quench cooler the syngas is passed through a counter-current condenser where the raw syngas is cooled and most of the steam is condensed. The condenser consists of several vertical tubes where reflux condensation occurs inside the tubes due to water cooling of the tubes on the shell-side. A large part of the condensation takes place inside the tubes on the wall and results in a counterflow of water driven by gravity through the counter current condenser. In this study a computational fluid dynamics model is developed for the two-phase fluid flow on the tube-side of the condenser and for the single phase flow of the shell-side. The two-phase flow was treated using an Euler-Euler formulation with closure correlations for heat flux, condensation rate and pressure drop inside the tubes. The single-phase model for the shell side uses closure correlations for the heat flux and pressure drop. Predictions of the model are compared with results from experimental measurements in a condenser used in a 3 MW Black Liquor Gasification development plant. The results are in good agreement with the limited experimental data that has been collected in the experimental gasifier.

Atoms are affected by four co-propagating control laser beams in a double tripod configuration of the atomic energy levels involved, allowing us to minimize the losses at the vortex core of the control beams. In such a situation the atomic medium is transparent for a pair of co-propagating probe fields, leading to the creation of two-component (spinor) slow light. We study the interaction between the probe fields when two control beams carry optical vortices of opposite helicity. As a result, a transfer of the optical vortex takes place from the control to the probe fields without switching off and on the control beams. This feature is missing in a single tripod scheme where the optical vortex can be transferred from the control to the probe field only during either the storage or retrieval of light. © 2013 American Physical Society.",,"Atomic medium; Control beams; Control laser beam; Optical vortices; Orbital angular momentum; Orbital angular momentum of light; Two-component; Vortex cores; Angular momentum; Atoms; Probes; Slow light; Vortex flow; Orbital transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878488553

Seeds have been exploited as bioreactors for the production to foreign materials, but stable, high level expression has been elusive, in part due to the intrinsic bias for producing the natural reserves in their typical proportions. To identify mutants governing seed filling, we screened a population of mutagenized Arabidopsis plants for a mutant that failed to fill its seeds. Here we report the identification of ssp1, a recessive, viable mutant that accumulates approximately 15% less protein than wildtype seeds. Molecular analyses revealed that ssp1 is due to the introduction of a premature stop codon in CRU3, one of the major cruciferin genes. Unlike many other reserve mutants or transgenic lines in which seed storage protein levels are reduced by antisense/RNAi technologies, ssp1 exhibits low level compensation by other reserves, and represents a mutant background that might prove useful for high level expression of foreign proteins. To test this hypothesis, we used a bean phytohemagglutinin (PHA) gene as a reporter and compared PHA expression levels in single copy insertion lines in ssp1 vs. wildtype. These near isogenic lines allow reporter protein levels to be compared without the confounding and sometimes unknown influences of transgene copy number and position effects on gene expression. The ssp1 lines consistently accumulated more PHA than the backcrossed counterparts, with increases ranging from 12% to 126%. This proof of principle study suggests that similar strategies in crop plants may improve the yield of foreign proteins of agronomic and economic interest. © 2013 Lin et al.",,"cruciferin protein; phytohemagglutinin; seed storage protein; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; Arabidopsis protein; Arabidopsis; article; backcrossing; controlled study; CRU3 gene; gene dosage; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; gene insertion; genetic analysis; homozygosity; mass screening; mutant; nonhuman; PHA gene; plant gene; plant seed; plant yield; protein deficiency; protein expression; protein localization; reporter gene; RNA interference; seed development; SSP1 gene; stop codon; tissue level; transgene; transgenic plant; gene expression; gene expression regulation; genetics; lipid metabolism; metabolism; mutation; phenotype; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Lipid Metabolism; Mutation; Phenotype; Plants, Genetically Modified; Seeds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878339447

The DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed to prevent loss of data; these refresh operations waste energy and degrade system performance. Existing DRAM devices refresh all cells at a rate determined by the leakiest cell in the device, however, most DRAM cells can retain data for significantly longer. [1] proposes a method refreshing most DRAM cells at a low rate, while selectively refreshing weak cells at a higher rate, can result in a significant decrease in refresh overhead. On the other hand, having SECDED support to cope with the soft errors in DRAM memories seems too weak. In this paper a 3C decoder with the capability of DEC/QED is proposed. This design requires no modification to DRAM. Applying on DRAM and eDRAM, this refresh controller achieves at least 75% refresh reduction, at a modest storage overhead of redundant 8KB DRAM memory. Its benefits are designing a robust DRAM system to the various applications. © 2013 IEEE.",,"DRAM devices; Dram memory; Mobile memory; Music players; Refresh reductions; Retention time; Storage overhead; Waste energy; Cells; Digital storage; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877952621

Linking these subgrids is a power converter, whose topology should preferably be not too unconventional. This is to avoid unnecessary compromises to reliability, simplicity, and industry relevance of the converter. The desired operating features of the hybrid microgrid can then be added through this interlinking converter. To demonstrate, an appropriate control scheme is now developed for controlling the interlinking converter. The objective is to keep the hybrid microgrid in autonomous operation with active power proportionally shared among its distributed sources. Power sharing here should depend only on the source ratings and not their placements within the hybrid microgrid. The proposed scheme can also be extended to include energy storage within the interlinking converter, as already proven in simulation and experiment.

The main inverter of the dual inverter system is powered by the rectified output of a wind turbine-coupled permanent-magnet synchronous generator. The auxiliary inverter is directly connected to the supercapacitor bank. With this approach, an interfacing converter is not required, and there are no associated costs and power losses incurred.

This trend however is throttled by the limited battery lifetime of mobile devices and unstable wireless connectivity, making the highest possible quality of service experienced by mobile users not feasible. The recent cloud computing technology, with its rich resources to compensate for the limitations of mobile devices and connections, can potentially provide an ideal platform to support the desired mobile services. Tough challenges arise on how to effectively exploit cloud resources to facilitate mobile services, especially those with stringent interaction delay requirements. In this paper, we propose the design of a Cloud-based, novel Mobile sOcial tV system (CloudMoV). The system effectively utilizes both PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) cloud services to offer the living-room experience of video watching to a group of disparate mobile users who can interact socially while sharing the video. To guarantee good streaming quality as experienced by the mobile users with time-varying wireless connectivity, we employ a surrogate for each user in the IaaS cloud for video downloading and social exchanges on behalf of the user. The surrogate performs efficient stream transcoding that matches the current connectivity quality of the mobile user. Given the battery life as a key performance bottleneck, we advocate the use of burst transmission from the surrogates to the mobile users, and carefully decide the burst size which can lead to high energy efficiency and streaming quality. Social interactions among the users, in terms of spontaneous textual exchanges, are effectively achieved by efficient designs of data storage with BigTable and dynamic handling of large volumes of concurrent messages in a typical PaaS cloud. These various designs for flexible transcoding capabilities, battery efficiency of mobile devices and spontaneous social interactivity together provide an ideal platform for mobile social TV services. We have implemented CloudMoV on Amazon EC2 and Google App Engine and verified its superior performance based on real-world experiments. © 1999-2012 IEEE.","Communications technology; Computers and information processing; Mobile computing; Mobile TV; TV","Cloud computing technologies; Communications technology; Computers and information processing; High energy efficiency; Mobile TV; Performance bottlenecks; Personal mobile devices; Wireless connectivities; Data processing; Design; Energy efficiency; Global system for mobile communications; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Interactive television; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Quality of service; Social sciences; Television; Platform as a Service (PaaS)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877894603

This is mainly due to the convincing revolution in power electronic technology and the growing concern about greenhouse effect that is intensified due to the burning of fossil fuels. Variable-speed wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) such as doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are dominating the wind energy market due to their superior advantages over fixed-speed-based WECS which include more captured energy, less mechanical stress, and acoustical noise. DFIG is interfaced to the ac network through the grid-side voltage source converter (VSC) and rotor-side VSC to enable the variable-speed operation of the wind turbine and to provide reactive power support to the ac grid during disturbance events. Converter switching malfunction such as misfire and fire-through may influence the power dispatch capability of the DFIG. In this paper, a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) unit is utilized to improve the power dispatch and dynamic performance of DFIG-based WECS during internal converter switching malfunctions such as misfire and fire-through faults. Simulation results without and with SMES connected to the system are presented, compared, and analyzed. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","Doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs); fire-through; misfire; superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES)","Doubly fed induction generators; Electronic technologies; fire-through; misfire; Reactive power support; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Voltage source converters; Wind-Energy conversion systems (Wecss); Asynchronous generators; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Greenhouse effect; Power converters; Stresses; Superconducting devices; Wind power; Wind turbines; Fires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877847930

This generally occurs when the generation from PV resources substantially exceeds the load demand during high insolation period. This paper has investigated the solar PV impacts and developed a mitigation strategy by an effective use of distributed energy storage systems integrated with solar PV units in LV networks. The storage is used to consume surplus solar PV power locally during PV peak, and the stored energy is utilized in the evening for the peak-load support. A charging/discharging control strategy is developed taking into account the current state of charge (SoC) of the storage and the intended length of charging/discharging period to effectively utilize the available capacity of the storage. The proposed strategy can also mitigate the impact of sudden changes in PV output, due to unstable weather conditions, by putting the storage into a short-term discharge mode. The charging rate is adjusted dynamically to recover the charge drained during the short-term discharge to ensure that the level of SoC is as close to the desired SoC as possible. A comprehensive battery model is used to capture the realistic behavior of the distributed energy storage units in a distribution feeder. The proposed PV impact mitigation strategy is tested on a practical distribution network in Australia and validated through simulations. © 2013 IEEE.","Charging/discharging strategy; Energy storage; Reverse power flow; Rooftop solar photovoltaic; Voltage-rise","Charging/discharging; Distributed energy storage systems; Distributed energy storages; Distribution feeders; Low-voltage distributions; Reverse Power flows; Solar photovoltaics; Voltage-rise; Energy storage; Lead acid batteries; Solar concentrators; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886288323

Recent data suggest that seipin regulates LD (lipid droplet) dynamics and adipocyte differentiation, but whether these roles are mechanistically linked remains unclear. To understand how seipin regulates these processes, we investigated the evolutionary changes of seipin orthologues, and studied individual domains in regulating lipid accumulation in non-Adipocytes and adipocytes. Mammalian seipins comprise at least two distinct functional domains, a conserved core sequence and an evolutionarily acquired C-terminus. Despite its requirement for adipocyte formation, seipin overexpression inhibited oleate-induced LD formation and accumulation in nonadipocytes, whichwasmediated by the core sequence. In contrast, seipin overexpression did not inhibit LD accumulation during adipocyte differentiation or the adipogenic process in 3T3- L1 cells. However, adipogenesis and LD accumulation were impaired in 3T3-L1 cells expressing a seipin mutant lacking the C-terminus. Furthermore, expression of the same mutant without the C-terminus failed to rescue the adipogenic defects in seipin-knockdown cells, demonstrating the importance of the C-terminus for seipin's function in adipocyte development. We propose that seipin is involved in lipid homoeostasis by restricting lipogenesis and LD accumulation in non-Adipocytes, while promoting adipogenesis to accommodate excess energy storage. © The Authors Journal compilation.","3T3-L1 cell; Adipocyte; Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (BSCL2); Fat; Insulin resistance; Lipodystrophy; Seipin","lipid; membrane protein; seipin; unclassified drug; adipocyte; adipogenesis; article; carboxy terminal sequence; cell differentiation; controlled study; homeostasis; human; human cell; lipid storage; lipogenesis; priority journal; protein domain; protein expression; protein function; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Animals; Conserved Sequence; Evolution, Molecular; HEK293 Cells; Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Lipogenesis; Mice; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876899536

The seashells have also been proven to exhibit piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, which may contribute to their mechanical behaviors and various functionalities. This work has elaborated in more details of the piezoelectric and ferroelectric behaviors of the nacre by using the DART (Dual-AC Resonance Tracking) and vector-PFM (Piezoresponse Force Microscope), as well as the SS-PFM (Switching Spectroscopy PFM) techniques. By using the vector-PFM technique, the local polarization directions of intracrystalline biopolymers are found to be very close to the direction perpendicular to the platelet surface, and it, therefore, shows strong piezoresponse along this direction. On the other hand, the interlamellar biopolymer shows strong piezoresponse in the direction parallel to the platelet surface. This intrinsic piezoelectric property of the biopolymer may be the basis for sensing and actuating during biomineralization process. Besides the piezoresponse, the locations of various biopolymers are also revealed in-situ by using the PFM technique. The ferroelectric behaviors of nacre have been observed by SS-PFM method. Based on the shapes of the ferroelectric hysteresis loops, it is found that the biopolymers in nacre exhibit the similar behaviors to that of the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based co- or ter-polymers for energy storage applications. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Biomineralization process; Energy storage applications; Ferroelectric hysteresis loop; Ferroelectric property; Piezo-response force microscopes; Piezoelectric property; Piezoresponse force microscopy; Polyvinylidene fluorides; Biomineralization; Biomolecules; Biopolymers; Gems; Mechanical properties; Piezoelectricity; Platelets; Scanning probe microscopy; Ferroelectricity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878074796

An additional aspect of rock breakage, specific to the mineral extraction industry, is the modeling of liberation of particular mineral grains from the host rock matrix. These aspects of rock behavior make comminution modeling a unique field of rock mechanics. From a traditional engineering point of view (mining and civil), rock samples are considered to be homogenous. Although the mechanical properties of individual minerals can vary significantly, the properties of the minerals and of the mineral boundaries interact randomly enough to assume that in the size of rock samples mechanical properties can be considered homogenous. However, from a comminution point of view, heterogeneity caused by a difference in the properties of minerals are crucial and therefore rock material, even in the scale of a few centimeters, should be considered as heterogeneous. The comminution response of such rock will be influenced by the textural parameters of the rock as well as mechanical properties of constitutive mineral grains. Image based numerical modeling is a useful tool for investigation of the pattern and dynamics of the rock breakage process. Its usefulness rests on the fact that a difficult step of building a faithful model of rock texture and composition, as a pre-requisite for modeling of rock breakage, is removed. Numerical modeling based on the use of classified digital image of the rock surface, could be particularly effective in the mineral extraction industry, where one of the key objectives is liberation of specific minerals, by providing inside view of mechanisms that are responsible for liberation of valuable minerals embedded into specific ore matrix. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, carbon sequestration and wood production were evaluated on afforested farms by integrating the Gaussian diameter distribution model and exponential diameter-height model derived from sample plots of an afforested hardwood forest in Taiwan. The quantity of sequestrated carbon was determined based on aboveground biomass. Through pilot tests run on an age-volume model, an estimation bias was obtained and used to correct predicted volume estimates for a farm forest over a 20-year period. An estimated carbon sequestration of 11,254 t C was observed for a 189ha-hardwood forest which is equivalent to 41,264 t CO2. If this amount of carbon dioxide were exchanged on the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) market, the income earned would be 821 US$ ha-1. Carbon sequestration from rice (Oryza sativa) or sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) production is discharged as a result of straw decomposition in the soil which also improves soil quality. Sugarcane production does not contribute significantly to carbon sequestration, because almost all the cane fiber is used as fuel for sugar mills. As a result of changing the farming systems to hardwood forest in this study area, carbon sequestration and carbon storage have increased at the rate of 2.98 t C ha-1 year-1. Net present value of afforestation for a 20-year period of carbon or wood management is estimated at around US$ 30,000 given an annual base interest rate of 3 %.","Aboveground biomass; Carbon capture and storage; Forest management; Plantation on farm land; Taiwan","Oryza sativa; Saccharum officinarum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877127887

As the synthetic medium evolved from an inert atmosphere of argon to hydrogen pressure, the morphology shifted from rod like to small particles (25-170 nm). In cyclohexane, a solvent relative inert toward magnesium, smaller particles (15-50 nm) were formed. However in diethyl ether, which is more reactive toward magnesium, flakes organized in large microstructures were obtained. Remarkably in all cases β-MgH2 was readily obtained with some residual carbon contamination. Hydrogen release from these structures occurred at a relatively low temperature (300 °C), with desorption kinetics faster or equivalent to that of ball milled magnesium. In particular, hydrogen desorption from the smallest particles of MgH 2 produced via the hydrogenolysis of di-n-butylmagnesium under hydrogen pressure or cyclohexane was impressive with the full desorption achieved in less than 10 min without any catalyst. These remarkable hydrogen storage properties are believed to result from an appropriate stabilization of the nanoparticles generated. Copyright © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Reef-building corals are increasingly exposed to local and global stressors that alter nutritional status causing reduced fitness and mortality, however, these responses can vary considerably across species and populations.Methodology/Principal Findings:We compare the expression of 22 coral host genes in individuals from an inshore and an offshore reef location using quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) over the course of 26 days following translocation into a shaded, filtered seawater environment. Declines in lipid content and PSII activity of the algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium ITS-1 type C2) over the course of the experiment indicated that heterotrophic uptake and photosynthesis were limited, creating nutritional deprivation conditions. Regulation of coral host genes involved in metabolism, CO2 transport and oxidative stress could be detected already after five days, whereas PSII activity took twice as long to respond. Opposing expression trajectories of Tgl, which releases fatty acids from the triacylglycerol storage, and Dgat1, which catalyses the formation of triglycerides, indicate that the decline in lipid content can be attributed, at least in part, by mobilisation of triacylglycerol stores. Corals from the inshore location had initially higher lipid content and showed consistently elevated expression levels of two genes involved in metabolism (aldehyde dehydrogenase) and calcification (carbonic anhydrase).Conclusions/Significance:Coral host gene expression adjusts rapidly upon change in nutritional conditions, and therefore can serve as an early signature of imminent coral stress. Consistent gene expression differences between populations indicate that corals acclimatize and/or adapt to local environments. Our results set the stage for analysis of these processes in natural coral populations, to better understand the responses of coral communities to global climate change and to develop more efficient management strategies. © 2013 Bay et al.",,"actin; acyl coenzyme A oxidase; adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); aldehyde dehydrogenase; carbonate dehydratase; collagen; complement component C3; cytochrome c oxidase; ferritin; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; lectin; retinol dehydrogenase; superoxide dismutase; urokinase receptor; acclimatization; Acropora millepora; article; biotope; climate change; coral; coral reef; COX15 gene; Dgat1 gene; endosymbiont; energy transfer; environmental stress; FadD gene; gene; gene expression; gene function; lipid composition; Ndh1b gene; nonhuman; protein processing; quantitative analysis; Rdh1 gene; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sea; seashore; Symbiodinium; Acclimatization; Aldehyde Dehydrogenase; Animals; Anthozoa; Carbonic Anhydrases; Cluster Analysis; Coral Reefs; Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase; Dinoflagellida; Ecosystem; Host-Parasite Interactions; Lipids; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Seawater; Symbiosis; Transcriptome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877335673

Poor load-following characteristics and slow response to rapid load changes are some of the drawbacks of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) because of the gas processing reaction and the fuel cell dynamics. This load tracking problem can be solved by adding an energy storage element, such as a battery or an ultra-capacitor to the system. This paper focuses on modeling of a stand-alone hybrid distributed generation (DG) system using the MATLAB/Simulink software. The model utilizes PEMFC as the main energy source, whereas the battery functions as energy storage to compensate for the limitations of PEMFC. Furthermore, the three main types of batteries are compared via simulation to identify the most suitable battery types for DG applications. The main objective of this paper is to analyze a hybrid model based on the power output across the fuel cell and in the battery terminal. Simulation results show that the delay and load-tracking problems in the PEMFC model have been resolved by the existence of the battery in the hybrid model.","Battery; Dynamic model; Energy storage system; Hybrid; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877090681

The graphical PoPA tools have recently been proposed to determine targets for the minimum amount of outsourced electricity and the maximum amount of excess electricity to be stored and reused in the hybrid power systems. The numerical techniques for PoPA have so far not been developed. This work introduces two new PoPA numerical tools known as the Power Cascade Analysis (PoCA) and the Storage Cascade Table (SCT). The tools can be used to determine (1) the minimum target for outsourced electricity, (2) the amount of excess electricity for storage during start up and normal operations, (3) the amount of transferrable power, (4) the maximum storage (e.g. battery) capacity for the off-grid systems, (5) the amount of electricity transferrable to the grid, (6) the amount of outsourced electricity needed at each time interval and (7) the time interval where the maximum power demand occurs.

Body weight and food intake were measured weekly. Indirect calorimetry, dietary fatload clearance, insulin and glucose tolerance tests were also evaluated. Liver, muscle and adipose tissue mRNA gene expression were measured by RT-PCR.Results:At week one and 12, C5aRKO mice on DIO had increased oxygen consumption. After 12 weeks, although food intake was comparable, C5aRKO mice had lower body weight (-7% CHOW, -12% DIO) as well as smaller gonadal (-38% CHOW, -36% DIO) and inguinal (-29% CHOW, -30% DIO) fat pads than their WT counterparts. Conversely, in WT mice, C5aR was upregulated in DIO vs CHOW diets in gonadal adipose tissue, muscle and liver, while C5L2 mRNA expression was lower in C5aRKO on both diet. Furthermore, blood analysis showed lower plasma triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid levels in both C5aRKO groups, with faster postprandial triglyceride clearance after a fatload. Additionally, C5aRKO mice showed lower CD36 expression in gonadal and muscle on both diets, while DGAT1 expression was higher in gonadal (CHOW) and liver (CHOW and DIO) and PPAR<bold>γ</bold> was increased in muscle and liver.Conclusion:These observations point towards a role (either direct or indirect) for C5aR in energy expenditure and fat storage, suggesting a dual role for C5aR in metabolism as well as in immunity. © 2013 Roy et al.",,"CD36 antigen; complement component C5a receptor; fatty acid; messenger RNA; sucrose; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antigen expression; article; body weight; C5L2 gene; calorimetry; carbohydrate diet; controlled study; energy metabolism; fatty acid blood level; food intake; gene expression; glucose tolerance test; gonad; insulin tolerance test; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; liver level; locomotion; low fat diet; male; mouse; muscle level; nonhuman; obesity; oxygen consumption; postprandial state; receptor gene; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; triacylglycerol blood level; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Knockout Techniques; Homeostasis; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Liver; Male; Mice; Motor Activity; Muscles; Obesity; Oxygen; Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a; Receptors, Chemokine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877117500

Two storage geometries have been studied; the tank surface area which was varied from 6-12 m2 and the storage water mass per unit area of the collectors (50-70 kg m-2) on the storage temperature. The study is based on several years collected data incluhng solar intensity, ambient temperature and the wind speed which were measured in Tikrit city-North West of Iraq-in January. The solar collector was constructed from multiple standard units; each unit is (1 m) width and (2 m) length. Each unit consists of six copper pipes with 10 mm hameter and 2 m long covered by galvanized steel sheet 1 mm thickness and a glass cover of 3 mm thickness. The mathematical model was converted to a simulation computer program accounting for all effective parameters on heat transfer in the heated room space, the collector and the storage tank.

Ionic liquids offer a number of ideal thermal and physical properties as potential electrolytes in such large-scale energy storage applications. We describe here the synthesis and characterisation of a family of novel ""chelating"" ILs designed to chelate and solubilize the zinc ions to create electrolytes for this type of battery. These are based on quaternary alkoxy alkyl ammonium cations of varying oligo-ether side chains and anions such as p-toluene sulfonate, bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide and dicyanoamides. This work shows that increasing the ether chain length in the cation from two to four oxygens can increase the ionic conductivity and reduce the melting point from 67 °C to 15 °C for the tosylate system. Changing the anion also plays a significant role in the nature of the zinc deposition electrochemistry. We show that zinc can be reversibly deposited from [N222(20201)] [NTf2] and [N222(202020201)][NTf2] beginning at -1.4 V and -1.7 V vs. SHE, respectively, but not in the case of tosylate based ILs. This indicates that the [NTf2] is a weaker coordinating anion with the zinc cation, compared to the tosylate anion, allowing the coordination of the ether chain to dominate the behavior of the deposition and stripping of zinc ions. © 2013 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876917225

The application of sensible heat storage (SHS) in solid media is an attractive economic option, but is dependent on identifying suitable SHS media. Given the growing number of new materials available today, finding a suitable material is a time-consuming and difficult process. This paper demonstrates the use of a materials selection software package and identifies suitable SHS materials for high temperature (>500 C) TES systems. The environmental performance of some selected materials was also evaluated using the package. Common materials such as alumina, silicon carbide, high temperature concrete, graphite, cast iron and steel were found to be highly suitable for SHS for the duty considered (500-750 C). For cost comparison, a simple heat exchanger, consisting of a packed bed of the materials (in brick or block form) heated by an inert gas, was considered. On the basis of equivalent gas phase heat transfer, high alumina cement concrete blocks had the lowest cost, followed by a common refractory brick at <US$ 10/kWh (thermal). High temperature concretes, such as the high alumina cement-based materials and alumina-silicate geoploymers, were identified as having potential for SHS media as they are cheap composite materials. Their thermo-physical properties could be optimised for SHS by a suitable choice of aggregates, binders and additives. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This waste of whole-body energy is replenished by digested and absorbed dietary glucose on intestine and distributed among muscle, adipose tissue, liver, kidney, brain and others tissues involved in glycemia by means of glucose uptake, metabolism, storage and excretion. Glucose is unable to readily diffuse through the plasma membranes due to its hydrophilic nature. So, at least, two main types of assistance transport proteins are needed: facilitative transporters (glucose carriers (GLUTs) from the SLC2 gene family and active transport proteins (glucose carriers (SGLTs) from the SCL5 gene family. Among twelve known GLUT molecules, GLUT4 is the major glucose transporter for skeletal muscle, adipose tissue (insulin dependent for these both tissues) and cardiac muscle. Other ones, such as GLUTs 1, 2, 3, and 8, facilitate the glucose entry into the brain and liver, for example. Significant amounts of glucose (≥ 80%) are transported into the skeletal muscle where it may be used for energy supply or for glycogen stores. On the other hand, the glucose uptake on adipose tissue is around 5% although it plays an important influence on insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver. Furthermore, several transporters are involved on glucose flux from cells to the blood and from organelles to the cytosol. The glucose homeostasis is maintained by a complex network among pancreatic cells, intestine, kidney, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver and lately also the central glucose regulation by brain has been carefully concerned. The reabsorption of glucose by kidney occurs through the sodium glucose cotransporter SGLT2 (the majority) and the remaining ones by SGLT1 (around 10%). SGLT1 is also extensively expressed in the small intestine. The SGLT active glucose transport system takes advantage of sodium electrochemical potential gradient across the brush border membrane and also utilize sodium:potassium adenosine triphosphatase pumps at the basolateral membrane to the suitable glucose uptake. This review provides a discussion about the benefits and what is going on with glucose uptake and health implications, the mechanisms that contribute to glucose homeostasis and the potential impact of glucose transporters as pharmacological targets able to correct glucose imbalance. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

If underground coal gasification systems are combined with carbon capture and storage methods, CO2 emissions can be greatly reduced. Carbon capture and storage methods require considerable amount of energy to separate CO2 and prepare it for transport and storage, which is typically considered a parasitic loss. This study investigates utilizing waste heat rejected during processing of syngas from underground coal gasification using an auxiliary power plant, to supply the required energy associated with amine-based CO2 capture and compression processes necessary for transport and sequestration. The system investigated is the Newman Spinney underground coal gasification test plant coupled with a basic Rankine cycle. It is shown that the energy requirement for CO2 processing can be met through the use of an auxiliary plant. The basic model illustrates that the power produced by the auxiliary plant is 2.1 times greater than that required by CO2 compression, while supplying the required heat for amine-based CO2 capture. Parametric analyses are performed to investigate the impact of air injection rate, syngas cooling and CO2 capture and compression requirements on system performance. © IMechE 2013.","CO2 capture; Energy analysis; Rankine cycle; Underground coal gasification; Waste heat recovery","Auxiliary power; Carbon capture and storage; Compression process; Energy analysis; Energy requirements; Parametric -analysis; Parasitic loss; Underground coal gasification; Carbon capture; Carbonization; Energy management; Rankine cycle; Synthesis gas; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884541695

We have produced beams of atomic carbon anions and small carbon anion molecules (Cn -, n = 1, 2, 3, 4) in a sputter ion source. The ion beams were accelerated to 10 keV kinetic energy and stored in an electrostatic ion storage ring enclosed in a vacuum chamber at 13 K. For 10 keV 2- molecular anions we measure the residual-gas limited beam storage lifetime to be 448 s ± 18 s with two independent detector systems. Using the measured storage lifetimes we estimate that the residual gas pressure is in the 10 -14 mbar range. When high current ion beams are injected, the number of stored particles does not follow a single exponential decay law as would be expected for stored particles lost solely due to electron detachment in collision with the residual-gas. Instead, we observe a faster initial decay rate, which we ascribe to the effect of the space charge of the ion beam on the storage capacity. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Detector systems; Electron detachments; Exponential decays; High-current ion beams; Molecular anions; Residual gas pressure; Stockholm University; Storage capacity; Carbon; Electrostatics; Experiments; Ion sources; Kinetics; Negative ions; Ion beams",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878927049

With the impetus of the Clean Energy Future package, these plantings have the potential to contribute to biodiversity gains if established and managed appropriately. In this study, we sought to link indicators of biodiversity to carbon storage in remnant vegetation, mixed-species native revegetation and single-species eucalypt plantations in the Mount Lofty Ranges (MLR) of South Australia. Native plant species richness was higher in remnant vegetation than in revegetation and plantation sites in the southern MLR, but only remnant and plantation sites were different in the northern MLR. Native bird species richness was higher in remnant than plantation sites, but revegetation sites were similar to both plantation and remnant sites in northern and southern sites. Mean total standing carbon varied across treatments in southern sites, and there were no statistically significant differences in mean carbon sequestration rate between planted treatments. Monoculture plantation sites lack the structural complexity required and offer limited resources for native fauna compared with mixed-species revegetation or remnant vegetation. This reinforces the importance of carefully constructed incentives to compensate landholders for potential carbon shortfalls if the opportunity for biodiversity gains from carbon plantings is to be realised in the longer term. The value of the standing carbon in remnant vegetation should also be recognised in emerging markets. © 2013 Ecological Society of Australia.","Biodiversity conservation; Bioindicators; Carbon sequestration, faunal habitat; Forestry; Habitat restoration; Revegetation","biodiversity; bioindicator; carbon sequestration; habitat conservation; habitat restoration; monoculture; perennial plant; plantation; tree planting; Australia; Mount Lofty Ranges; South Australia; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878356770

The results are presented in terms of temperature and velocity profiles, streamlines, isotherms, moving interface position, solid fraction and dimensionless heat flux. The suspended nanoparticles caused an increase in thermal conductivity of nano-enhanced phase change material (NEPCM) compared to conventional PCM, resulting in heat transfer enhancement and a higher melting rate. In addition, the nanofluid heat transfer rate increased and the melting time decreased as the volume fraction of nanoparticles increased. The higher temperature difference between the melting temperature and the hot wall temperature expedited the melting process of NEPCM. © 2013 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Melting; Nanofluid; Phase change material (PCM); Square cavity; Thermal energy storage","Dispersion of nano particles; Heat Transfer enhancement; Nano-particle dispersions; Nanoenhanced phase change material (NePCM); Nanofluids; Nanoparticle volume fractions; Phase Change Material (PCM); Square cavity; Dispersions; Finite volume method; Heat flux; Heat storage; Heat transfer coefficients; Melting; Metal melting; Nanoparticles; Phase change materials; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Volume fraction; Nanofluidics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877712648

The aim of this study was to identify if these root specializations are expressed at differential supplies of phosphorus (P) and at different shoot P concentrations [P].MethodsSeedlings were planted in sand and provided with a mycorrhizal inoculum and basal nutrients plus one of 21 P treatments, ranging from 0 to 50 mg P kg-1 dry soil. Plants were harvested after 12 weeks, and roots, shoots and cluster roots were measured for length and fresh and dry weight. The number of cluster roots, the percentage of mycorrhizal colonization, and shoot [P] were determined.Key ResultsShoot biomass accumulation increased with increasing P supply until a shoot dry weight of 3 g was reached at a P supply of approx. 27·5 mg P kg-1 dry soil. Neither cluster-root formation nor mycorrhizal colonization was fully suppressed at the highest P supply. Most intriguingly, shoot [P] did not differ across treatments, with an average of 1·4 mg P kg-1 shoot dry weight.ConclusionsThe almost constant shoot [P] in V. juncea over the very wide range of P supplies is, to our knowledge, unprecedented. To maintain these stable values, this species down-regulates its growth rate when no P is supplied; conversely, it down-regulates its P-uptake capacity very tightly at the highest P supplies, when its maximum growth rate has been reached. It is proposed that the persistence of cluster roots and mycorrhizal colonization up to the highest P treatments is a consequence of its tightly controlled shoot [P]. This unusual P physiology of V. juncea is surmised to be related to the habitat of this N 2-fixing species. Water and nutrients are available at a low but steady supply for most of the year, negating the need for storage of P which would be metabolically costly and be at the expense of metabolic energy and P available for symbiotic N2 fixation. © 2013 The Author.","Cluster roots; legume; mycorrhiza; phosphorus supply; shoot phosphorus concentration; Viminaria juncea","phosphorus; biomass; colonization; concentration (composition); growth rate; harvesting; legume; mycorrhiza; nutrient availability; phosphorus; root system; seedling; shoot; water availability; weight; article; Australia; bacterial count; biomass; chemistry; drug effect; Fabaceae; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; mycorrhiza; plant; soil; Australia; Biomass; Colony Count, Microbial; Fabaceae; Mycorrhizae; Phosphorus; Plant Shoots; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877280207

However, in order to fully exploit these networks for such applications, energy-efficient and scalable solutions for information discovery are essential. Multidimensional WSNs are deployed in complex environments to sense and collect data relating to multiple attributes (multidimensional data). Such networks present unique challenges to data dissemination, data storage and in-network query processing (information discovery). In this paper, we propose a novel method of information discovery for multidimensional WSNs that can significantly increase network lifetime and minimize query processing latency, resulting in quality of service (QoS) improvements that are of immense benefit to mission-critical applications. We propose a distributed solution with multiple levels of resolution to enable fast query resolution. We present simulation results to show that the proposed approach to information discovery offers significant improvements on query resolution latency in comparison with current approaches. In addition, the results prove that the QoS improvements come with significant network-wide energy savings that will result in an increase of the network lifetime. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Complex environments; Distributed solutions; Environmental Monitoring; In-network query processing; Information discovery; Mission critical applications; Multidimensional data; Multiple attributes; Complex networks; Quality of service; Query processing; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876769661

However, in many cases, the consequences of regulatory mutations on patterns of gene expression and ultimately phenotypic differences remain elusive. A standard way to study the genetic architecture of expression variation in model systems has been to map gene expression variation to genetic loci (Fig. 1a). At the same time, in many nonmodel species, especially for long-lived organisms, controlled crosses are not feasible. If we are to expand our understanding of the role of regulatory mutations on phenotypes, we need to develop new methodologies to study species under ecologically relevant conditions. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Verta et al. () present a new approach to analyse gene expression variation and regulatory networks in gymnosperms (Fig. 1b). They capitalized on the fact that gymnosperm seeds contain an energy storage tissue (the megagametophyte) that is directly derived from a single haploid cell (the megaspore). The authors identified over 800 genes for which expression segregated in this maternally inherited haploid tissue. Based on the observed segregation patterns, these genes (Mendelian Expression Traits) are most probably controlled by biallelic variants at a single locus. Most of these genes also belonged to different regulatory networks, except for one large group of 180 genes under the control of a putative trans-acting factor. In addition, the approach developed here may also help to uncover the effect of rare recessive mutations, which usually remain hidden in a heterozygous state in diploid individuals. The appeal of the work by Verta et al. () to study gene expression variation is in its simplicity, which circumvents several of the hurdles behind traditional expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, and could potentially be applied to a large number of species. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","eQTL; gene duplication; gene network; microarray; Picea; RNAseq; transcriptomics","evolution; gene regulatory network; genetics; quantitative trait locus; review; spruce; tree; Biological Evolution; Gene Regulatory Networks; Picea; Quantitative Trait Loci; Trees; Gymnospermae; Picea",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876539046

A variety of mouse strains have been used for this purpose. However, mouse strains can differ in their inherent propensities to develop metabolic disease, which may affect the experimental outcomes of metabolic studies. We have investigated strain-dependent differences in the susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in five commonly used inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129X1/SvJ, BALB/c, DBA/2 and FVB/N). Methods: Mice were fed either a low-fat or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. Whole-body energy expenditure and body composition were then determined. Tissues were used to measure markers of mitochondrial metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress and lipid accumulation. Results: BL6, 129X1, DBA/2 and FVB/N mice were all susceptible to varying degrees to HFD-induced obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, but BALB/c mice exhibited some protection from these detrimental effects. This protection could not be explained by differences in mitochondrial metabolism or oxidative stress in liver or muscle, or inflammation in adipose tissue. Interestingly, in contrast with the other strains, BALB/c mice did not accumulate excess lipid (triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols) in the liver; this is potentially related to lower fatty acid uptake rather than differences in lipogenesis or lipid oxidation. Conclusions/interpretation: Collectively, our findings indicate that most mouse strains develop metabolic defects on an HFD. However, there are inherent differences between strains, and thus the genetic background needs to be considered carefully in metabolic studies. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carbohydrate metabolism; Insulin sensitivity and resistance; Lipid metabolism; Weight regulation and obesity","diacylglycerol; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; triacylglycerol; 129X1 SvJ mouse; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; Bagg albino mouse; body composition; C57BL 6 mouse; controlled study; DBA 2 mouse; disease predisposition; energy expenditure; fatty acid transport; FVB N mouse; glucose homeostasis; glucose intolerance; inflammation; insulin resistance; lipid diet; lipid liver level; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipogenesis; liver parenchyma; low fat diet; male; mitochondrial respiration; mouse; mouse strain; muscle tissue; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; priority journal; protection; strain difference; triacylglycerol blood level; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Adiposity; Animals; Biological Markers; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Susceptibility; Glucose Intolerance; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Mitochondria; Muscle, Skeletal; Obesity; Oxidative Stress; Random Allocation; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876465920

All the aforementioned approaches are based on various physical and chemical phenomena including absorption, adsorption, and cryogenic capture of CO2. The purified carbon dioxide is sent for the physical storage options afterwards, using the earth as a gigantic reservoir with unknown long-term environmental impacts as well as possible hazards associated with that. Consequently, the ultimate solution for the CO2 sequestration is the chemical transformation of this stable molecule to useful products such as fuels (through, for example, Fischer-Tropsch chemistry) or polymers (through successive copolymerization and chain growth). This sustainably reduces carbon emissions, taking full advantage of CO2-derived chemical commodities, so-called carbon capture and conversion. Nevertheless, the surface chemistry of CO2 reduction is a challenge due to the presence of large energy barriers, requiring noticeable catalysis. This work aims to review the most recent advances in this concept selectively (CO2 conversion to fuels and CO2 copolymerization) with chemical engineering approach in terms of both materials and process design. Some of the most promising studies are expanded in detail, concluding with the necessity of subsidizing more research on CO2 conversion technologies considering the growing global concerns on carbon management. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Carbon capture and conversion; Catalysis; CO2; Copolymerization; Electrocatalysis; Photoelectrocatalysis","Carbon capture and storage; Chemical commodities; Chemical conversions; Chemical transformations; Conversion technology; Materials and process; Photo-electrocatalysis; Post-combustion captures; Carbon capture; Catalysis; Copolymerization; Copolymers; Electrocatalysis; Environmental impact; Fuels; Surface chemistry; Carbon dioxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876465238

This study determined the GHG outcomes of the extraction, manufacture, transport, use in construction, maintenance and disposal of wood products and other building materials for two popular house designs in Sydney, Australia. Methods: The life cycle assessment (LCA) was undertaken using the computer model SimaPro 7.1, with the functional unit being the supply of base building elements for domestic houses in Sydney and its subsequent use over a 50-year period. The key data libraries used were the Australian Life Cycle Inventory library, the ecoinvent library (with data adapted to Australian circumstances where appropriate) and data for timber production from an Australian study for a range of Australian forestry production systems and wood products. Two construction variations were assessed: the original intended construction, and a ""timber-maximised"" alternative. The indicator assessed was global warming, as the focus was on GHG emissions, and the effect of timber production, use and disposal on the fate of carbon. Results and discussion: The timber maximised design resulted in approximately half the GHG emissions associated with the base designs. The sub-floor had the largest greenhouse impact due to the concrete components, followed by the walls due to the usage of bricks. The use of a ""timber maximised"" design offset between 23 and 25 % of the total operational energy of the houses. Inclusion of carbon storage in landfill made a very significant difference to GHG outcomes, equivalent to 40-60 % of total house GHG emissions. The most beneficial options for disposal from a GHG perspective were landfill and incineration with energy recovery. Conclusions: The study showed that significant GHG emission savings were achieved by optimising the use of wood products for two common house designs in Sydney. The switch of the sub-floor and floor covering components to a ""wood"" option accounted for most of the GHG savings.

Recently, PCM technology improvement helps to use different types of PCMs for increasing energy and exergy efficiency of TES system. In this present work, the effect of different PCMs with different melting temperatures on the energy and exergy efficiencies are investigated by considering the price of energy, exergy for each PCM type. The cost of lost energy and destroyed exergy are calculated for each PCM type in their life cycle and their share in total life cycle cost sketched as a circle diagram to show their importance. The amount of average lost exergy cost share is about 70.49%, average lost energy cost share is about 29.45% and average PCM price share is about 0.06% which means for having more optimum PCM choosing, the exergy concept have more significant role in choosing melting point of PCM than energy and the price of PCM.

This handling method, however, requires multiple stages and the amount of handling involved results in a significant loss of biomass that could have been used for energy. This study compares two handling methods for the extraction of logging residues in stands dominated by Norway spruce. The traditional "" dried-stacked"" method was compared to the "" fresh-stacked"" method in which logging residues are collected simultaneously during normal logging operations and stacked in windrows at or near the roadside to dry. Determination of fraction composition and moisture content was carried out on the biomass provided to the energy-converting industry shortly after comminuting the logging residues. The results show that the fresh-stacked logging residues contained a higher amount of needles (8%), compared to 4% for the dried-stacked logging residues. However, the amount of needles was considered to be low in both handling methods. Both handling methods were proven to provide adequate drying with moisture content levels at approximately 36% for fresh-stacked and 31% for dried-stacked logging residues. These results indicate that weather and forest conditions have a greater impact on the moisture content than handling method. An acceptance of fresh-stacked logging residues, preferably connected to ash recycling, would afford the energy-converting industries the opportunity to use new technologies, reduce costs and extract a greater biomass total. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Forest fuel; Logging residuals; Needles; Norway spruce; Storage; Wood fuel","Forest conditions; Forest fuel; Logging operations; Logging residues; Multiple stages; New technologies; Norway spruce; Reduce costs; Biomass; Energy storage; Extraction; Forestry; Fuel storage; Needles; Plants (botany); Wood fuels; Moisture determination; biochemical composition; bioenergy; biomass power; coniferous forest; cost-benefit analysis; logging (timber); moisture content; Biomass; Extraction; Forestry; Fuels; Needles; Picea Abies; Plants; Storage; Wood; Sweden; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875787176

We show that the variance of the intervals between receiving wakeup slots affects the expected sleep latency: when the variance of the intervals is low (high), the expected latency is low (high). We therefore propose a novel scheduling scheme that uses the bit-reversal permutation sequence (BRPS)-a finite integer sequence that positions receiving wakeup slots as evenly as possible to reduce the expected sleep latency. At the same time, the sequence serves as a compact representation of wakeup schedules thereby reducing storage and communication overhead. But while low latency wakeup schedule can reduce per-hop delay in ideal conditions, it does not necessarily lead to low latency end-to-end paths because wireless link quality also plays a significant role in the performance of packet forwarding. We therefore formulate expected transmission delay (ETD), a metric that simultaneously considers sleep latency and wireless link quality. We show that the metric is left-monotonic and left-isotonic, proving that its use in distributed algorithms such as the distributed Bellman-Ford yields consistent, loop-free and optimal paths. We perform extensive simulations using real-world energy harvesting traces to evaluate the performance of the scheduling and forwarding scheme. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Residential shade trees extenuate the heating of buildings in the summertime by intercepting insolation and by evapotranspirative cooling of their immediate surroundings. By modifying location-specific climate data and tree growth characteristics, we adapt the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's (SMUD) Tree Benefits Estimator for application in Toronto, Canada. We then use our tool to model the air conditioning energy conservation savings delivered by 577 trees planted in Toronto backyards between 1997 and 2000. In urban residential neighbourhoods, where houses are closely spaced, the energy conservation benefits of planting a tree depend on species, on pre-existing canopy, and on placement of the tree with respect to distance and orientation from buildings. Study trees contributed 77,140. kWh (167. kWh/tree) of electricity savings as of 2009, 54.4% of which was due to shading of neighbouring houses. Twenty-five years following planting, we estimate that each study tree will have delivered, on average, between 435 and 483. kWh in energy conservation benefit. Our findings indicate that residential tree-planting programmes in densely settled urban areas should not focus exclusively on location-driven strategic planting to yield large energy conservation benefits. Instead, we argue that priority should be given to selecting planting locations that will maximize tree survival as neighbourhood energy conservation benefits of a tree that achieves mature stature often outweigh the homeowner-specific benefits of a strategically planted tree. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Air conditioning; Electricity; Shading; Toronto; Tree benefits; Urban forest","Conservation benefits; Conservation strategies; Demand side managements; Sacramento municipal utility districts; Shading; Toronto; Tree benefits; Urban forests; Air conditioning; Digital storage; Electric utilities; Electricity; Heating; Housing; Reforestation; Urban planning; Energy conservation; climate change; demand-side management; density; electricity; energy conservation; estimation method; evapotranspiration; neighborhood; residential energy; savings; strategic approach; summer; tree planting; urban area; California; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Sacramento; Toronto; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875601585

The first GP model is known as Weighted Goal Programming (WGP). However, Multi-Choice Aspirations Level (MCAL) problems cannot be solved by current GP techniques. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Choice Mixed Integer Goal Programming model (MCMI-GP) for the aggregate production planning of a Brazilian sugar and ethanol milling company. The MC-MIGP model was based on traditional selection and process methods for the design of lots, representing the production system of sugar, alcohol, molasses and derivatives. The research covers decisions on the agricultural and cutting stages, sugarcane loading and transportation by suppliers and, especially, energy cogeneration decisions; that is, the choice of production process, including storage stages and distribution. The MCMIGP allows decision-makers to set multiple aspiration levels for their problems in which ""the more/higher, the better"" and ""the less/lower, the better"" in the aspiration levels are addressed. An application of the proposed model for real problems in a Brazilian sugar and ethanol mill was conducted; producing interesting results that are herein reported and commented upon. Also, it was made a comparison between MCMI GP and WGP models using these real cases. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Aggregate production planning; Goal programming; Multi- Choice mixed integer goal programming; Multi-choice aspiration levels; Sugar and ethanol mills","Aggregate production planning; Analytical approach; Goal programming; Goal programming model; Multi choices; Multiple aspiration levels; Production process; Real-world problem; Aggregates; Ethanol; Industry; Integer programming; Loading; Milling (machining); Production engineering; Problem solving",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875377451

We conducted both a spatial and a temporal study in order to test the hypotheses: (1) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations influence Hg accumulation in zebra mussels sampled from a series of lakes and (2) seasonal variations in diet influence Hg accumulation. In the spatial study, we found a significant negative relationship between Hg concentrations and DOC concentrations, suggesting an influence of DOC on Hg bioaccumulation. In the temporal study, we used stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) as ecological tools to provide a temporally integrated description of the feeding ecology of zebra mussels. Both δ15N and δ13C varied seasonally in a similar manner: more depleted values occurred in the summer and more enriched values occurred in the fall. Mercury concentrations also varied significantly over the year, with highest concentrations occurring in the summer, followed by a progressive decrease in concentrations into the fall. The C/N ratio of zebra mussels also varied significantly over the year with the lowest values occurring mid-summer and then values increased in the fall and winter, suggesting that there was significant variation in lipid stores.

A review of research on controlled atmosphere (CA) storage suggests that temperature changes in CA have less impact on product deterioration than in air. This paper reviews the underpinning observations of fruit physiology in CA and the possible approaches to reducing energy costs through temperature manipulation. Experimental results indicate that minor increases in temperature during CA storage have little influence on apple quality outcomes across a number of apple cultivars. Calculations for applying a 9 h on 15 h off cycle estimated an approximate 40% of electricity cost savings whilst only incurring a 0.5°C average fruit temperature swing.

In contrast to the traditional practices where SRAM arrays enclose more rows than columns, this work reveals that better SRAM energy efficiencies can be achieved with a wider SRAM array structure with fewer rows than columns particularly at low supply voltage.

Conventional battery-based WSN components has several drawbacks, such as limited life-span, bulky size and hazardous to the environment. Hence, energy harvesting from ambient sources attracts enormous attention. But energy harvesting depends on the availability of the ambient sources. In most cases energy harvesting from a single source is not enough to produce sufficient energy to power up WSN components. This paper describe about the design, and implementation consideration of a hybrid energy harvester for an autonomous sensing system. The sensing components of WSN are connected with the hybrid energy harvester on the same structure to generate required energy from the ambient environment such as solar and chemical reaction. As a case study, the power requirements of in-house developed WSN components [1] are measured. Based on the power requirement a hybrid energy harvester based autonomous system is designed [2], and a functional prototype of the system is implemented. In the implemented prototype, energy is being harvested from the ambient solar and chemical sources. From the evaluation of the developed system, it is found that powering WSN components, hybrid energy harvester produces an additional amount of 10491.93 J (equivalent to 2.91 Wh) of energy, which is capable to fill-up a 971 mA-hr storage in one day operation. This is enough for the WSN components to draw power subsequently, when there is not enough ambient sources available for next few days. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Autonomous; Energy harvester; Hybrid; Self-powered; WSN","Autonomous; Energy Harvester; Hybrid; Self-powered; WSN; Energy harvesting; Machinery; Sensors; Solar energy; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876520580

Recently, research institutes in Malaysia are the focus of the studies on hydrogen technology in order to drive this energy in transportation applications. Since Hydrogen and fuel cells are viewed as one of the most important energy conversion devices in the future, thus the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) had identified this energy as priority research after solar. Just like normal refueling stations, hydrogen stations and its infrastructure must be planned, designed, and operated in accordance with the properties. Safety consideration of hydrogen system installation and its application can consider as one of the major issues influencing the acceptance of hydrogen for public use. The current methodology of hydrogen production and storage system was surveyed in this paper, and the characteristics of the system as well as their advantages and limitation were reviewed. Besides, this study has investigated and discussed the potential hazards associated with hydrogen refueling facilities such as hydrogen production, storage and dispensing system.

However, control problems still remain due to the large variety of PV output power with different solar radiation levels. To better investigate about this problem, a model that the PV power plants are integrated with production and storage system such as hydrogen generator, electrolyzer, PV system and hydrogen tank is needed. The focus of the present paper is to develop an integrated simulation model that can be effective and user friendly to predict the dynamic behaviors of a solar powered hydrogen system. The solar irradiance and temperature are the independent variables that act as the input variables to the model. The analyzed results could be used for analyzing the system performance, and also for sizing and designing the system.

Coral health was investigated by measuring metabolic indices (RNA/DNA ratio and protein concentration), energy levels (lipid ratio) and autotrophic indices (chlorophyll a (chl a) and zooxanthellae density) at six stations during typical seasons (austral autumn 2010 (March and April), austral winter 2010 (August)) and during an extreme La Niña event in summer 2011 (February). These indices were correlated with 15 physico-chemical factors (measured immediately following coral sampling) to identify predictors for health indices. Variations in metabolic indices (protein concentration and RNA/DNA ratio) for A. spicifera were mainly explained by nitrogen, temperature and zooplankton concentrations under typical conditions, while for A. digitifera, light as well as phytoplankton, in particular picoeukaryotes, were important, possibly due to higher energy requirement for lipid synthesis and storage in A. digitifera. Optimum metabolic values occurred for both Acropora species at 26-28°C when autotrophic indices (chl a and zooxanthellae density) were lowest. The extreme temperature during the La Niña event resulted in a shift of feeding modes, with an increased importance of water column plankton concentrations for metabolic rates of A. digitifera and light and plankton for A. spicifera. Our results suggest that impacts of high sea surface temperatures during extreme events such as La Niña may be mitigated via reduction on metabolic rates in coral host. The high water column plankton concentrations and associated low light levels resulted in a shift towards high symbiont densities, with lower metabolic rates and energy levels than the seasonal norm for the coral host. © 2013 Hinrichs et al.",,"chlorophyll a; DNA; lipid; nitrogen; protein; RNA; Acropora digitifera; Acropora spicifera; alga; article; Australia; autotrophy; autumn; controlled study; coral; coral reef; El Nino; energy metabolism; environmental factor; feeding behavior; Indian Ocean; lipid storage; lipogenesis; metabolic parameters; metabolic rate; nonhuman; physical chemistry; phytoplankton; picoeukaryote; protein content; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; species dominance; symbiosis; winter; zooplankton; zooxanthellae; animal; Anthozoa; coral reef; growth, development and aging; health; metabolism; photosynthesis; season; weather; Acropora; Acropora digitifera; Acropora spicifera; Anthozoa; Animals; Anthozoa; Coral Reefs; Health; Indian Ocean; Photosynthesis; Physicochemical Processes; Seasons; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876512930

The algorithms, termed just-in-time with varying polling cycle times (JIT) and just-in-time with fixed polling cycle times (J-FIT), are designed to achieve energy-savings when the idle time of an optical network unit (ONU) is less than the sleep-to-active transition time. This is made possible by a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) ONU that can transit into sleep or doze modes during its idle time. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms in terms of polling cycle time, power consumption, percentage of energy-savings, and average delay. The energy-efficiency of a VCSEL ONU that can transition into sleep or doze mode is compared to an always-ON distributed feedback (DFB) laser ONU. Simulation results indicate that both JIT and J-FIT DBA algorithms result in improved energy-efficiency whilst J-FIT performs better in terms of energy-savings at low network loads. The J-FIT DBA however, results in increased average delay in comparison to the JIT DBA.

C5L2, a 7-transmembrane receptor, serves a dual function, binding the lipogenic hormone acylation stimulating protein (ASP), and C5a, involved in innate immunity.Aim:We evaluated the impact of C5L2 on macrophage infiltration in WAT of wildtype (Ctl) and C5L2 knock-out (C5L2-/-) mice over 6, 12 and 24 weeks on a chow diet and moderate diet-induced obesity (DIO) conditions.Results:In Ctl mice, WAT C5L2 and C5a receptor mRNA increased (up to 10-fold) both over time and with DIO. By contrast, in C5L2-/-, there was no change in C5aR in WAT. C5L2-/- mice displayed higher macrophage content in WAT, varying by time, fat depot and diet, associated with altered systemic and WAT cytokine patterns compared to Ctl mice. However, in all cases, the M1 (pro-) vs M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophage proportion was unchanged but C5L2-/- adipose tissue secretome appeared to be more chemoattractant. Moreover, C5L2-/- mice have increased food intake, increased WAT, and altered WAT lipid gene expression, which is reflected systemically. Furthermore, C5L2-/- mice have altered glucose/insulin metabolism, adiponectin and insulin signalling gene expression in WAT, which could contribute to development of insulin resistance.Conclusion:Disruption of C5L2 increases macrophage presence in WAT, contributing to obesity-associated pathologies, and further supports a dual role of complement in WAT. Understanding this effect of the complement system pathway could contribute to targeting treatment of obesity and its comorbidities. © 2013 Gauvreau et al.",,"adiponectin; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; CD163 antigen; complement component C3 receptor; complement component C3a receptor; complement component C5a; complement component C5a receptor; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2; G protein coupled receptor; G protein coupled receptor 77; glucose; glycoprotein p 15095; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inducible nitric oxide synthase; insulin; interleukin 12p40; interleukin 6; keratinocyte derived chemokine; messenger RNA; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; RANTES; stromelysin; suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha gene; cell infiltration; cellular distribution; complement classical pathway; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 gene; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 gene; diet; disease association; female; food intake; gene; gene expression; genotype; glucose metabolism; insulin metabolism; insulin resistance; intracellular signaling; knockout mouse; lipid storage; macrophage; macrophage infiltration; macrophage M1; macrophage M2; male; molecular interaction; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma gene; protein deficiency; weight gain; white adipose tissue; Adipokines; Animals; Body Weight; Cells, Cultured; Chemotactic Factors; Complement System Proteins; Cytokines; Energy Intake; Female; Gene Expression; Glucose; Inflammation Mediators; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Lipid Metabolism; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Obesity; Receptors, Chemokine; Receptors, Formyl Peptide; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876441851

We have carried out a detailed mechanistic study on TiO2 hydrogenation through H and/or H2 diffusion from the surface into subsurface layers of anatase TiO2 (101) by periodic density functional theory calculations implementing on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT + U). Both H atoms and H2 molecules can migrate from the crystal surface into TiO2 near subsurface layer with 27.8 and 46.2 kcal/mol energy barriers, respectively. The controlling step for the former process is the dissociative adsorption of H2 on the surface which requires 47.8 kcal/mol of energy barrier. Both hydrogen incorporation processes are expected to be equally favorable. The barrier energy for H2 migration from the first layer of the subsurface Osub1 to the 2nd layer of the subsurface oxygen Osub2 requires only 6.6 kcal. The presence of H atoms on the surface and inside the subsurface layer tends to promote both H and H2 penetration into the subsurface layer by reducing their energy barriers, as well as to prevent the escape of the H2 from the cage by increasing its escaping barrier energy. The H2 molecule inside a cage can readily dissociate and form 2HO-species exothermically (ΔH = -31.0 kcal/mol) with only 26.2 kcal/mol barrier. The 2HO-species within the cage may further transform into H2O with a 22.0 kcal/mol barrier and 19.3 kcal/mol exothermicity relative to the caged H2 molecule. H 2O formation following the breaking of Ti-O bonds within the cage may result in the formation of O-vacancies and surface disordering as observed experimentally under a high pressure and moderately high temperature condition. According to density of states analysis, the projected density of states of the interstitial H, H2, and H2O appear prominently within the TiO2 band gap; in addition, the former induces a shift of the band gap position notably towards the conduction band. The thermochemistry for formation of the most stable sub-surface species (2HO and H2O) has been predicted. These results satisfactorily account for the photo-catalytic activity enhancement observed experimentally by hydrogenation at high temperatures and high pressures. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.",,"Density-of-states analysis; Dissociative adsorption; High temperatures and high pressures; Hydrogen incorporation; Moderately high temperature; Periodic density functional theory calculations; Photocatalytic activities; Projected density of state; Energy barriers; Energy gap; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Molecules; Quantum chemistry; Titanium dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887372519

The composite PCM were characterized by using Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transformation infrared spectrum analysis (FT-IR). The thermal properties, thermal stability and reliability of the composite were determined by using Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA) and thermal cycling test. Test results showed that the maximum percentage of DA retained in GGBS without seepage was 11%. This composite was therefore called as form-stable composite PCM. FT-IR results validate that the components of the form-stable composite are chemically stable. The melting and freezing temperatures of the composite PCM were found to be 21.16 C and 19.1 C while the latent heat of melting and freezing were 22.51 J/g and 21.62 J/g. The results of TGA and thermal cycling test confirmed that the form-stable composite is thermally stable and reliable.

C.; Henriksson, U.Bridging-cluster model for hydrophobic attraction. Langmuir 2007, 23, 10026-10033) to the recently published surface force isotherms for water films between hexadecylthiolated gold surfaces in the thickness range of 20-100 nm and temperature range of 10-40 C (Wang, J.; Yoon, R.-H.; Eriksson, J. C.Excess thermodynamic properties of thin water films confined between hydrophobized gold surfaces. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2011, 364, 257-263). We show that these isotherms can be faithfully reproduced on the basis of the bridging-cluster model. The thermodynamic excess properties (ΔGc, ΔHc, and TΔSc) of linear clusters that are assumed to bridge the core of the films were calculated from the experimental surface force isotherms. A crucial step taken was to infer two-dimensional ideal mixing of the clusters with the surrounding film water. We find that ΔHc and TΔSc are both negative quantities, with the latter being larger than the former, which implies a positive excess Gibbs energy of a cluster, ΔGc = ΔHc - TΔSc. Typically, for temperatures between 10 and 40 C, these cluster properties are of the order of some kBT units, corresponding to 10-4-10 -3kBT per water molecule entailed. Our analysis yields support of the notion that elongated aggregates can arise in thin films of water between hydrophobic surfaces driven by entropy of mixing. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Cluster property; Entropy of mixing; Excess Gibbs energy; Excess properties; Hydrophobic attraction; Hydrophobic surfaces; Temperature range; Thin water films; Digital storage; Gold; Isotherms; Mixing; Surface chemistry; Thermodynamic properties; Thin films; Hydrophobicity; gold; organogold compound; thiol derivative; water; article; chemical phenomena; chemistry; surface property; thermodynamics; Gold; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Organogold Compounds; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Surface Properties; Thermodynamics; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876258908

We calculate Li insertion characteristics in SWSiNTs and compare them with the respective ones in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and other silicon nanostructures. From our calculations, SWSiNTs show higher reactivity toward the adsorption of Li adatoms than CNTs and Si nanoclusters. Considering the importance of Li kinetics, we demonstrate that the interior of SWSiNTs may serve as a fast Li diffusion channel. The important advantage of SWSiNTs over their carbon analogues is a sevenfold reduction in the energy barrier for the penetration of the Li atoms into the nanotube interior through the sidewalls. This prepossesses easier Li diffusion inside the tube and subsequent utilization of the interior sites, which enhances Li storage capacity of the system. The improvements in both Li uptake and Li mobility over their analogues support the great potential of SWSiNTs as Li-ion battery anodes. Enhancing Li diffusion: Li adsorption and diffusion in single-walled Si nanotubes (SWSiNTs) of interest to Li-ion battery anodes are studied theoretically. SWSiNTs show a higher reactivity toward the adsorption of Li atoms compared to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Si nanoclusters. A lower energy barrier for penetration of the Li atoms into the nanotubes through the sidewalls is found relative to that for CNTs, which may suggest enhanced Li diffusion rates.

Amphicarpy is a rare mode of reproduction in which aerial and subterranean seeds are produced by the same individual. In the present paper, we compare morphology, anther number, pollen viability, seed production and mode of reproduction of T. argentinense flowers, and comment on the life strategy of the species. Plants grown from aerial seeds and from the regrowth of storage roots of aerial plants had longer stolons and a larger plant diameter than did those grown from subterranean plants. Plants grown from seeds were also taller than plants grown from storage roots. More resources were allocated to subterranean reproduction in plants of subterranean origin than in those of aerial origin. Aerial flowers produced more seeds, presented more anthers and produced more pollen grains than did the subterranean ones. T. argentinense is a versatile species, self- and cross-pollinated, consistent with the values of high polymorphism information content. T. argentinense adopts the 'pessimistic strategy' (early allocation of energy to large subterranean propagules), common in amphicarpic species when growing in disturbed habitats, such as the native pastures of Rio Grande do Sul, where intense grazing and trampling, as well as long seasonal dry spells, may periodically destroy the aerial plants, thus assuring survival by germination of subterranean seeds and regrowth of storage roots. © CSIRO 2013.","ecology; Leguminosae; mode of reproduction; pastures.","flower; growth rate; habitat availability; morphology; plant community; regrowth; reproductive behavior; reproductive strategy; seed production; subterranean environment; trampling; Brazil; Rio Grande do Sul; Fabaceae; Trifolium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875982762

The design of the refueling station does not influence the refueling of the vehicle when the requirements of the technical information report J2601 from Society of Automotive Engineers are met.

Hydrate formation kinetics at driving forces of 2 MPa, 5 MPa and 7 MPa were studied. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) concentration was varied between 1 mol% and 5 mol% and its effect on hydrate formation kinetics was investigated. With an increase in the driving force there was an increase in gas uptake till super saturation. However, the increased driving force had little effect on the reduction of induction time even at high promoter (THF) concentration. 5 mol% THF solutions behave distinctly exhibiting an increased hydrate growth compared to low promoter concentrations due to the occurrence of multiple nucleation events (observed based on temperature spikes and gas uptake). Rate of hydrate formation increased with an increase in driving force for a given concentration of THF promoter. Water conversion to hydrates in the range of 2.8-10.8% was achieved for all the experiments.

A clear correlation between rinsing volume and PPy degradation was found using water- or NaCl-rinsing solutions as evidenced by conductivity and electroactivity losses. It was further found, through FTIR-ATR as well as XPS-measurements, that this degradation was caused by incorporation of hydroxyl groups in the PPy-layer. The extent of degradation correlated with a shift in the FTIR-ATR peak around 1300 cm-1, showing that FTIR-ATR may be used as a quick diagnostic tool to evaluate the extent of degradation. By the use of acidic rinsing solution, this degradation effect was eliminated and resulted in superior samples in terms of both conductivity and electroactivity and also in a more efficient removal of reactants. Upon ambient storage, over a period of 200 days, a gradual decrease in conductivity was found for initially highly conductive samples. The electroactivity, on the other hand, was relatively unaffected by storage, showing that conductivity measurements alone are ineffective to determine the degree of polymer degradation if the water content is not controlled.

Both observed and modeled North American and Eurasian snow cover in the pan-Arctic have statistically significant negative trends from April through June over the period 1972-2006. To diagnose the causes of the pan-Arctic SCE recession, the authors identify the role of surface energy fluxes generated in VIC and assess the relationships between 15 hydroclimatic indicators and NOAA SCE observations over each snowcovered sensitivity zone (SCSZ) for both North America and Eurasia. The authors find that surface net radiation (SNR) provides the primary energy source and sensible heat (SH) plays a secondary role in observed changes of SCE. As compared with SNR and SH, latent heat has only a minor influence on snow cover changes. In addition, these changes in surface energy fluxes resulting in the pan-Arctic snow cover recession are mainly driven by statistically significant decreases in snow surface albedo and increased air temperatures (surface air temperature, daily maximum temperature, and daily minimum temperature), as well as statistically significant increased atmospheric water vapor pressure. Contributions of other hydroclimate variables that the authors analyzed (downward shortwave radiation, precipitation, diurnal temperature range, wind speed, and cloud cover) are not significant for observed SCE changes in either the North American or Eurasian SCSZs. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric water vapor; Diurnal temperature ranges; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Primary energy source; Spatial and temporal variation; Surface air temperatures; Surface energy fluxes; Variable infiltration capacities; Atmospheric temperature; Digital storage; Interfacial energy; Snow; air temperature; albedo; latent heat flux; net radiation; NOAA satellite; Northern Hemisphere; sensible heat flux; snow cover; spatial variation; temporal variation; Eurasia; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875869276

Voltage sags lead to huge financial losses all over the world which makes them more important for sensitive load centers. In this paper, a three-phase voltage sag compensator is proposed. The proposed voltage sag compensator is based on the ac-ac conversion eliminating the energy storage elements and dc link capacitors in the conventional voltage sag compensators such as dynamic voltage restorers (DVRs). The proposed topology in this paper energizes the compensator of each phase from the other two phases. Regarding that the single-phase voltage sags are the most frequent types of voltage sags, the faulted phase will be supplied by the two healthy phases in the most cases of voltage sags. This results in a more successful operation under very deep single-phase voltage sags. Even if one phase is lost, the proposed compensator will continue to supply all three phases of the sensitive load. Beside the single-phase voltage sags, the compensator can compensate for any balanced and unbalanced voltage sag accompanied with phase jump. The proposed voltage sag compensator is validated using digital simulation case studies with PSCAD/EMTDC software and experimental results from a laboratory-scale prototype. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Each detection block consists of two arrays of 4$\, \times\,$8 avalanche photodiodes (APD) individually coupled to an 8$\, \times\,$ 8 scintillator array, to form 64 independent detectors with parallel readout channels. This new detection block entails an eightfold increase in pixel density compared to the LabPET I. A 64-channel mixed-signal application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) was designed to extract relevant PET data in real time from the LabPET II detection blocks. In order to interface the ASICs forming the PET camera with the storage units, a real-time FPGA-based digital data acquisition (DAQ) system was designed. The DAQ system allows event harvesting, processing and transmission to a host computer for data storage as well as system programming and calibration. Real-time event processing embedded in the DAQ includes time trigger, energy computation using a time-over-threshold (TOT) conversion scheme, timing corrections, and event sorting trees. In the standard DAQ mode, a real-time coincidence engine analyzes events and only keeps relevant information to minimize data throughput and post-acquisition data processing. The architecture consists of three FPGA-based electronic layers wired through gigabit links: a Front-End layer extracts time and energy along with the pixel address, a custom Hub layer chronologically sorts incoming events, and a Coincidence engine matches coincident events and computes an estimate of the random events rate. Every FPGA in the different layers is accessible through an Ethernet link.

The CNTs are randomly dispersed between the GNS and hence, the hybrid papers exhibit high mechanical strength and flexibility even after being annealed at 800 °C. Electrochemical properties of the hybrid papers are strongly dependent on the CNT/GN ratios. Highest lithium ion storage capacities were obtained in the paper with a CNT/GN ratio of 2:1. The initial reversible specific capacities are ∼375 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1. The capacities remain above 330 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles, which are about 100 mAh g -1 higher than those of the graphene paper with nearly the same mass. The improved capacities were attributed to the contribution of the CNTs, which prevent restacking of the GNS, increase cross-plane electric conductivity of the paper and simultaneously, store Li ions.

In this context, the objective of this work is threefold: develop an adequate model for simulation of individual and group of refrigerators; implement practical strategies to manage the demand of refrigerators during peak time; and analyze the impact of such strategies in the operation of distribution systems.

Fungi are a major decomposer group in the aquatic carbon cycle, and are one of few groups thought to be capable of breaking down woody (lignified) tissue. In this work we have used high spatial resolution (synchrotron light source) infrared micro-spectroscopy to study the interaction between aquatic fungi and lignified leaf vein material (xylem) from River Redgum trees (E. camaldulensis) endemic to the lowland rivers of South-Eastern Australia. The work provides spatially explicit evidence that fungal colonisation of leaf litter involves the oxidative breakdown of lignin immediately adjacent to the fungal tissue and depletion of the lignin-bound cellulose. Cellulose depletion occurs over relatively short length scales (5-15 μm) and highlights the likely importance of mechanical breakdown in accessing the carbohydrate content of this resource. Low bioavailability compounds (oxidized lignin and polyphenols of plant origin) remain in colonised leaves, even after fungal activity diminishes, and suggests a possible pathway for the sequestration of carbon in wetlands. The work shows that fungi likely have a critical role in the partitioning of lignified material into a biodegradable fraction that can re-enter the aquatic carbon cycle, and a recalcitrant fraction that enters long-term storage in sediments or contribute to the formation of dissolved organic carbon in the water column. © 2013 Kerr et al.",,"carbon; cellulose; dissolved organic matter; lignin; polyphenol; aquatic species; article; Australia; carbon cycle; controlled study; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; fungal colonization; high spatial resolution infrared micro spectroscopy; infrared spectroscopy; leaf litter; leaf vein; litter decomposition; nonhuman; optical resolution; plant fungus interaction; synchrotron radiation; wetland; xylem; Aquatic Organisms; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Ecological and Environmental Processes; Eucalyptus; Fungi; Lignin; Microtechnology; Multivariate Analysis; Plant Leaves; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875919563

Due to the restricted communication range and high network density, event forwarding in WSNs is very challenging and requires multihop data forwarding. Currently, the energy-efficient ant based routing (EEABR) algorithm, based on the ant colony optimization (ACO) metaheuristic, is one of the state-of-the-art energy-aware routing protocols. In this paper, we propose three improvements to the EEABR algorithm to further improve its energy efficiency. The improvements to the original EEABR are based on the following: (1) a new scheme to intelligently initialize the routing tables giving priority to neighboring nodes that simultaneously could be the destination, (2) intelligent update of routing tables in case of a node or link failure, and (3) reducing the flooding ability of ants for congestion control. The energy efficiency improvements are significant particularly for dynamic routing environments. Experimental results using the RMASE simulation environment show that the proposed method increases the energy efficiency by up to 9% and 64% in converge-cast and target-tracking scenarios, respectively, over the original EEABR without incurring a significant increase in complexity. The method is also compared and found to also outperform other swarm-based routing protocols such as sensor-driven and cost-aware ant routing (SC) and Beesensor. © 2013 Adamu Murtala Zungeru et al.",,"Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Communication range; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy-aware routing protocol; Neighboring nodes; Performance improvements; Simulation environment; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Artificial intelligence; Communication; Complex networks; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Routers; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875650869

For instance, PEG serves as a unique moiety for pegylation of ""biobetter"" drug development, PEG provides controlled-release and preserved activity of biologics, and PEG modified surface works as an antibiofouling surface. The primary characteristics of PEG molecules used in relevant applications have been attributed mainly to the hydration behavior in aqueous solutions. However, the effects on the solvation of solutes in solution caused by presenting PEG molecules as a cosolvent, as well as the thermodynamics aspect of the hydration behavior of PEG in solution, have not been well documented. The solvation behavior of solutes, such as protein, with PEG as a cosolvent, indicates the success of PEG applications, such as biofouling and controlled release. In this investigation, we examined the effects of a buffer solution containing PEG molecules on the solution behavior of solute and the interactions between solid surfaces with solutes. We adapted the study by selecting a lysozyme as a solute in a buffer solution with either ammonium sulfate (kosmotrope) or sodium chloride (chaotrope) and anionic resin (SP-Sepharose) as solid surfaces. The experiments primarily involved binding equilibrium measurements and thermodynamics analysis. The results revealed that, in both saline buffers, adding PEG increases the binding affinity between the lysozyme and the resin, similar to kosmotropic salt in the examined salt concentrations. The thermodynamics analyses involving microcalorimetric measurements show that the bindings are mainly driven by enthalpy, indicating that electrostatic interaction was the primary binding force under these experimental conditions. The variations of the enthalpy and entropy of the binding thermodynamics when adding PEG to different salt types in the buffer solution showed opposite behavior, and the results support the concept of kosmotrope-like behavior of PEG. The equilibrium and thermodynamics data demonstrate that PEG has a kosmotrope-like hydration behavior, and the extent of kosmotrope-like behavior depends on the molecular weight of PEG with the outcomes of various molecular weights of PEG being added to the binding solution. The results of this study provide essential knowledge for PEG as an additive (or cosolvent) in various research applications. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding isotherm measurement; Binding thermodynamics; Biomedical applications; Experimental conditions; Polyethylene glycol (PEG); Research applications; Thermodynamics analysis; Thermodynamics data; Binding energy; Digital storage; Enthalpy; Enzymes; Hydration; Medical applications; Molecular weight; Molecules; Polyethylene glycols; Resins; Solvation; Surface analysis; Thermodynamics; lysozyme; macrogol derivative; water; article; calorimetry; chemistry; metabolism; thermodynamics; Calorimetry; Muramidase; Polyethylene Glycols; Thermodynamics; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875798174

The pellets are used in large-scale as well as in small-scale applications, and increased demands on pellet quality are likely to force pellet producers to improve on the pellet properties. One way of increasing pellet quality is by using additives. The purpose of this article, therefore, is to examine kraft lignin as an additive. Pellets were produced in a small industrial pellet press located at Karlstad University, Karlstad, Sweden, and 1-4% of kraft lignin was added to the pellets. The results indicate that the addition of an increased amount of kraft lignin to the pellets increases their mechanical durability and their lengths. The results also indicate that dry kraft lignin yields pellets with higher durability as compared to wet kraft lignin. The energy demand was unaffected by the increased use of kraft lignin.

It is thus possible to have ac and dc subgrids intertied to form hybrid microgrids with lesser power conversion, and hence higher efficiency. However, operation of hybrid microgrids to gain these advantages is not trivial, and is so far limited. It is, therefore, the theme here to develop a control scheme for the hybrid microgrids so that they can operate efficiently with progressive energy flow tuning and no requirement for fast communication links. A plug-in scheme is also proposed for progressive and selective charging/discharging of storages, which are likely to be present in the hybridmicrogrids for energy smoothing and ride-through purposes. The overall scheme has already been verified in experiment. © 2012 IEEE.","Distributed generation; Droop control; Energy storage; Microgrids",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891109552

To maximize energy efficiency for storage (ηEstorage), total leakage power is kept low by selecting the supercapacitors to charge sequentially, alternately, or in series based on their voltages. To maximize energy efficiency for driving load (η Edriving), residual energy is minimized by switching to series composition of the supercapacitors in order to raise the voltage above theminimum input voltage of the load-side dc-dc converter. Due to the nonlinear, stateful, load-dependent behavior of such harvesters, parameter sweeping is used for system-level optimization. A topology-reconfigurable structure consisting of two larger, symmetric ""reservoir"" supercapacitors and one voltage-raising ""bootcap"" proves to be efficient and practical when considering combinations of symmetric and asymmetric capacitance values. Experimental results on an actual implementation show that for charging, series topology is best when input power is high due to lower leakage, and individual topology is best when input power is low due to lower voltage; for discharging, series topology is effective in reducing residual energy while individual topology with alternating discharging effectively minimizes leakage. © 2012 IEEE.","Energy harvesting; Leakage rate; Reconfigurable topology; Supercapacitor subsystem",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882301404

Aluminum (Al), a ubiquitous environmental contaminant is implicated in anemia, osteomalacia, hepatic disorder, and neurological disorder. In this review, we outline how this intracellular generator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggers a metabolic shift towards lipogenesis in astrocytes and hepatocytes. This Al-evoked phenomenon is coupled to diminished mitochondrial activity, anerobiosis, and the channeling of α-ketoacids towards anti-oxidant defense. The resulting metabolic reconfiguration leads to fat accumulation and a reduction in ATP synthesis, characteristics that are common to numerous medical disorders. Hence, the ability of Al toxicity to create an oxidative environment promotes dysfunctional metabolic processes in astrocytes and hepatocytes.

In the approach, the residual energy model was formulated based on the measured terminal voltage with respect to a certain state of charge value. Subsequently, the stored energy of an LFP battery was evaluated by using the obtained voltage characterizations. This is followed by the difference calculated between the fully stored energy and the residual energy such that the suitable time to enact the high-rate charge is determined, thereby ensuring a battery of full capacity in stable, safe, and nonovercharged conditions. Moreover, for the hysteresis effects that may affect the battery voltage evaluation, they are also included in the charge process in this study. In order to validate the method, this proposed strategy has been examined from perspectives of charge time, charge efficiency, and the number of charge cycles. Compared with other charge strategies, both the charge time and the charge efficiency are highly improved, hence confirming the feasibility of the method for energy storage applications. © 2012 IEEE.","Charge strategy; LiFePO4 (LFP) battery; State of charge (SOC)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879086005

The 100 Gy radiation treatments on 10th and 30th days after harvest completely prevented sprouting at both varieties studied but on 50th day only Agria tubers not sprouted. This study indicated that early irradiation and absorbed radiation doses significantly decreased sprouting, percent weight loss and specific gravity of tubers. Reducing sugar content significantly increased by delay in irradiation and lower dose of radiation while non-reducing sugars did not decrease significantly by delay in irradiation and higher dose of radiation. The least increase in reducing sugars (10.2%) and most decrease in non-reducing sugar (-12.75%) were observed in tubers that irradiated on 10th day after harvest. The content of ascorbic acid was decreased by irradiation with higher dose. Although delay in irradiation caused less loss of ascorbic acid (8.5%) but showed greater metabolic changes as sprouting, weight loss, firmness, and sugars contents. Also, more increased delay in irradiation needed higher radiation doses for sprout inhibition. © 2011 Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).","Different dates; Potato; Sprouting; Storage; γ-radiation","Ascorbic acid; Energy storage; Food storage; Gamma rays; Harvesting; Irradiation; Radiotherapy; Sugars; Timing circuits; Absorbed radiation; Different dates; Factorial experiment; Metabolic changes; Potato; Quality characteristic; Radiation treatments; Sprouting; Radiation effects; Agria; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878490406

Furthermore, at high current rates (10, 20 and 40 C), it displayed remarkable capacity retention. Equally impressive is the long term cycle life. Nearly 50% of the initial capacity was retained after 30,000 charge/discharge cycles at 40 C (4.7 A/g). Notably, coulombic effi ciency was 99.68% (average) over the course of cycling.

To gain additional information on the potential impacts of invertebrates feeding on cyanobacteria, we fed Elliptio complanata mussels with two types of algae: Anabaena flos-aquae (cyanobacteria) and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (green algae). Physiological parameters were examined at the energy status, immune system and oxidative stress levels. Energy status was examined by following the rate of electron transport activity in mitochondria (a measure of cellular energy expense) and lipid/sugar stores in the visceral mass. The cyanobacteria were not actively producing toxins. Based on the digestive gland index, the mussels fed equally on either regime. However, the energy status in mussels fed A. flos-aquae revealed that the total sugar was lower in the digestive gland, whereas mitochondrial electron transport activity (MET), once corrected against the digestive gland somatic index, showed increased energy expenses. Acetylcholinesterase activity and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were also higher in mussels fed with A. flos-aquae compared with mussels fed with P. subcapitata. LPO was correlated by mitochondrial activity in both the digestive gland and gills, suggesting that oxidative stress resulted from metabolic respiration. Immunocompetence (phagocytic activity, natural killer cell-like activity, haemocyte count and viability) and humoral level of lysozyme were not affected in mussels by the algae or cyanobacteria regime. Moreover, the xenobiotic conjugating enzyme, glutathione S-transferase, hemoprotein oxidase and vitellogenin-like proteins were not affected in mussel organs via ingestion of A. flos-aquae. Our study suggests that ingestion of cyanobacteria leads to increased energy expenses, oxidative stress and increased acetylcholine turnover in mussels. © 2013 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.","Anabaena flos-aquae; Energy status; Freshwater mussels; Immunocompetence; Oxidative stress","acetylcholinesterase; glutathione transferase; hemoprotein oxidase; lipid; lysozyme; sugar; unclassified drug; vitellogenin like protein; bivalve; cyanobacterium; energy; immune system; lipid; oxidation; physiological response; Anabaena flos-aquae; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; blood cell; cell viability; controlled study; correlation analysis; electron transport; Elliptio complanata; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; exocrine gland; gill; humoral immunity; immune system; lipid peroxidation; lipid storage; mitochondrion; mussel; natural killer cell; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phagocytosis; priority journal; Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata; Acetylcholinesterase; Anabaena; Animals; Biological Markers; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Chlorophyta; Electron Transport; Energy Metabolism; Gastrointestinal Tract; Glutathione Transferase; Lipid Peroxidation; Mitochondria; Multivariate Analysis; Nutritive Value; Oxidative Stress; Synaptic Transmission; Unionidae; algae; Anabaena flos-aquae; Chlorophyta; Cyanobacteria; Elliptio complanata; Invertebrata; Selenastrum capricornutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876667219

Globally, land-use change is a major driver of changes in belowground C storage. The emerging bioenergy industry is likely to drive widespread land-use changes, including the replacement of annually tilled croplands with perennial bioenergy crops, and thereby to impact the climate system through alteration of belowground C dynamics. Mechanistic understanding of how land-use changes impact belowground C storage requires elucidation of changes in belowground C flows; however, altered belowground C dynamics following land-use change have yet to be thoroughly quantified through field measurements. Here, we show that belowground C cycling pathways of establishing perennial bioenergy crops (0- to 3. 5-year-old miscanthus, switchgrass, and a native prairie mix) were substantially altered relative to row crop agriculture (corn-soy rotation); specifically, there were substantial increases in belowground C allocation (>400%), belowground biomass (400-750%), root-associated respiration (up to 2,500%), moderate reductions in litter inputs (20-40%), and respiration in root-free soil (up to 50%). This more active root-associated C cycling of perennial vegetation provides a mechanism for observed net C sequestration by these perennial ecosystems, as well as commonly observed increases in soil C under perennial bioenergy crops throughout the world. The more active root-associated belowground C cycle of perennial vegetation implies a climate benefit of grassland maintenance or restoration, even if biomass is harvested annually for bioenergy production. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","belowground carbon allocation; bioenergy/biofuels; carbon cycle; establishment phase; perennial grasses; root allocation; soil organic carbon; soil respiration","bioenergy; biofuel; biogeochemistry; biomass allocation; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; crop rotation; energy crop; grass; harvesting; land use change; perennial plant; soil carbon; soil organic matter; Miscanthus; Panicum virgatum; Poaceae; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876304167

Torrefaction offers a range of potentially beneficial logistics properties but the actual benefits depend upon how the supply chain is configured to address various elements of customer demand. Hence, the aim of this paper is to develop a framework for torrefaction configuration in a supply chain perspective for different types of customers. Design/methodology/approach: Sophisticated pre-treatment processes are yet to reach the commercialisation phase. Identification of possible supply chain configurations is in this paper done through a conceptual approach by bringing together knowledge from related research fields such as unrefined forest fuel, pellets and coal logistics with prescriptions for configuration derived from the subject area of supply chain management (SCM). Findings: A framework that explicates different elements of supply and demand of torrefaction is proposed, and exemplified by three distinct supply chains. Depending on demand, torrefaction serves different purposes, bridging gaps in place, time, quality and ownership. Furthermore, different supply chain configurations will pose different requirements on torrefaction in terms of producing different product quality, durability, energy density and hydrophobicity of the pellets. Research limitations/implications: The proposed framework entails a set of propositions, but requires further development through empirical studies using complementary research methods such as interviews or surveys and quantification through techno-economical or optimisation from a supply chain perspective. Practical implications: This paper provides a framework that can inform decisions makers in biomass-to-energy supply chains, in particular at torrefaction plants, on upstream and downstream implications of their decisions. Originality/value: The findings have implications for biomass-to-energy supply chains in general, and in particular, the paper provides a supply chain perspective of pre-treatment processes, where previous research has focused primarily on technical aspects of torrefaction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Distribution management; Logistics; Pre-treatment; Supply chain configuration; Supply chain management; Torrefaction","Conceptual approaches; Design/methodology/approach; Distribution management; Pre-Treatment; Pretreatment process; Supply chain configuration; Supply chain managements (SCM); Torrefaction; Biomass; Economics; Energy resources; Logistics; Pelletizing; Research; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875616251

It marks a knickpoint along the Colorado River at the top of the steep Grand Canyon, and it is central to debate about the patterns of erosion and sources of uplift in this famous landscape. New chronostratigraphic data from the suite of fill terraces here indicate a strong fluvial response to climate drivers superimposed upon an integrated mid-to-late Pleistocene incision rate of ~350 m/m.y. A regional compilation of well-constrained results over the same timescale reveals that this is intermediate between slower rates downstream in Grand Canyon and even faster rates in the central Colorado Plateau, which taper off again farther upstream near the plateau's eastern edge. This bull's-eye pattern of rapid incision in the central Colorado Plateau does not match proposed sources of uplift from mantle dynamics at the south and west flank of the plateau, nor patterns of river steepness and energy. Instead we suggest that this incision pattern is primarily driven by transient response to drainage integration and isostatic feedback from the deep exhumation of weak rocks in the central plateau. © 2013 Geological Society of America.",,"Chronostratigraphic data; Chronostratigraphy; Colorado Plateau; Colorado River; Fluvial response; Grand Canyons; Incision rates; Mantle dynamics; Digital storage; Rivers; chronostratigraphy; drainage; erosion; landscape; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; terrace; uplift; Arizona; Colorado Plateau; Colorado River [North America]; Grand Canyon; Lees Ferry; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875481557

We used long-nosed and southern brown bandicoots in northern Sydney to investigate whether environmental and demographic variables can influence faecal glucocorticoid metabolites.

Higher faecal glucocorticoid metabolites were recorded in female southern brown bandicoots than in males, whilst female and male long-nosed bandicoots had similar glucocorticoid metabolite levels.

A novel process of pre-impregnation is proposed to prepare cobalt-embedded OMC. This process is based on using cobalt chelated chitosan as carbon precursor. The surface functional groups and metal contents were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The bulk cobalt contents in the cobalt-embedded OMCs were measured by an atomic absorption spectrometer. The morphology of the OMCs was observed by small angle X-ray scattering analysis and transmission electron microscope. The OMC texture characteristics were determined by using nitrogen adsorption analysis. Hydrogen capacities of the OMCs were obtained by a volumetric method. The cobalt-embedded OMCs possess obviously higher hydrogen adsorption capacity than that of pure OMC. At 298 K and under 5.5 MPa, the hydrogen capacities of the OMC and OMC-Co-5 are 0.2 and 0.45 wt%, respectively.

HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) analyses were also performed to determine the concentrations of four organic acids (oxalic, succinic, pyruvic and lactic) present in the hemolymph of infected and uninfected snails, to better understand the effect of infection on the host's energetic/oxidative metabolism. The snails were dissected 1-4. weeks after infection to collect the hemolymph and separate the tissues. There was alteration in the glycemia of the snails at both parasite doses, with a significant increase of glycemia from of the third week after infection in comparison to the control group. Changes were also observed in the lactate dehydrogenase activity, with increased activity as the infection progressed. In parallel, there was a decrease in the glycogen content in the storage tissues, with a markedly greater reduction in the digestive gland-gonad complex (larval development site) in comparison with the cephalopedal mass.

The effects of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) alignment on the dielectric properties for MWCNT/polystyrene composites in the X-band (8.2-12.4. GHz) were investigated by comparing the dielectric properties of injection moulded samples, where MWCNTs were aligned, versus compression moulded samples, where MWCNTs were randomly distributed. Raman spectroscopy technique was employed to verify partial alignment of MWCNTs in the injection moulded samples. The compression moulded samples showed an insulator-conductor transition window at 0.50-2.00. wt% of MWCNT, whereas the injection moulded samples showed a significantly wider transition window at 3.50-10.00. wt% of MWCNT. Broader insulator-conductor transition window reduces challenges and risks in manipulating conductive filler/polymer composites around the percolation threshold to regulate the dielectric properties. Moreover, it was observed that MWCNT alignment improved the dielectric properties by reducing the dissipation factor. For instance, at MWCNT concentrations of 0.50 and 2.00. wt%, the compression moulded samples showed dissipation factors of 0.06 and 0.59, respectively, while the injection moulded samples presented the dissipation factors considerably lower and equal to 0.01 and 0.18, respectively.

In spite of the proven efficacy of statin drugs in reducing CHD burden, there is still much room for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents to address the considerable residual cardiovascular risk that remains after treatment with currently available medications. In particular, there is an urgent demand for drugs capable of boosting the concentration and/or function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), thereby promoting reverse cholesterol transport. Phospholipids are naturally occurring fats that play indispensible role in human health via their structural, energy storage, signal transduction and metabolic functions. Supplementation with either purified or mixed preparations of bioactive phospholipids has been reported to ameliorate a range of nutritional and cardiovascular disorders. Moreover, several lines of evidence have supported the efficacy of dietary phospholipids in reducing serum and hepatic contents of cholesterol and triglycerides, while increasing HDL-C and apo A-I levels. These beneficial effects of phospholipids could be attributed to their ability in reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption, enhancing biliary cholesterol excretion and modulating the expression and activity of transcriptional factors and enzymes that are involved in lipoprotein metabolism. Given their extreme safety and biocompatibility, dietary supplementation with phospholipid preparations, in particular phosphatidylinositol, appears as a novel and effective strategy that could be used as an alternative or adjunctive therapy to the current medications.

Critical to this role in hepatocytes is the breakdown of cytoplasmic lipid droplets, a process referred to as lipophagy. Conversely, autophagy is required for adipocyte differentiation and the concurrent accumulation of lipid droplets. Autophagy also affects lipid metabolism through contributions to lipoprotein assembly. A number of reports have now implicated autophagy in the degradation of apolipoprotein B, the main structural protein of very-low-density-lipoprotein. Aberrant autophagy may also be involved in conditions of deregulated lipid homeostasis in metabolic disorders such as the metabolic syndrome. First, insulin signalling and autophagy activity appear to diverge in a mechanism of reciprocal regulation, suggesting a role for autophagy in insulin resistance. Secondly, upregulation of autophagy may lead to conversion of white adipose tissue into brown adipose tissue, thus regulating energy expenditure and obesity. Thirdly, upregulation of autophagy in hepatocytes could increase breakdown of lipid stores controlling triglyceride homeostasis and fatty liver. Taken together, autophagy appears to play a very complex role in lipid homeostasis, affecting lipid stores differently depending on the tissue, as well as contributing to pathways of lipoprotein metabolism. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Apolipoprotein B; Autophagy; Lipophagy; Metabolic syndrome; Very-low-density-lipoprotein","apolipoprotein B; fat droplet; lipid; lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein; adipocyte; adipose tissue; autophagy; brown adipose tissue; cell differentiation; energy expenditure; fatty liver; homeostasis; insulin resistance; lipid storage; lipophagocytosis; lipoprotein metabolism; liver; liver cell; metabolic regulation; metabolic syndrome X; obesity; priority journal; review; white adipose tissue; Adipocytes; Animals; Apolipoproteins B; Autophagy; Hepatocytes; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lipoproteins",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873436219

Our results show that the majority-spin direction of the lattice electronic states depends upon the dimer identity, the lattice spin polarization being in the same direction as the dimer spin polarization for Fe2 and FeCo, but opposite for Co2 and Ni2. We can understand this by examining the electronic density of states of the dimer and the lattice. We also show that coadsorption significantly increases the adsorption energies of both dimer and hydrogen leading to a more strongly-adsorbed dimer, while the bond length and magnetic moment of the upper dimer atom, the latter important for potential magnetic storage applications, are negligibly changed. Our work shows that the coadsorbed hydrogen and metal dimer interact over a long-range, this interaction being mediated by the hydrogen-induced spin-polarization of the graphene lattice. We obtain general insight into how the elemental identity of these magnetic dimers determines the spin-polarized states on the hydrogenated graphene lattice. These results could be important for potential applications of magnetic properties of decorated graphene lattices. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.",,"Adsorption energies; Coadsorbed hydrogen; Density functional theory calculations; Graphene lattices; Hydrogen adsorption; Magnetic dimers; Magnetic transitions; Transition-metal dimers; Carbon dioxide; Density functional theory; Electronic density of states; Graphene; Hydrogen; Magnetic moments; Magnetic storage; Nickel; Spin polarization; Dimers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875784970

In order for this to occur, one must first design metal complexes which can retain magnetic information at temperatures where these applications become possible. This can only be achieved through answering and understanding fundamental questions regarding the observed physical properties of SMMs. While mononuclear lanthanide complexes have shown promise in obtaining high energy barriers for the reversal of the magnetisation they are limited to Single-Ion Magnet behaviour intrinsic to one metal centre with a limited number of unpaired electrons. As a way of increasing the effective anisotropic barrier, systems with higher nuclearity have been sought to increase the spin ground state of the molecule.

The results show that for Sohar zone the tilt angle of a PV array must be adjusted twice a year. The PV array must be slanted at 49° in the period of 21/09-21/03 (n = 255-81), while it must be horizontal (tilt angle is zero) in the period of 21/03-21/09 (n = 81-255).

Loads for an actual house in the City of Milton near Toronto, Canada, were estimated. TRNSYS, a system simulation software tool, was used to model yearly performance of a conventional GSHP system as well as a proposed hybrid GSHP system. Actual yearly data collected from the site were examined against the simulation results. This study demonstrates that hybrid ground source heat pump system combined with solar thermal collectors is a feasible choice for space conditioning for heating dominated houses. It was shown that the solar thermal energy storage in the ground could reduce a large amount of ground heat exchanger (GHX) length. Combining three solar thermal collectors with a total area of 6.81 m2 to a GSHP system will reduce GHX length by 15%. Sensitivity analysis was carried out for different cities of Canada and resulted that Vancouver, with mildest climate compared to other cities, was the best candidate for the proposed solar hybrid GSHP system with a GHX length reduction to solar collector area ratio of 7.64 m/m2. Overall system economic viability was also evaluated using a 20-year life-cycle cost analysis. The analysis showed that there is small economic benefit in comparing to the conventional GSHP system. The net present value of the proposed hybrid system based on the 20-year life-cycle cost analysis was estimated to be in a range of 3.7%-7.6% (or $1500 to $3430 Canadian dollar) lower than the conventional GSHP system depending on the drilling cost. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Design; Ground heat exchanger; Ground source heat pump; Hybrid systems; Modelling; Solar thermal collector","Economic viability; Ground heat exchangers; Life-cycle cost analysis; Solar collector areas; Solar thermal collector; Solar thermal energy; Space conditioning; System simulations; Computer simulation; Cost accounting; Design; Geothermal heat pumps; Heat storage; Hybrid systems; Life cycle; Models; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875182209

Among the different types of thermal energy storage, latent heat thermal energy storage has gained significant attention recently because of its high energy density per unit mass/volume at nearly constant temperature. The current study numerically investigates the solidification of a phase change material (PCM) in a triplex tube heat exchanger with and without internal and external fins to enhance heat transfer during the charging and discharging of PCM. The effects of PCM freezing from the inside tube, the outside tube, and both tubes were investigated using a 2D numerical model developed with the Fluent 6.3.26 software. The pure conduction and natural convection were considered for the simulation. Different design parameters, such as the numbers of fins, fin length and thickness, and PCM unit geometries, were considered. Results indicate that Case G (8-cell PCM unit geometry) achieved complete solidification in a short time; that is, 35% of the finned tube. Experiments were conducted to validate the proposed model.

Conventional current-mode control schemes, which requires adaptive slope compensation, are not attractive in these applications. In this paper, a class of self-oscillating hysteretic current-mode control (HCMC) schemes with frequency stabilization are analyzed and compared. Among them, the ripple HCMC scheme has the advantages of the inherent access to the average inductor current information, and inherent decoupling between the voltage and the frequency loops. The modeling and design procedure of two frequency regulation methods, namely the phase-locked loop (PLL) and delay-locked loop (DLL), are presented and compared in detail. The analysis is applicable to a range of inductive converters such as buck, boost, and buck-boost. HCMC implemented with a DLL is shown to not only offer comparable bandwidth compared to the PLL, but is also more robust against system parameter variations.

The performance of the proposed control scheme is assessed under different scenarios in terms of a key performance index and earning comparison from power sale using actual wind farm and electricity price data. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Australian electricity market; battery energy storage; control applications; model predictive control; power dispatch; renewable energy; wind power","Australian electricity market; Battery energy storage; Control applications; Power dispatch; Renewable energies; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Model predictive control; Wind power; Predictive control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880255296

This paper proposes a simple yet accurate instruction-level energy estimation model for embedded systems. As a case study, the model parameters were determined for a commonly used ARM7TDMI-based microcontroller. The total energy includes the energy consumption of the processor core, Flash memory, memory controller, and SRAM. The model parameters are instructions opcode, number of shift operations, register bank bit flips, instructions weight and their Hamming distance, and different types of memory accesses. Also, the effect of pipeline stalls have been considered. In order to validate the proposed model, a physical hardware platform equipped with energy measurement capabilities was developed. We have conducted experiments on several embedded applications from MiBench benchmark suite and the results show less than 6% error in the energy consumption estimation. We have also developed an energy profiler tool for the systems that use ARM7TDMI processors by embedding the model parameters in an instruction-level profiler from the SimpleScalar toolset which provides valuable information and guidelines for software energy optimization. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Embedded software; energy estimation; energy measurement; memory; regression analysis","Benchmark suites; Embedded application; Energy estimation; Energy optimization; Hardware platform; Instruction-level; Memory controller; Model parameters; Data storage equipment; Electric power measurement; Embedded software; Energy utilization; Estimation; Flash memory; Hamming distance; Instruments; Optimization; Regression analysis; Static random access storage; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879056601

A milli-whistle was connected to the outlet of the GC capillary. When the eluted and GC carrier gases pass through the capillary and milli-whistle, a sound is produced. After a fast Fourier transform (FFT), the sound wave generated from the milli-whistle is picked up by a microphone and the resulting vibration of the milli-whistle body can be recorded by an accelerometer. The release of hydrogen gas, as the result of thermal energy, from ammonia borane (NH3BH3), which has been suggested as a storage medium for hydrogen, was selected as the model sample. The findings show that the frequencies generated, either by sound or by the vibration from the whistle body, were identical. The concentration levels of the released hydrogen gas can be determined online, based on the frequency changes. Ammonia borane was placed in a brass reservoir, heated continually, and the released hydrogen gas was directly injected into the GC inlet at 0.5 min intervals, using a home-built electromagnetic pulse injector. The concentration of hydrogen for each injection can be calculated immediately. When the ammonia borane was encapsulated within a polycarbonate (PC) microtube array membrane, the temperature required for the release of hydrogen can be decreased, which would make such a material more convenient for use.

An electrochemical cell with low cost, safe and utilizing sustainable manganese dioxide (MnO 2) cathode coupled with zinc (Zn) anode in aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) electrolyte is reported. The cyclic voltammetric (CV) profiles are found to be quite different in terms of peak position and current response depending on concentration of NaOH electrolyte.

The CV curves exhibits a pair of reversible redox peaks (within 1e- region) corresponding to sodium ion insertion and extraction but while extending the potential window to second electron reduction resulted in irreversible nature. This is explained to the formation of inhomogeneous reduction reaction due to slow electron diffusion.

Heterogeneous electron transfer from dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 to [Co(bpy)3]3+ ions in solution, a process known as recombination in the context of DSC operation, is an important loss mechanism in these solar cells. Here, we employ impedance spectroscopy over a range of temperatures to characterize electron storage, transport, and recombination in efficient DSCs based on the [Co(bpy) 3]3+/2+ redox mediator, with either the amphiphillic ruthenium sensitizer Z907 or the state-of-the-art organic sensitizer Y123. The temperature dependence of the electron-transport resistance indicates that transport occurs via states at energies lower than commonly assumed for the TiO2 conduction band edge. We show that a non-exponential dependence of capacitance, transport resistance, and recombination resistance on photovoltage can be interpreted as evidence for partial unpinning of the TiO2 energy levels. We also find that the nature of the sensitizing dye determines the predominant recombination route: via the conduction band for Y123 and via band gap states for Z907, which is the main reason for the superior performance of Y123. The different mechanisms appear to arise from changes in electronic coupling between TiO2 donor states and [Co(bpy) 3]3+ acceptor states, as opposed to changes in the density of TiO2 states or their energetic matching with the acceptor-state distribution. These findings have implications for modeling heterogeneous electron transfer at dye-sensitized semiconductor-solution interfaces in general and for the optimization of DSCs. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Conduction band edge; Different mechanisms; Dye-Sensitized solar cell; Heterogeneous electron transfer; Impedance spectroscopy; Ruthenium sensitizers; Temperature dependence; Transport resistance; Conduction bands; Electron transitions; Solar cells; Spectroscopy; Titanium dioxide; amphophile; dye; nanocrystal; photosensitizing agent; ruthenium; titanium dioxide; article; dye sensitized solar cell; electric conductivity; electric potential; electric resistance; electrochemical analysis; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; electron transport; oxidation reduction potential; semiconductor; sensitization; solar energy; temperature; temperature dependence; 2,2'-Dipyridyl; Dielectric Spectroscopy; Electric Power Supplies; Electron Transport; Fluorescent Dyes; Nanostructures; Organometallic Compounds; Ruthenium; Solar Energy; Temperature; Titanium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874985433

The adult diapause of the linden bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus, involves a reproductive arrest accompanied by energy storage, reduction of metabolic needs, and preparation to withstand low temperatures. By contrast, nondiapause animals direct nutrient energy to muscle activity and reproduction. The photoperiod-dependent switch from diapause to reproduction is systemically transmitted throughout the organism by juvenile hormone (JH). Here, we show that, at the organ-autonomous level of the insect gut, the decision between reproduction and diapause relies on an interaction between JH signaling and circadian clock genes acting independently of the daily cycle. The JH receptor Methoprene-tolerant and the circadian proteins Clock and Cycle are all required in the gut to activate the Par domain protein 1 gene during reproduction and to simultaneously suppress a mammalian-type cryptochrome 2 gene that promotes the diapause program. A nonperiodic, organ-autonomous feedback between Par domain protein 1 and Cryptochrome 2 then orchestrates expression of downstream genes that mark the diapause vs. reproductive states of the gut. These results show that hormonal signaling through Methoprene-tolerant and circadian proteins controls gut-specific gene activity that is independent of circadian oscillations but differs between reproductive and diapausing animals.","Basic helix-loop-helix protein; Oogenesis; Photoperiodism; Reproductive diapause","circadian rhythm signaling protein; cryptochrome 2; methoprene; article; circadian rhythm; diapause; Drosophila melanogaster; gene activation; gene expression; gene interaction; intestine; nonhuman; priority journal; reproduction; signal transduction; Animals; Circadian Clocks; Cryptochromes; Genes, Insect; Heteroptera; Insect Proteins; Intestines; Methoprene; Photoperiod; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875021264

The PCM temperature gradients in the radial, angular, and axial directions were analyzed. Results indicated that the third case (i.e., heating both sides) achieved complete PCM melting within a short time and used a lower inlet heat transfer fluid temperature compared with the other cases.

Its use is hampered in contaminated aquifers because of the potential environmental risks associated with the spreading of contaminated groundwater, but positive side effects, such as enhanced contaminant remediation, might also occur. A first reactive transport study is presented to assess the effect of SATES on the fate of chlorinated solvents by means of scenario modeling, with emphasis on the effects of transient SATES pumping and applicable kinetic degradation regime. Temperature effects on physical, chemical, and biological reactions were excluded as calculations and initial simulations showed that the small temperature range commonly involved (ΔT < 15 C) only caused minor effects. The results show that a significant decrease of the contaminant mass and (eventually) plume volume occurs when degradation is described as sediment-limited with a constant rate in space and time, provided that dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) is absent. However, in the presence of DNAPL dissolution, particularly when the dissolved contaminant reaches SATES wells, a considerably larger contaminant plume is created, depending on the balance between DNAPL dissolution and mass removal by degradation. Under conditions where degradation is contaminant-limited and degradation rates depend on contaminant concentrations in the aquifer, a SATES system does not result in enhanced remediation of a contaminant plume. Although field data are lacking and existing regulatory constraints do not yet permit the application of SATES in contaminated aquifers, reactive transport modeling provides a means of assessing the risks of SATES application in contaminated aquifers. The results from this study are considered to be a first step in identifying the subsurface conditions under which SATES can be applied in a safe or even beneficial manner. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","ATES; Groundwater; Keywords; Reactive transport modeling; Remediation","Aquifer thermal energy storage; ATES; Biological reaction; Chlorinated solvent; Constant rate; Contaminant concentrations; Contaminant plume; Contaminant remediation; Contaminated aquifer; Contaminated groundwater; Degradation rate; Dense non-aqueous phase liquids; Dnapl dissolutions; Environmental risks; Field data; Groundwater system; Keywords; Low temperatures; Mass removal; Periodic heating; Positive sides; Reactive transport; Reactive transport modeling; Scenario Modeling; Space and time; Subsurface conditions; Temperature range; Aquifers; Carbon inorganic compounds; Contamination; Degradation; Dissolution; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Models; Remediation; Temperature; Groundwater pollution; ground water; tetrachloroethylene; trichloroethylene; vinyl chloride; vinylidene chloride; aquifer; chlorine; degradation; environmental risk; groundwater pollution; low temperature; model test; nonaqueous phase liquid; pollutant transport; reaction kinetics; reactive transport; seasonal variation; temperature effect; thermal power; article; bioremediation; concentration (parameters); contaminant limited degradation; contaminant mass removal; controlled study; degradation kinetics; dense non aqueous phase liquid dissolution; dissolution; ecosystem restoration; energy; environmental impact; geology; hydrogeology; low temperature seasonal aquifer thermal energy storage; nonbiological model; oxidation reduction reaction; plume dispersion; plume volume; pollution and pollution related phenomena; pollution transport; priority journal; reactive transport model; risk assessment; sediment limited degradation; simulation; temperature sensitivity; water contamination; Energy-Generating Resources; Groundwater; Models, Theoretical; Solvents; Temperature; Tetrachloroethylene; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874669529

A lithium-ion storage battery is incorporated into the microgrid to mitigate peak demands during grid-connected operation and to compensate for any shortage in the generated power during islanded operation. The control design for the DG inverters employs a new model predictive control algorithm which enables faster computational time for large power systems by optimizing the steady-state and the transient control problems separately.

Upon integration of the capacitor and dye-sensitized solar cell into a single photocapacitor hybrid device, the following parameters were obtained under simulated 100 mW cm-2 solar illumination: specific capacitance, 407 F g-1 (3.26 F cm -2); energy and power densities, 0.17 mWh cm-2 and 0.34 mW cm-2 and coulombic efficiency, 88%. These data together with results of experiments performed at different light intensities (10-100 mW cm -2) are consistent with very good performance of the optoelectronic device under various light conditions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, a number of serious operational issues threaten its utility. Among these is corrosion of PCC plant in which degradation of amines, particularly in the presence of oxygen, can lead to a range of corrosive products. This study uses electrochemical methods to quantify the corrosiveness of well-known capture agents, such as monoethanolamine (MEA), and compare them with novel solvent blends that have been developed at CSIRO. The amines used in our novel solvents also satisfy the standard PCC criteria of high rates of reaction with CO2, low energy requirements (for regeneration), low volatility and low toxicity. The results of the corrosion tests on carbon steel show that reductions in corrosion rate, compared with those for MEA, are possible with the novel solvents. Under laboratory conditions, the electrochemical data also indicate that the presence of oxygen causes a significant decrease in the corrosion rate in all systems studied. Whether an increase in oxygen concentration can be used in practical PCC applications depends on the long term stability of new amine formulations under these more strongly oxidizing conditions. Longer term testing is required to determine whether novel blends, such as CSIRO-1, possess the required chemical stability in the presence of typical variations in oxygen and CO2 concentration as well as temperature. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, little attention was given to how DMSO influences protein-ligand binding strengths. In this study we investigated the effects of DMSO on different noncovalent protein-ligand complexes, in particular in terms of the binding affinities, which we determined using nanoESI-MS. For the investigation, three different protein-ligand complexes were chosen: trypsin-Pefabloc, lysozyme-tri-N-acetylchitotriose (NAG3), and carbonic anhydrase-chlorothiazide. The DMSO content in the nanoESI buffer was increased systematically from 0.5 to 8%. For all three model systems, it was shown that the binding affinity decreases upon addition of DMSO. Even 0.5-1% DMSO alters the KD values, in particular for the tight binding system carbonic anhydrase-chlorothiazide. The determined dissociation constant (KD) is up to 10 times higher than for a DMSO-free sample in the case of carbonic anhydrase-chlorothiazide binding. For the trypsin-Pefabloc and lysozyme-NAG 3 complexes, the dissociation constants are 7 and 3 times larger, respectively, in the presence of DMSO.

Understanding the fundamentals of such technologies and their design would be greatly aided by an ability to efficiently predict the conformation of an adsorbed protein and its free energy of adsorption. In the study reported here, we show that this is possible when data obtained from nonequilibrium thermodynamic integration (NETI) combined with steered molecular dynamics (SMD) is subject to bootstrapping. For the met-enkephalin pentapeptide at a water-graphite interface, we were able to obtain accurate predictions for the location of the adsorbed peptide and its free energy of adsorption from around 50 and 80 SMD simulations, respectively. It was also shown that adsorption in this system is both energetically and entropically driven. The free energy of adsorption was also decomposed into that associated with formation of the cavity in the water near the graphite surface sufficient to accommodate the adsorbed peptide and that associated with insertion of the peptide into this cavity. This decomposition reveals that the former is modestly energetically and entropically unfavorable, whereas the latter is the opposite in both regards to a much greater extent. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Biosensors; Data integration; Digital storage; Drug delivery; Free energy; Graphite; Molecular dynamics; Peptides; Tissue engineering; Accurate prediction; Free energy of adsorption; Graphite surfaces; Liquid/solid interface; Non equilibrium molecular dynamic (NEMD); Non equilibrium thermodynamics; Protein adsorption; Steered molecular dynamics; Technological applications; Vaccine production; Water-graphite interface; Adsorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874587036

One of the key problems that we address in the paper is how to determine dissipativity properties of the process network from the dissipativity properties of the individual process systems and the topology of the network. The results in the paper extend the dissipativity analysis based on thermodynamics for individual processes to dissipativity-based conditions (storage functions and supply rates) suitable for process network analysis. The new storage and supply functions are based on balance equations represented in terms of temperatures and compositions rather than internal energy and chemical potentials.

However, its production is still mostly based on fossil fuels, in part because of the high cost of alternative production routes, as is the case of water electrolysis for example. This fact is explained by the energy consumed during the process of hydrogen evolution from water. Nevertheless, the research on water electrolysis is justifiable by the advantages that the process offers, as high produced hydrogen purity, possible association with other renewable energy sources such as solar, hydro and wind power generation, no CO2 emissions during the evolution, simplicity of the process, as so many others. With the purpose of increasing the hydrogen-producing device (electrolysers) performance, great scientific efforts have been directed to the electrodes base materials and their surface technology.

These devices have been largely used as accelerators in scientific computing applications that require massive data processing, large parallel machines, huge memory bandwidth and power. The RTM algorithm enables you to directly solve the acoustic and elastic waves problems with precision in complex geological structures, demanding a high computational power. To face such challenges we suggest strategies such as reduced arithmetic precision, based on fixed-point numbers, and a highly parallel architecture are suggested. The effects of such reduced precision for storage/processing data are analyzed in this chapter through signal-noise ratio (SRN) and universal image quality index (UIQI) metrics. The results show that SRN higher than 50dB can be considered acceptable for a migrated image with 15 bits word size. A special stream-processing architecture aiming to implement the best possible data reuse for the algorithm is also presented. It was implemented by an FIFO-based cache in the internal memory of the FPGA. A temporal pipeline structure has also been developed, allowing that multiple time steps to be performed at the same time. The main advantage of this approach is the ability to keep the same memory bandwidth needs of processing just one time step. The number of time steps processed at the same time is limited by the amount of FPGA internal memory and logic blocks. The algorithm was implemented on an Altera Stratix 260E, with 16 processing elements (PEs). The FPGA was 29 times faster than the CPU and only 13% slower than the GPGPU.

Research however states that despite the existence of numerous technical energy efficiency measures, its deployment is hindered by the existence of various barriers to energy efficiency. The complexity of increasing energy efficiency in manufacturing industry calls for an interdisciplinary approach to the issue. Improving energy efficiency in industrial energy systems applies an interdisciplinary perspective in examining energy efficiency in industrial energy systems, and discusses how cross-pollinating perspectives and theories from the social and engineering sciences can enhance our understanding of barriers, energy audits, energy management, policies, and programmes as they pertain to improved energy efficiency in industry. Apart from classical technical approaches from engineering sciences, Improving energy efficiency in industrial energy systems couples a sociotechnical perspective to increased energy efficiency in industry, showing that industrial energy efficiency can be expected to be shaped by social and commercial processes and built on knowledge, routines, institutions, and methods established in networks. The book can be read by researchers and policy-makers, as well as scholars and practicians in the field.

However, standard ventilation units use a considerable amount of electricity. This article discusses the consequences on a system level of using hybrid ventilation with heat recovery. The simulation program TRNSYS was used in order to investigate a ventilation system with heat recovery. The system also includes a ground source storage and waste water heat recovery system. The result of the analysis shows that the annual energy gain from ground source storage is limited. However, this is partly a consequence of the fact that the well functioning hybrid ventilation system leaves little room for improvements. The analysis shows that the hybrid ventilation system has potential to be an attractive solution for low energy buildings with a very low need for electrical energy. © 2013 by the authors.","Hybrid ventilation with heat recovery; System analysis; Waste water heat recovery",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920138556

The designing of a routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Network is very challenging due to a number of factors such as application specific, dense node deployment, frequent topology change, no global identification, unreliable sensor node, fault tolerant, server energy, computation and storage constraints. In the recent couple of years to prolong the network lifetime of tiny sensor node, different types of routing mechanisms have been proposed by various researchers. However, their performance superior or poorer cannot be examined without any doubt by traditional techniques due to their altered behavior in different scenarios. The aim of this research is to find the energy consumption profile over various metrics among energy efficient tree based routing protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The present research work can be considered as to guide the protocol designing, application-specific protocol selection and modification of the existing energy efficient routing protocols in WSNs.

For the growing season (May 1 to September 31), the 5 year averages (± standard deviation) of the midday (10:00 to 14:00 h) Bowen ratio (β, i.e., H/λE) was 0.86 ± 0.08. Seasonal and inter-annual variability of β was mainly driven by λE which itself was strongly controlled by both weather (i.e., vapor pressure deficit, D, and net radiation, Rn) and physiological parameters (i.e., surface resistance). During the growing season, surface resistance largely exceeded aerodynamic resistance, which together with low mean values of the actual ET to potential ET ratio (0.55 ± 0.05) and Priestley-Taylor α (0.89) suggests significant physiological constrains on ET in this well-watered fen. Among the water budget components, the inter-annual variability of ET was lower (199 to 298 mm) compared to Q (225 to 752 mm), with each accounting on average for 34 and 65% of the ecosystem water loss, respectively. The fraction of P expended into ET was negatively correlated to P and positively to Rn. Although a decrease in WTL caused a reduction of the surface conductance, the overall effect of WTL on ET was limited. Non-growing season (October 1 to April 30) fluxes of H, λE, and Q were significant representing on average -67%, 13%, and 61%, respectively, of their growing season sums (negative sign indicates opposite flux direction between the two seasons). Overall, our findings suggest that plant functional type composition, P and Rn dynamics (i.e., amount and timing) were the major controls on the partitioning of the mire energy and water budgets. This has important implications for the regional climate as well as for ecosystem development, nutrient, and carbon dynamics. © 2012. American Geophysical Union.

Here we investigated the hypothesis that ERRγ impacts on differentiation and function of brown adipocytes. Design and Methods: We characterize the expression of ERRγ in adipose tissues and cell models and investigate the effects of modulating ERR? activity on UCP1 gene expression and metabolic features of brown and white adipocytes. Results: ERRγ was preferentially expressed in brown compared to white fat depots, and ERRγ was induced during cold-induced browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue and brown adipogenesis. Overexpression of ERRγ positively regulated uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression levels during brown adipogenesis. This ERRγ-induced augmentation of UCP1 expression was independent of the presence of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1 (PGC-1α) but was associated with increased rates of fatty acid oxidation in adrenergically stimulated cells. ERR? did not influence mitochondrial biogenesis, and its reduced expression in white adipocytes could not explain their low expression level of UCP1. Conclusions: Through its augmenting effect on expression of UCP1, ERRγ may physiologically be involved in increasing the potential for energy expenditure in brown adipocytes, a function that is becoming of therapeutic interest.

The effects of different reaction conditions (e.g., incubation time, PME concentration, and temperature) on PME inactivation and kinetics of inactivation were investigated. Temperature, incubation time, and PME concentration significantly affected the extent of PME inactivation. Generally, higher temperature, longer incubation time, and low PME concentration caused more PME inactivation. The immobilized fish trypsin had higher capacity to inactivate PME than immobilized bovine trypsin. The inactivation efficiency of the immobilized fish trypsin was about 20% higher than that of its bovine counterpart. However, PME inactivated by both trypsins regained partial activity during storage at 4°C, with immobilized fish trypsin-treated PME regaining more of its original activity than the immobilized bovine trypsin-treated PME. Heat-denatured PME was hydrolyzed more extensively by immobilized fish trypsin than by its bovine counterpart. The rate constants increased, whereas the D-values decreased with temperature for both immobilized fish and bovine trypsins. The inactivation rate constants of immobilized fish trypsin at all the temperatures investigated (i.e., 15-35°C) were higher than those of immobilized bovine trypsin.

The unique composition and structure of the carbons resulted in very promising electrochemical energy storage performance. We obtained a reversible lithium storage capacity of 1780 mA h g-1, which is among the highest ever reported for any carbon-based electrode. Tested as a supercapacitor, the carbons exhibited a capacitance of 390 F g-1, with an excellent cycle life (7% loss after 10000 cycles). Such exquisite properties may be attributed to a unique combination of a high specific surface area, partial graphitization and very high bulk nitrogen content. It is a major challenge to derive carbons possessing all three attributes. By templating the structure of mesoporous cellular foam with egg white-derived proteins, we were able to obtain hierarchically mesoporous (pores centered at ∼4 nm and at 20-30 nm) partially graphitized carbons with a surface area of 805.7 m2 g -1 and a bulk N-content of 10.1 wt%.

Safety and cost are very significant factors in these large scale devices. Ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes that are inherently non-volatile and non-flammable offer a safer alternative to mainstream lithium battery electrolytes, which are typically based on volatile and flammable organic carbonates. Hence, in recent years there have been many investigations of ionic liquid electrolytes in lithium batteries with some highly promising results to date, however in most cases cost of the anion remains a significant impediment to widespread application. Amongst the various possible combinations the dicyanamide (DCA) anion based ionic liquids offer exceptionally low viscosities and high conductivities-highly desirable characteristics for Li electrolyte solvents. DCA ILs can be manufactured relatively inexpensively because DCA is already a commodity anion, containing only carbon and nitrogen, which is produced in large amounts for the pharmaceutical industry. In this study we use the non-fluorinated ionic liquid N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium dicyanamide to form non-volatile lithium battery electrolytes. We demonstrate good capacity retention for lithium metal and LiFePO4 in such electrolytes and discharge capacities above 130 mAh.g-1 at 50 °C. We show that it is important to control moisture contents in this electrolyte system in order to reduce capacity fade and rationalise this observation using cyclic voltammetry and lithium symmetrical cell cycling. Having approximately 200 ppm of moisture content produces the optimum cycling ability. We also describe plastic crystal solid state electrolytes based on the DCA anion in the lithium metal-LiFePO 4 battery configuration and demonstrate over 150 mAh.g-1 discharge capacity without any significant capacity fading at 80 °C. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon and nitrogen; Discharge capacities; Energy storage applications; Good capacity retentions; Ionic liquid electrolytes; Pharmaceutical industry; Solid-state electrolyte; Wind and solar power; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrolytes; Ionic liquids; Lithium; Moisture determination; Negative ions; Solar energy; Lithium batteries; anion; carbonate; cost-benefit analysis; electrochemistry; electrolyte; lithium; moisture content; pharmaceutical industry; safety; viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875653227

Ghrelin, a peptide that promotes appetite and the accumulation of adipose tissue, is also secreted in response to stressors to protect the brain and peripheral tissues from the effects of these stressors. Herewedemonstrate that elevated ghrelin levels produced by chronic exposure to social stress are associated with increased caloric intake and body weight gain in male C57BL mice. In contrast, stressed mice lacking ghrelin receptors (GHSR KO mice) or C57BL mice receiving chronic intracerebroventricular delivery of the ghrelin receptor antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 show attenuated weight gain and feeding responses under the same social stress paradigm. Interestingly, stressed GHSR KO mice showed depleted sc and intrascapular brown fat depots, whereas stressed young wild-type mice did not. In old wild-type mice, chronic social defeat increased visceral and intrascapular brown fat depots in association with increases in obesity markers like hyperleptinemia and hyperinsulinemia along with increased hypothalamic expression of neuropeptide Y and Agouti related peptide. Importantly, the elevated expression of these peptides persisted least for 2 weeks after cessation of the stressor regimen. In contrast, oldGHSRKOmice did notshowthese alterations after chronic social defeat. These results suggest that ghrelin plays an important role in the metabolic adaptations necessary to meet the energetic demands posed by stressors, but chronic exposure to stress-induced ghrelin elevations ultimately could lead to long lasting metabolic dysfunctions.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) containing oleocanthal is often consumed after storage for a substantial amount of time and for oleocanthal to indeed provide health benefits, it has to be present in a substantial quantity throughout the shelf-life of EVOO. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate if natural light and/or oxygen (O2) exposure (via atmospheric air) combined with extended storage, as would occur on a common domestic basis, affected the concentration of oleocanthal in EVOO. One EVOO containing 90mg/kg oleocanthal was stored for 10months with and without exposure to light and or O2. Oleocanthal concentrations were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and its biological activity determined with a taste bioassay measuring the intensity of oropharyngeal irritation. A significant difference in oleocanthal concentration was observed amongst the different storage treatments (p=0.05). Oleocanthal concentration degraded to a maximum of 37% (90±13mg/kg to 56±9mg/kg) after 10months exposure to both light and O2. Limiting light and O2 over 10months resulted in a 15% decrease in oleocanthal (90±13mg/kg to 76±9mg/kg). Oleocanthal biological activity mirrored the results of oleocanthal concentration (r=0.8, p&lt;0.05). Overall, the findings support the role of oleocanthal as a potential health promoting compound in EVOO as significant concentrations remain in EVOO after exposure to light, oxygen and over time. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Extra virgin olive oil; HPLC; Oleocanthal; Phenolics; Storage; Taste bioassay","Anti-inflammatory capacities; Atmospheric air; Extra virgin olive oil; Health benefits; Health effects; High performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometries; HPLC; HPLC-MS; Mediterranean diet; Natural light; Oleocanthal; Oropharyngeal; Phenolics; Potential health; Shelf life; Significant differences; Bioassay; Energy storage; High performance liquid chromatography; Olive oil; Oxygen; Phenols; Bioactivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874383164

Although white rice is far more popular worldwide, consumption of brown rice is increasing, partially on account of the presence of bioactive compounds; however, the effects of parboiling, storage and cooking on them are not well-characterized. The effects of parboiling and a 6-month storage period on the contents of vitamin E and γ-oryzanol in three brown rice cultivars grown in three different locations in Brazil were investigated. Also, their levels in branded non-parboiled and parboiled brown rice were monitored before and after cooking. Vitamin E homologues and γ-oryzanol were separated by RP-HPLC equipped with PDA and fluorescence detectors. The average levels of total tocols and γ-oryzanol in the raw brown rice cultivars studied were 25 and 188. mg/kg, respectively. Of the vitamin E homologues, γ-tocotrienol contributed with 74% of total tocols, followed by α-tocopherol, α-tocotrienol and γ-tocopherol in minor quantities. The combined processes, parboiling, storage and cooking, led to an approximate 90% reduction in tocols and only γ-tocotrienol was detectable after any of the processes.

Today, the most widely used cooling strategy for data centers is refrigerated air-cooling. Unfortunately, air-cooling presents phenomenally low efficiencies. Therefore green computing paradigms are needed to improve energy efficiency by several orders of magnitude and allow a continued chip scaling for tackling the energy crisis in future-generation data centers. A promising solution would be implementing direct on-chip two-phase cooling technology, which not only improves the heat removal efficiency but also permits the reuse of waste heat since the two-phase coolant can cool CPUs effectively at 60 °C. In the present work a specific cooling cycle using micro-evaporation technology has been experimentally evaluated considering different aspects such as cooling cycle and energy recovery efficiencies and controllability. In resume, this novel cycle shows strong competence in energy usage, heat recovery and controllability towards green data center. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

Although pesticides and fumigants are the most commonly used methods for controlling insects in postharvest products such as grains, nuts, and fruits, they pose a direct threat to human health and the environment. In this work, power dissipation factors and the rate of increase of temperature in the insect bodies and wheat kernels were considered to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. Dielectric and other physical properties of the insect and wheat were measured, and the electric field intensities in the system were estimated using an electromagnetic model. The host grain at three levels of moisture contents, 12%, 15%, 18% wet weight basis, were included to cover a wide range of grain storage scenarios, and the dielectric properties were measured at temperatures between 15 °C and 75 °C. The ratios of electric field intensity (Ei2/Eg2) and dielectric loss factor (εi'/εg') within the insect bodies to that in grain kernels ranged from 0.13 to 0.76 and from 8.61 to 169.93 respectively. The latter had a significant effect on insect-to-wheat power absorption factor, Pig, which varied between 5 and 40. The relative rate of increase of temperature for insect-to-wheat was directly related to Pig, but inversely related to the product of insect/grain specific heat and density, which varied between 0.89 and 1.33, and was therefore almost identical to Pig, and ranged from 6.47 to 29.6. This large relative rate of increase of temperature in insect bodies compared to wheat may have potential benefits in heating the insects selectively with radio frequency energy to their lethal temperature while keeping the host grain at moderate temperature, and therefore minimising or eliminating adverse effects on its physicochemical properties. © 2012 IAgrE.",,"Adverse effect; Dielectric loss factors; Dissipation factors; Electric field intensities; Electromagnetic models; Feasibility studies; Grain kernels; Grain storage; Human health; Lethal temperature; Moderate temperature; Physicochemical property; Postharvest; Potential benefits; Power absorption; Radio frequencies; Radio-frequency energy; Rate of increase; Relative rates; Selective heating; Wet weight; Wheat kernels; Dielectric properties; Electric fields; Fumigation; Health risks; Pesticides; Radio waves; Grain (agricultural product); Coleoptera; Cryptolestes ferrugineus; Hexapoda; Suidae; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873277423

However, the current suite-as well as potential future suite-of thermoelectric generation technologies has a very wide range of water demand intensities, spanning two orders of magnitude. As such, the evolution of the generation mix is important for the future water demands of the sector. This study uses GCAM, an integrated assessment model, to analyze the global electric sector's water demands in three futures of climate change mitigation policy and two technology strategies. We find that despite five- to seven-fold expansion of the electric sector as a whole from 2005 to 2095, global electric sector water withdrawals remain relatively stable, due to the retirement of existing power plants with water-intensive once-through flow cooling systems. In the scenarios examined here, climate policies lead to the large-scale deployment of advanced, low-emissions technologies such as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), concentrating solar power, and engineered geothermal systems. In particular, we find that the large-scale deployment of CCS technologies does not increase long-term water consumption from hydrocarbon-fueled power generation as compared with a no-policy scenario without CCS. Moreover, in sensitivity scenarios where low-emissions electricity technologies are required to use dry cooling systems, we find that the consequent additional costs and efficiency reductions do not limit the utility of these technologies in achieving cost-effective whole-system emissions mitigation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate policy; Electric sector; Integrated assessment; Water demand","Additional costs; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Concentrating solar power; Dry cooling systems; Electric sector; Electricity generation; Emissions mitigation; Engineered geothermal systems; Generation mix; Global demand; Integrated assessment; Integrated assessment models; Large-scale deployment; Orders of magnitude; Technology strategies; Thermoelectric generation; Water consumption; Water demand; Water scarcity; Water withdrawal; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cooling systems; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Geothermal fields; Hydrocarbons; Solar energy; Thermoelectric equipment; Water supply; Technology; carbon sequestration; climate effect; cooling; electricity generation; environmental policy; geothermal system; power plant; solar power; water demand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872382539

In this study, changes in the triacylglycerols (TAG) and free fatty acids (FFA) composition of Coffea arabica seeds roasted to two color degrees (light medium and dark medium) were evaluated during storage for 6 months, under two temperature (5 °C and 25 °C) and atmosphere (air and N 2) conditions. For the first time, hydrolysis of TAG fraction was observed during storage of roasted coffee, with increases in FFA, after 1 month storage, from 0.4 to 93.5 mg/100 g in light-medium samples and from non-detected to 1.1 mg/100 g in dark-medium samples. After 3 months storage, 20% and 13% decreases in FFA from light-medium and dark-medium samples, respectively, were observed, suggesting oxidation. The N 2 atmosphere contributed to a slower loss of FFA. In the same way, at 5 °C, lower release of FFA was observed compared to 25 °C. Considering the inversion in the unsaturated FA (UFA) and saturated FA (SFA) contents observed in the dark-medium sample, the present results also show that the ratio Σ UFA/SFA, in TAG and AGL fractions might potentially be used as a tool to establish the shelf life of roasted coffee. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Coffee lipids; Coffee quality; Fatty acids; Storage; Triacylglycerols","Coffea arabica; Free fatty acid; Light medium; Roasted coffee; Sensorial qualities; Shelf life; Triacylglycerols; Two-color; Energy storage; Fatty acids; Glycerol; Lipids; Coffee; Coffea arabica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867892291

The feasibility and assessment of the proposed system is evaluated by utilizing the load profile and considering the geographical condition of a village (Juara village in Tioman Island) with approximately 30 chalets located in southern Malaysia. HOMER uses two types of load profiles for each given year. The first load profile is used during the presence of tourists, and the second profile is used when the locals are the main inhabitants of the island. The optimization management for the green energy system is performed through unit sizing to find the optimum power management analysis and to perform cost analysis of the system. The potential of renewable energy as well as a diesel-based energy system to meet the power demand for such a stand-alone system is considered. Technically feasible and economically viable green energy systems as prospective plans are explored in this study. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Diesel-based energy system; Green energy system; HOMER software; Hybrid PV/wind/FC/battery system; Optimal configuration","Battery storage energies; Cost analysis; Eco-friendly; Electricity generation; Energy systems; Geographical conditions; Green energy; Hybrid PV/wind/FC/battery system; Load profiles; Malaysia; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Net present cost; Optimal configurations; Optimization managements; Power demands; Power managements; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Standalone systems; Unit sizing; Alternative fuels; Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Electric generators; Energy management; Gas emissions; Optimization; Rural areas; Wind power; Energy policy; cost-benefit analysis; diesel; electricity generation; energy planning; feasibility study; island; optimization; renewable resource; software; solar power; sustainability; village; wind power; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867061515

In this study, a modified dual-templating strategy for architectural design of 3D HOPC as a promising electrode material for high-rate EC applications was developed by using polystyrene and Pluronic F127 as macro- and meso-porous templates, respectively. Tetraethyl orthosilicate was also added as the silica precursor, and then the sol-gel-derived SiO2 was removed by sodium hydroxide to form the second mesopore in HOPC (HOPC-s) for enhancing the accessible surface areas and pore structures. The HOPC-s formed by the templating strategy is composed of highly ordered macropores, macroporous windows, bimodal mesopores, and micropores, resulting in high specific surface area (1112 m2 g -1), high total pore volume (1.18 cm3 g-1) and an easily accessible environment for fast electrolyte ion transport. The specific capacitance of the HOPC-s electrodes can reach 316 F g-1 at 25 mV s-1 and maintain excellent capacitive retention at a high scan rate of 1000 mV s-1 when compared with that of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC-s). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy fitting shows that the pore electrolyte resistance of HOPC-s is 3 times lower than that of OMC-s, which is attributed to the hierarchical macroporous structures and short mesoporous channels. In the symmetric capacitor test, the HOPC-s also shows excellent power capability, and the energy density of 4-10 W h kg-1 can be maintained over the power density range of 1-14 kW kg-1. In addition, the capacitance of HOPC-s in the polycarbonate-containing ionic liquid shows 80% retention at a scan rate of 500 mV s-1, indicating that the unique hierarchical structure can provide efficient ion-buffering capacity for high-rate performance. These exceptional electrochemical performances clearly demonstrate that 3D HOPC-s is a superior material to solve the poor ion transport limitation, which can open an avenue to fabricate high-rate ECs with high power and energy densities for energy storage. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Capacitors; Carbon; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrolytes; Ionic liquids; Macros; Polystyrenes; Silica; Sol-gels; Three dimensional computer graphics; Accessible surface areas; Electrochemical capacitor; Electrochemical performance; Hierarchical structures; High specific surface area; Macroporous structures; Ordered mesoporous carbon; Tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876593136

Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of the two following groups: control (C; n = 10) and obese (OB; n = 40). The C group received standard food, whereas the OB group was fed a hypercaloric diet for 20 weeks. After this period, half of the OB animals (n = 20) were subjected to a 25%-calorie restriction of standard diet for 8 weeks forming thus a new group (OR), whereas the remaining OB animals were kept on the initial hypercaloric diet. During the following two weeks, 10 OR animals continued on the calorie restriction diet, whereas the remaining 10 rats of this group formed a new group (ORS) given a supraphysiological dose of T3 (25 μg/100 g body weight) along with the calorie restriction diet. Similarly, the remaining OB animals were divided into two groups, one that continued on the hypercaloric diet (OB, n = 10), and one that received the supraphysiological dose of T3 (25 μg/100 g body weight) along with the hypercaloric diet (OS, n = 10) for two weeks. The OB group showed weight gain, increased adiposity, insulin resistance, increased leptin levels and genotoxicity; T3 administration in OS animals led to an increase in genotoxicity and oxidative stress when compared with the OB group. The OR group showed weight loss and normalized levels of adiposity, insulin resistance, serum leptin and genotoxicity, thus having features similar to those of the C group. On the other hand, the ORS group, compared to OR animals, showed higher genotoxicity. Our results indicate that regardless of diet, a supraphysiological dose of T3 causes genotoxicity and potentiates oxidative stress. © 2013 De Sibio et al.",,"leptin; liothyronine; malonaldehyde; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; caloric intake; caloric restriction; comet assay; controlled study; DNA damage; genotoxicity; insulin resistance; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; protein blood level; rat; weight gain; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Composition; Body Weight; Caloric Restriction; Comet Assay; Energy Intake; Hyperthyroidism; Insulin Resistance; Leptin; Male; Malondialdehyde; Obesity; Rats; Triiodothyronine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874511518

Three types of graphene papers, with thickness of ∼1.5, 3 and 10 μm, respectively, were fabricated by vacuum-assisted filtration of reduced graphene nanosheets suspended in water. These papers deliver evidently different lithium storage capacities, with thinner papers always outperform thicker ones. The 1.5 μm paper gives rise to initial reversible specific capacities (the first 10 cycles) of ∼200 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1, while the 10 μm paper only presents ∼80 mAh g-1 at a current density of 50 mA g-1. After 100 cycles, a specific capacity of ∼180 mAh g-1 is retained for the 1.5 μm paper; in contrast, only ∼65 mAh g-1 remains for the 10 μm paper. The capacity decline with the paper thickness is associated with the dense restacking of graphene nanosheets and a large aspect ratio of the paper. The effective Li+ diffusion distance in graphene paper is mainly controlled by the thickness of the paper, and the diffusion proceeds mainly in in-plane direction, cross plane diffusion is restrained. As such, the effective contact of graphene nanosheets with electrolyte is limited and the efficiency of carbon utilization is very low in the thick papers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Rainwater in the FSR had pH in the neutral range and high alkalinity, whereas those of the PSR were acidic and with low buffer ability because of different catchment materials. Median concentrations of 14 metals from two RWHSs were low, except for Na, Ca, K and Mg. Anions, including Cl-, NO3-, and SO42- showed much higher concentration in winter, indicating the influences of marine source and northeast monsoon. Effects of 14-day storage were examined and it was found that pH did not change, while EC, turbidity and DOC slightly decreased. Concentrations of anions and metals were stable, and TC counts of harvested rainwater increased in the beginning, and then declined with storage time.

When activated, AMPK can induce substrate catabolism and shut down energy-consuming anabolic pathways to increase intracellular ATP availability. Even though most of these effects have been described in muscle and liver, several studies have provided compelling evidence that AMPK also plays an important role in the regulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) glucose and lipid metabolism. In fact, the effects of acute and chronic AMPK activation in the WAT induce profound changes in adiposity with important implications for the treatment of obesity and its related metabolic disorders. This review discusses the role of AMPK in the regulation of white adipocyte metabolism with respect to energy storage and release, gene expression, mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative capacity, cell differentiation, and the potential impact on whole-body adiposity and energy homeostasis. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Adipocyte; AMPK; AS160; Glucose uptake; Lipolysis; Obesity","5 amino 4 imidazolecarboxamide; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase kinase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; fatty acid; glucose; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase alpha 1; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase alpha 2; lipoprotein lipase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; protein serine threonine kinase; unclassified drug; adipocyte; amino acid sequence; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; energy balance; energy metabolism; enzyme activation; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme degradation; enzyme localization; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme regulation; fat mass; fatty acid oxidation; gene expression; glucose metabolism; lipolysis; metabolic regulation; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; priority journal; protein domain; protein expression; review; structure activity relation; tissue metabolism; white adipose tissue; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adipose Tissue, White; Adiposity; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Enzyme Activation; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucose; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Mitochondrial Turnover; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Signal Transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872667975

Immunometabolism addresses how metabolic and inflammatory pathways converge to maintain health and a contemporary problem is determining how obesity-induced inflammation precipitates chronic diseases such as insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important serine/threonine kinase well known for regulating metabolic processes and maintaining energy homeostasis. However, both metabolic and immunological AMPK-mediated effects play a role in disease. Pro-inflammatory mediators suppress AMPK activity and hinder lipid oxidation. In addition, AMPK activation curbs inflammation by directly inhibiting pro-inflammatory signaling pathways and limiting the build-up of specific lipid intermediates that elicit immune responses. In the context of obesity and chronic disease, these reciprocal responses involve both immune and metabolic cells. Therefore, the immunometabolism of AMPK-mediated processes and therapeutics should be considered in atherosclerosis and insulin resistance. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Cardiovascular disease; Cytokine; Diabetes; Inflammation; Metabolism; Obesity","fatty acid; fatty acid synthase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; inflammasome; insulin; interleukin 1beta; lipid; atherosclerosis; cell activation; cell membrane depolarization; endothelial dysfunction; energy balance; enzyme activity; enzyme regulation; fatty acid oxidation; hepatitis; human; immunity; immunocompetent cell; immunoreactivity; immunostimulation; inflammation; insulin resistance; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; macrophage; macrophage activation; metabolic regulation; metabolism; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; review; vascular disease; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Atherosclerosis; Cytokines; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Endothelial Cells; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Inflammation; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Peroxidation; Lymphocytes; Macrophages; Obesity; Signal Transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872660747

Herein, catalyst materials with exemplary surface areas (2980 m2 g -1) and ORR activity were developed by innovatively coupling KOH activation of exfoliated graphene with ammonia induced nitrogen doping (N-a-ex-G). Specifically, ORR activity approaching that of commercial platinum based catalysts was observed (ca. 45 mV lower onset potential), and these unique materials were found to provide excellent practical metal-air battery performance.

In all these applications, fluids penetrate the voids of porous materials often having a complex morphology. This demands a deep understanding of how structural variables such as pore size distribution and pore connectivity affect transport in order to design or optimize processes and devices. In previous work from this laboratory, the effect of these structural variables had been studied at infinite dilution. Here, we consider nonvanishing densities and investigate the influence of adsorbate density on the effective diffusivity and tortuosity. At finite densities the transport and self-diffusivity are not equivalent at the single pore level, leading to differing effective diffusion coefficients and tortuosities. The tortuosity has previously been shown to be governed not only by the pore network topology, but also by temperature and the gas species. Here, we show it to vary significantly with adsorbate density and the diffusion mode (i.e., collective or self), which has important repercussions on modeling and interpretation of experimental data. While the effective self-diffusivity of supercritical gases is found to qualitatively behave similar to that estimated in single pores, subcritical fluids present widely different behavior, with a maximum at low adsorbate densities when the coexisting population of small and large mesopores is significant, consistent with experimental evidence. We discuss under what conditions a monotonically decreasing single-pore self-diffusivity can lead to the appearance of such maximum in a network. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Complex morphology; Confined space; Diffusion modes; Effective diffusion coefficients; Effective diffusivities; Electrochemical energy storage; Emerging technologies; Experimental datum; Experimental evidence; Finite density; Gas separations; Gas species; Infinite dilution; Large mesopores; Molecular transport; Pore connectivity; Pore networks; Self-diffusivity; Subcritical fluids; Supercritical gas; Adsorbates; Electric network topology; Porous materials; Diffusion in liquids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874173901

The quality of torrefied pellets is determined mainly by the density, hardness, and the hygroscopicity or moisture uptake. In this study, the density and the hardness of torrefied pellets were systematically examined by using torrefied samples prepared at different conditions in a press machine. The hygroscopicity of prepared torrefied pellets was evaluated in a humidity chamber by measuring the moisture uptake rate of control and torrefied pellets. The results showed that the density and the hardness of torrefied pellets mainly depended on the densification die temperature and the weight loss of torrefied samples. To make strong torrefied pellets of high density and low moisture uptake from 30 wt % weight loss torrefied samples, a die temperature of 230 °C or above was needed. Preconditioning torrefied samples to a moisture content of ∼10% can improve the quality of torrefied pellets. The moisture uptake of torrefied pellets was more sensitive to the weight loss of torrefaction and the relative humidity of the storage environment.

The result is shown in three-dimensional graphs with different output variables of interest as functions of volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the material in the heavy construction part (with a standard concrete as a reference). Output variables of interest are for example energy consumption, peak power consumption and thermal comfort parameters. Influence of factors such as the thickness of the interior wall, wall surface area, and the influence of free solar radiation can be tested. The aim is to present a minimal and thus fully comprehensible model that can be used as a qualitative tool to investigate the influence of thermal mass on building performance.

However, partial discharge has always been a predecessor to major faults and problems in this field. In addition, there are a lot more to explore as the characteristic of partial discharge in nanocomposites is not clearly understood as well as the electrical properties of the nanocomposites. By adding a few amount of weight percentage (wt%) of the nano fillers, the physical, mechanical and electrical properties of polymers can be greatly enhanced. This is due to its amazing characteristic of having large specific area as a consequential from its nano sized particle that could enhance the electrical properties of the insulator. For instance, nano fillers in nanocomposites such as silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3) and titania (TiO2), play big role in providing good approach to increase dielectric breakdown strength and partial discharge resistance of nanocomposites.

It is known that reducing emissions through CCS on point sources can only slowdown the rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration and not able to mitigate the CO2 that are already in the atmosphere by previous emissions. Hence, a complimentary method would be to extract CO2 directly from air - Direct Air Capture (DAC). This paper addresses a novel concept of DAC whereby an additional phase of axial compression is introduced to adapt atmospheric air to a level suitable for capture. An axial compression model was developed so that fluid simulation studies can be performed. These information are then utilized in a feasibility study to address several key issues: the additional energy penalty when applying axial compression and whether or not, increasing the capture input by compression would displace the elevated energy consumption. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Axial; CCS; Direct air capture; Feasibility study","Air captures; Atmospheric air; Atmospheric CO; Axial; Carbon capture and storage; CCS; Direct capture; Energy penalties; Feasibility studies; Fluid simulations; Key Issues; Novel concept; Point sources; Rate of increase; Reducing emissions; Axial compression; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide process; Climate change; Computer simulation; Energy utilization; Innovation; Planning; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873919488

After the reliability analysis of the proposed model was verified, the data provided dynamic results on demand forecasting, quality control, and marketing management for decision making. Then, the effectiveness would be practically adjusted for different quality levels to predict the actual need. It's the essential way to recognize the cost variation and observe other parameters of the marketing strategy.

The optimized geometry of Mg(BH4)2 clusters mimics the structure it has in the crystalline form, but undergoes significant geometric distortion as well as changes in the natural bond orbital (NBO) charge after the addition of the catalysts. While all the catalysts lower the hydrogen desorption energy, elemental Ti appears to be the best catalyst followed by TiCl3 and TiF3. The lowering of the hydrogen desorption is shown to be due to the weakening of the BH bond which is caused by the interaction of Ti with H and Mg.

Here molecular dynamics simulations are employed to study guest transport in clathrates of hydroquinone (HQ) and Dianin's compound (DC). Systems investigated were HQ with methanol and acetonitrile, and DC with methanol and ethanol. Simulations were set up with one guest in the pore, two guests in the pore and one vacancy in the pore and a filled pore, and free-energy barriers for movement between cavities of the pore were estimated for all cases. Comparison between these simulations indicates that guest transport most likely proceeds by molecules moving from full to empty cavities consecutively, one by one, rather than in a concerted manner. Thus, the presence of empty cavities is very important for guest transport, which becomes more energetically demanding in fully loaded systems. Flexibility of the host can assist guest transport. In the studied DC clathrates transport occurs via an intermediate conformation in which the hydroxyl group of the alcohol guest molecule participates in the hydrogen-bonded ring of the host. We also address the issue of the number of methanol guest molecules that DC accommodates, for which conflicting information exists. We found that this is likely to be temperature dependent and suggest that under some conditions the system is most likely non-stoichiometric. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Different impurity phases can be formed during LiFePO4 synthesis. Here, a direct visualization of the impact of impurity phases in LiFePO 4 on a carbon coating is presented; they are investigated on a model material using various surface-characterization techniques. By using polished ingot model materials, impurity phases can be clearly observed, identified, and located on the surface of the sample by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focused-ion-beam lithography (FIB), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. During the carbon-coating process, the phosphorus-rich phase is found to have an inhibiting effect (or no positive catalytic effect) on carbon formation, while iron-rich phases (mainly iron phosphides) promote carbon growth by contributing to more carbon deposition and a higher graphitic carbon content. This finding, and the methodological evaluation here, will help us to understand and reveal the influencing factors of impurity phases on the basic carbon-deposition process to obtain high-performance LiFePO4 material for future energy-storage devices.

Several of these communities have electric load restrictions that limit further building construction and economic growth. This preliminary work discusses the barriers for renewable energy (RE) projects in northern Ontario communities by analyzing the current economic structure, the high capital costs, the available natural resources, and the installation and operation complexity. Also, a detailed analysis of six scenarios is presented; three scenarios consider a solar and/or wind-diesel system with a low RE penetration of 7% without any excess energy, whereas other three scenarios increase the RE penetration to 18%, requiring a dump load, an additional small diesel engine, or a battery storage system.

We quantify three key physical and chemical principles, namely momentum-induced recoil during the decay event, defect creation due to physical displacement, and chemical evolution over time. A fourth effect, that of electronic excitation, is also discussed, but this is difficult to quantify and is strongly material dependent. The analysis is presented for the specific cases of SrTiO3 and SrH2. By comparing the recoil energy with available threshold displacement data we show that in many beta-decay situations defects such as Frenkel pairs will not be created during decay as the energy transfer is too low. This observation leads to the concept of chemical evolution over time, which we quantify using density functional theory. Using a combination of Bader analysis, phonon calculations and cohesive energy calculations, we show that beta decay leads to counter-intuitive behavior that has implications for nuclear waste storage and novel materials design. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Beta decay; Chemical evolution; Chemical principles; Cohesive energies; Defect creation; Electronic excitation; Frenkel pairs; Novel materials; Nuclear waste storage; Phonon calculation; Recoil energies; SrTiO; Strontium-90; Defects; Density functional theory; Digital storage; Energy transfer; Isotopes; Radioactive wastes; Strontium; hydrogen; oxide; strontium; strontium titanium oxide; titanium; article; astronomy; chemical model; chemistry; electron; energy transfer; quantum theory; Beta Particles; Energy Transfer; Evolution, Chemical; Hydrogen; Models, Chemical; Oxides; Quantum Theory; Strontium; Titanium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872707089

They possess potential applications in cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations due to their excellent wetting behaviour at interfaces and a non-greasy feeling when applied on the skin surfaces. This preliminary work was carried out to construct pseudo-ternary phase diagrams for oleyl laurate, oleyl stearate and oleyl oleate with surfactants and piroxicam. Then, the preparation and optimization study via 'One-At-A-Time Approach' were carried out to determine the optimum amount of oil, surfactants and stabilizer using low-energy emulsification method. The results revealed that multi-phase region dominated the three pseudo-ternary phase diagrams. A composition was chosen from each multi-phase region for preparing the nanoemulsions systems containing piroxicam by incorporating a hydrocolloid stabilizer. The results showed that the optimum amount (w/w) of oil for oleyl laurate nanoemulsions was 30 and 20 g (w/w) for oleyl stearate nanoemulsions and oleyl oleate nanoemulsions. For each nanoemulsions system, the amount of mixed surfactants and stabilizer needed for the emulsification to take place was found to be 10 and 0.5 g (w/w), respectively. The emulsification process via high-energy emulsification method successfully produced nano-sized range particles. The nanoemulsions systems passed the centrifugation test and freeze-thaw cycle with no phase failures, and stable for 3 months at various storage temperatures (3 C, 25 C and 45 C). The results proved that the prepared nanoemulsions system cannot be formed spontaneously, and thus, energy input was required to produce nano-sized range particles. © 2013 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.","high-energy emulsification method; low-energy emulsification method; particle size; pseudo-ternary phase diagram; stabilizer","fatty acid ester; piroxicam; article; centrifugation; emulsion; esterification; freeze thawing; hydrocolloid; nanoemulsion; phase separation; priority journal; storage temperature; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors; Emulsions; Esters; Fatty Acids; Piroxicam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878538977

Hydrogen as a biomass is considered as an alternative fuel which can be derived from a variety of domestically available primary sources. In this paper, a hydrogen and electricity co-generation plant with rice husk is proposed. Rice husk with water vapor and oxygen produces syngas in gasifier. In this design, electricity is generated by using two Rankine cycles. The Results show that the net electric efficiency and hydrogen production efficiency are 1.5% and 40.0%, respectively. Hydrogen production is 1.316 kg/s in case which carbon dioxide is gathered and stored. The electricity generation is 5.923 MWe. The main propose of implementing Rankine cycle is to eliminate hydrogen combustion for generating electricity and to reduce NOx production.

The influence of purity (reagent grade [98% pure] compared with practical grade [&lt;80% pure]) on the melting transition was found to be insignificant. The long-term stability of the melting transition of practical-grade dodecanoic acid was investigated by thermal cycling of samples from completely solid through complete melting and back to the solid phase, nearly 500 times. It was found that the transition enthalpy and the melting onset temperature remain within experimental uncertainty of their values, 184 J g-1 and 43.3 °C, respectively. Neither data set showed significant trends with number of thermal cycles. The freezing temperature of 41 °C for practical-grade dodecanoic acid also was stable with respect to thermal cycling, showing almost negligible hysteresis, without addition of nucleating agents. The specific heat in the region of the phase transition was determined, along with the thermal conductivity in the solid state (0.150 ± 0.004 W m-1 K -1 at 30 °C) and the volume change associated with melting (6%). Although the thermal conductivity of dodecanoic acid is low in both the solid phase and liquid phase, and thermal energy storage devices would need to be designed accordingly, dodecanoic acid is inexpensive, readily available (used as a foodstuff), has a low volume change on melting, and is stable over hundreds of thermal cycles even in practical grade, making it a promising phase-change material for thermal energy storage. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the inability of rechargeable energy sources to charge and discharge at the same time, a constraint we term the energy half-duplex constraint, two rechargeable energy storage devices (ESDs) are assumed so that at any given time, there is always one ESD being recharged. The energy harvesting rate is assumed to be a random variable that is constant over the time interval of interest. A save-then-transmit (ST) protocol is introduced, in which a fraction of time ρ (dubbed the save-ratio) is devoted exclusively to energy harvesting, with the remaining fraction 1-ρ used for data transmission. The ratio of the energy obtainable from an ESD to the energy harvested is termed the energy storage efficiency, η. We address the practical case of the secondary ESD being a battery with η < 1, and the main ESD being a super-capacitor with η = 1. Important properties of the optimal save-ratio that minimizes outage probability are derived, from which useful design guidelines are drawn. In addition, we compare the outage performance of random power supply to that of constant power supply over the Rayleigh fading channel. The diversity order with random power is shown to be the same as that of constant power, but the performance gap can be large. Finally, we extend the proposed ST protocol to wireless networks with multiple transmitters. It is shown that the system-level outage performance is critically dependent on the number of transmitters and the optimal save-ratio for single-channel outage minimization. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","energy half-duplex constraint; Energy harvesting; energy storage efficiency; fading channel; outage minimization; save-then-transmit protocol; TDMA","Charge and discharge; Energy storage efficiencies; Half-duplex constraints; Multiple transmitters; Outage minimization; Outage performance; Wireless communication devices; Wireless transmitter; Data communication systems; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatic discharge; Energy harvesting; Energy storage; Fading channels; Optimization; Rayleigh fading; Transmitters; Wireless telecommunication systems; Time division multiple access",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875628003

Therefore, the reduction of visceral adipose tissue potentially plays a pivotal role in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to describe the overall effect of exercise on visceral adipose tissue and to provide an overview of the effect of different exercise regimes, without caloric restriction, on visceral adipose tissue in obese persons. A systematic literature search was performed according to the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The initial search resulted in 87 articles after removing duplicates. After screening on title, abstract and full-text 15 articles (totalling 852 subjects) fulfilled the a priori inclusion criteria. The quality of each eligible study was assessed in duplicate with ""The Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies"". Using random-effects weights, the standardized mean difference (Hedge's g) of the change in visceral adipose tissue was -0.497 with a 95% confidence interval of -0.655 to -0.340. The Z-value was -6.183 and the p-value (two tailed) was &lt;0.001. A subgroup analysis was performed based on gender, type of training and intensity. Aerobic training of moderate or high intensity has the highest potential to reduce visceral adipose tissue in overweight males and females. These results suggest that an aerobic exercise program, without hypocaloric diet, can show beneficial effects to reduce visceral adipose tissue with more than 30 cm2 (on CT analysis) in women and more than 40 cm2 in men, even after 12 weeks. © 2013 Vissers et al.",,"adult; aerobic exercise; article; body mass; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; exercise; exercise intensity; female; genetic heterogeneity; human; intraabdominal fat; male; meta analysis; metabolic syndrome X; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; physical activity; qualitative analysis; quality control; randomized controlled trial; sex difference; systematic review; Adult; Exercise; Female; Humans; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Male; Middle Aged; Overweight; Sex Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873678101

Electrical resistance heating of the metallic components of the fiber-optic cable provides information on the thermal characteristics of the cable's environment, providing valuable insight into processes occurring in the surrounding medium, such as groundwater-surface water interactions, dam stability or soil moisture. Until now, heated applications required direct handling of the DTS instrument by a researcher, rendering long-term investigations in remote areas impractical due to the often difficult and time-consuming access to the field site. Remote control and automation of the DTS instrument and heating processes, however, resolve the issue with difficult access. The data can also be remotely accessed and stored on a central database. The power supply can be grid independent, although significant infrastructure investment is required here due to high power consumption during heated applications. Solar energy must be sufficient even in worst case scenarios, e.g. during long periods of intense cloud cover, to prevent system failure due to energy shortage. In combination with storage batteries and a low heating frequency, e.g. once per day or once per week (depending on the season and the solar radiation on site), issues of high power consumption may be resolved. Safety regulations dictate adequate shielding and ground-fault protection, to safeguard animals and humans from electricity and laser sources. In this paper the autonomous DTS system is presented to allow research with heated applications of DTS in remote areas for long-term investigations of temperature distributions in the environment. © 2013 Author(s).",,"Cables; Digital storage; Electric grounding; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power utilization; Groundwater; Investments; Laser safety; Remote control; Soil moisture; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Surface waters; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors; Control and automation; Distributed temperature sensing; Electrical resistance heating; Ground water-surface water interactions; Ground-fault protection; High power consumption; Infrastructure investment; Thermal characteristics; Microgrids; autonomy; cable; database; electrical resistivity; groundwater-surface water interaction; heating; instrumentation; laser; research work; soil moisture; solar radiation; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906308268

The incorporation of accessible nitrogen-donor sites into the pore walls of porous adsorbents can dramatically affect the CO2 uptake capacity and selectivity on account of the dipole-quadrupole interactions between the polarizable CO2 molecule and the accessible nitrogen site. In the present work, a nitrogen-rich rth-type metal-organic framework (MOF) was constructed based on rational design and careful synthesis.

Temperature-programmed desorption results showed that a mutual destabilization effect exists between the components. First, Na3AlH6 reacts with MgH2 to form a perovskite-type hydride, NaMgH 3, Al, and H2 at a temperature of about 170°C, which is about 55°C lower than the decomposition temperature of as-milled Na 3AlH6. Then, at a temperature of about 275°C, the as-formed Al can destabilize MgH2 to form the intermetallic compound Mg17Al12, which is accompanied by the self-decomposition of the residual MgH2. This temperature is about 55°C lower than the decomposition temperature for as-milled MgH2. Furthermore, when heated up to 345°C, NaMgH3 starts to decompose into NaH, Mg, and H2, which is followed by the decomposition of NaH at a temperature of about 370°C. Rehydrogenation processes show that Mg17Al 12 and NaMgH3 are fully reversible. It is believed that the Mg17Al12 and NaMgH3 formed in situ provide synergetic thermodynamic and kinetic destabilization, leading to the dehydrogenation of MgH2, which is responsible for the distinct reduction in the operating temperatures of the as-prepared MgH 2-Na3AlH6 (4:1) composite system.

The generator is placed on the seabed and connected to a buoy on the ocean surface. Due to the reciprocating motion of the translator, an electrical conversion system is needed between the wave energy converter (WEC) and the grid. Depending on how the conversion system is designed, the generator will be subjected to different loads. A novel conversion system is presented in this paper where the voltage from the WEC is rectified in a resonance circuit. Both simulations and experiments are performed on the circuit. The results from the simulations show that a higher power absorption and power production can be achieved with the resonance circuit compared to a WEC connected to a passive rectifier.

Whilst large-scale renewably powered desalination systems have been the focus of much research, where smaller systems are concerned, there remains ambiguity as to the significance of modelling all system intricacies and the effects of Solar-Photovoltaics (solar-PV) scalability on total water yield.After detailing the methodology used to model such Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems, this paper presents the results of simulations used to investigate a small-scale, stand-alone, solar-PV powered (RO) system, with/without battery storage. Results indicate that system performance is affected differently when including power characteristics of RO devices and also by the temporal resolution used in simulations. The scale of the renewable energy conversion used (solar-PV) appears to be a factor in some cases. Parameters varied in the simulations include RO (unit) power characteristics, saline water concentration/temperature, PV panel power characteristics as well as the dynamic charging and discharging of batteries and the efficiency of power conditioning.

These storage piles may become a trap for saproxylic insects (dependent on dead wood) if they attract many breeding individuals, whose offspring are killed at biofuel processing. Stumps in clear-cuts are also an important habitat for many species and these species could be negatively affected by habitat loss when stumps are extracted. In a field study, we therefore estimated the trap effect for the saproxylic beetle fauna in stump storage piles. We also estimated the habitat loss and population decrease that was the result of stump extraction. Beetle density and habitat amounts were estimated in stump storage piles, extraction clear-cuts, and ordinary clear-cuts. In each of eight (six for piles) replicates, beetles were sampled from ten Norway spruce Picea abies stumps, by means of bark sieving, in each habitat (220 stumps in total). Stump extraction reduced the P. abies stump volume by 76%. The concomitant decrease in beetle community abundance was 70%, a decrease from 9109 to 2692 beetles per hectare. A conservative estimate is that between 5.2% and 23.1% of the beetles ""produced"" at the stump extraction site were killed at stump pile removal. Our results indicated that the stump storage piles were a severe ecological trap for four individual species. However, a lower community density of beetles in stump storage piles compared to surrounding extraction clear-cuts, indicate that stump storage piles did not constitute a community-wide ecological trap. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Bioenergy; Coleoptera; Community ecology","Bio-energy; Coleoptera; Community density; Community ecology; Concomitant decrease; Dead wood; Field studies; Habitat loss; Norway spruce; Picea abies; Saproxylic; Saproxylic beetles; Storage piles; Trap effect; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Plants (botany); Piles; abundance estimation; beetle; clearcutting; estimation method; habitat loss; population decline; population density; species diversity; trapping; tree stump; Abies; Coleoptera; Hexapoda; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872676603

Biochemical analysis of phyllosoma during ontogeny provides information on the energy storage requirements of late instar phyllosoma and their ability to survive metamorphosis and achieve the energetic demands of the puerulus stage. The current study is the first to examine biochemical composition of spiny lobsters through the entire larval phase. Survival, growth, development, and biochemical composition were measured in Sagmariasus verreauxi phyllosoma that were cultured at High Density (HD) and Low Density (LD) from hatch to puerulus. Protein measured directly by Lowry was considerably lower than crude protein as calculated from nitrogen (N) content using N × 6.25, suggesting that a conversion factor of 6.25 was too high. Survival of phyllosoma was significantly higher in the HD treatment after instar 9 due to high mortalities of LD phyllosoma caused by high ozonation during instar 9. However, HD phyllosoma were less susceptible to the high ozonation event possibly due to the larger biomass in HD tanks. Phyllosoma growth and development were more advanced in LD phyllosoma after 108 d. Instar 17 LD phyllosoma were also significantly larger than instar 17 HD phyllosoma. The C:N ratio confirmed proportionally more lipid than protein was accumulated during larval development before a significant decrease in lipid reserves between instar 17 and the puerulus stage by over 21% to fuel the process of metamorphosis and the non-feeding puerulus stage. The study demonstrated the larval phase of S. verreauxi is important for accumulating lipid reserves to fuel metamorphosis and the puerulus stage and provides a more complete picture of the culture requirements of spiny lobsters during ontogeny, particularly for the rarely studied late phyllosoma instars. © 2012.","C:N ratio; Lipid; Ontogeny; Phyllosoma; Protein; Spiny lobster","biochemistry; developmental biology; growth rate; lipid; lobster; ontogeny; ozone; population density; Palinuridae; Puerulus; Sagmariasus verreauxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871364373

Despite its advantages, this energy could never be a primary source of electric power to be integrated into the grid even in high wind areas, such as Great Plains, due to its intermittent behaviour. This intermittency will generate intermittent power to grid, which leads to instability, unreliability and power quality problem onto the grid system. One of the widely accepted methods to overcome this problem is by coupling the wind turbine with the energy storage system. This paper reviews the ability of four different types of the energy storage system to mitigate the power fluctuated into the grid, especially during low wind speed.

In some distributed computing environments, especially in a cloud computing environment, the most concerned issue for a datacenter designer is power consumption instead of its speed. This is because the storage devices always consume much electricity. To save power, we can assign to each device proper workload and turn off some spare devices. Therefore, partitioning data and allocating them among the storage devices becomes the first priority. However, due to some complex constraints, the data partition problem is very time-consuming or even NP-hard. Therefore, we propose a gradient-based method to deal with the problem. The novelty of the proposed method lies in that the discretized combinatorial problem is solved by a calculus-based technique. Experimental results show that significant energy is saved by shutting down as many uncalled-for devices as possible. The results also suggest that other similar optimization problems can be solved by the linearly-convergent method. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.","cloud computing; data partition; distributed computing; Gradient; mathematical optimization; power saving","Cloud computing environments; Data partition; Data partition method; Distributed computing environment; Gradient; Gradient-based method; Mathematical optimizations; Power savings; Cloud computing; Computer systems; Customer satisfaction; Distributed computer systems; Virtual storage; Data handling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878436831

This study aimed to analyze the fat body neutral lipid composition in Rhipicephalus microplus engorged females. In the first study (physiological profile of untreated ticks), the lipid analysis took place over the course of 4 days; the engorged females were incubated at optimal conditions and their fat bodies were dissected daily. Fat body lipid analysis after fungal infection with Metarhizium anisopliae sensu lato (s.l.) or Beauveria bassiana s.l. was performed with four groups: one without any treatment, one that was inoculated with a solution of 0.1 % Tween 80 in water, and two groups that were inoculated with M. anisopliae or B. bassiana conidial suspensions. The fat bodies were dissected 24 and 48 h after infection. Lipid analysis was conducted by thin-layer chromatography on a silica plate. The results of the physiological profile showed that the amounts of triacylglycerol (TAG) and free cholesterol (CHO) decreased with time, whereas cholesterol ester (CHOE) increased on the second and fourth days. Following M. anisopliae or B. bassiana infection, there was an increase in the amount of CHO after 24 h, whereas the other lipid classes were not altered. M. anisopliae caused an increase in CHOE and TAG and a reduction in CHO at 48 h after infection; however, B. bassiana infection did not cause significant alterations in the concentrations of these lipids.

The calculated adsorption energies of the CO/AlNNT complex increased with increasing parallel electric field intensity, whereas the adsorption energy values at the applied transverse electric field show a significant reverse trend. The calculated adsorption energies of the complex at the applied parallel electric field strengths increased gradually from -0.42 eV at zero field strength to -0.80 eV at a field strength of 140 × 10-4 a.u. The considerable changes in the adsorption energies and energy gap values generated by the applied parallel electric field strengths show the high sensitivity of the electronic properties of AlNNT towards the adsorption of CO on its surface. Analysis of structural parameters indicates that the nanotube is resistant to external electric field strengths. The dipole moment variations in the complex show a significant change in the presence of parallel and transverse electric fields, which results in much stronger interactions at higher electric field strengths. Additionally, the natural bond orbital charges, quantum molecular descriptors, and molecular orbital energies of the complex show that the nanotube can absorb CO molecule in its pristine form at a high applied parallel electric field, and that the nanotube can be used as a CO storage medium.

It is often impregnated in polymers for controlled and effective release of insecticide. The migration and chemical consumption of DM and PBO from moulded polyethylene sheets was studied. The thermal behaviour of pristine DM and the prepared polyethylene compound was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. DM did not crystallize and remained in a liquid state after cooling to room temperature. Evaporation rates and activation energies of evaporation were determined by thermogravimetry for pristine DM, PBO, a solution of DM and PBO and for the PE compound. Evaporation from the DM/PBO solution was greater than that predicted from the evaporation rates of the individual compounds, which suggested that the DM/PBO solution obeyed non-ideal solution properties. The migration of DM and PBO from the polyethylene was studied in liquid water at 80 and 95 °C and in air of different relative humidities (60 and 80%) at 80 °C. Exposure to liquid water caused degradation and hydrolysis of the ester bond in DM, present in the prepared material, and generated species containing hydroxyl groups. Liquid chromatography and infrared spectroscopy showed a significant migration of the active species in liquid water, whereas the loss of DM and PBO in air at 80°C (60 and 80 %RH) was negligible over 30 days. © Smithers Rapra Technology, 2013.","Deltamethrin; Piperonyl butoxide.; Polyethylene; Pyrethroids","Activation energy; Aliphatic compounds; Differential scanning calorimetry; Evaporation; Food storage; Infrared spectroscopy; Insecticides; Liquids; Polyethylenes; Thermogravimetric analysis; Chemical consumption; Deltamethrin; Non-ideal solution; Piperonyl butoxide; Polyethylene sheet; Pyrethroids; Synthetic pyrethroids; Thermal behaviours; Liquid chromatography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876997302

The existing gear prognosis methods are primarily either model-based or data-driven. In this paper, an integrated prognostics method is developed for gear remaining life prediction, which utilizes both gear physical models and real-time condition monitoring data. The general prognosis framework for gears is proposed. The developed physical models include a gear finite element model for gear stress analysis, a gear dynamics model for dynamic load calculation, and a damage propagation model described using Paris' law. A gear mesh stiffness computation method is developed based on the gear system potential energy, which results in more realistic curved crack propagation paths. Material uncertainty and model uncertainty are considered to account for the differences among different specific units that affect the damage propagation path. A Bayesian method is used to fuse the collected condition monitoring data to update the distributions of the uncertainty factors for the current specific unit being monitored, and to achieve the updated remaining useful life prediction. An example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Bayesian updating; finite element modeling; integrated prognostics; prediction; remaining useful life; vibration","Bayesian updating; Finite element modeling; integrated prognostics; Remaining useful lives; vibration; Bayesian networks; Condition monitoring; Digital storage; Dynamic loads; Finite element method; Forecasting; Gears; Stress analysis; Systems engineering; Uncertainty analysis; Models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874982656

Following on from a collaborative study supported by the CSIRO's Energy Transformed Flagship and the CO2CRC on the CO2 storage potential of the Hunter Coalfield, five coal seam gas 'compartments' (where gas content and composition show similar distributions) were identified based on structural and gas data. The seam gas composition varies between predominantly CH4 to predominantly CO2, with up to 100% CO2 in some areas. The magmatic origin of the CO2 in these coals is supported by isotopic data as well as the proximity of igneous dykes and sills, but the present-day distribution may also be related to gas migration through geological structures and dissolution in groundwater. This study has refined a previous assessment of the CO2 storage potential of the Hunter coals. Using a simplistic approach the theoretical total storage capacity of the coalfield is estimated to about 9512 Mt of CO2 between 300 and 800 m depth, with an average coal permeability of ~1.5 mD between these depths. Permeability is believed to be an order of magnitude lower at depths greater than 800 m. The southern region of the coalfield shows the greatest potential for CO2 storage given its high permeability, proximity to potential CO2 sources, and thick sequence of coal seams, including deeper seams as possible storage targets. The actual available storage capacity for the coalfield, however, could be considerably less owing to factors such as high existing CO2 concentrations in some areas, low permeability in many areas, accessibility issues owing to the presence of national parks, and existing and proposed coal mines. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","CO2 storage potential; coal seam gas; Hunter Coalfield; natural analogue; reservoir properties; Sydney Basin","assessment method; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; coal mine; coal seam; hydrocarbon migration; hydrocarbon reservoir; methane; permeability; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874785197

Recognition that there is a potentially suitable geosequestration site in the region near extensive emission sources led to the formation of the South West Hub and its submission as a potential Flagship under the Australian Federal Clean Energy Initiative (CEI). An area with geosequestration potential was identified based on data from years of active research in the region to investigate oil and gas potential, ground-water resources and more recently for geothermal energy potential and now carbon storage. Three interesting factors stand out regarding this site: (1) the storage site relies primarily on residual and dissolution trapping, (2) some of the CO2 will be sequestered by mineralisation during the amelioration of bauxite residue from some nearby alumina plants, and (3) the subsurface storage area can be tested at a relatively early stage by accessing significant pilot-scale quantities of high-purity CO2 from existing industry in the Kwinana area. CO2 is already being captured and vented at a site in Kwinana, and a proposed pipeline will transport the CO2 to the alumina plants with the remainder of the gas used for a pilot-scale test. The upfront capital costs are therefore reduced to the pipeline cost rather than for a full-scale capture-ready power plant. In preparation for an investment decision (to drill a new data well addressing the main criteria for characterising carbon storage potential of the proposed Lesueur site) a series of studies have increased the understanding of the geology of the area. Modelling studies suggest that up to 6.4 million tonnes per annum could be stored in the Triassic aged Lesueur Sandstone, with total capacity estimates of 200-260 million tonnes of CO2 over the lifetime of the project. This paper primarily discusses the evolution of the geological understanding of the Lesueur Sandstone and associated formations in and around the Harvey Ridge structure, which falls within the Lesueur study area, as well as how the Collie coal users and producers and other local industries and government have become engaged in the project. Recent activities in the project have included seismic data acquisition and the drilling, coring and logging of a data well that will allow significant reductions in geological uncertainties for the project. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","carbon capture and storage; carbon dioxide; geosequestration; Lesueur Formation; residual gas saturation; South West Hub; storage; Western Australia","bauxite; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; dissolution; mineralization; sandstone; Triassic; Australia; Western Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874782881

Complement activation in blood triggers energydepleting immune responses to fight infections. Here we identify surprising energy-conserving roles for complement proteins C5a and C3a and their receptors, C5aR and C3aR, roles that are contraindicated in complement biology. Rats fed a high-carbohydrate high-fat diet developed obesity, visceral adiposity, adipose inflammation, glucose/insulin intolerance, and cardiovascular dysfunction that correlated with increased plasma C3a, adipose C5aR, and C3aR. These in vivo changes were dramatically attenuated by receptorselective antagonists of either C5aR (5 mg/kg/d p.o.) or C3aR (30 mg/kg/d p.o.), which both reduced proinflammatory adipokines and altered expression of inflammatory genes in adipose tissue. In vitro C5a and C3a (100 nM) exhibited novel insulin-like effects on 3T3-L1 adipocytes, promoting energy conservation by increasing glucose and fatty acid uptake while inhibiting cAMP signaling and lipolysis, and induced PGE2 release from macrophages, effects all blocked by each respective antagonist (10 μM). These studies reveal important new links between complement signaling and metabolism, highlight new complement functions on adipocytes and in adipose tissue, demonstrate how aberrant immune responses may exacerbate obesity and metabolic dysfunction, and show that targeting C3aR or C5aR with antagonists is a new strategy for treating metabolic dysfunction. © FASEB.","Adipose inflammation; Complement; GPCR; Immunity; Metabolism","3d 53; complement component C3a; complement component C5a; complement component C5a receptor; complement inhibitor; cyclic AMP; interleukin 6; n2 [(2,2 diphenylethoxy)acetyl]levo arginine; prostaglandin E2; prostaglandin synthase; sb 290157; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; adipocyte; adipogenesis; animal experiment; animal model; article; cardiovascular disease; complement activation; controlled study; energy conservation; fat mass; fatty acid transport; gene expression; glucose intolerance; glucose transport; immune response; in vivo study; inflammation; insulin tolerance test; lipid diet; lipid storage; lipolysis; macrophage; male; metabolic disorder; monocyte; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein expression; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; retroperitoneal fat; signal transduction; systolic blood pressure; weight gain; weight reduction; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Animals; Arginine; Benzhydryl Compounds; Diet, High-Fat; Dietary Carbohydrates; Inflammation; Lipid Metabolism; Macrophages; Male; Metabolic Diseases; Mice; Obesity; Peptides, Cyclic; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a; Receptors, Complement; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873472582

Our previous evidence suggests that alterations in skeletal muscle lipid metabolism coupled with altered mitochondrial function may also develop. The objective of this study was to use an integrative metabolic approach to identify potential areas of dysfunction that develop in skeletal muscle from ovariectomized (OVX) female mice compared with age-matched ovary-intact adult female mice (sham). The OVX mice exhibited significant increases in body weight, visceral, and inguinal fat mass compared with sham mice. OVX mice also had significant increases in skeletal muscle intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) compared with the sham animals, which corresponded to significant increases in the protein content of the fatty acid transporters CD36/FAT and FABPpm. A targeted metabolic profiling approach identified significantly lower levels of specific acyl carnitine species and various amino acids in skeletal muscle from OVX mice compared with the sham animals, suggesting a potential dysfunction in lipid and amino acid metabolism, respectively. Basal and maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates were significantly impaired in skeletal muscle fibers from OVX mice compared with sham animals. Collectively, these data indicate that loss of ovarian function results in increased IMCL storage that is coupled with alterations in mitochondrial function and changes in the skeletal muscle metabolic profile. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.","Estrogen; Fat; Metabolism; Mitochondria; Muscle","amino acid; carnitine; CD36 antigen; fatty acid binding protein; fatty acid transporter; lipid; amino acid metabolism; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; fat mass; female; intraabdominal fat; lipid metabolism; lipidosis; metabolic parameters; mitochondrial respiration; mitochondrion; mouse; muscle cell; muscle metabolism; nonhuman; ovariectomy; ovary function; oxygen consumption; priority journal; protein content; sham procedure; skeletal muscle; weight gain; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Female; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muscle Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; Ovariectomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873299815

However, the mechanism behind this association is not completely understood. The hormone leptin may be a molecular link between obesity and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Leptin can affect lipid metabolism independent of its well-known effects on food intake and energy expenditure, but exactly how this occurs is ill-defined. We hypothesized that since leptin receptors are found on the liver and the liver plays an integral role in regulating lipid metabolism, leptin may affect lipid metabolism by acting directly on the liver. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice with a hepatocyte-specific loss of leptin signaling. We previously showed that these mice have increased insulin sensitivity and elevated levels of liver triglycerides compared with controls. Here, we show that mice lacking hepatic leptin signaling have decreased levels of plasma apolipoprotein B yet increased levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides, suggesting alterations in triglyceride incorporation into VLDL or abnormal lipoprotein remodeling in the plasma. Indeed, lipoprotein profiles revealed larger apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein particles in mice with ablated liver leptin signaling. Loss of leptin signaling in the liver was also associated with a substantial increase in lipoprotein lipase activity in the liver, which may have contributed to increased lipid droplets in the liver. Conclusion: Lack of hepatic leptin signaling results in increased lipid accumulation in the liver and larger, more triglyceride-rich VLDL particles. Collectively, these data reveal an interesting role for hepatic leptin signaling in modulating triglyceride metabolism. © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",,"apolipoprotein B; leptin; liver triacylglycerol lipase; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; blood sampling; controlled study; enzyme activity; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipoprotein blood level; liver cell; male; mouse; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; signal transduction; triacylglycerol blood level; Animals; Apolipoproteins B; Hepatocytes; Leptin; Lipid Metabolism; Lipoprotein Lipase; Lipoproteins, VLDL; Liver; Mice; Mice, Obese; Signal Transduction; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873284664

Plant lipids are uniquely suited to serve as a renewable source of high-value fatty acids for use as chemical feedstocks and as a substitute for current petrochemicals. Despite the broad variety of acyl structures encountered in nature and the cloning of many genes involved in their biosynthesis, attempts at engineering economic levels of specialty industrial fatty acids in major oilseed crops have so far met with only limited success. Much of the progress has been hampered by an incomplete knowledge of the fatty acid biosynthesis and accumulation pathways. This review covers new insights based on metabolic flux and reverse engineering studies that have changed our view of plant oil synthesis from a mostly linear process to instead an intricate network with acyl fluxes differing between plant species. These insights are leading to new strategies for high-level production of industrial fatty acids and waxes. Furthermore, progress in increasing the levels of oil and wax structures in storage and vegetative tissues has the potential to yield novel lipid production platforms. The challenge and opportunity for the next decade will be to marry these technologies when engineering current and new crops for the sustainable production of oil and wax feedstocks. © 2012 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Fatty acids; Industrial feedstocks; Metabolic engineering; Oils; Waxes","fatty acid; vegetable oil; wax; animal food; biosynthesis; metabolic engineering; metabolism; plant; review; Animal Feed; Fatty Acids; Metabolic Engineering; Plant Oils; Plants; Waxes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873126686

However, research published over the past few years has indicated that many of the pathological pathways important in the development of the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus are equally relevant to the initiation of diabetes mellitus itself. These pathways include insulin signalling, generation of cellular energy, post-translational modifications and redox imbalances.

In cardiomyocytes, TAG is synthesized by acyltransferases and phosphatases at the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membrane and then packaged into cytosolic lipid droplets for temporary storage or into lipoproteins for secretion. A complex interplay among lipases, lipase regulatory proteins, and lipid droplet scaffold proteins leads to the controlled release of FAs from the cardiac TAG pool for subsequent mitochondrial β-oxidation and energy production. With the identification and characterization of proteins involved in myocardial TAG metabolism as well as the identification of the importance of cardiac TAG turnover, it is now evident that adequate regulation of myocardial TAG metabolism is critical for both cardiac energy metabolism and function. In this article, we review the current understanding of myocardial TAG metabolism and discuss the potential role of myocardial TAG turnover in cardiac health and disease.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled ""Focus on Cardiac Metabolism"". © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cardiomyopathy; Energy metabolism; Lipid droplet; Lipolysis; Lipoprotein; Triacylglycerol","acyltransferase; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2; fat droplet; glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase; lipoprotein; microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; phosphatase; regulator protein; scaffold protein; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; cytosol; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid transport; heart muscle cell; heart muscle metabolism; human; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrial energy transfer; mitochondrial membrane; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; priority journal; review; sarcoplasmic reticulum; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lipoproteins; Myocardium; Triglycerides",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872686208

This research examines citizens' views on climate change and a number of energy systems, with a specific focus on the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a technology to address greenhouse gas emissions. An all-day workshop with 82 local participants was held in the city of Calgary in Alberta, Canada to explore the views of climate change, energy and CCS. Participants were provided the opportunity to ask experts questions and discuss in small groups their views of climate change policy and energy systems. Results demonstrate that participants' assessments of energy systems are influenced by social-political-institutional-economic contexts such as trust in industry and government, perception of parties benefiting from the technology, and tradeoffs between energy systems.

Polypyrrole (PPy) film, doped with p-toluenesulfonate, has been coated onto activated carbon (AC) electrode preform. Although the specific capacitance of the electrode is doubled, from 176 F/g to 352 F/g, with coating of 17.7 wt.% PPy, the capacitance lost nearly 60% after 10,000 cycles at 40 °C, in contrast to 20% loss at 25 °C. It is demonstrated that the problem of accelerated fading at high temperature is effectively alleviated, in conjunction with significant (up to 50%) improvement in power performance, by embedding conductive TiC nanoparticles within the PPy layer via co-electroplating. With addition of 1.7 wt.% of TiC in the composite electrode, the capacitance retains 92% of its initial capacitance under the same cycling condition (40 °C, 10,000 cycles). The enhanced high-temperature cycling stability has in part been attributed to the reduction in the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficient between the conducting polymer layer and the AC substrate. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Pump scheduling is one of the most important tasks of the operation of a water distribution system as it represents the major part of its operating costs. In this paper, a novel approach for modeling of explicit pump scheduling to minimize energy consumption by pumps is introduced which uses the pump start/end run times as continuous variables, and binary integer variables to describe the pump status at the beginning of the scheduling period. This is different from other approaches where binary integer variables for each hour are typically used, which is considered very impractical from an operational perspective. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and a new algorithm is developed for its solution.

The Genetic Algorithm (GA), an optimal search technique, was adopted to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The major objective functions consist of the electric fee saving, line loss reduction, and voltage deviation minimization. Major constraints such as the line thermal limit and allowable maximum voltage deviation are all taken into account in the process. To precisely simulate the influence of charge/discharge time of the ESS-rEVb on the distribution network, the daily load curves and hourly renewable energy generation in Taiwan were also taken into account.

The INCP can be converted into the minimization of a least-squares discrepancy between the observed and the modelled data. It has been solved using different classical optimization strategies that require a monotone descent of the objective function for recovering the unknown profile of the time-varying heat source function. In this investigation, we use this partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization problem as a demanding test bed to compare the performance of several state-of-the-art variants of the conjugate gradients approach. We propose solving the INCP, using the scaled nonlinear conjugate gradient method: a low-cost and low-storage optimization technique. The method presented here uses the gradient direction with a particular spectral step length and the quasi-Newton Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno updating formula without any matrix evaluations. Two adaptive line search approaches are numerically studied in which there is no need for solving the sensitivity problem to obtain the step length directly, and are compared with an exact line search approach. We combine the proposed optimization scheme for INCP with a consistent-splitting scheme for solving systems of momentum, continuity and energy equations and a mixed finite-element method. We show a number of computational tests that demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the classical gradient method by improving the number of iterations required and reducing the computational time. We also discuss some practical issues related to the implementation of the different methods. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Adjoint variable method; Consistent-splitting method; Inverse natural convection problem; Mixed finite elements; Scaled conjugate gradient method","Adjoint variable methods; Consistent-splitting method; Mixed finite elements; Natural convection problems; Scaled conjugate gradients; Conjugate gradient method; Constrained optimization; Digital storage; Equipment testing; Finite element method; Natural convection; Partial differential equations; Porous materials; Problem solving; Inverse problems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867473134

Implementing solar assisted air conditioning is an ideal option to achieve a high solar fraction which leads to a significant amount of energy and greenhouse gas emission savings. Solar assisted air conditioning systems are environmentally friendly by being constructed in a way that minimises the need for chlorofluorocarbons CFC, Hydro chlorofluorocarbons HCFC or Chlorofluorocarbons HFC refrigerants and by using a low grade thermal renewable energy, therefore, making them energy efficient and environmentally safe. They can be used either as stand-alone systems or with conventional AC, to improve the indoor air quality. Solar cooling is a new and a fast growing technology compared to other fields of solar energy applications. On the other hand most of the current solar cooling applications are demonstration projects in nature; the technologies are advancing yet still need a lot of additional design, planning, development, and research efforts. T now solar assisted air conditioning's main obstacles are the high installation costs, and the lack of knowledge and familiarity with this technology between designers, developers and architects.In this paper a feasibility study is carried out to assess a solar assisted air conditioning system for an office building under three of Queensland's subtropical climates; Rockhampton, Gladstone, and Emerald. The technical aspects of a proposed solar cooling system are investigated.

An electric vapour compression pump, with 2.5 coefficient of performance (COP) for cooling is used as a reference system to assess the primary energy consumption, assuming 80% of primary energy consumed by the reference conventional system is replaced by solar energy.

In the oil and gas industry, the CO2-EGR policy has become attractive because it maintains the use of fossil fuels while reducing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Accordingly, the effect of gas miscibility is studied for the developed reservoir model in terms of methane contamination by CO2 to find the optimum miscibility parameters. Several scenarios are considered, including continuous primary CO2 injection into the gas reservoir prior to primary depletion. CO2 injection scenarios at deeper reservoir levels are considered as they enable sweep efficiency. The main goal of the analysis is to maximise methane production, while simultaneously storing the injected CO2. In addition, various CO2 costs involved in the CO2-EGR and storage are investigated. This investigation is undertaken to determine whether the technique is feasible, that is, whether the CO2 content in the production and preparation stages is economically viable. © 2012 WIT Press.","Capture cost; Carbon credit; CO2; Compression cost; Gas production; Injection cost; Storage; Transportation cost","Australia; Carbon credits; Clean gas; Enhanced gas recoveries; Gas productions; Gas reservoir; Input datas; Methane production; Oil and Gas Industry; Reservoir models; Reservoir simulator; Storage modelling; Sweep efficiency; Transportation cost; Costs; Digital storage; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Gas industry; Methane; Mineral resources; Petroleum reservoirs; Solubility; Water injection; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872966251

These storage systems can capitalize on the high specific energy of Lithium-Ion batteries and the high specific power of modern ultracapacitors. The new predictive algorithm uses a state-based approach inspired by power systems optimization, organized as a probability-weighted Markov process to predict future load demands. Decisions on power sharing are made in real time, based on the predictions and probabilities of state trajectories along with associated system losses. Detailed simulations comparing various power sharing algorithms are presented, along with converter-level simulations presenting the response characteristics of power sharing scenarios. The full hybrid storage system along with the mechanical drivetrain is implemented and validated experimentally on a 500 W, 50 V system with a programmable drive cycle having a strong regenerative component. It is experimentally shown that the hybrid energy storage system runs more efficiently and captures the excess regenerative energy that is otherwise dissipated in the mechanical brakes due to the battery's limited charge current capability. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Battery management; Dc-dc converters; Digital control; Electric vehicles (EVs); Energy management; Hybrid energy storage; Ultracapacitors (u-caps)","Battery Management; Charge current; Digital control; Drive cycles; Hybrid energy storage; Hybrid storages; Lithium-ion battery; Load demand; Mechanical brakes; Optimal controls; Power flows; Power sharing; Power systems optimizations; Predictive algorithms; Real time; Regenerative energy; Response characteristic; Specific energy; Specific power; State trajectory; Storage systems; System loss; Ultracapacitors; Vehicle applications; Capacitors; DC-DC converters; Digital control systems; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Energy storage; Friction materials; Land vehicle propulsion; Markov processes; Optimization; Algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872957840

The method is successfully applied to an existing subtransmission grid; actual hourly production and consumption data during a two-year period is used.

Accordingly, in recent years the awareness of people about EVs has increased significantly. In addition to the well-known advantages such as cleaner environment, less oil-dependency, cheaper fuel, more silent operation etc., through smartgrids, EVs offer a unique benefit called vehicle to grid (V2G) technology. In order to define the role of EVs as distributed storage devices, simulation works undertaken in Paladin Designbase 4.0 are presented in this paper. It is shown that through V2G, EVs can support better operation of smartgrids in terms of reliability and storage. In order to achieve these, the components of smartgrids shall communicate and share information via communication lines. Having a universal communication standard is vital for implementing the plug-and-play concept in smartgrids. IEC 61850, the substation automation standard, could be used for this purpose. However, it is insufficient and must be expanded to cover missing links.

Metronidazole is currently the first-line treatment for mild to moderate C. difficile diarrhea however recurrence occurs at rates of 15-35%. There are few reports of C. difficile metronidazole resistance in the literature, and when observed, the phenotype has been transient and lost after storage or exposure of the bacteria to freeze/thaw cycles. Owing to the unstable nature of the resistance phenotype in the laboratory, clinical significance and understanding of the resistance mechanisms is lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings: Genotypic and phenotypic characterization was performed on a metronidazole resistant clinical isolate of C. difficile. Whole-genome sequencing was used to identify potential genetic contributions to the phenotypic variation observed with molecular and bacteriological techniques. Phenotypic observations of the metronidazole resistant strain revealed aberrant growth in broth and elongated cell morphology relative to a metronidazole-susceptible, wild type NAP1 strain. Comparative genomic analysis revealed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level variation within genes affecting core metabolic pathways such as electron transport, iron utilization and energy production. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first characterization of stable, metronidazole resistance in a C. difficile isolate. The study provides an in-depth genomic and phenotypic analysis of this strain and provides a foundation for future studies to elucidate mechanisms conferring metronidazole resistance in C. difficile that have not been previously described. © 2013 Lynch et al.",,"clindamycin; metronidazole; moxifloxacin; rifampicin; tigecycline; vancomycin; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; article; bacterial cell; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterium isolation; cell structure; Clostridium difficile; Clostridium difficile infection; electron transport; energy yield; gene sequence; genetic variability; genomics; genotype; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phenotypic variation; single nucleotide polymorphism; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Clostridium difficile; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Drug Resistance, Multiple; Genomics; Humans; Metronidazole; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Clostridium difficile; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872549775

One factor that may explain this relationship is visceral adiposity, which is prospectively associated with increased cardiometabolic risk and mortality. The objective of the present study was to determine whether sedentary behaviour was associated with increased accumulation of visceral fat or other deleterious changes in cardiometabolic risk over a 6-year follow-up period among adult participants in the Quebec Family Study. Methods: The current study included 123 men and 153 women between the ages of 18 and 65. Total sedentary time and physical activity were assessed by self-report questionnaire. Cross-sectional areas of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue were assessed using computed tomography. Cardiometabolic biomarkers including fasting insulin, glucose, blood lipids, HOMA-Insulin Resistance, and oral glucose tolerance were also measured. All variables of interest were collected at both baseline and follow-up. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, baseline BMI, physical activity, energy intake, smoking, education, income and menopausal status, baseline sedentary behaviour was not associated with changes in visceral adiposity or any other marker of cardiometabolic risk. In the longitudinal model which adjusted for all studied covariates, every 15-minute increase in sedentary behaviour from baseline to follow-up was associated with a 0.13 cm increase in waist circumference (95% CI = 0.02, 0.25). However, there was no association between changes in sedentary behaviour and changes in visceral adiposity or other markers of cardiometabolic risk. Conclusion: These results suggest that neither baseline sedentary behaviour nor changes in sedentary behaviour are associated with longitudinal changes in visceral adiposity in adult men and women. With the exception of waist circumference, the present study did not find evidence of a relationship between sedentary behaviour and any marker of cardiometabolic risk in this population. © 2013 Saunders et al.",,"glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; abdominal subcutaneous fat; adult; age; aged; article; body mass; caloric intake; Canada; cardiometabolic risk; computer assisted tomography; educational status; female; follow up; glucose blood level; human; income; insulin resistance; intraabdominal fat; lipid blood level; lipid storage; longitudinal study; male; menopause; oral glucose tolerance test; outcome assessment; physical activity; risk assessment; sedentary lifestyle; self report; sex; smoking; waist circumference; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Biological Markers; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Humans; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Quebec; Risk Factors; Sedentary Lifestyle; Subcutaneous Fat, Abdominal; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872177981

SEM and FT-IR techniques and TGA and DSC analysis are used for characterization of material and thermal properties. The composite PCM contained 48.3 wt.% of paraffin without leakage of melted PCM and therefore this composite found to be a form-stable composite PCM. SEM results indicate that the paraffin bounded into the pores of GO. FT-IR analysis showed there was no chemical reaction between paraffin and GO. Temperatures of melting and freezing and latent heats of the composite were 53.57 and 44.59 °C and 63.76 and 64.89 kJ/kg, respectively. Thermal cycling tests were done by 2500 melting/freezing cycling for verification of the form-stable composite PCM in terms of thermal reliability and chemical stability. Thermal conductivity of the composite PCM was highly improved from 0.305 to 0.985 (W/mk). As a result, the prepared paraffin/GO composite is appropriate PCM for thermal energy storage applications because of their acceptable thermal properties, good thermal reliability, chemical stability and thermal conductivities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The main focus of this study was on the use of scintillometry to determine the turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat. A novel approach is utilized for identifying periods where the scintillometry measurement footprint extends beyond the water surface. This approach relies on comparison of 'inferred' water surface temperature and measured skin temperature. The 'inferred' temperature is an independent assessment of water skin temperature derived through rearrangement of key equations in the scintillometry calculation scheme. An extensive dataset is used to investigate the processes controlling heat and vapour fluxes and to develop simple relationships that can be used for reliable predictions. These relationships are used to fill missing measurements in the dataset and to construct a complete energy balance for an 18 month period. The long-term data set is used to describe the diurnal, seasonal and annual variations in energy fluxes and to explore issues related to energy balance closure. Average energy balance closure across the study was 82%, however closure was much better during the winter than the summer. The key factors likely to lead to errors in energy balance closure are considered and it is concluded that the most likely causes are underestimation of latent heat fluxes, advection of energy that is not measured by the scintillometer, or overestimation of net radiation. © 2012.","Energy budget; Evaporation; Latent heat flux; Scintillometer; Sensible heat flux","advection; annual variation; energy balance; energy flux; flux measurement; footprint; irrigation; latent heat flux; net radiation; seasonal variation; sensible heat flux; surface temperature; turbulent flow; water storage; water temperature; Australia; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867049961

The optimal capacitance for charging was found to be ∼0.01 F for each MFC.

Compared with a P(VDF-TrFE) film with a similar overall thickness, the idealized nanotube array has a theoretical capacitance that is 763 times larger due to the greatly enlarged contact area between the electrodes and the polymer dielectric.

This is a crucial matter in realizing compact and robust converters without use of bulky and sensitive electrolytic capacitors. Nonoptimum dynamic response results in undesired interruptions of the maximum power point tracking and reduction of the overall efficiency of the system. Common practice is to select a large dc-bus size in order to reduce the double-frequency ripples that cause harmonics and to slow down the dynamic response to avoid large fluctuations on the bus caused by random input power jumps. This paper shows that both problems can be addressed to a great extent by improving the control system and without need to excessively increase the size of the bus component. This paper proposes a control system to achieve these goals and provides an analytical design method to optimize both dynamic response and output current harmonics. The proposed method succeeds to reduce the size of bus component several times without compromising the system performance.

The presence, intensity and pattern of the Cherenkov light can be used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to verify that the fuel properties comply with declarations. The DCVD is since several years approved by the IAEA for gross defect verification, i.e. to control whether an item in a storage pool is a nuclear fuel assembly or a non-fuel item [1]. Recently, it has also been endorsed as a tool for partial defect verification, i.e. to identify if a fraction of the fuel rods in an assembly have been removed or replaced. The latter recognition was based on investigations of experimental studies on authentic fuel assemblies and of simulation studies on hypothetic cases of partial defects [2]. This paper describes the simulation methodology and software which was used in the partial defect capability evaluations. The developed simulation procedure uses three stand-alone software packages: the ORIGEN-ARP code [3] used to obtain the gamma-ray spectrum from the fission products in the fuel, the Monte Carlo toolkit Geant4 [4] for simulating the gamma-ray transport in and around the fuel and the emission of Cherenkov light, and the ray-tracing programme Zemax [5] used to model the light transport through the assembly geometry to the DCVD and to mimic the behaviour of its lens system. Furthermore, the software allows for detailed information from the plant operator on power and/or burnup distributions to be taken into account to enhance the authenticity of the simulated images. To demonstrate the results of the combined software packages, simulated and measured DCVD images are presented.

Dehydrogenation of the molecule starts from the five-membered ring by weakening the axial C-H bonds adjacent to the N atom. In the adsorption mode identified for dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole, the five-membered ring was located on a hollow site and the axial H atoms adjacent to N were positioned atop Pd atoms with an adsorption energy of -95 kJ/mol. The two axial C-H bonds of the five-membered ring showed a large increase in bond distance upon adsorption, from 1.10 to 1.16 Å, that was responsible for the weakening of these bonds. The adsorption mode for dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole explained the product distribution obtained from the dehydrogenation reaction with octahydro-N-ethylcarbazole and tetrahydro-N-ethylcarbazole identified as primary and secondary products, respectively. DFT was also used to investigate the structure sensitivity of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole dehydrogenation observed on Pd catalysts. The effect of the ethyl group and N atom on the rate of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole dehydrogenation was also investigated by comparing the adsorption energies of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole with two other H2 storage candidates, dodecahydrocarbazole and dodecahydrofluorene. The latter compounds had much slower H2 recovery rates, a consequence of the strong adsorption of these compounds relative to dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption energies; Adsorption modes; Bond distance; C-H bond; Dehydrogenation reactions; Density functional theories (DFT); Ethyl groups; Five-membered rings; Hollow sites; Pd atoms; Pd catalyst; Product distributions; Recovery rate; Secondary product; Structure sensitivity; Atoms; Catalyst supports; Dehydrogenation; Density functional theory; Adsorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872398384

Moreover, the rapid development of power electronics technologies has even realized high energy-efficient vehicles. EV could be the alternative to decrease the global green house gases emission as the energy consumption in the world transportation is high. However, EV faces huge challenges in battery cost since one-third of the EV cost lies on battery. This paper reviews state-of-the-art of the energy sources, storage devices, power converters, low-level control energy management strategies and high supervisor control algorithms used in EV. The comparison on advantages and disadvantages of vehicle technology is highlighted. In addition, the standards and patterns of drive cycles for EV are also outlined. The advancement of power electronics and power processors has enabled sophisticated controls (low-level and high supervisory algorithms) to be implemented in EV to achieve optimum performance as well as the realization of fast-charging stations. The rapid growth of EV has led to the integration of alternative resources to the utility grid and hence smart grid control plays an important role in managing the demand. The awareness of environmental issue and fuel crisis has brought up the sales of EV worldwide. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Drive cycle; Electric vehicle; Energy management; Hybrid electric vehicle; Optimization; Supervisory control","Battery cost; Drive cycles; Electronics technology; Energy efficient; Energy management system; Energy source; Environmental issues; Low level control; Optimum performance; Power processors; Rapid growth; Smart grid; Supervisor control; Supervisory control; Utility grids; Vehicle technology; Algorithms; Energy management; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Optimization; Power electronics; Transportation; Virtual storage; Electric vehicles",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871785266

In this model, objects with more impact on the layout are able to obtain and reserve their optimum locations even if they arrive to the construction site in later stages. The model allocates space to objects only for the duration they are required on the site, and accordingly, it enables a realistic representation of space availability on the site and allows the reuse of space over the time.

Ten different process configurations are simulated using a combination of Aspen Plus 2006.5 and MATLAB tools. It was found that the addition of CAES to an SOFC plant provided significant load-following capabilities with relatively small penalties to efficiencies (1.1%HHV) and levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) (0.08-0.3 ¢ kW -1 h-1). The load-following capabilities of the CAES-enabled plants, as measured by proposed squared-error based metrics, were excellent and were not impacted by the addition of CCS. CCS-enabled configurations using SOFCs with and without CAES are able to reduce direct CO2 emissions to essentially zero. The introduction of a seasonal, partial power train shutdown schedule, while useful for maintenance and cleaning purposes, also reduces fuel consumption by 9.5% with very small penalties to the overall load-following performance of the SOFC/CAES plant. Although SOFCs are perhaps decades away from being implemented on the scale discussed in this study, the forward-looking energy conversion strategy proposed in this work shows promise for providing future carbon-free peaking power. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Thus, to understand the effects of variations in surface melt on ice sheet dynamics it is necessary to understand the surface hydrology. We have used satellite imagery, acquired at 5-day intervals, to map lake initiation and cessation on two sub-sections on the south west Greenland Ice Sheet over three melt seasons (2007-2009). We observe that lake initiation is closely tied to a threshold energy input of approximately 40 ± 18.5 positive-degree-days. This applies to all studied melt seasons, regardless of evolution and melting index anomalies. Lake longevity averages 24. days with little variation between different melt seasons. Our observed median lake area is larger than previously reported. Approximately 50% of all lakes have a life span of <10. d. Cessation of identified lakes is caused by two processes: drainage during the melt season (88% - 2007, 78% - 2008 and 88% - 2009) and freeze-up at the end of the season (12% - 2007, 22% - 2008 and 12% - 2009).

A temperature modulating scheme is introduced to the solar-thermal system that supplies feed seawater to the DCMD modules. This scheme attenuates extreme temperature fluctuations of the feed water by storing the collected energy during solar-peak hours and reutilizing it throughout the day. Thus, the energy savings is realized yet the feed seawater temperature is maintained within the desired range. Additionally, the system employs heat recovery from the permeate and brine streams to the feed seawater. The simulations for such a system with a shell-and-tube type DCMD modules are carried out to examine the spatial property variations and the sensitivity of system performance (i.e., transmembrane pressure, permeate flux and performance ratio) to the operating conditions (inlet temperature and flow rate) and the fiber dimensions (fiber length and packing density). It is found that there are trade-offs between mean permeate flux and performance ratio with respect to permeate inlet temperature and flow rate and between total distillate production and performance ratio with respect to packing density. For the solar-assisted DCMD system having evacuated-tube collectors of 3360m2 with 160m3 seawater storage tanks and 50 DCMD modules, the annual solar fraction and the collector efficiency are found to be 77% and 53%, respectively, whilst the overall permeate production capacity is 31m3/day. The overall specific thermal energy consumption of the DCMD system with heat recovery is found to be 436kWh/m3 and it is about 43% lower as compared to the system without heat recovery. It is observed that the specific thermal energy consumption decreases significantly by 55% with increased collector area from 1983m2 to 3360m2 whereas the specific electrical energy consumption increases slightly by 16%. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Heat recovery (HR); Hollow fiber direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD); Modeling; Solar-assisted desalination; Temperature modulating (TM)","Direct contact membrane distillation; Electrical energy consumption; Energy recovery; Extreme temperatures; Feed water; Fiber dimensions; Fiber length; Inlet temperature; Operating condition; Packing density; Performance ratio; Permeate flux; Production capacity; Seawater temperature; Shell-and-tube; Solar fraction; Spatial properties; Storage tank; Transmembrane pressures; Desalination; Distillation equipment; Energy utilization; Flow rate; Models; Seawater; Sensitivity analysis; Tubes (components); Waste heat; Water filtration; Solar energy; sea water; article; desalination; direct contact membrane distillation; distillation; energy conservation; energy recovery; flow rate; performance; priority journal; solar assisted desalination; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871807392

In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient algorithm and its corresponding architecture to not only reduce the energy consumption but also further enhance the throughput of Montgomery modular multipliers. The proposed architecture is capable of bypassing the superfluous carry-save addition and register write operations, leading to less energy consumption and higher throughput. In addition, we also modify the barrel register full adder (BRFA) so that the gated clock design technique can be applied to significantly reduce the energy consumption of storage elements in BRFA.

To evaluate the cost-benefits, using a recently developed model (Ji, X.; Zhu, C. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 2012, 91, 40-59), this study predicts phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties of the system H2S-CO2-H 2O-NaCl under transportation and storage conditions and discusses potential effects of H2S on transportation and storage. The prediction shows that inclusion of H2S in CO2 streams may lead to two-phase flow. For H2S-CO2 mixtures, at a given temperature, the bubble and dew pressures decrease with increasing H 2S content, while the mass density increases at low pressures and decreases at high pressures. For the CO2-H2S-H 2O system, the total gas solubility increases while the mass density of the aqueous solution with dissolved gas decreases.

The PfSPZ Vaccine comprises whole live-attenuated cryopreserved sporozoites stored in liquid nitrogen (LN2) vapor phase (LNVP) below -140°C and would be distributed through a LNVP cold chain. The purpose of this study was to model LNVP cold chain distribution for the cryopreserved PfSPZ Vaccine in Tanzania, estimate the costs and compare these costs to those that would be incurred in distributing a 'conventional' malaria vaccine through the EPI. Capital and recurrent costs for storage, transportation, labor, energy usage and facilities were determined for the birth cohort in Tanzania over five years. Costs were calculated using WHO/UNESCO calculators. These were applied to a 2-8°C distribution model with national, regional, district, and health facility levels, and for the cryopreserved vaccine using a 'modified hub-and-spoke' (MH-S) LNVP distribution system comprising a central national store, peripheral health facilities and an intermediate district-level transhipment stop. Estimated costs per fully immunized child (FIC) were $ 6.11 for the LNVP-distributed cryopreserved vaccine where the LN2 is generated, and $ 6.04 with purchased LN2 (assuming US $ 1.00/L). The FIC costs for distributing a conventional vaccine using the four level 2-8°C cold chain were $ 6.10, and with a tariff distribution system as occurs in Tanzania the FIC cost was $ 5.53. The models, therefore, predicted little difference in 5-year distribution costs between the PfSPZ Vaccine distributed through a MH-S LNVP cold chain and a conventional vaccine distributed through the more traditional EPI system. A LNVP cold chain provides additional benefits through the use of durable dry shippers because no refrigerators, freezers or refrigerated trucks are required. Thus strain at the cold chain periphery, vaccine wastage from cold chain failures and the environmental impact of distribution would all be reduced. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cold chain; Distribution cost; Liquid nitrogen vapor phase; Malaria; Model; Vaccine","liquid nitrogen; malaria vaccine; article; cohort analysis; cold; cryopreservation; drug storage; energy cost; health care cost; health care facility; immunization; liquid nitrogen vapor phase cold chain; priority journal; Tanzania; traffic and transport; Cryopreservation; Drug Storage; Health Facilities; Malaria Vaccines; Nitrogen; Refrigeration; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871396047

Therefore, embedding absorber pipes within foundation and underground structures represent a great opportunity while it saves the cost of dedicated drillings for boreholes.

Therefore investigations of innovative and environmentally friendly ways to produce portable water are very much essential. Atmospheric water generators (AWGs) apply vapour compression refrigeration to extract water vapour from the surrounding air. They produce drinking quality water and they require moist air and electricity. The required electricity may be produced by solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. By using solar energy the environmental impacts of an AWG associated with electricity consumption could be substantially reduced. The availability of solar energy and high humidity of air coincide with the drinking water demand. As of today the performance characteristics of stand-alone solar PV powered AWG is unknown. To address this knowledge gap a simulation model of such system has been developed. The model focuses on an individual phenomenon such as solar radiation availability, solar PV electricity output, battery storage, moisture content in the air and heat and mass transfer at the vapour compression refrigeration. The aim of this paper is to present the transient model developed and the simulation results. Kasaragod district in the state of Kerala, India is selected as the study area. Drinking water availability is a major issue in this district during the months from February to early June. Daily climate variables like temperature, maximum and minimum relative humidity, wind speed and global solar radiation on horizontal plane and wind speed were obtained from a meteorological station located in Kasaragod. A simulation model has been developed in TRNSYS with the following components: PV modules, Batteries, Regulator, Inverter and Atmospheric Water Generator. By using the model developed the capacity of the AWG, the number PV modules, the capacity of the battery bank required were determined for minimum daily water production of 15 L. The water extraction efficiency of the AWG investigated varies between 5.4% and 9.3% for Kasaragod. The cooling CCOPs of the AWG investigated are between 4 and 5, which is better than conventional air-to-air heat pump. Based on the analysis it was concluded that the monthly average daily efficiency is strongly correlated to the monthly average relative humidity of the ambient air. The monthly average daily efficiency is defined as average of all the daily average efficiency for a month. The validation of the simulation model with experiments to enable practical system design optimisations, and the development of control algorithms to obtain better performance by using the validated model are recommended for the future studies. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Atmospheric water generator; Drinking water; Solar","Atmospheric humidity; Electric batteries; Environmental impact; Mass transfer; Operations research; Photovoltaic cells; Potable water; Refrigeration; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Wind; Atmospheric water; Electricity-consumption; Heat and mass transfer; Meteorological station; Modelling and simulations; Performance characteristics; Solar; Vapour compression refrigerations; Extraction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080948823

For thermal systems, the storage could be thermal energy storage at the generator or electrical storage at the generator or within the electrical network. With the proliferation of non-scheduled generation from renewable electrical energy sources such as there is an ever present need for enabling scheduled generation via the incorporation of energy storage; either as from directly coupled Thermal Energy Storage (TES) at the source or distributed Electrical Storage Systems (ESS) within the electrical network or grid. The aims of this paper are twofold: to review the existing and emergent storage technologies and to survey the most appropriate optimisation techniques in determining the storage size and the subsequent optimal operation of the system within the context of the Australian National Energy Market (NEM). Firstly, a review for storage technologies is performed to establish sources for indicative characterisations of energy density, storage containment, conversion efficiency, charge/discharge rates and associated costing. The survey of optimisation techniques is partitioned into those methods most appropriate for various time scales.

It supports diversification of supplies to reduce the reliance on rain-dependant sources. A study has been initiated by the Goyder Institute for Water Research in this regard, in particular to inform the identification of optimal mixes of water sources for metropolitan Adelaide. As part of this study an integrated system simulation model of metropolitan Adelaide's water system is being developed. This is to quantify supply implications and stormwater and wastewater discharges at defined points in the urban water system, when utilising different mixes of water sources, under both historical and future climatic conditions. This information is used to evaluate an objective function that aims at minimising life cycle cost of infrastructure, energy consumption and the potential impact on Adelaide's coastal waters, and maximising supply security, as part of a multi-objective optimisation based decision-support framework. The aim of the decision-support framework is to generate knowledge that can support the identification of the most cost-effective mix of fit-for-purpose water sources available to meet the needs of the community in metropolitan Adelaide, in an environmentally and financially sustainable manner. The sources to be considered are River Murray, surface water from Mount Lofty Ranges catchments, desalinated sea water, recycled wastewater, stormwater including roof water, ground water and the potable water savings through various demand management options. The objective of this paper is to describe the process followed to develop the simulation component of the combined simulation-optimisation approach. The modelling platform used to develop the simulation model is Source Integrated Modelling System (IMS), which is emerging as Australia's national hydrologic modelling platform for river basins. Hence it has not been applied widely yet, particularly for urban water systems. The study reported in this paper one of the first application of eWater Source to urban water systems. The application process has been an exploratory process where modelling methods have to be developed for the each water source considered in this study using the available functionalities. Also, there are modelling methods currently in place in most cities to inform planning and operation of each city's water supply system. In general, when a new modelling method is introduced, quantitative evidence is required to demonstrate the performance of the new methodology is comparable to that of the existing methodology. Thus the process to develop the simulation component of the simulation-optimisation approach was staged and comprised the development of firstly a Test Case, secondly a Base Case before developing the Scenario Cases. In this paper, we describe the Test Case and the Base Case. Development of Scenario Cases is in progress. The purpose of the Test Case is to examine the ability of the eWater Source to represent key features of metro Adelaide's water supply system, to an adequate level. The 'adequacy' was defined as the ability of eWater Source to generate outputs (e.g. pumping volumes and storage volumes) of a similar order of magnitude from an existing water supply planning and operation model that is currently used by the South Australian Water Corporation. The Base Case model represents the 'business as usual' scenario for supplying water from the three main drinking water supply sources for Adelaide, i.e. River Murray, Mount Lofty Ranges catchments and Adelaide Desalination Plant. The simulation is performed over 50 years, on a monthly basis. The optimisation time horizon is 25 years, from 2013. The simulation model is provided with functionalities using the Expression Editor capability in the eWater Source to evaluate the objective function, consisting of net present value of life cycle cost of infrastructure, energy consumption and the volumetric reliability of supply. Development of Scenario Cases is in progress, which will include adding the other sources mentioned above. The Scenario Cases will also provide information to minimise potential impact of wastewater and stormwater discharges to Adelaide's coastal waters. The results of the Test Case showed that eWater Source can adequately represent the existing water sources in Adelaide's water supply. The results of the Base Case showed that eWater Source can produce the expected behaviour of the supply system.

This paper presents an application of a methodology, based on diffusion modelling, for estimating the uptake of air conditioners and time-varying price tariffs from 2013 to 2033, with the case study of housing stock in Townsville Local Government Area (LGA). It integrates technologies in multi-criteria analysis and choice modelling, to better capture the sensitivity of different types of air conditioner and price tariff uptake across a landscape of heterogeneous consumers. Several variables were included in the modelling to characterise consumer preference of different air conditioners and tariffs: upfront cost (purchase price), annual cost (maintenance and running costs), household income, house age, visual appeal, convenience, comfort, familiarity and socioeconomic rating. The model makes possible a highly granular geographical and demographic analysis, allowing uptake trends to be assessed for each ABS Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) spatial unit of approximately 150 households, which Townsville LGA contains 431 residential SA1s. This provides a better understanding of the changes in peak demand across Ergon Energy electricity grid at scale of individual feeder. We show the base case along with sensitivity uptake to various electricity price scenarios. To set up the diffusion model, ABS 2011 census data was used to formulate a typology of location (SA1) by building type by demographic variables. For the application to air conditioners, the following options were considered, no air conditioner, ducted, 1 split system, 2 split system, 3 split system, 1 box air conditioner, 2 box, 3 box. Townsville is currently a saturated market with 76% of households having three or more air-conditioners (Queensland Household Energy Survey 2011). For the base case scenario there was a significant shift from box air conditioners to split systems and ducted systems from 2013 to 2033. The main changes were about a 53% drop in houses with 3 box air conditioners, with these households mostly moving to either 2 split systems or ducted. When testing the sensitivity of various electricity price scenarios, it had minimal impact on market share of each air conditioner option at 2033, though the high electricity price scenario led to a modest reduction in ducted air conditioners. For the application to time varying price tariffs, uptake of Tariff 33 increased to 81.7% by the end of 2033, up from 75% in 2013. The uptake of Tariff 12 and Tariff 33+12 was 0.64% and 2.19% respectively at 2033. Low uptake of the Tariff 12 scenarios was not surprising due to their minimal reduction in costs for detached housing and an increased annual electricity cost for semi-detached and apartment dwellings. When testing a scenario where the daily service fee for Tariff 12 was reduced to that of Tariff 11, this reduced the annual costs by $230/yr, and led to the uptake of Tariff 12 and Tariff 12+33 increasing to 0.82% and 2.81% respectively. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Choice Modelling; Multi Criteria Analysis","Commerce; Competition; Cost reduction; Diffusion; Domestic appliances; Electric utilities; Housing; Operations research; Population statistics; Surveys; Choice modelling; Consumer preferences; Demographic variables; Electricity distribution systems; Local government areas; Multi Criteria Analysis; Residential housings; Spatial diffusions; Air conditioning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080943979

As water becomes more precious, CWW has embarked on alternate water projects. Among them is the West Werribee Dual Water Supply Scheme (WWDWSS). CWW Engineering Department's Operations Research group built the Mass-Balance Model, MABAL to aid planning and to optimise the operating schedule of water schemes. An early simulation model has been replaced by a linear program to work around supply constraints. At the heart of MABAL, there are 3 models: ∙ Weather Forecasting: Statistical forecasts 28 days ahead ∙ Demand Forecasting: Uses weather data, customer numbers, time of year and other factors. ∙ Linear Programming: Optimises production, subject to supply constraints, to meet forecast demand. While WWDWSS is under construction, MABAL is being applied to the Ballan Road water supply in Werribee as a pilot. The pilot provides better control of tank levels and makes efficient use of the pump station in response to increasing energy cost. The pilot provides an opportunity to prove the robustness and accuracy of the models and establish communication infrastructure and protocols between the software and the external SCADA devices. The linear programming, helps to overcome the problem of variable demand and supply outages. As a result, scheduling can be optimised. This paper describes the water supply schemes, with focus on the optimization model, the factors that influence the supply and demand sides and the outcomes. To support the planning of the water supply scheme, MABAL allows the Engineer to define all of the components, the customers and their demand under different weather conditions and to model the operation over different periods. From these simulations the Engineer can change the settings to ensure that the water supply scheme is designed to avoid the need to add potable water to meet demand if the scheme is undersized. Also, to ensure that the scheme is not over-sized tying up valuable capital. Two configurations exist. One, GMABAL, allows water supply schemes ranging in complexity to be modeled for short periods of time. A second configuration, MABAL-LITE allows complex water supply schemes to be modeled for a much longer number of years while still achieving reasonable runtimes. MABAL has been used to assess the impact of an Aquifer to supplement the above ground storages for the WWDWSS. In particular to answer questions such as: When should above ground storages be doubled in capacity? Can the water supply scheme meet demand with just 2 salt reduction trains and if not when would I need to have a 3rd salt reduction train? MABAL has also been used to determine the impact of an extended Feedwater supply outage of 4 months requested by Melbourne Water. The development of the linear program model for MABAL has enabled CWW to realize the crucial planning issue of automated planning around future known events and quantity and quality constraints to produce a least cost operational schedule. City West Water has a tool that can be used to model proposed water and alternate water schemes. By running different scenarios through the model, water supply schemes can be planned to meet the critical issues of being configured to be the right-size and delivered at the right-time to balance supply and demand. Results of the analysis can be included in business cases seeking approval for proposed water supply schemes. Different techniques and levels of generalization can be used to limit or reduce run times to have models solve in business acceptable times. Operating water supply schemes have quite specific constraints that might be known when planning the scheme or they may be added as a consequence of restrictions imposed by external bodies when gaining approval to proceed with the water supply scheme. CWW has taken the view that operating water supply schemes will have customized models that best deal with each water supply scheme's individual requirements and so that acceptable solving times are achieved. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Forecasting; LINGO; Optimisation; Scheduling; Water","Aquifers; Economics; Forecasting; Linear programming; Meteorology; Operations research; Potable water; Scheduling; Water; Weather forecasting; Communication infrastructure; Engineering department; Increasing energy costs; Linear program models; LINGO; Melbourne , Australia; Optimisations; Optimization modeling; Water supply",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080877875

Wind power and photovoltaic panels are well-developed technologies now, and have achieved significant reductions in costs as their industries matured. Renewable energy can also be generated through large-scale solar thermal plants, whereby a field of solar collectors concentrate the sun's energy to heat a fluid that is then passed to a conventional steam generator. This technology is in a develop-mental stage, with the benefits from learning from experience with pilot plants, from mass production, and from innovation not yet obtained. The Australian Solar Thermal Research Initiative (ASTRI) is a federal government program to investigate technologies that will reduce the cost of electricity produced by concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. One aspect of the program is to develop a methodology to create a baseline economic model for the costs of typical CSP plants, and use this to assess the potential for cost reductions of research activities. Part of the methodology is the System Advisor Model (SAM) developed by an ASTRI partner, the U.S.'s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. SAM is an industry standard model for comparing the performance of solar thermal or photovoltaic plants. The analysis reported here, and the framework for the economic model for the ASTRI program, uses SAM and solar data from Longreach, Queensland. This paper reports on basic outcomes from the SAM model for two solar tower systems, one with storage and one without, comparing results mainly in terms of the levelised cost of electricity achieved by the plants. Standard settings for SAM are used, some of which are later systematically varied during sensitivity analysis on model inputs. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Concentrating solar power; Levelised cost of electricity; Sensitivity analysis","Cost reduction; Digital storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Operations research; Photovoltaic cells; Pilot plants; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Steam generators; Wind power; Concentrating solar power; Cost of electricity; Federal governments; Learning from experiences; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Renewable energy source; Research initiatives; Solar thermal plants; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080873602

Sharp spikes on the stocks return distribution have been linked to the presence of unusually high volatility signifying the presence of high levels of kurtosis. The accurate measurement of the stocks' underlying co-movements for more accurate CVaR portfolio optimization requires, therefore, the utilization of sophisticated and specific-specialized techniques which could adequately capture and model these characteristics. Here this issue is addressed by applying statistical-graphical models for dependence estimation. Twenty mining stocks, out of the 801 listed in the ASX as of December 2012, have been selected for the analysis under the criteria of satisfying the eight years trading period sought, having very weak or no autocorrelation of residuals and displaying the highest kurtosis. Models' estimations of dependence are compared and inserted into a differential evolution algorithm for non-convex global optimization in order to conduct risk controlled CVaR portfolio optimization (Ardia, Boudt, Carl, Mullen & Peterson, 2011) and be able to identify the one yielding the highest portfolio return. The findings are of relevance in portfolio allocation and portfolio risk management. Energy and mining stock markets are subjected to numerous price drivers holding complex relationships. The dynamics of production and consumption based on seasonality features, transportation and storage, weather conditions, commodity price fluctuations, currency changes, market confidence and expectations, trading speculations and the domestic and international states of the economy impact mining stock prices in particular and unobvious ways reflected in high volatility with sudden spikes in the stock's return distribution (Pilipovic, 1998). The generation of accurate measurements of the dependence matrix of mining stock's return series is therefore both, a non-trivial task due to the hard to decipher characteristics present in return series suffering from high levels of kurtosis (Carvalho, Lopes & Aguilar, 2010) and, a crucial element in portfolio optimization and portfolio risk management. The use of graphical techniques in this study is justified on the basis of their utility and suitableness. Graphical models such as pair c-vine copulas, the graphical lasso and adaptive graphical lasso provide, for instance, the visualization and flexibility to represent a problem in a more simplified and dissected form (Lauritzen, 1996). Graphs also appear to be naturally adequate to express the interaction of variables and thus facilitate the analysis of their dependency. The models of dependence estimation and CVaR portfolio optimization, on the other hand, are desirable due to mathematical and statistical framework they provide which may lead to satisfactory results and, their apparent ability to overcome the flaws (i.e. standardized model application to all joint distributions, restrictive and deterministic linear and monotonic modelling functions as in the Pearson and Spearman) traditional measures display when dealing with highly kurtotic data, joint distributions with stronger dependence in the tails and controlled risk non-convex portfolio optimization problems. Findings indicate that the highest portfolio returns are generated by inserting the covariance output matrix from the student-t copula into the differential optimization algorithm and, the student-t copula fitting with separate modelling of the marginal distributions appears to be the most desirable modelling choice. The portfolio return by the adaptive graphical lasso is lower than that of the student-t and is followed by the Gaussian pair c-vine copula. The regular graphical lasso produced the lowest portfolio return and the covariance matrix values were higher for models producing the highest portfolio returns implying that the models generating the lowest portfolio returns underestimated the dependence of the assets. The implications of the findings suggest that specific modelling of each marginal distribution, as compared to modelling based on a Gaussian framework, may lead to an edge in the estimations due to the distribution differences encountered on each marginal. Furthermore, the ability of the model to capture dependence in the tails, as it is the case of the student-t copula, does provide a modelling advantage too. This paper appears to be the first one in, comparing the portfolio performance of the models of dependence estimation in the context of controlled CVaR, applying the models treated to a highly kurtotic mining sample of stocks from the Australian market and modelling separately the distribution of the marginals when fitting the student-t copula. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Copula; CVaR; Dependence structure; Differential evolution; Mining stocks","Commerce; Costs; Covariance matrix; Digital storage; Electronic trading; Estimation; Evolutionary algorithms; Functions; Global optimization; Graphic methods; Higher order statistics; Operations research; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Students; Copula; CVaR; Dependence structures; Differential Evolution; Differential evolution algorithms; Non-convex global optimization; Portfolio risk management; Production and consumption; Financial markets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080871516

Adelaide, South Australia is one example where height restrictions in the central business district (CBD) were recently lifted to allow for a projected increase in urban population. The city provides a unique study area for the analysis of the urban induced heat variation. The main CBD is small compared to most cities around the world. The CBD covers only four square kilometres and is surrounded by a 500 metre wide parkland belt with sparse vegetation. Adelaide's temperature distribution has been monitored by twenty temperature sensors in the CBD and parklands since winter 2010. The observations exhibit a maximum temperature difference between the CBD and parklands of 6°C; with an average of 1.5°C. The maximum temperature difference occurs around sunrise and the winter UHI effect is more marked than in summer. Using a sky view factor which includes information of the wind (effective sky view factor, ESVF), the change in temperature depending on the height variation is in excess of 1°C. This, in connection with a projected temperature increase due to climate change, has major implications to energy use and carbon emissions in the future. A micro-scale urban model (ENVI-Met) has been employed to study the influence of building height on the surrounding UHI effect. The modeling of a simple street canyon displays the relation between building height and street width and hence confirms the results exhibited by the effective sky view factor. However, the simple street canyon simulations with ENVI-Met show that when building height reaches street width, the increase in temperature at street level stops and even reverses for higher building heights. The model may lack significant processes (e.g. heat transfer between inside and outside of the buildings). Observations show that shading of surface area and heat storage processes in the walls are important contributions to the atmospheric temperature. ENVI-Met Version 3.1 does not include heat storage in building walls. Heat transport between inside and outside of buildings is treated as an in situ process. This missing process is a possible explanation in the reversal of the diurnal temperature change in the simple cases when building height reaches street width. It is also likely the reason that a lower average temperature is modeled in a complex city setting when double building height is simulated and compared to the control case. Further investigation of the atmospheric processes and their effect on the near surface temperature is needed. Modeling here is still in progress and further simulations, especially for the complex Adelaide CBD, cases are necessary. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Energy balance; Micro-scale modeling; Surface characteristics; Urban heat island","Climate change; Energy balance; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Operations research; Urban growth; Walls (structural partitions); Central business districts; Diurnal temperatures; Maximum temperature differences; Micro scale models; Near surface temperature; Surface characteristics; Urban heat island; Urban Heat Island Effects; Atmospheric temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080864561

The purpose of this study was to simulate the seismic response of the BCS after injecting 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 during a one-year period of injection. This was done using Gassmann fluid substitution and seismic forward modeling. A geological model for the baseline scenario was generated based on logs from well SCL-8-19-59-20W4. For the monitor case, Gassmann fluid substitution modeling was undertaken to model a CO2 plume within BCS. Numerical stack sections for both scenarios were obtained and subtracted to study the change in the seismic response after injecting CO2. The difference section shows the location and the spatial distribution of the plume. Based on these results the CO2 plume could be detected in the seismic data after a year of injection, providing the data have good bandwidth and a high signal-to-noise ratio. © 2013 SEG SEG Houston 2013 Annual Meeting.",,"Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Geophysical prospecting; Seismic response; Signal to noise ratio; Cambrian sandstone; Deep saline aquifers; Detectability; Fluid substitution; Geological modeling; High signal-to-noise ratio; Seismic forward modeling; Time-lapse analysis; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058114895

The excess energy stored in adipose tissue plays a major role in the maintenance of whole-body energy homeostasis. It is well established that adipose tissues not only serve as inert energy storage depots but also secrete a number of signaling factors into the circulation, such as C-reactive protein, leptin, resistin, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), and others (Rajala and Scherer 2003). These factors are believed to be involved in the development of insulin resistance. Another such signaling factor, retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4), a protein whose only function was thought to be the delivery of retinol (vitamin A) to tissues, was recently implicated as an adipokine in insulin resistance (Yang et al. 2005).

The nanomaterials and exotic materials, which are explored in this quest, provide insulating and conducting properties in nanosensors, nanounits and nanocircuits as well as advanced energy transfer and storage properties. Many solutions involve the use of metal alloys including rare and expensive metals (Gold, Platinum, Silver, Cerium and Europium) and evolve around the special energetic properties of crystals and their conductive characters. Many of these metals, such as Cadmium and Gallium-Arsenide, imply though toxicity issues and severe environmental hazards. Carbon clusters and carbon chains are on the other hand inexpensive, poorly - if not, nontoxic and have electronic properties with direct relevance to develop green nanocircuits and nanomaterials. Arranged in a specific and polymerized manner, carbon atoms can satisfy the 4n/4n+2 π-electron localization/delocalization rule, which has the potential to be the basis for semiconducting or conducting nanowires. With their hybrid electronic potential, carbon-based organic polymers with 4n/4n+2 resonance can thus give unique tunable electronic properties. At the same time, these molecular ensembles have the potential to be both recyclable and biodegradable, and when encapsulated in carbon nanotubes, be physically elastic compared to metal-based nanowires and potentially provide appealing band-gap effects.

The overarching development concept is a precinct solution at Edge Of Grid and electricity distribution utility has confirmed that NSI qualifies as such irrespective of proximity to Brisbane (population 2,146,577 in 2011). North Stradbroke Island is adjacent to the Gold Coast boasting 300 sunny days a year yet where the wind regime is rarely Roaring 40s strength. Resort occupancies on NSI are highly seasonal so behind-the-meter energy efficiency improvements and solar PV / energy storage installation is restricted to ""below firm load"" in the current regulatory environment. A recent regulatory study by an electricity distribution utility at external examples of Edge Of Grid shows there is a local community level benefit for meeting the firm load of a community before Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) actually needs to be considered, that is no export from zone transformers. But integration of many energy storage and renewable generation units into a distribution network substation at NSI possibly will have significant implications for means of peak demand management, the coordination 110/11kV Tap Changers, effective fault level for safe protection operation and commissioning tests of the coordinated system, because the required control system differs radically from previous schemes (shedding hot water loads, etc.). Distribution Zone Substation refurbishment project and a project to proactively solve Emerging Distribution Network Limitations is an archetypal capital deferral for electricity distribution utilities. These two projects de-constrain and de-risk the distribution network for major energy investment streams on the other side of distribution network connection points. The latter of these projects requires an Integrated Volt/VAR Control (VVC) Decentralized with Distributed Power System Auto-Control solution. A Circuit Reconfiguration Controller associated with VVC control area is needed for rapid fault location, isolation and supply restoration scenario and its implementation using IEC 61499 function blocks. One major investment stream is MW class solar PV facilities that may be located in areas that fit in with a very large protected area (80% of NSI) to become National Park by 2027 and could generate enough electricity to power nearly 900 homes on the Island. These developments are for Independent Power Producers (IPP) interested in the grid-connected supply of electricity generated by renewable energy under a long-term PPA. Thus, distribution network constraints on the corridor back to transmission substation may possibly lead to a runback scheme, thereby potentially increasing dimensions of technical issues. This paper studies potential technical issues associated with the integration of a multi-renewable Ethernet-based sustainable energy system on the consumer-side and within a conventional distribution network that has traditional distribution network constraints. © 2013 CIGRE.

Specifically, this new law introduced new rules for the transportation and storage activities as well as for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals. Regarding gas pipelines for natural gas transportation, the ""Gas Act"" determined that the construction and operation of these facilities should be conceded by the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) or (in some cases) authorized by the Brazilian National Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels Agency (ANP), with regulated tariffs and open access for third parties. For gas storage, the activity is conceded by the MME if carried on in oil/gas reservoirs returned to the Brazilian Union or in non-producing hydrocarbon geological structures. On the other hand, if the gas is stored in any other facility, then it is authorized by ANP and, in that last case, the operator is not obliged to grant access, which is not also obligatory to LNG terminals. For these LNG terminals, the Decree n° 7,382/2010 noticed that it was necessary to establish a border between its gas pipelines (for regasified gas), and the transport natural gas pipelines (or gas transportation network) to which LNG terminals usually connect. In order to do it, the Decree's article 16 determined that the gas pipelines started in LNG terminals and interconnected to the transport network which is not part of the terminal shall be considered as transport gas pipelines and ANP should define which gas pipelines are part of the LNG terminals through specific regulation (sole paragraph of article 16). These determinations were important because LNG terminals (and its gas pipelines) regulatory aspects differ a lot from those concerning transport gas pipelines. For example, as it was mentioned before, access is not obliged for LNG terminals (and it applies for all of its facilities, including its pipelines), but it is mandatory for transportation gas pipelines. Different kinds of regulations also exist between transportation pipelines and storage facilities so that a similar border should be considered between natural gas storage facilities (and its pipelines) and transportation gas pipelines. Hence, the main purposes of this article is to discuss and propose the establishment of a regulatory framework, that could involve both ANP and MME, to determine which gas pipelines are part of the storage facilities and, hence, under the same rules established for them. For this study, it will be considered the philosophy of the ANP Order n° 50/2011, that determined the conditions and characteristics that shall be taken into consideration to define what pipeline(s) is(are) part(s) of the LNG terminal. Finally, the results of this job shall be completely in line with Law n° 11,909/2009, specially its definition for ""transportation gas pipeline"", the Decree n° 7,382/2010 and the typical characteristics and functions of storage's surface facilities. © 2013, Brazilian Petroleum, Gas and Biofuels Institute - IBP.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044664914

As a matter of fact, these properties make biomass preparation and conversion to electricity expensive. Moreover, biomass can absorb moisture during storage and may rot as well. These properties have negative impacts during energy conversion such as lower combustion and electricity generation efficiencies. Therefore, enhancement of biomass properties is advisable not only to improve its inferior characteristics, but also to make it a suitable alternative to fossil fuels.

Several measures applied in the last years aiming to reduce the greenhouse gas emission of Switzertand (target is 20% less in 2020 than 1990) were already able to stabilize the total national output at a level of 1990. The new proposal to exit at the same time from nuclear energy to supply electric power, poses however, new challenges to meet these objectives. If gas-fired power generation is chosen as bridge to a fully renewable energy supply system of the future, the CCS technology might be an interesting option to compensate for the additional greenhouse gas emissions. In 2010 a first study demonstrated that several saline aquifers in the Swiss Molasse Basin have a combined theoretical storage capacity of-2,700 million tons of C02. Although these estimates are based on a rather sparse data set, they indicate substantial potential that merits further investigations. Recently the CARMA research project presented a roadmap for a CCS pilot test that has the objective to demonstrate that CO2can be permanently stored in a safe way in the Swiss subsurface and that CCS is an economic option on the way to a renewable energy era.","Aquifer; C02; Capture; Carbon; Energy strategy; Greenhouse gas emission; Mesozoic; Monitoring; Paleozoic; Pilot injection test; Sequestration; Storage; Switzerland","Aquifers; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Energy management; Energy storage; Gas emissions; Geochronology; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Monitoring; Capture; Energy strategy; Mesozoic; Paleozoic; Pilot injection; Sequestration; Switzerland; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019748022

The purpose of this study was to simulate the seismic response of the BCS after injecting 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 during a one-year period of injection. This was done using Gassmann fluid substitution and seismic forward modeling. A geological model for the baseline scenario was generated based on logs from well SCL-8-19-59-20W4. For the monitor case, Gassmann fluid substitution modeling was undertaken to model a CO2 plume within BCS. Numerical stack sections for both scenarios were obtained and subtracted to study the change in the seismic response after injecting CO2. The difference section shows the location and the spatial distribution of the plume. Based on these results the CO2 plume could be detected in the seismic data after a year of injection, providing the data have good bandwidth and a high signalto- noise ratio. © 2013 SEG.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018988830

The facility provides low energy radioactive beams and post-accelerated beams. In the last 45 years the ISOLDE facility has gathered unique expertise in research with radioactive beams. Over 700 isotopes of more than 70 elements have been used in a wide range of research domains, including cutting edge studies in nuclear structure, atomic physics, nuclear astrophysics, and fundamental interactions. These nuclear probes are also used to do frontier research in solid state and life sciences. There is an on-going upgrade of the facility, the HIE-ISOLDE project, which aims to improve the ISOLDE capabilities in a wide front, from an energy increase of the post-accelerated beam to improvements in beam quality and beam purity. The first phase of HIE-ISOLDE will start for physics in the autumn of 2015 with an upgrade of energy for all post-accelerated ISOLDE beams up to 5.5 MeV/u, the second phase will increase the energy until 10 MeV/u. Plans exist of complementing the facility with a highly performing Storage Ring, TSR presently at Heidelberg in Germany. The addition of the TSR will allow the beams from HIE-ISOLDE to be stored and cooled, providing much greater luminosity and much better beam definition.

Results show that TiO2 addition changes the wettability and electrical resistance of the electrode surface. The water contact angle on the electrode surface decreases with increased weight percentage of TiO2 particles in the electrode. The electrochemical performance of these electrodes with different loading amounts is studied by cyclic voltammetry and single-cell charge-discharge measurements. Adding an adequate amount of TiO2 particles to the carbon electrode promotes the electrode specific capacitance and charge-discharge efficiency of a single cell. An electrode with 20 wt% TiO2 loading at a scan rate of 0.04 V s-1 shows a high specific capacitance (Cs,t) of 156.2 F g-1, which is 59.1% higher than that of pure carbon electrode (98.2 F g-1).

The state-space averaging is widely used for modeling and analysis of DC-DC converters however the transformer series inductance current in PSM converters is an ac state and conventional cycle-averaging techniques will result in the removal of this state and its effects. The previously proposed techniques either simply remove this state and get a reduced order model or are too complex to be applied in many cases. The proposed method gives an effective and straightforward full order modeling technique even for converters with higher order containing more energy storage elements like half bridges or the converters with hybrid modulation techniques where duty cycle is not fixed at 50%. The large signal and small signal state space presentations are parametrically derived and presented. The large signal model order is reduced without loss of information using derived matrix properties. Analysis results are compared with a precisely simulated converter.

A large number of magnet and cable prototypes have been constructed, showing in all cases high reliability. Large projects involving the construction of magnets, solenoids as well as dipoles and quadrupoles are described in the present book. A very large project, the LHC, is currently in operation, demonstrating that superconductivity is a reliable technology, even in a device of unprecedented high complexity. A project of similar complexity is ITER, a fusion device that is presently under construction. This article starts with a brief historical introduction to superconductivity as a phenomenon, and some fundamental properties necessary for the understanding of the technical behavior of superconductors are described. The introduction of superconductivity in the industrial cycle faces many challenges, first for the properties of the base elements, e.g. the wires, tapes and thin films, then for the various applied devices, where a number of new difficulties had to be resolved.

Electrical power is not easily stored so the generation of power ideally would match demand. The amount of energy provided by wind, (and solar power) is determined by natural events which makes matching supply and demand very difficult. Wind speed data has been used in the past to assist with the prediction of power generation, but it is not a satisfactory predictor. There have been numerous attempts to identify the characteristics of wind speed time series data and it has been found in previous studies that they exhibit long term dependence. Methods of analyzing wind speed and power output time series data have included traditional time series analyses such as ARMA and GARCH as well as the relatively new methods of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and more recently multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA). This study extends these latter methods to examine the variation of output that is inherent in wind generated power. Almost all chaotic systems can be characterized by a fractal dimension. The fractal dimension of an object is a measurement of a non-integer dimension which represents the degree of persistence, also known as scale or self similarity, embedded in the series. The history of the Fractal Dimension Index (FDI) begins with the British dam builder and hydrologist H.E. Hurst, in 1951. He worked on the Nile River Dam Project searching for patterns in the Nile delta to solve problems related to the storage capacity of the dam reservoir. Most hydrologists assumed that water inflow was a random process with no underlying order. After studying almost a millennium of Nile overflows Hurst found that large overflows tend to be followed by large overflows most of the time. There appeared to be cycles, but their lengths were non-periodic. Standard statistical analysis revealed no patterns between observations, but the concept of persistence was raised. Hurst divided the Nile data into time segments and examined the variance of each segment in comparison with the number of total segments. The process is called re-scaled range analysis. Using this analysis Hurst showed that overflows tended to repeat, meaning that the natural overflows were partially predictable. Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, used the Hurst exponent to experiment with time series found in nature. This led to his development of a method to measure the irregularity in natural objects. He named the measurement the Fractal Dimension Index. The development of fractal geometry in recent times has provided a means of characterizing a range of complex structures using the concept of the fractal dimension. The fractal dimension, which is not necessarily an integer, reflects the scale symmetry of random structures which include time series, and is measured by the Fractal Dimension Index (FDI). Scale symmetry refers to the self similarity patterns observed on different time scales, and a single scaling exponent characterizes the structure. The FDI determines the volatility, which is the unexpected event of extremity, of a given time series. This specialized indicator identifies the Fractal Dimension of the series by using re-scaled range analysis and an estimated Hurst exponent. This has been used by researchers to determine the persistence or anti-persistence of a series. Previous studies have found that the wind farms in South Australia have some spatial correlation, but that it is not sufficient to be able to aggregate analyses into more than one farm. The farms are thus analysed individually, to assess the degree of persistence in the data for five minute time intervals. The results show that there is evidence of persistence in some of the wind farm time series data under study. This paper describes the application of the MFDFA technique to a set of wind farms located in South Australia. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Electricity generation; Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis; Prediction; Wind farms","Chaotic systems; Digital storage; Economics; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Fractal dimension; Helium; Operations research; Random processes; Reservoirs (water); Solar energy; Time series; Wind; Wind power; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Electricity generation; Multifractal analysis; Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis; Spatial correlations; Standard statistical analysis; Wind farm; Wind speed time series; Time series analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962521373

The GAB provides a vital water resource for rural semiarid communities and also contains the largest onshore oil and gas reserves in Australia. The GAB is composed of alternating layers of water-bearing permeable sandstone and non-water-bearing impermeable shale. These geological formations have an immense influence on the chemical composition of GAB groundwaters, which can be bicarbonate-, chloride, sulphate or iron rich. The depth of the aquifer is estimated to be 3,000 m, and the underground water flow from the recharge areas at the edge of the basin to the discharge areas in central Australia as mound springs is estimated to be 1–5 million year. The water is heated by the Earths magma due to its depth, and the age of the water is calculated to be over 2 Ma. Not only do more than 5,000 free-flowing bores, with source temperatures ranging between 100 and 30°C, depending on bore depth, provide an important water resource to the outback communities, but the GAB is also a favourable environment for the growth of a wide diversity of microbial life. Distinct thriving macroscopic microbial mat communities can be seen colonising specific temperatures along the temperature gradient of runoff channels formed by the free-flowing bores. In the last two decades, a range of thermophilic and mesophilic microorganisms have been characterised from the GAB waters which include sulphate reducers, carbohydrate fermenters, strict aerobes and dissimilatory metal-reducing microorganisms (DIRM). During recent years, there has been a significant drop in the GAB groundwater pressure and volume, largely due to water leakage from corroding bores, and this is a matter of great concern. The isolation of metal-reducing microorganisms from the GAB environment suggests that they could be colonising the metal casing of such bores, thereby contributing to bore corrosion and subsequent complete bore failure. It is widely accepted that metal-reducing microorganisms have a large impact on the geochemistry of subsurface environments through the cycling of metals and organic matter and thereby affect water quality and taste. Furthermore, metal-reducing microorganisms have potential applications in bioremediation, mineral leaching and energy generation processes and are of evolutionary interest as metal reduction is considered to be a very ancient form of respiration. In this report, we provide an insight into the microbial diversity of this unique subsurface aquifer. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","Aquifer; Bioremediation; Great Artesian Basin; Metal leaching; Metal-reducing microorganisms","Aquifers; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Chlorine compounds; Corrosion; Flow of water; Groundwater geochemistry; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Leaching; Leakage (fluid); Metals; Microorganisms; Proven reserves; Sulfur compounds; Water quality; Artesian; Australian continents; Chemical compositions; Geological formation; Metal leaching; Subsurface environment; Underground water flow; Water storage capacity; Recharging (underground waters)",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956511099

Among the TES systems, the hot well of the aquifer TES has maximum energy and exergy efficiency values of 94.12 % and 88.78 % at a dead state temperature of 8 °C. Furthermore, the most sustainable TES system is found to be the aquifer TES.

Nanotribology was stimulated by the fabrication of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). With the advent of scanning force microscopy (SPM), experimental approach to nanotribological regimes has been substantially advanced. Most common examples of nanotribological phenomena are in hard disk drives, MEMS, and nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS). Tribology is a surface phenomenon, which can be significantly affected by a very high surface-to-volume ratio in a micro or nanostructure. Small mass, light load, elastic deformation, and slight wear or absence of wear are typical of nanotribology. It has been widely perceived that various tribological test conditions, such as load, velocity, temperature, surface free energy, surface topography, environment, etc. play major roles in nanotribology. The experimental study of nanotribology is made possible by using surface force apparatus (SFA), atomic force microscope (AFM), friction force microscope (FFM), and ball-on-disk nanotribometer. Tribology research exceedingly needs broadened knowledge in various fields such as physics, chemistry, mechanics, materials science, etc. This chapter discusses the various aspects of nanotribology including nanofriction, nanowear and nanolubrication for MEMS. The nanotribological measurement methodologies and mathematical relationships between friction, bending and torsion forces based on AFM/LFM (lateral force microscopy) are comprehensively reviewed. The influences of various experimental conditions on nanotribology are described with various examples.

An energy storage system would be able to help with solving this problem. The simplest and most cost-effective energy storage method is a thermal accumulator, where hot water or another fluid is stored at a given temperature higher than the surroundings. Conversion of thermal energy into mechanical power when compared to photovoltaic systems, however, is limited in efficiency and requires comparatively complex equipment, which might not be as cost-effective as desired, suffer from low reliability and require frequent maintenance. The thermal path of converting solar energy into electricity is certainly promising but has largely been underestimated and underutilized. Several thermal-to-electricity energy conversion technologies already exist in either conventional form or at close-to-commercialization phase and can be further optimized and adapted to low-cost low-temperature solutions. Combined heat and power (cogeneration) facilities at small scales can be attractive for a quicker and wider deployment in solar-rich locations. This study evaluates and compares several candidates for the conversion of low-temperature solar thermal energy into power and examines their technical feasibility and thermodynamic performance, as well as their potential for low-investment strategies and integration with thermal energy storage. With temperatures in the solar collectors limited to 150 oC (300 oF), the suggested energy conversion techniques include flat plate and evacuated tube solar collectors combined with low-parameter steam Rankine cycles or turbocharger derivative Brayton cycles, organic Rankine cycles and novel thermoelectric solutions. Results show that common steam, organic, or air expansion cycles optimized for low parameter applications are feasible for further development and deployment in the near future, based on established components featuring turbines derived from commercial products. Thermal-to-electricity efficiency of around 5% - 12% and solar-to-electricity efficiency of around 4 - 8% can be achieved by some of the cycle alternatives at their best operational conditions.

In the case of grid-tied energy storage units, the possibility to operate in peak shaving mode, mitigating contingencies and providing backup power, reducing transmission losses, and generally giving larger utility control on renewable energy generation makes distributed energy storage a necessary prerequisite for the wider deployment of renewable energy systems and their deeper penetration into utilities' portfolios. Thermodynamic energy storage in the form of compressed air can be applied at small scales as an alternative to electrical batteries. Distributed compressed air energy storage (DCAES) units combined with small-scale solar or wind energy converters installed at residential homes or small commercial buildings do not present any major technical challenges, and promise lower specific investment than batteries if mass produced. Flexible control methods can be applied for optimizing the behavior of the energy storage system and maximizing the benefits from its utilization. This study aims at presenting a devised operational control strategy applied to distributed compressed air energy storage systems, as well as assessing the best scenario for optimal utilization of grid-integrated renewable energy sources at small scales in dynamic electricity markets. Profit maximization for the end consumer is the major goal. Results show that profits can be achieved even without integration of local power generation, if optimal charge and discharge strategy is found as a function of electricity price and various restrictions. A monthly benefit of $ 77 is expected during times of generally high consumption levels for an aggregated group of several residential houses, growing to $ 82.5 /month if a 15 kW renewable energy capacity is installed in the locality. Smart load management approximating a quasi-dispatchable behavior of the energy storage can bring additional benefits to the transmission system operator, leading to improved grid stability.

The regulation of lipid homeostasis by adipose tissue is an important aspect of whole-body metabolism. Owing to the central nature of adipose tissue in lipid metabolism, dysregulation has wide-ranging effects, contributing to disorders as diverse as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Excess lipids are stored in specialized organelles called lipid droplets (LDs). The surface of the lipid droplet can be considered a highly regulated membrane domain that both protects the contents of the LD from unregulated lipolysis and the cell from the cytotoxic effects of elevated free fatty acids. The surface of the LD is coated with a variety of regulatory proteins, either resident or transiently associated, including enzymes involved in the breakdown of TG, lipid transport proteins, and cofactors. Recent studies have begun to unravel the range of LD-associated proteins and to define their functional significance. Importantly, the involvement of LD proteins in pathophysiological disorders is beginning to be understood. This review will outline recent advances in defining the diversity of LD-associated proteins and their links to metabolic disorders including the integral membrane protein, caveolin-1 (CAV1). Analysis of the role of CAV1 in adipose tissue has highlighted the interconnectedness between the regulation of lipid storage and the function of the adipocyte plasma membrane.","Adipocytes; Caveolae; Caveolin; Lipid droplets; Lipolysis","acylglycerol lipase; catecholamine; caveolin 1; cholesterol; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; fat droplet; fatty acid; fatty acid binding protein; hormone sensitive lipase; phosphatidylcholine; phospholipid; SNARE protein; caveolin 1; fat droplet; adipocyte; adipose tissue; article; basal cell; biogenesis; biosynthesis; caveola; cell death; cell membrane; cell organelle; cell surface; cytology; cytosol; cytotoxicity; endoplasmic reticulum; fatty acid transport; human; hydrolysis; lipid storage; lipidosis; lipodystrophy; lipolysis; liver cell; metabolic disorder; mutation; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein function; protein phosphorylation; regulatory mechanism; adipose tissue; animal; caveola; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Caveolae; Caveolin 1; Humans; Lipid Droplets; Lipolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928650093

Differences in levels of feed restriction or on the period of feed restriction need to be adapted to each broilers strain, and should balance an adequate physiological response towards compensatory growth for production of the most suitable carcass, the smallest stress and an adequate immune-competence levels. So far, investigations showed considerable variations concerning broilers response to early life restrictions, physiological associate changes, compensatory growth and fat deposition. This experiment had been done to compare the effects of quantitative feed restriction imposed in different intensities and durations on the blood concentrations of energy, protein and lipid metabolites. Materials, Methods & Results: Five experimental treatments included T1 corresponded to controls (ad libitum); T2 and T4 groups were submitted to 25 and 50% feed restriction for one week; and T3 and T5 were feed deprived in 25 and 50% for two weeks, in three replicates of 10 pieces per treatment. Periods previous and subsequent (up to 42 days) to FR periods were fed ad libitum. All chickens were fed with ad libitum before and after the completion of the restriction period. Feeds were based on corn and soybean meal, and were formulated to contain the same protein and energy levels in all treatments; feed was adapted to the three main phases of the rearing period: the starter period (1-21 days of old), grower period (22-35 days old) and the finisher period (36-42 days old). At the end of the study, at 42 days of age, one bird per group, totalling 3 birds per treatment, was randomly selected for blood collection. Blood samples (1 mL/bird) were collected into EDTA tubes from the wing veins by the end of the experiment, at day 42. Samples were transferred to the laboratory for analysis within 2 h of collection. After centrifugation (3000 g, for 10 min at room temperature) plasma was harvested and stored in eppendorf tubes at -20°C, until assayed. Severe restriction for a 2 week period showed the highest concentrations for Uric Acid (UAc), Triglycerides, VLDL, as well as the lowest for cholesterol and LDL; also, the highest ratios HDL/LDL were observed in this group, suggesting that birds in this treatment are more susceptible to protein catabolism during fasting and more prone to fat deposition in the carcass. In opposition, mild feed deprived birds showed the highest cholesterol and LDL concentrations in blood along with the lowest UAc, triglycerides and VLDL plasma values; they also showed lower HDL/LDL ratios than controls or severely feed deprived birds. No differences were observed between groups in glucose plasma concentrations. Discussion: The results suggest that feed restriction for longer periods may predispose the bird metabolism for an increased susceptibility for fat deposition, in comparison to the controls or the mild feed restriction treatments. Data gathered in the present study showed that quantitative feed restriction starting by day 8, followed by ad libitum was associated with changes in plasma metabolite concentrations. These changes varied between the two different intensities of FR and the two periods of FR evaluated. The results suggest that, for the same intensity of feed restriction, the length of deprivation may not be a determinant factor in mild FR. However, when severe FR is imposed, the length of FR may be a risk factor for excessive protein catabolism and increased VLDL availability, with the latter favouring precocious fattening of the carcasses. New studies are warranted to strength these results in particular on respect to the establishment of the influences of such changes in plasma metabolites with fatness and fat distribution on broilers. © 2013 Acta Scientiae Veterinariae.","Blood metabolites; Broiler; Feed restriction; Plasma lipid profile; Plasma protein profile","albumin; cholesterol; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; protein; salinomycin; triacylglycerol; uric acid; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; animal experiment; animal food; Article; blood analysis; body fat distribution; broiler; coccidiosis; controlled study; diet restriction; food deprivation; food intake; infectious bursal disease; intestine adaptation; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; nutritional requirement; vaccination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926166739

Thus, a new uranium-thorium-based fuel assembly is proposed for improving the thermal margins. The proposed fuel is simulated for the Swedish Ringhals-3 PWR equilibrium core in a realistic demonstration. The difference between the uranium-thorium and traditional fuel assemblies is the fuel pellets composition. In the uranium-thorium fuel assembly, 7 weight percentage of thorium oxide is added to some of the fuel pellets. In those fuel pellets, the enrichment is kept below 5 % enrichment of U-235 in order to avoid extra certification on transport, management and storage. The two most significant results showed in this paper are the improved pin peak power, and the axial offset in the core. The pin peak power margin could be improved by 75 % by using the uranium-thorium-based fuel compared with the reference core containing traditional fuel assemblies. The maximum axial offset was decreased by 33 % using the uranium-thorium-based fuel compared with the reference core. The improved thermal margins in the core would allow more flexible core designs with less neutron leakage, or could be used for power uprates while guaranteeing sufficient safety margins.",,"Fuels; Neutron reflection; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Pelletizing; Thorium; Uranium; Discharge burn-up; Equilibrium core; Neutron leakages; Thermal margins; Thorium based fuels; Thorium oxides; Traditional fuels; Weight percentages; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925067996

Landfill gas is produced by bacterial decomposition, which occurs when organic waste is broken down by the bacteria naturally present in the waste and in the soil used to cover the landfill. Landfill gas is composed of a mixture of hundreds of different gases. By volume, in general the landfill gas typically contains 45% to 60% methane and 40% to 60% carbon dioxide. This study has estimated total produced gas, carbon dioxide and methane, by the basic first-order decay model for Aradkooh Landfill till the next 30 years after the landfill is closed. Gas production has decreasing trend in time, as the maximum gas production for methane and carbon dioxide is in order of 6 and it will be 16 million kg in the year 2015.The minimum contribution will also be in order of 0.3 and 0.8 million kg in 2044. The total produced gas in the 30 years is 213 million m3 which 27% of its mass belongs to methane and 73% is carbon dioxide gas. In addition, the amount of methane, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide contributed from energy generation technology is calculated for 30 years and compared. The results show that the emission rate of controlled carbon dioxide gas is 1.85 times in uncontrolled state and the emission of controlled methane gas is 0.15 in uncontrolled state. In addition, using energy generation technology leads to sulfur dioxide contribution. The estimation for total amount of this gas in 30 years is predicted about 361 kg. Finally, the gases emissions predicted from this model are validated using the mass balance method according to other studies. Comparison of results shows good agreement with other studies.","Biogas; Energy; Greenhouse gas; Waste","Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921786431

In markets where introduction of these vehicles has been met with supportive policies, their demand has been relatively strong. However in Australia, due mainly to a lack of policy and industry support, a much smaller number of these vehicles have been available, resulting in markedly lower market penetration. While it has been asserted that the increased upfront cost of plugin vehicles diminishes the ""value proposition"" to consumers who might otherwise be customers, early investigation of consumer attitudes toward these products in Australia indicate that there may be other factors at play. Through a literature review of the existing marketplace for plug-in vehicles, and supported by preliminary findings from survey data collected at a public community test drive event called Green Zone Drive and held at the Gold Coast, Queensland in August 2012, this paper examines a variety of factors thought to influence motorists' impressions of modern clean vehicles and subsequent demand for these products. In addition to inherent vehicle feature preferences, factors stated by respondents to influence their opinions of these vehicles included the policy environment, social networks, media influence, and the car-buying experience. In this study early impressions from a small sample of first time clean vehicle Australian motorists shed light on consumer attitudes and misunderstandings of clean vehicle product offerings and will help to direct future research with a view to improve the marketability of these vehicles.",,"Automobile drivers; Commerce; Digital storage; Energy policy; Energy security; Vehicles; Consumer attitudes; Literature reviews; Market penetration; Product offerings; Public communities; Renewable energies; Supportive policies; Value proposition; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916918692

Due to the growing worldwide demand for energy, some equipment, transmission and distribution networks are approaching their maximum rating. Over the years, these assets have accumulated high stress levels that are probably now exceeding the initial design criteria. Recently, several countries such as India, Brazil and the USA have experienced large blackouts initiated by a series of cascading events. According to a study published by IEEE [1], the root cause of these events can be reduced with modern control and protection equipment, and by regular maintenance, monitoring and frequent testing of the assets. In line with the report recommendations, one of the best ways to extend the remaining equipment life expectancy and mitigate the risk of network disturbance is by performing controlled switching of the circuit breakers. Controlled switching refers to the synchronization of circuit breaker operations to the network frequency: it is opened or closed at the optimum electrical moment for the application (point on wave). For the last two decades, this technique has frequently been used for shunt reactor opening (MSR) and capacitor bank closing (MSC). This period has allowed not only the validation and maturation of the technology, but also increased expertise in this field. It lead to the spreading of many more installations and eased the acceptance of more complex applications: transmission lines and power transformer energisation. Hydro-Québec was one of the first utilities to put in place controlled switching of shunt reactors, capacitors banks and power transformers. In the latter case, a device taking into account the residual flux was successfully commissioned at the beginning of 2000 on a 462 MVA transformer at 315kV. This was the starting point for the deployment of this new application in hydro-electric generation plants and critical high voltage transmission substations, including those involved in network re-energisation after a collapse. During the last decade of experience, controlled switching taking into account the residual flux has proven the following benefits: - Drastic reduction and even complete elimination of inrush current - Reduction of dielectric stress in the transformer windings upon energisation - Suppression of temporary network overvoltage - Simplification of exploitation directives and operating procedures Controlled switching technology does not only control the circuit breaker, but also provides extensive monitoring and auto-diagnosis of the system, including its components. For example, it may permit early detection of performance degradation before a catastrophic failure can occur. Furthermore, thanks to a large memory storage capacity, the data collected by the controlled switching device provides extended operating information which can be analysed for long-term behaviour modeling of the equipment, thus contributing to its estimated life expectancy. These features are extremely useful tools for the development of new experts embarking on a career in our changing and challenging environment. © 2013 CIGRE.

Seasonal variations in food intake, energy storage, and expenditure appear to be a widespread phenomenon suggesting they may have evolved in anticipation for changing environmental demands. These cycles appear to be driven by changes in external daylength acting on neuroendocrine pathways. A number of neuroendocrine pathways, two of which are the endocrine mechanisms underlying feeding and stress, appear to show seasonal changes in both their circulating levels and reactivity. As such, variation in the level or reactivity to these hormones may be crucial factors in the control of seasonal variations in food-seeking behaviors. The present review examines the relationship between feeding behavior and seasonal changes in circulating hormones. We hypothesize that seasonal changes in circulating levels of glucocorticoids and the feeding-related hormones ghrelin and leptin contribute to seasonal fluctuations in feeding-related behaviors. This review will focus on the seasonal circulating levels of these hormones as well as sensitivity to these hormones in the modulation of food-seeking behaviors. © 2013 Cahill, Tuplin and Holahan.","Feeding; Ghrelin; Glucocorticoids; Leptin; Seasonal variation; Stress","dopamine; ghrelin; glucocorticoid; hormone; leptin; autumn; body mass; body weight; chronic stress; circannual rhythm; circulation; conditioned place preference test; feeding behavior; food availability; food deprivation; food intake; hormone determination; hormone release; hormone sensitivity; human; lipid storage; motivation; negative feedback; nonhuman; photoperiodicity; review; reward; seasonal variation; signal transduction; stress; summer; sunlight; weight reduction; winter",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904868566

This article presents the theoretical and practical research results of an oil-free co-rotating scroll air compressor and turbine working with water injection to make the operations of expansion and compression as isothermal as possible. The theoretical performance is predicted with the help of a mathematical model using the equations of energy and mass conservation and the equation of state. This model takes into account the effects of water injection and volumetric losses. The experimental prototype is an oil-free scroll air compressor with the distinctive feature of having two mobile involutes working in synchronized co-rotation one relative to another. The prime-mover is an electric motor driving the two scrolls with two synchronizing belts. Water injection in the housing intends to provide a quasi-isothermal compression. The same device is used as an isothermal expander by supplying highpressure air with water when it rotates backwards in expander mode, the electric motor acting then as a generator. Expected improvements to a standard scroll compressor and expander are a better volumetric efficiency and a greater power density due to a higher rotational speed of the scrolls, thanks to their symmetrical masses.

The assessment and the optimization of their performances are required both at the economic level and at the environmental level. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been proven to be suitable for the environmental assessment of renewable energy technologies, since it accounts for the impacts generated over the full life cycle. This paper presents first a comparative LCA of four different CSP plants using data of recently built power plants: parabolic trough (Andasol), tower (Gemasolar), Fresnel (PE2) and dishes (Maricopa). The Impact2002+ method is used to assess their impacts on human health, ecosystem quality, climate change and resources. A sensitivity analysis on the key design parameters of CSP plants is as well performed. Subsequently, a multi-objective environomic optimization is run with selected decision variables to minimize simultaneously the levelized cost of electricity and the environmental impacts. The hybridization with natural gas is considered. The issue of the optimal value of the CO2 tax ensuring the competitiveness of CSP over its fossil competitors is as well addressed. The results of the LCA demonstrate that more than 86% of the impact is due to the construction phase. In general, the solar field construction has the highest contribution to the impact. In addition, the storage system and the heat transfer fluid (HTF) may have as well a significant impact, in particular for trough plants. However, when compared with its fossil competitors, CSP has a much lower impact for most of the impact categories. The optimization highlights the trade-off between the investment costs of the CSP plant and its environmental impacts. The optimal range for the hybridization ratio is between 70% and 20%. The breakeven value of the CO2 tax favoring CSP over coal or natural gas is between 54 and 174 $/ton of CO2-eq, depending on the CSP technology and the hybridization ratio.","Concentrating solar power; Environomic; Life cycle assessment; Multi-objective optimization","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Costs; Digital storage; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Natural gas; Solar energy; Concentrating solar power; Concentrating solar thermal power; Environmental assessment; Environomic; Key design parameters; Levelized cost of electricities; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renewable energy technologies; Multiobjective optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903625393

In the studied DC microgrid, a wind permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is connected to its DC bus via a three-phase Vienna switch-mode rectifier (SMR). And a single-phase three-wire (IP3W) bidirectional load inverter is developed to serve as the load of microgrid and the interface from microgrid to utility grid. Good 220V/llOV 60Hz AC output voltages are generated for local loads via the proposed simple robust control scheme. As to the established ESS, while the battery bank is connected to the microgrid DC bus via a half-bridge bidirectional interface DCIDC converter, the developed permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) driven flywheel employs a bidirectional three-phase inverter as the interface. Good charging and discharging performances of these two ESS devices are achieved by the properly designed control schemes. The energy balanced transfer between wind PMSG, battery, load, dump load and mains can be automatically accomplished. During the flywheel charging operation, the insufficient power provided from the wind generator can be supported by the battery automatically. Some measured results are provided to verify the performances of the established system. © 2013 IEEE.","Battery; Current control; DC microgrid; Energy storage system; Flywheel; Interface converter; Inverter; PMSG; PMSM; Robust control; Speed control; Wind generator","Charging (batteries); Electric current control; Electric inverters; Electric rectifiers; Energy storage; Flywheels; Permanent magnets; Robust control; Secondary batteries; Speed control; Synchronous generators; Wheels; Battery; Dc micro-grid; Energy storage systems; Interface converters; Inverter; PMSG; PMSM; Wind generator systems; Electric machine control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903135178

Many studies about data dissemination have been proposed. However, most of them are not energy-efficient, especially in large-scale networks. Hence, in this paper the authors proposed an energy-efficient data dissemination scheme in large-scale wireless sensor networks. First, the authors design a data storage method which disseminates only a few amount event data by dividing the network into regions and levels, and thus reducing the energy consumption. Then, the authors develop an efficient sink query forwarding strategy by probability analysis so that a sink can query events easily according to its location to reduce the delay time of querying event data, as well as energy consumption. In addition, a simple and efficient maintenance mechanism is also provided. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms TTDD and LBDD in terms of the energy consumption and control overhead.

In the absence of rate limits, we offer necessary and sufficient conditions for the generation g(t) to service the loads under causal scheduling without surplus or deficit. Our results show that the flexibility in the collection can be modeled as electricity storage. The capacity Q(t) and maximum charge/discharge rate m(t) of the equivalent storage can be computed in real time. Ex ante, these parameters must be estimated based on arrival/departure statistics and charging needs. Thus, the collection is equivalent a stochastic timevarying electricity storage.

The pneumatic hybridization of the Diesel engine consists to introduce the CAES through the admission valve. The combustion efficiency and the fuel consumption are improved by optimizing air/fuel ratio thanks to the CAES assistance. With limited tank volume, the pressure becomes an influent factor. As the pressure increase inside the tank, more power is required to introduce the same quantity of air. The goal of this study is to find the optimum tank volume, associated with the minimum mass of the tank and the maximum time of feeding DG with CAES. © 2013 IEEE.","Optimization; Remote areas; Remote power systems; Wind-diesel Compressed air energy system","Diesel engines; Fuel economy; Hybrid systems; Optimization; Pneumatics; Pressure vessels; Tanks (containers); Wind power; Combustion efficiencies; Compressed air energy storage; Compressed air storage; Energy systems; Pneumatic hybridizations; Remote areas; Remote power systems; Wind-diesel systems; Compressed air",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901362143

Two online or period-ahead techniques are compared to an offline mathematical formulation of a PV-ESS-Diesel system for an hourly-based annual simulation. A new online method, based on the average cost curve of a generator is introduced as it consists in a combination between the closed mathematical formulation of a classic offline technique and the online capabilities of a Knowledge-Based Expert System (KBES). An application of the three techniques over the same benchmark shows that by the introduction of a load shifting capability of approximately 25% of the peak, for all three methods the RC is able to save around 3% of the overall diesel consumption of a PV-Diesel Microgrid (MG). © 2013 IEEE.","Distributed generation; Economic Dispatch; Microgrids; Power system economics; Remote Community","Distributed power generation; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Economic Dispatch; Energy storage systems; Knowledge-based expert systems; Mathematical formulation; Micro grid; Power system economics; Remote communities; Renewable energy source; Mathematical techniques",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901360753

Despite the progress made by the architects and engineers in developing special systems for above the ground buildings, the underground has not been fully explored; and it seems that it is still alien to many. Also, people are still unaware of the effects and benefits of this type of building.

Gomg underground is another promising option for Smgapore to further expand its land and space capacity.

Hie design of the storage volume is based on silos, mspired from the mining mdustry and storage silos. The access system consists of vertical shafts and a number of tunnels. Tlie order of excavating shafts, tunnels and silos will be described. As soon as a small number of silos are ready, the excavation of new silos and waste-fillmg in ready-made silos will run in parallel. This means use of the storage volume can start after a relatively short period of construction, giving quick ""payback"" for the investment. The design also allows for a large degree of flexibility- in the excavation rate, making it possible to meet changmg prognosis for further waste volume. The silo-design allows for utilization of gravity both in the excavating phase and in the operational phase and contributes to less use of resources and energy and thereby reduces the costs.

The paper touches on many important topics such as; environment, reasons for going underground, geotechnical and rock engineering, underground transport systems, industrial and commercial applications, utilization of underground space and case studies and special projects. For cities with dramatic topography or with dense population, the underground space is utilized in Sweden for official services to the community like water and sewage treatment plants in caverns and tunnels. Often the surface area above the facility is developed as residence or industrial areas. Storing foodstuffs is an operation that can benefit considerably from the properties of the rock, and there arc many historic examples showing that people have long known how to make use of the constant low temperatures prevailing underground. Cooled storage has, after the initial cooling, low energy consumption, which is the case for e.g. storage of ice-cream or other deep frozen products. Efficient and safe underground storage solutions for energy, e.g. oil, LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) or hot water arc examples of good applications to communities. Also, a development on how to design and construct a repository for spent nuclear fuel has been going on for many years. Now the site selection process is completed and authorization process together with planning is ongoing. The underground creates possibilities to solve the traditional problems of congestion, environment and safety for the Swedish road and railroad systems in urban areas. Several projects have been fulfilled and arc in the planning phase even if both technical and logistical challenges arc large.

We have witnessed the revolution of photonics in optical communications. The advance in photonic chips will allow for the development of ultrafast optical signal generation and processing. While optical data storage such as the optical compact (CD) disk, digital video (DVD) disk and Blue-ray disk technologies has transformed our society in the last two decades, the development in this area has been slow down and seemingly become less active due to the fast development of flush memory and hard disks. However, the optical data storage technology has held its distinctive advantages of long lifetime, low-energy consumption, and ultra-secure encryption [1-3]. Nanophotonics that is the integration of photonics and nano-materials has extended optical data storage from three-dimensions to five dimensions or more [1, 2]. If combined with supresolution optics that allows for the break of the diffraction limit, nanophotonics-enabled optical data storage will make it possible to develop Petabype optical disks, forming a green-technology platform for future data centres. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Diffraction; Digital storage; Electron optics; Energy utilization; Information technology; Light; Multimedia systems; Nanophotonics; Optical communication; Quantum electronics; Diffraction limits; Digital videos; Disk technology; Information generation; Long lifetime; Optical disks; Optical signal generation; Photonic chips; Optical data storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900333848

However, after years of intensive experimental and theoretical studies of GDR materials, physical nature of their extremely high complex dielectric permittivity (specifically, real part ∼ 104 - 106) is still not established convincingly. Another serious problem is excessively high imaginary part of the permittivity (which usually exceeds real one). Better understanding on physical mechanisms and limitations of GDR behavior in aforementioned dielectrics could be achieved based on polaronic phase transition criteria, proposed S. Fratini and P. Quémerais [Eur. Phys. Journ. B 14, 99 (2000)]. In particular, 'melting' of Polaronic Wigner Crystal (PWC) either to 'polaronic liquid' or 'electron liquid' manifests two different scenarios of PWC phase transition at increment of concentrations of appropriate dopants. The former scenario is certainly preferable for ionic dielectrics with GDR behavior, while the latter one would yield in metal-like dielectric response with very high real permittivity, but unacceptable loss. Described approach provides physically transparent guidelines for selection of prospective host dielectrics with GDR behavior and quantitative estimations on critical dopant/polaron concentrations, corresponding to both aforementioned types of the phase transitions as well as temperature ranges suitable for GDR. © 2013 Materials Research Society.",,"Doping (additives); Liquids; Permittivity; Complex dielectric permittivities; Dielectric response; Physical mechanism; Quantitative estimation; Research interests; Temperature range; Theoretical study; Transition criterion; Dielectric materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900301425

The biodiesel samples were stored in clinical compartment, at different temperatures and were monitored at regular interval over a period of 60 days. Blending of biodiesel are varied from 5vol%(B5)∼ 45vol%(B45) and storage temperature from 5°C∼30°C. The tests subject presented in this research is performed according to ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standard. The effects of storage conditions on properties of biodiesel such as density, kinematics viscosity, acid value, water content and flash point of biodiesel were discussed in detail. Furthermore, the experimental with burner system was carried out to observe the influences of storage method on emission aspects. Analysis of the measurement performed shows that the biodiesel density, viscosity and carbon monoxide are affected by storage duration and storage temperature.

Voltage scaling had been used to reduce the power consumption of the cache. However, due to the impact of variations, SRAM cells of the cache could potentially fail when voltage dropping. To against variations, we need to increase the supply voltage for the safety margin, thus the cache costs large energy consumption. For eliminating the voltage safety margin, some prior works for SRAM failure tolerance designs were proposed. These schemes will result in worse energy consumption and cannot deal with dynamic variations. They still have a safety margin to resist dynamic variations. With the supply voltage scaling down, we find out that the major reason of failures is that some slow cells have longer latency. We call these cell faults as 'latency fault'. If each cache line can be accessed in an appropriate access time, the slower cells could be reused but not disable them. We propose a VAL-Cache adapting the access time to tolerate latency faults and which is able to scale down the voltage. And we also propose the latency-fault detector to detect latency faults at run-time so as to tolerate both static and dynamic variations. Our experimental results on Mibench and 0xbench benchmarks demonstrate that the energy consumption can be reduced 10%∼18% in average at a cost of acceptable performance loss. © 2013 IEEE.","Adaptive latency; Fault-tolerant cache; Low voltage cache; Variation-aware","Benchmarking; Cache memory; Cells; Cytology; Energy utilization; Fits and tolerances; Acceptable performance; Adaptive latency; Dynamic variations; Fault-tolerant; Low voltages; Static and dynamic variations; Supply-voltage scaling; Variation-aware; Static random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899531958

A series of experiments based on the implementation on the Linux system was conducted to evaluate the capability of the proposed scheme, and the results are very encouraging. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Computer operating systems; File organization; Mobile computing; Phase change memory; Virtual storage; Energy efficient; High energy consumption; Mobile computing systems; Performance gaps; Phase change memory (pcm); Secondary storage; Storage medium; Storage systems; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899457025

The inverters are usually controlled by Phase Lock Loop to sync its output frequency with the grid frequency. As a result, the grid inertia that used to be provided by conventional generators decreases and the grid becomes more vulnerable to disturbances. Prior articles have proposed several approaches to emulate the inertia characteristics of a synchronous generator by using energy storage systems (ESS) such as batteries. Inverter is controlled in such way that the ESS performs the function of a virtual synchronous generator (VSG). In this paper, a new control method for the ESS that smoothens the active power disturbances of the microgrid is proposed based on the existing VSG topologies. The new control is modeled as a part of the multilevel active power control system of the microgrid. In the examined case the microgrid is comprised of diesel generators, Photovoltaic (PV) generators, loads and proposed battery storage systems. This microgrid is tested for various active power disturbances, and the results show how the control method can enhances the grid stability. © 2013 IEEE.","ESS inverter control; microgrid; power smoothening; PVgenerator; VSG","Distributed power generation; Power electronics; Synchronous generators; Inverter control; Micro grid; power smoothening; PVgenerator; VSG; Electric power system interconnection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899424120

As a solution, other alternative energy source such as photovoltaic (PV) becomes increasingly applied in the EV charging station infrastructure. However as the energy that can be harvested from the PV is constrained, among others by the sun irradiation availability and space for system installation, integration with utility grid still need to be considered to ensure a smooth charging operation. In this paper, a new method of integration between PV inverter system with utility grid for vehicle charging station based on the quasi-Z-source (qZSI) topology is proposed. The proposed system realizes a bidirectional power flow management between PV sources, energy storage unit and the utility grid which is very suitable for small to mid size business infrastructure. The main advantage is the flexibility of the proposed topology with various voltage levels of the inverter DC link and the battery storage, with no circuit modification requirement.

It converts the potential energy of the natural circulating water flows to usable electrical energy by driving a turbine which is connected to a generator. In the rural area of Sabah state in Malaysia, such as Kampung Terian, the existing micro-hydro power plant is incapable to support the villagers' demand during the peak hours. Meanwhile, the tremendous amount of excess energy is wasted by disposing through ballast load during the non-peak hours. Since the discharge coefficient parameter of charging system is dynamically changed in nature, the conventional proportional controller is unable to control the charging process well.

International Energy Agency (IEA) warns the entire world that more and more serious greenhouse effects will lead to unavoidable crisis in our ecosystems, if people don't take effective measures to reduce air pollutant emissions. Some clean coal schemes have been proposed by IEA, which include developing renewable energy, improving energy efficiency in existing power plants, and executing carbon capture and storage (CCS). Energy Technology Perspective 2010 (ETP 2010) reported that if the reduction of half amount of greenhouse gas is expected before 2050, CCS technology should contribute up to 20% of all the carbon abatement scenarios. Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) has involved in R&amp;D on clean coal technologies since 2005, which include coal/biomass gasification, hot/warm gas clean-up, and CO2 capturing techniques. Among hot/warm gas clean-up techniques, it is divided into particulate filtration and sulfur removal. In this paper, sulfur removal at medium-high temperature with simulated syngas environment will be discussed. Compared to traditional scrubbing methods, the advantages of increasing operational temperature in clean-up process are improving energy efficiency and reducing pollutant emission. In our study, silica-supported sorbents, which are composed of Zn, Cu, Mn or Fe metal oxide, are synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation method. The precursor solution was poured on silica supporters, dried and calcinated accordingly. The physical properties of sorbents were analyzed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). XRD patterns showed that there was specific crystalline phase for every kind of sorbent, for example, α-Fe2O3 phase for iron-based sorbents. ICP-AES results indicated that the composition of metal oxide was close to the theoretical value, in other words, 20 wt%. For sulfur-capturing tests, sorbents were introduced into specific simulated syngas environment in a fixed-bed reactor. The analysis showed that zinc-based sorbents exhibited the best performance, in which breakthrough time was about 39 minutes, and sulfur capacity was 6.86 g-S/100g sorbent. For parametric discussion, it was found that sulfur capacity kept the same while space velocity was controlled between 8000-12000 mL/g.hr. For space velocity reaching 20000 mL/g.hr, the breakthrough time declined to 11 minutes, and sulfur capacity was 4.83 g-S/100g sorbent. For chemical stability evaluation, zinc-based sorbents were experienced for 10 cycles of desulfurization-regeneration reaction. It showed that sulfur-removal capability dropped to 60% of the initial performance at the final cycle. It will be promising to apply this kind of sorbents to advanced fuel conversion processes, and in order to achieve this objective, more related tests will be conducted continuously in the future.","Breakthrough time; Sorbent; Sulfur capacity","Atomic emission spectroscopy; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Copper; Desulfurization; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Metallic compounds; Silica; Sorption; Sulfur; Synthesis gas; Zinc; Breakthrough time; Carbon capture and storage; Incipient wetness impregnation method; Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry; Institute of nuclear energy researches; International energy agency; Medium-High temperatures; Sulfur capacity; Sorbents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899026671

In the investigation stage, the Chang-Gong site was selected as the preferred site for the suitable geology condition and large storage capacity. Under the Chang- Gong preferred site, target aquifer underlying the recent overburden sediments consists of four key geologic formations, namely KCL, CS, CL, and TKS formations from bottom to top. These formations have been outlined based on extensive literal review and analysis of available geological data, the maximum depth is estimated approximately 3,000 m. Hence, prior to allocate a 3,000 m deep characterization well, the land seismic reflection survey is regarded as compulsory to testify the adequacy of required drilling depth. Six survey lines were distributed in the industrial park of the preferred site, the seismic data showed higher S/N ratio than expected. It may be due to the fact that only few human activities and rather low background noises of the preferred test site. The continuous operation of wind-power generator, ocean current and tidal wave resulted in no significant effects on the seismic data. Moreover, the saturated soil would also help the downward penetration of source energy with mini-vibe. For better interpretation of the seismic profiles, an auxiliary seismic survey had been conducted nearby a pre-existing deep well (WG-1) located 15 km away and south of the industrial park. The auxiliary seismic profile showed four extinct reflectors which match in sequence with the formation boundaries as revealed with the well log of the WG-1. The six seismic profiles obtained also showed four extinct reflectors, which correlated consistency with the profile obtained 15 km away. This seismic investigation showed the top of the target formations was in depth ranged from 2,200 m to 2,460 m. Based on the depth interpretation of the target geological formations, a preliminary planning on the drilling depth, well bore development scheme, and stability design can be done prior to allocate a 3000 m characterization well on-site.","CCS pilot project; Mini-vibe; Seismic reflection",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898758884

Nevertheless, its potential as a climate mitigating option will be proved, only if it is implemented in the countries which are developing at a great pace and taking advantage of fossil fuels in order to afford their energy demands. As regards Iran is ranked as the eighth great CO2 emitter country worldwide, it is quite a qualified option for CCS implementation as an emission mitigation solution. In this essay, first of all, an analytical framework is expanded which is covering the evaluation of CCS deployment determinants in Iran. At the second step, barriers against deployment of this technology and also, the required solutions and policies are discussed. Finally, three scenarios for CCS development process in Iran are depicted on the basis of IPCC Emission Scenarios (SRES), considering the aforementioned policies.

(Enhance), located in Alberta, Canada, specializes in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Along with its partner North West Redwater Partnership (NWRP), Enhance has developed a fully integrated CCS project incorporating gasification, CO2 capture, transportation, storage and EOR. The project utilizes proven technology to provide a critical CO2 gathering and distribution infrastructure, which will enable the cost-effective management of CO2 emissions in Alberta, Canada. The project also demonstrates how Alberta's vast bitumen resources can be produced amid tightening environmental standards. At the heart of the proposed project is the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line (ACTL), a 16"", 240 km pipeline, which will be fully operational in 2015. Laterals have been designed to allow for multiple entry points. CO2 will be collected from various emitters such as coal fired power plants, upgrading/refining operations, petrochemicals and natural gas processing plants in and around Alberta's Industrial Heartland. The CO2 will then be transported to aging reservoirs in southern Alberta for storage in EOR projects. The ACTL will be able to access reservoirs which are capable of storing over two billion tonnes of CO2, and producing an additional one billion barrels of high quality light crude oil using CO2 EOR. The ACTL will initially capture and store up to 1.6 million tonnes/year of CO2 from the Agrium fertilizer manufacturing facilities and North West Redwater Partnership Sturgeon Refinery (NWRPSR). At full capacity the ACTL project will store 14.6 million tonnes/year of CO2, the equivalent of removing 2.6 million cars from Alberta's roads. Once fully operational, the ACTL project will be the world's largest CCS development. This paper will provide an update on the progress being made on the project as the ACTL has moved passed the regulatory phase and is now completing detailed engineering, with procurement underway. The ACTL has received regulatory approval for its pipeline construction and landowners along the entire pipeline route are supportive of the project. The presentation will address the project's development and stress the importance of the support from stakeholders. The paper will also outline the benefits of the project, and will explain how it balances environmental sustainability and economic viability while garnering public support. The project is significantly advanced and is being financially supported b| the Governments of Alberta and the Government Canada; the former through the Carbon Capture and Storage Program in the amount of $495MM CDN, and the latter through the ecoEnergy Technology Initiative and Clean Energy Fund in the amount of $63MM CDN. The estimated total cost of the full project is $1.15B CDN. Susan Cole will present the paper at the GHG-T 11 Conference. Susan is the founder and President of Enhance. Ms. Cole is a professional engineer with over 20 years of experience in the energy industry. Prior to founding Enhance, Ms. Cole was manager of the Weyburn cO2 Project in Saskatchewan, Canada, which is the largest industrial CO2 capture, transportation, and EOR/secure storage project in the world. She managed initial approval, facility construction and start-up phases of this project.

It is being developed for locations that lack access to underground storage capacity for CO2 and/or have access to suitable mineral resources, or for users that aim at marketable (hydro-) carbonate or otherwise useful solid product. The ""Abo Akademi route"" of producing Mg(OH)2 from serpentinite rock followed by gas-solid carbonation in a pressurised fluidised bed (PFB) has been further developed and optimized towards industrial demonstration. Recoverable ammonium sulphate salt is used as the fluxing agent for Mg extraction from rock. While Mg(OH) 2 production and its scale-up and subsequent carbonation are yet to be demonstrated beyond 78 and 65% efficiency, respectively, the carbonation reaction reaches an equilibrium already after 10-15 minutes. Process energy requirements are ~ 3 GJ (heat)/t CO2 (similar to the capture stage of ""conventional"" CCS), while using ~ 3 t rock/t CO2, with separate streams of unreacted rock, FeOOH and MgCO2 as main products. The scale-up activities involve defining reactor types and conditions for the Mg(OH)2 production and the carbonation, respectively, using flue gas at ~500°C, 20 bar CO2 partial pressure. This implies compression of a complete flue gas stream. It was shown that carbonation at a given (wet) CO2 pressure gives results similar to when operating with diluted gas streams at higher pressures, at the same CO2 partial pressure. Also simultaneous carbonation and sulphation of Mg(OH)2 was found to be realizable. The beneficial role of increased yet reasonable levels of water vapour pressure is another research topic. While serpentinite-derived Mg(OH) 2 shows good reactivity the production of particle sizes suitable for bubbling PFB reactors is a complicating challenge.","Operation on flue gas; Serpentinite",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898743753

Furthermore, the effect of whether or not onshore storage will be accepted is investigated. The work is based on techno-economic modeling of the European electricity generation sector under different assumptions (scenarios) of the future with respect to electricity demand and fuel prices. The results indicate that the contribution from CCS on a member state level depends on local conditions, e.g., access to local fuels like lignite, and whether or not onshore storage will be allowed. Excluding on-shore storage in aquifers, the modeling results give that CCS is centralized around the North Sea. Natural gas fired conventional power plants is likely to be a serious competitor to coal CCS in the short to medium term providing large emission reduction opportunities by fuel shifting from existing coal power plants to new high efficient gas fired combined cycles. Such development can be a barrier for early deployment of CCS, and hence, result in a delay in commercialization of CCS. The scenarios presented in the Energy Roadmap prescribe power systems almost without net CO2 emissions by 2050, which implies that CCS technologies by the year 2050 must be of a zero-emission type. The modeling presented here indicates in general a large increase in technologies with low CO2 emissions, renewables as well as a significant contribution from CCS technologies, where CCS in the investigated scenarios have the potential to contribute as much as 25-35% of total electricity generation at around year 2050.","CCS; Energy systems; EU; Policy",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898728270

First, the electricity sector is described using the Chalmers Electricity Investment Model, which, for each EU member state, yields the technology mix including CCS - until the year 2050. The model gives the lowest system cost under a given CO2 emission reduction target. Thus, the model gives the annual flows of CO2 being captured by country and fuel. Secondly, these flows are used as input to InfraCCS, a cost optimization tool for bulk CO2 pipelines. Finally, the results from InfraCCS are applied along with Chalmers databases on power plants and CO2 storage sites to design the development over time of a detailed CO2 transport network across Europe considering the spatial distribution of power plants and storage locations. Two scenarios are studied: with and without onshore aquifer storage. The work shows that the spatial distribution of capture plants over time along with individual reservoir storage capacity and injectivity are key factors determining routing and timing of the pipeline network. The results of this work imply that uncertainties in timing for installation of capture equipment in combination with uncertainties related to accurate data on storage capacity and injectivity on reservoir level risk to seriously limit the build-up of large-scale pan-European CO2 transportation networks. The study gives that transport cost will more than double if aquifer storage is restricted to offshore reservoirs. Thus, it is found that the total investments for the pan-European pipeline system is € 31 billion.when storage in onshore aquifers is allowed and € 72 billion. if aquifer storage is restricted to offshore reservoirs with corresponding specific cost of € 5.1 to € 12.2 CO2 transported.","CCS; Energy system modelling; Infrastructure; Injectivity; Optimisation; Timing",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898725903

IL, 61820, United States","When addressing community engagement and outreach, North American carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects have parameters unique to the continent, including the history of CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which goes back over 40 years in some jurisdictions and, aligned with this, the use of landmen and one-on-one dialogue with landowners and community residents that are well versed in oilfield technologies. These variables alone are in marked contrast to the CCS experiences of many global projects, which do not have the tradition of engaging in one-on-one discussion. Even where CCS projects have conducted extensive public consultation and education, significant opposition has shut down some, and put in jeopardy others, in a manner that contradicts the North American hydrocarbon experience. With the increase in North America of integrated CCS projects that go beyond CO2-EOR, a change in community engagement strategies has taken place under the unique auspices of the United States Department of Energy's (US DOE) Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships Initiative (RCSP). Part of the planning in each of these seven geographic regions includes significant public education, outreach, and communications programs, particularly in areas unfamiliar with injection and storage technologies (i.e., outside of traditional oil producing areas). The bringing together of different demonstration projects' participants - not just nationally within the US but including projects in Western Canada - has allowed for the sharing of best practices between projects and across international jurisdictions. Such sharing is particularly true where the development of community engagement guidelines and strategies are concerned. The publication in 2010 of the US DOE's Best Practices for Public Outreach and Education for Carbon Storage Projects is one example where the experiences of several United States demonstration projects were brought to bear on developing communications guidelines, which in turn were used to help develop public outreach strategies for such projects as Aquistore in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada [1]. Another example of such international information sharing is the World Resources Institute's Guidelines for Community Engagement in Carbon Dioxide Capture, Transport, and Storage Projects where, over a period of a year and a half, international experts were brought together for round table discussions to form the basis of the guidelines and provide an international peer review [2]. More recently, the development of an emergency response plan for the Illinois Basin - Decatur Project, led by the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium, one of the RCSP partnerships, drew upon this international collaborative structure, employing the experience of communicators from Schlumberger Carbon Services, the Petroleum Technology Research Centre (managers of the IEAGHG Weyburn- Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project) and the Illinois State Geological Survey to develop a map of potential crisis points. This planning process brought together the lessons learned from various projects, risk assessments, media experiences, and best practices to help identify potential risks for the project (a list of events and scenarios) with the goal of creating response paths and directions for the management of risks and the mitigation of potential threats. These scenarios involved not only potential external issues - such as leakage or pipeline failure - but also addressed management issues internal to a project such as loss of key personnel or loss of funding. The development of this emergency response plan is an example to other projects of the value of interconnecting communications experiences between projects, and of identifying common high-risk scenarios that require advanced response planning.","Carbon capture and storage; Communications planning; Community outreach; Crisis communications; Public consultation; Public engagement",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898718698

Whenever SRAM-based FPGAs are used, upsets in the configuration memory become a major dependability threat, and must be removed as soon as possible. This is usually accomplished through a process called scrubbing. The traditional scrubbing technique, however, suffers from high energy costs and a long mean time to repair (MTTR). In this work we propose a novel approach to minimize these drawbacks through a triggered shifted scrubbing procedure. The proposed technique exploits the non-uniform distribution of critical bits in the configuration memory of the device to reduce the repair time. It provides an average MTTR reduction of 30% without any changes in the circuit implemented in the FPGA when compared to previous works. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Static random access storage; Configuration memory; Critical systems; High-energy costs; Mean time to repairs; Non-uniform distribution; Repair time; Scrubbing techniques; Repair",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898619023

Data on the level of stress sustained by buildings and other critical infrastructure acquired during the event can significantly help in post-disaster recovery and assessment of buildings' structural integrity. While installing sensors to acquire such data is not difficult, ensuring that there is power to drive the sensors at the critical moment of the event is a challenge. In this paper, we propose an event-driven energy-harvesting (EDEH) wireless sensor network (WSN) in which the sensors are powered by the energy harvested from the consequence of the event, e.g. buildings shaking during an earthquake. The scarce amount of energy harvested during the short event occurrence time poses great challenges for the medium access control (MAC) design, which is the focus of our research. Furthermore, when all sensors harvest energy from the event, they become active simultaneously leading to serious channel contention problems. As such, we first examine the amount of harvestable energy and then show analytically that our MAC protocol is able to provide higher packet delivery ratio than conventional wireless technology, e.g. IEEE802.15.4. © 2013 IEEE.","Event-Driven Energy-Harvesting; Medium Access Control; Structural Health Monitoring(SHM)","Digital storage; Earthquakes; Medium access control; Sensors; Standards; Structural health monitoring; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Catastrophic event; Channel contention; Critical moment; Event-driven; Medium access control(MAC); Packet delivery ratio; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Wireless technologies; Harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898020982

Data of a month's load profile was analysed and it was found that the TES system consumed more energy by 27% compared to the direct supply system of chilled water but its maximum demand reduced by 23%. The estimated cost (RM) per day was less by only 4%, under no energy loss, due to the introduction of thermal energy storage system compared with the direct system.

Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancers (prostate, colorectal, endometrial, and breast). Obese people may present to the gastroenterologists with gastroesophageal reflux, non-alcoholic fatty liver, and gallstones. It is important, therefore, to recognize and treat obesity. The main cause of obesity is an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended, although in a small number of cases, genetics and diseases such as hypothyroidism, Cushing's disease, depression, and use of medications such as antidepressants and anticonvulsants are responsible for fat accumulation in the body. The main treatment for obesity is dieting, augmented by physical exercise and supported by cognitive behavioral therapy. Calorie-restriction strategies are one of the most common dietary plans. Low-calorie diet refers to a diet with a total dietary calorie intake of 800-1500, while very low-calorie diet has less than 800 calories daily. These dietary regimes need to be balanced in macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Fifty-five percent of the dietary calories should come from carbohydrates, 10% from proteins, and 30% from fats, of which 10% of total fat consist of saturated fats. After reaching the desired body weight, the amount of dietary calories consumed can be increased gradually to maintain a balance between calories consumed and calories expended. Regular physical exercise enhances the efficiency of diet through increase in the satiating efficiency of a fixed meal, and is useful for maintaining diet-induced weight loss. A meta-analysis by Franz found that by calorie restriction and exercise, weight loss of 5-8.5kg was observed 6 months after intervention. After 48 months, a mean of 3-6kg was maintained. In conclusion, there is evidence that obesity is preventable and treatable. Dieting and physical exercise can produce weight loss that can be maintained. © 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","BMI; Diet; Exercise; NAFLD; Obesity","anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; antidiabetic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; neuroleptic agent; steroid; article; body weight; breast cancer; caloric restriction; carbohydrate intake; cardiovascular disease; cognitive behavioral stress management; colorectal cancer; Cushing disease; depression; diabetes mellitus; diet; diet therapy; disease association; exercise; fat intake; gallstone; gastroesophageal reflux; human; hypothyroidism; kinesiotherapy; lipid storage; musculoskeletal disease; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; priority journal; prostate cancer; protein intake; risk factor; side effect; sleep disordered breathing; weight reduction; BMI; diet; exercise; NAFLD; obesity; Bariatric Surgery; Cardiovascular Diseases; Colorectal Neoplasms; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diet Therapy; Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted; Diet, Fat-Restricted; Diet, Reducing; Energy Intake; Exercise Therapy; Fatty Liver; Female; Humans; Male; Obesity; Overweight; Risk; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897597946

Injecting CO2 into a reservoir does not guarantee safe storage because CO2 could leak back to the surface and/or may contaminate specific strata where other energy, mineral and/or groundwater resources are present. Two mechanisms control assurance of storage integrity, which are geological leakage mechanism and wellbore leakage mechanism (Espie, 2005). Wellbore element was presented as a basic unit for developing a model of an entire wellbore system. This paper is the second to assess the performance of a wellbore system for geological storage purposes. The analytical model adopts concept of sequence scenarios of possible leakage paths, concept of wellbore efficiency for storage purposes and concept of the reference state. A new analytical model for modeling leakage through a wellbore system has been proposed. The analytical model represents the wellbore system as serially connected wellbore elements. This provides an advantage that each element can differ from the subsequent one and will have its own characteristics. Effective wellbore permeability also can change from element to another. The effect of site formation arrangement between general system and repeated aquitard-aquifers is investigated and compared. The analytical model is validated with the results of Nordbotten et al.

In addition, it is a potential locus for new underground operations such as geothermal energy production, storage of compressed air, and CO2 storage. Considering the importance of this region, a database of rock properties based on the existing wireline logs in more than 2200 wells in Alberta was developed by the author. This database includes rock properties such as porosity, density, shear and compressional wave velocities and dynamic elastic parameters for the formations intersected by these wells, along with the statistical analyses of these data to evaluate the reliability of the measurements. In this paper, it is shown that the data presented in this database might be utilized to study potential meaningful relationships between shear and compressional wave velocities for different geological formations in Alberta. These relationships can be extremely valuable because shear sonic logs are usually scarce compared to compressional sonic logs. Developing such correlations is common in the field of geophysics and they are widely used to estimate shear wave velocities from measured values of compressional wave velocities for various seismic interpretation applications and geomechanical characterization. Studies presented in this paper show that, for a notable number of geological formations in the Alberta Basin, strong linear correlations exist between shear and compressional wave velocities. As one of the major targets for conventional and unconventional oil recovery, the Viking Formation in Alberta was selected to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed database.

Electricity is generated and used almost in real time where the balance between the two is maintained by regulation services. Additionally, small number of fixed storage units are utilized to store some portion of the generated energy. In the future electricity grids, Mobile Energy Buffers (MEB) together with local energy buffering capabilities, will be the enabler of energy routing. In this paper, we propose an energy routing framework for low and medium voltage electricity distribution systems that house prioritized MEBs, local buffers and Delay-Tolerant electrical Loads (DTL). We model the distribution system as a token-based system where energy transfer between MEBs and local storage units rely on the availability of tokens that are generated by DTLs. Coordination of token advertisement, storage interest and token access is maintained by machine-to-machine communications. The underlying communication technology can be PowerLine Communications (PLC) or a medium-range wireless communication technology. We provide a mathematical analysis of the token-network with DTLs and prioritized MEBs. We show that coordination and prioritization allow lower blocking rates for high priority MEBs.

This article represents a simple control strategy to integrate a micro grid, including a photovoltaic (PV) system and energy storage for supplying AC loads in various grid states. The proposed control strategy provides high amount of power generation. The micro grid is controlled by inverter, which is controlled by hysteresis current control in the case of connecting to grid, and controlled through controlling a closed voltage loop in the case of islanding mode, to supply load voltage. In order to achieve the system operation in the islanding mode, a strategy for PV, the battery, and load management are proposed. Seamless transition of the PV converter control between maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and voltage control modes, of the battery converter between charging and discharging and control of inverter are ensured for different grid operation modes by the proposed control methods.

As a global society, we will need to greatly improve energy efficiency and conservation, and develop alternative and renewable energy sources, while implementing carbon sequestration strategies to stabilize the concentration of atmospheric CO 2. The carbon mineralization strategies reviewed in this chapter complement CO2 storage in subsurface pore space. This promising approach for sequestering CO2 is grounded in the fundamental processes that govern natural mineral dissolution and carbonate precipitation. Natural analogue sites allow for the study of the geochemical and biological transformation of CO2 at the field-scale; drawing our attention to potential reaction pathways that can be exploited and utilized, but also to the limitations that must be overcome in geoengineered and industrial systems designed to accelerate carbonation. Further study of natural analogues may yield a better understanding of the reaction pathways required for efficient carbonation, the long-term stability of carbonate minerals at Earth's surface, and the monitoring required for long-term storage. Enhanced weathering of natural minerals or alkaline wastes under near-surface conditions offers a low-energy means of sequestering CO2. Although this method offers the ability to aid in remediating the atmosphere, its effectiveness remains untested at large-scales. Accelerated carbonation of alkaline wastes may offer a means of reducing net greenhouse gas emission at the industrial level, while providing a testing ground for more widespread implementation. Biologically mediated carbonate precipitation is an alternate, low-energy means of sequestering CO2 that could be incorporated into efforts to produce biofuels. In situ carbon mineralization of peridotite offers substantial capacity and relatively fast carbonation rates. Industrial reactors for ex situ carbonation are technologically feasible, yet the estimated costs exceed current carbon prices. Further research and development of process routes is therefore required. Industries that produce alkaline wastes may adopt these technologies as a means of reducing their carbon footprints, while helping to further develop these technological solutions. The largest scale geologic carbon capture and storage operations currently inject ~1-3 Mt CO2/yr into subsurface pore space (Michael et al. 2009; Whittaker et al. 2011). Use of industrial wastes for carbonation may rival these rates. In the future, these two strategies may be roughly equivalent in rate and capacity: global implementation of accelerated waste carbonation could exceed the sequestration capacity of 700 CO2 injection sites. Use of a variety of industrial wastes in parallel could provide ~45% of a ""stabilization wedge,"" and deliver significant offsets at the industry-specific level (Figs. 10 and 11). Implementation of accelerated waste carbonation technologies may allow establishment of viable ex situ technologies that could then be applied to larger scale carbonation of abundant, rock forming minerals, both ex situ and in situ. Although mafic and ultramafic deposits are present in sufficient quantity to completely offset anthropogenic CO2 emissions for more than 1000 years, large-scale deployment of ex situ carbonation would require new mining activities at a scale comparable to total existing global mining operations (Power et al. 2013b). In principle, enhanced weathering and/or in situ carbonation of natural deposits could comprise an entire ""stabilization wedge,"" but these techniques are very much at the basic research stage. The capacity and rates of carbon mineralization are sufficient to offset significant portions of global greenhouse gas emissions. To realize this potential requires an interdisciplinary effort from fields ranging from the physical sciences to engineering to social sciences. Many of the strategies discussed in this chapter are technologically feasible at a level required for large-scale experimentation and even implementation at the industrial scale. In practice, a combination of ex situ carbonation of industrial waste and natural minerals, in situ carbonation of rock formations, and ongoing CO2 storage in subsurface pore space, could achieve a ""stabilization wedge"" (Fig. 11). However, financial incentives, either via a cap-and-trade mechanism or a carbon tax, are required to stimulate further innovation and research of CO2 sequestration technologies that will lead to significant CO2 sequestration via carbon mineralization or any other method proposed to date. Investigation of all of these techniques should proceed in parallel, followed by gradual adoption of a range of successful methods, using a variety of optimal strategies that depend on specific local conditions and opportunities.

This approach to motion control exploits the fact that vehicle dynamics can be described in terms of energy storage, distribution, and dissipation, and that the stable equilibrium points of mechanical systems are those at which the potential energy attains a minima. The control forces are used to transform the closed-loop dynamics into a port-controlled Hamiltonian system with dissipation. This is achieved by shaping the energy-storing characteristics of the system, modifying its interconnection structure (how the energy is distributed), and injecting damping. The end result is that the closed-loop system presents a stable equilibrium (hopefully global) at the desired operating point. By forcing the closed-loop dynamics into a Hamiltonian form, the resulting total energy function of the system serves as a Lyapunov function that can be used to demonstrate stability. We consider the tracking and regulation of fully actuated unmanned underwater vehicles, its extension to under-actuated slender vehicles, and also manifold regulation of under-actuated surface vessels.

The feasibility of concentrating solar power (CSP) systems depends on cost limitations, desired installed power capacity and direct solar insolation, where smaller scales and low-cost solutions can often be preferred to large-scale investmentintensive installations. Biomass residues of various types, on the other hand, can be considered as proven fuels for small-to-midscale utility or industry based power or cogen arrangements and utilized through various technologies. The thermodynamic integration between a biomass fired power plant and a CSP unit can help to significantly increase the availability of the plant, improve its partial load characteristics, compensate for the intermittency of the solar energy resource while preserving the purely renewable profile of the generated electricity, and at the same time showing better overall performance when compared to two separate plants while avoiding the need for costly energy storage solutions. Biomass fuels can help reach better steam conditions in a steam plant based on CSP-generated steam, and thus improve the efficiency of energy conversion for the integrated hybrid system if compared with two individual single-fuel power units. In this study, an overview of feasible solar-biomass integration concepts is presented. A deeper thermoeconomic analysis of a selected integrated utility-scale biomass and CSP electricity generation plant is attempted, with certain simplifications. Furthermore, a multiobjective optimization strategy is regarded as very necessary and thus included in the analysis, where several major environmental aspects plus the cost of electricity are involved and defined in terms of desired parameters and conditions representative to Central Europe and Southeastern United States. The results are compared with conventional power generation alternatives. On that basis, a low-parameter CSP solution integrated with conventional biomass-fired combustion unit, where solar-generated steam is being superheated by the biomass fuel, has been chosen as the focus of the analysis in this study.

Small-scale energy storage positioned at the demand side would open the possibility for enhanced predictability of power output and easier integration of small-scale intermittent generators into functioning electricity markets, as well as offering inherent peak shaving abilities for mitigating contingencies and blackouts, for reducing transmission losses in local networks, profit optimization and generally allowing tighter utility control on renewable energy generation. Distributed energy storage at affordable costs and of low environmental footprint is a necessary prerequisite for the wider deployment of renewable energy and its deeper penetration into local networks. Thermodynamic energy storage in the form of compressed air is an alternative to electrochemical energy storage in batteries and has been evaluated in various studies and tested commercially on a large scale. Distributed compressed air energy storage (DCAES) systems in combination with renewable energy generators installed at residential homes, public or commercial buildings are a viable alternative to large-scale energy storage, moreover promising lower specific investment than batteries if a mass-market is established. Flexible control methods can be applied to DCAES units, resulting in a complex system running either independently for home power supply, or as a unified and centrally controlled utility-scale energy storage entity. This study aims at conceptualizing the plausible distributed compressed-air energy storage units, examining the feasibility for their practical implementation and analyzing their behavior, as well as devising the possible control strategies for optimal utilization of grid-integrated renewable energy sources at small scales. Results show that overall energy storage efficiency of around 70% can be achieved with comparatively simple solutions, offering less technical challenges and lower specific costs than comparable electrical battery systems. Furthermore, smart load management for improving the dispatchability can bring additional benefits by profit optimization and decrease the payback time substantially.

Many techniques have been proposed to enhance solar utilization and minimize the effect of solar interruption. This paper summarizes the author's experience on enhancing the solar thermal systems by means of integration with either other energy resources or integration with thermal energy storages. On solar drying applications, a solar dryer was integrated with a thermal backup unit. The experimental results on hybrid drying showed an enhancement of 64.1% for EFB, and 61.1% for chilli, compared with open solar mode drying. Solar water heating was found to be sufficient to supply hot water during the day and night time by integration with thermal energy storage. The system was able to discharge thermal energy and maintain the heating of water to the next morning. On large scale and industrial application, a modified inclined solar chimney was enhanced via integration with wasted flue gas. By this technique, the system was brought to operate 24 hours a day. At 800 W/m2 solar intensity, the efficiency was enhanced to over 0.6% in the case of hybrid operation compared to less than 0.3% for solar mode only. Research results demonstrate that integrated solar thermal systems can contribute effectively in sustainability of clean energy resources. The results obtained, so far, from this research program are encouraging; and it is highly recommended to further investigate the solar hybrid and solar integration for energy sustainability from the sun. © 2013 WIT Press.","Energy sustainability; Hybrid solar dryer; PCM; Solar chimney; Solar energy; Solar water heater; Sustainability; TES; Waste to energy","alternative energy; energy resource; heating; integrated approach; renewable resource; solar power; sustainable development; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896080472

Different forms of carbon, including traditional carbons such as activated carbon, graphite, carbon black as well as new structures such as carbon nanotubes/nanofibers, fullerenes, porous carbons, and their composite materials, have stimulated wide research interests for novel applications. Carbon based materials in these forms have been used for catalyst supports and adsorbents and have been successful in improving overall process efficiency for which they are applied. Applications of these materials in areas related specifically to the conversion and storage of energy have been recently reported. Novel structured carbon materials, such as hierarchical carbons, display many of the attractive properties of traditional carbons are yet to find broad application. In view of the wide range of uses for carbon materials, this chapter will discuss how structured carbon materials could play a role in improving the process efficiency of energy-related processes.

The cooling effect can be produced at temperatures as low as - 40 °C, whereas the heating effect can occur at temperatures up to 350 °C. The level of operation temperatures depends on the working fluid and the salt used in the machines. Due to the intermittent nature of the heating and cooling productions, where the reaction can be halted for long periods, these machines have an inherent heat storage capability, without need of thermal insulation to prevent heat losses. Moreover, these machines have great energy saving potential because their main source of energy can be heat wasted in other processes or solar energy. Hence, this chapter starts with a description of the operation principle of these machines, followed by the presentation of the types of cycle that can be used for heat amplification, heat upgrade or for simultaneous production of useful heating and cooling effects. Then, the salts and working fluid usually employed are presented, together with the techniques that can be used to avoid salt agglomeration and the attenuation of the adsorption capacity, and the techniques that can reduce the thermal resistance of the sorbent bed. The chapter finishes with a discussion of the technical and economical feasibility of machines operating for heat upgrade, for production of simultaneous cooling and heating effect and for temperature lift.

Integral to this simulation was the incorporation of the stochasticity of a household's hourly electricity demand, which is largely determined by consumer behaviour. A Monte Carlo method was used whereby this random household behaviour was simulated with sets of probabilistic household demand.

In order to manage the demand side of electricity, time-of-day (TOD) tariffs are a simple economic mechanism that encourages consumers to smooth the diurnal demand profile by shifting consumption to off-peak times. The management of supply by renewable energy generators can be achieved using energy storage. This study investigates the use of compressed air energy storage (CAES) to de-couple a wind energy converter (WEC) from the electricity grid and manage its power output. Numerical and thermodynamic models simulate the operation of the system. One year of operation is simulated using 10 minute WEC time-step data for varying CAES capacities in order to optimize the economic performance of the total system. By selling electricity according to TOD tariff schedules, the income generated by a 0.8 MW WEC using a 4 MWh CAES system is increased by 30%. The CAES has a round-trip efficiency of 66 % and annually experiences 450 deep cycles as it stores 25% of the energy generated by the WEC. © 2013 The Authors.

To increase sub-cooling of the refrigerant at partial loads, we propose a new discharge bypass line together with an inline solenoid valve, installed after the compressor to regulate the mass flow rate of the refrigerant vapour passing through a hot water storage tank. For control design, a lumped parameter model is first developed to describe the dynamics of the system in an explicit form of input-output relationship. The system has been fully-instrumented to examine its performance under different operation conditions. The system model is then validated by extensive experimental tests. The predictions from the models exhibit a good coincidence with experimental results, judging by an RMS error less than 15%. Based on the obtained dynamic model, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is applied to optimize a cost function of the output errors and control efforts. The key challenge is to regulate the refrigerant temperature entering the condenser by controlling the valve opening. The design approach is then tested in a transient simulation tool to predict the system performance in transient conditions. The experimental results obtained from implementation with PLC demonstrate that the proposed system delivers higher system efficiency owing to the higher refrigeration effect in the direct expansion evaporator. Thus, the novel development is promising for improvement of energy efficiency, enhancement of the system performance while fulfilling the cooling demand. Consequently, between 25 and 43% of monthly electricity can be saved on average.","Energy saving; Linear quadratic regulator; Solar-assisted air-conditioner; Sub-cooling","Cooling; Cost functions; Domestic appliances; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Refrigerants; Robotics; Solenoid valves; Direct expansion evaporators; Energy efficiency improvements; Linear quadratic regulator; Lumped parameter modeling; Performance enhancements; Solar assisted; Solar assisted air conditioning; Subcoolings; Air conditioning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893610780

The attention is on how generator limits affect the solution, as well as how the addition of a small energy storage can assist in the transients. Two different types of problems are solved, minimum fuel and minimum time, with different generator limits as well as with and without an extra energy storage. In the optimization both the output power and engine speed are free variables. For this aim a 4-state mean value engine model is used together with models for the generator and energy storage losses. The considered transients are steps from idle to target power with different amounts of freedom, defined as requirements on produced energy, before the requested power has to be met. For minimum fuel transients the energy storage remains virtually unused for all requested energies, for minimum time it does not. The generator limits are found to have the biggest impact on the fuel economy, whereas an energy storage could significantly reduce the response time. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Control; Fuel economy; Powertrains; Propulsion; Transients; Engine speed; Free variable; Mean value engine modeling; Minimum time; Optimal controls; Output power; Target power; Transient operation; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893284160

Since wholesale electricity prices reflect power system conditions, arbitrage provides a service to the grid, helping to balance real-time supply and demand. While previous work on the energy arbitrage problem has used simple energy storage models, we use high fidelity TCL-specific models which allow us to understand and quantify the full capabilities and constraints of these time-varying systems. We explore two optimization/control frameworks for solving the arbitrage problem, both based on receding horizon linear programming. Since we find that the first approach requires significant computation, we develop a second approach involving decomposition of the optimal control problem into separate optimization and control problems. Simulation results show that TCLs could save on the order of 10% of wholesale energy costs via arbitrage, with savings decreasing with price forecast error. © 2013 EUCA.",,"Air conditioning; Economics; Electric energy storage; Electric load management; Linear programming; Optimal control systems; Time varying systems; Direct load control; Optimal control problem; Optimization and control; Supply and demand; System conditions; Thermostatically controlled loads; Wholesale electricity; Wholesale electricity markets; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893274626

In contrast, white adipose tissue stores energy, contributing to obesity. We investigated whether the early programming of obesity by overfeeding during lactation changes structure of interscapular brown adipose tissue in adulthood and its effects on thermogenesis. Methods: Birth of litters was considered day 0. On day 2, litter size was adjusted to normal (9 pups) and small (3 pups) litters. On day 21, the litters were weaned. A temperature transponder was implanted underneath interscapular brown adipose tissue pads of 81-day-old animals; local temperature was measured during light and dark periods between days 87 and 90. The animals were euthanized, and tissue and blood samples were collected for further analysis. The vagus and retroperitoneal sympathetic nerve activity was recorded. Results: Small litter rats presented significant lower interscapular brown adipose tissue temperature during the light (NL 37.6°C vs. SL 37.2°C) and dark (NL 38°C vs. SL 37.6°C) periods compared to controls. Morphology of small litter brown adipose tissue showed fewer lipid droplets in the tissue center and more and larger in the periphery. The activity of vagus nerve was 19,9% greater in the small litter than in control (p<0.01), and no difference was observed in the sympathetic nerve activity. In adulthood, the small litter rats were 11,7% heavier than the controls and presented higher glycemia 13,1%, insulinemia 70% and corticosteronemia 92,6%. Conclusion: Early overfeeding programming of obesity changes the interscapular brown adipose tissue structure in adulthood, leading to local thermogenesis hypoactivity, which may contribute to obesity in adults. © 2013 S.

The proposed method is applied to image processing, RS grey scale images, LiDAR rasterized data, and hyperspectral images.

With the aim of making pan bread more beneficial to health, the substitution of wheat flour (WF) at levels of 0, 10, 15 e 20% by commercial resistant starch (WF, RS1, RS2, RS3) or by unripe banana flour (WF, UBF1, UBF2, UBF3) was studied. The chemical composition of WF, RS and FB, including the content of resistant starch of the two latter, was determined and the influence of the different levels of substitution on the rheological properties of WF and on the technological quality of pan bread (specific volume, moisture content, water activity and instrumental texture) was evaluated. The results were analyzed by ANOVA and the Tukey test, at a 95% significance level, and by Principle Component Analysis (PCA). RS reduced the Falling Number of WF and UBF did not affect it. Substitution of WF by increasing amounts of RS and UBF reduced dry and wet gluten contents and increased farinographic water absorption. In the alveographic analyses, they reduced dough extensibility (L) and deformation energy (W) and increased elasticity (P). Regarding pan bread quality characteristics, there was a reduction of specific volume and an increase of moisture content and hardness at all levels of substitution of WF by RS or UBF, with all breads showing an increase in hardness during the 13-day storage period, from 2.14 to 3.32 N on the first day, and reaching 7.22 to 9.30 N on the last day. According to the results obtained, the substitution of WF by 10% RS or UBF increased the content of resistant starch in pan bread and produced bread with technological characteristics similar to the standard with only WF, thus could be suggested to introduce this component in the diet. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

At 25°C, the composites suffered significant loss in strength, as much as 47%, whereas, at 50 and 70°C, there was up to 15% gain in strength. Dynamic mechanical analysis shows that the addition of FA leads to the significant enhancement of both storage (E') and loss modulus (E"") of the composites compared to those of neat PP at a given temperature. It supports the formation of interfacial interaction between the surfaces of PP and FA. The tangent d curves of neat PP and composites showed a broader pattern of peak. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of PP was assigned at 70°C in neat PP and 73°C in composites. Crystallization kinetics of PP in composites has been studied non-isothermally and isothermally using differential scanning calorimetry at cooling/heating rates 10°C, 15°C and 20°C per min between 200°C to -30°C. Whilst neat PP showed a mono modal α crystalline phase structure only, and the presence of FA led to bimodal thermographs revealing partial transcrystallisation of α into β, to maximum 14 %. The onset and peak crystallization temperatures of all samples decreased by approx 3°C with each 5°C /min increase in cooling rate. Parameters such as crystal growth rate, dimensions and activation energy were determined using a series of established models. The Avrami graphs showed that contrary to the published data, there are two sets of straight lines a) with a lower slope at low cooling rate and b) with a distinctly higher slope for high cooling rate. Activation energy of the materials reached a maximum at 45 wt% FA. In the isothermal crystallization kinetics condition, the lowest points of the exotherm peaks shifted to higher crystallization times in the ranges of 0.75 - 1.50 min with the increasing of crystallization temperature (Tc) of PP in neat PP and composites regardless of FA percentage addition. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This has fostered the evaluation of alternative technologies for transit applications, like hydrogen fuel cells-electrochemical energy conversion devices that operate with zero emission, quieter and with higher efficiencies than internal combustion engines, specially at part load regimes. Transit bus market is particularly well suited to technology innovations because they are i) centrally fueled and maintained, ii) professionally operated on fixed routes and schedules, iii) tolerate weight and volume requirement of new technologies and, finally, whenever necessary, iv) can be subsidized by government. In this scenario, considerable research, development and testing effort has been dedicated to hydrogen fuel cell bus technology, with the engagement of governments and transit authorities, bus industry and operators. Early non hybrid fuel cell transit bus designs were focused in reliability rather than fuel economy, with efficiency penalties and reduced fuel cell lifetime, due to the impossibility of regeneration of kinetic energy and dynamic requirement on the power plant. Moreover, this design required larger fuel cells to supply all the power requirements of the vehicles, with direct effects into life cycle costs. In the light of these problems, fuel cell bus designs have evolved to hybridized concept, with fuel cell operating associated with energy storage devices/buffers (batteries, supercapacitors or both), with the possibility of recovery of part of kinetic energy and, hence, improvement of efficiency and fuel cell lifetime. Some state of art hybrid fuel cell drivetrains use a low power fuel cell working in steady state condition, recharging traction batteries, also recharged by the grid, in the so called plug-in configuration. This enables smaller fuel cells, working in a controlled regime, which means lower capital expenditures, higher efficiency and, hence, lower lifetime costs. However, when compared to non hybridized architecture, hybrid systems still present low availability, related to problems in power electronics and energy storage systems, as opposed to the fuel cell itself. Fortunately, ongoing industry effort to optimization of hybrid diesel electric concept, which uses the same electric hybrid architecture, will help to address this hurdle. To reach commercialization of Fuel Cell Transit Buses, few barriers need to be surpassed, with the optimization of i) fuel cell durability, ii) initial purchase cost, and iii) hydrogen production and delivery technology. On a Total Cost of Ownership-TCO perspective, current fuel cell buses are three to four times more costly than modern diesel buses. This additional cost is not acceptable to bus operators, unless with heavy public subsidies. This means that much has to be done in terms of technological improvement and increased volume production scale, to achieve, in the medium term, a reasonable TCO that would make fuel cell buses competitive with well established technologies on environmentally sensitive areas. This work is supposed to present an analysis of technical and economical features and performance of fuel cell bus technology, with a survey of the main barriers that need to be surpassed, and an overview of some ongoing fuel cell bus projects. © 2013 SAE INTERNATIONAL.",,"Bus transportation; Costs; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Gas fuel purification; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Internal combustion engines; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Life cycle; Molecular biology; Secondary batteries; Alternative technologies; Development and testing; Electrochemical energy conversions; Energy storage systems; Environmentally sensitive areas; Steady-state condition; Technological improvements; Total cost of ownership; Fuel cell power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891606897

In spite of the lower power cost per bit of optical networks, it is expected that one of the most challenging issues in the next decade will be reducing the power requirement for such core networks. Much of the recent work on optical grid network design has focused on optimizing the use of traditional computing and network resources in an integrated manner. In grid systems, it is typically possible to select one out of a number of possible destinations to execute a specific job. This is known as anycasting, and in this paper we propose a new approach for energy minimization in optical grids that exploits the inherent flexibility of anycasting. We present a comprehensive integer linear program (ILP) formulation that selects the destination node and performs routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) to minimize the overall energy consumption of a set of static lightpath demands. We also present a 2-stage ILP that can quickly generate solutions for large networks. Simulation results indicate that significant energy savings can be achieved by the proposed approach, not only compared to traditional RWA techniques but also over energy-aware unicast methods. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Energy utilization; Integer programming; Energy minimization; Energy optimization; High-speed data transmission; Inherent flexibility; Integer linear programs; Optical grid networks; Routing and wavelength assignment; Traditional computing; Optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891367024

Since storage nodes in wireless sensor networks have limited battery, it is valuable to find a repair scheme with optimal transmission costs (e.g., energy). The optimal-cost repair has been recently investigated in a centralized way. However a centralized control mechanism may not be available or is very expensive. For the scenarios, it is interesting to study optimal-cost repair in a decentralized setup. We formulate the optimal-cost repair as convex optimization problems for the network with convex transmission costs. Then we use primal and dual decomposition approaches to decouple the problem into subproblems to be solved locally. Thus, each surviving node, collaborating with other nodes, can minimize its transmission cost such that the global cost is minimized. We further study the optimality and convergence of the algorithms. Finally, we discuss the code construction and determine the field size for finding feasible network codes in our approaches. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Convex optimization; Costs; Light transmission; Multiprocessing systems; Optimization; Sensor nodes; Centralized control; Cloud storages; Code construction; Convex optimization problems; Distributed storage system; Dual decomposition; Optimal transmission; Transmission costs; Repair",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891352830

The nodes emerge or disappear in a stochastic manner due to the intermittent nature of natural sources such as wind speed and solar irradiation. Prediction and stochastic modelling of electrical energy flow is a critical characteristic in such a network to achieve load balancing and/or peak shaving in order to minimise the fluctuation between off peak and peak demand by power consumers. Before contributing energy to the network, a node acquires information about other nodes in the grid and the state of the grid in order to adjust its power injection to or consumption from the grid. The unpredictable behaviour of nodes in a smart grid is modelled and administered through a scheduling strategy control and learning algorithm using the historical data collected from the system. The stochastic model predicts future power consumption/injection to determine the power required for storage components. In the proposed stochastic model and the deployed learning and adaptation processes, two indicators, based on moving averages of different subsets of the time series are implemented to satisfy two objectives. The first objective is to predict the most efficient state of electrical energy flow between a distribution network and nodes. Whereas the second objective is to minimise the peak demand and off peak consumption of acquiring electrical energy from the main grid by using ant colony search algorithm (ACSA). The performance of the indicators is validated against limited autoregressive integrated moving average (LARIMA) and second order Markov Chain model. It is shown that proposed method outperforms both LARIMA and Markov Chain model. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Ant colony optimization; Chains; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Wind; Ant colony search algorithms; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Learning and adaptation; Markov chain models; Renewable energy source; Scheduling strategies; Second-order markov chains; Unstructured networks; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890854584

It is a tool developed to help process engineers in designing the production facility equipment to optimize operational efficiency and minimize GHG emissions. During the lifecycle of petroleum production facilities the material streams vary significantly. At the beginning of the operation, e.g. in the pre-salt region of Brazil, the volume of gas produced has an upward profile which reaches a maximum between 4 and 6 years of operation. Also, the CO2 content of this gas is significant and with a tendency to increase during the life of the well due to the well characteristics and due to gas re-injection (gas storage). Depending on the design and local conditions of the production facility it may also be necessary to import fuel (diesel or natural gas to produce heat and power) either since the start of the operations or when the production curve starts to decline. Many operational parameters of the processes undertaken to treat the products in an oil and gas production off-shore facility are function of time (due to variations not only in the quantity but also in the quality of the products) and, it is necessary to perform the entire material and energy balance for the operation to obtain the total GHG emissions as a function of time. A computational tool was developed using the language Delphi to perform those material and energy balances for various configurations of the facility aiming at determining the total GHG emissions from combustion, flaring and venting at each stage of the production lifetime. This implies in automating the data input as a function of time, setting up the equipment configuration for each phase of the life-cycle and obtaining a comprehensive material balance for all equipment taking into account all stages of the treatment and possible alternatives. It is thus possible to predict, for a platform's activity profile during its lifetime, the annual quantities of GHG emitted.

The main goal is to achieve energy storage by means of compressed air thanks to high isothermal efficiency compression/expansion processes. For achieving this goal, a new compression and expansion machine has been defined, using a new piston-cylinder assembly consisting of a series of concentric annuli's that fit together during compression/expansion. This will increase the heat transfer surface, allowing the heat to be removed from the system during compression and to be absorbed by the system during expansion. This feature together with low speed movement makes the process close to isothermal. First the concept of annular compression chambers is explained, with the goal of increasing the heat exchange surface. Then the new compression system with imbricated annulis is described. A test bench has been developed in order to propose an experimental validation of such a compression process concept. It is also of a great interest to compare the dry finned piston to the classic pistons available in the market.

Whereas LCFAs promote lipid accumulation and insulin resistance, diets rich in medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) have been associated with increased oxidative metabolism and reduced adiposity, with few deleterious effects on insulin action. The molecular mechanisms underlying these differences between dietary fat subtypes are poorly understood. To investigate this further, we treated C2C12 myotubes with various LCFAs (16:0, 18:1n9, and 18:2n6) and MCFAs (10:0 and 12:0), as well as fed mice diets rich in LCFAs or MCFAs, and investigated fatty acid-induced changes in mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress. MCFA-treated cells displayed less lipid accumulation, increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity, and less oxidative stress than LCFA-treated cells. These changes were associated with improved insulin action in MCFA-treated myotubes. MCFA-fed mice exhibited increased energy expenditure, reduced adiposity, and better glucose tolerance compared with LCFA-fed mice. Dietary MCFAs increased respiration in isolated mitochondria, with a simultaneous reduction in reactive oxygen species generation, and subsequently low oxidative damage.

Hydrogen stored in solid state materials is a promising method to be able to achieve the on-board applications due to its advantages of high density and safety issues. However, the challenges of high temperature and slow kinetics of hydrogen release must be addressed. Fundamentally, the temperature of hydrogen release is directly dependent on the enthalpy of the reaction. It is demonstrated that the previous approaches such as ball milling with catalysts can significantly enhance the hydrogen release rate but influence very little the thermodynamics (the enthalpy). In this talk, we report some recent research results on hydrogen storage materials (magnesium, complex hydrides and ammonia borane) confined in porous templates. It is confirmed that the hydrogen desorption temperature can be significantly decreased, which means the thermodynamics of hydrogen release reactions can be altered through nanoconfinement. © OSA 2013.",,"Ammonia; Ball milling; Enthalpy; Magnesium compounds; Temperature; Energy and environment; High temperature; Hydrogen desorption temperatures; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen release; Nanoconfinements; Recent researches; Solid-state materials; Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887771857

These applications are heavily dependent upon energy costs. Although, there are many optimization methodologies that can theoretically maximize energy cost savings, but there are none (yet) that have practically succeeded. Therefore, the goal of the new optimization strategies should not be only to solve the energyoptimization problems, but also to have constraints criteria that seek for the design and management of the water distribution systems. Some of these strategies can be used: (a) to improve the operation of pumping stations for a given water demand; (b) to include a regulating reservoir between the water supply source and the delivery system; and (c) to control water level in tanks and reservoir to prevent overflow and draining. Such initiatives are likely to be more successful if they involve a role of maintaining the safety and the reliability of the pumping station while optimizing its operation. A novel strategy that can result in minimum operation costs and can lead to less energy consumption and then utility bills is proposed in this paper. In this strategy, a new heuristic algorithm, referred to as the Adaptive Parallel Multi-objective Differential Evolution (AP-MODE), is developed and used for: (a) selecting the lowest cost or optimum pump combinations (i.e., optimal pump scheduling) in water distribution systems; (b) evaluating the total energy costs required to operate the network; and (c) determining the reservoir storage capacity (i.e., optimal reservoir operation) to store water that is pumped during peak-off hours to be used during peak periods. This strategy is applied to the water distribution system of one rural district located in Saskatoon City, Saskatchewan, Canada. The analysis indicated that the optimal operation of pump groups and regulating reservoirs are energy cost effective. © 2014 WIT Press.","Energy-efficiency; Heuristic algorithms; Pumping stations; Water distribution systems","algorithm; distribution system; energy efficiency; numerical model; optimization; pumping; water demand; water planning; water supply; Canada; Saskatchewan; Saskatoon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887584962

The nonlinearities studied include water level, area and storage relations in the reservoirs, as well as evaporation. The proposed methodology uses linear and polynomial regression to simplify the level-area-storage curves, often represented by fourth degree polynomials. For evaporation, the calculation proposed is based on the history of monthly averages storages and corresponding areas before the optimization process, eliminating the need of calculating the area that represents a nonlinear constraint in the optimization problems. The methodology was added in HIDROTERM, a nonlinear programming model applied to optimize the management and operation of the Brazilian hydrothermal system, a linked network with 143 reservoirs in which 68 are run-of-river and 75 have storage to regulate flows. Using a very conservative setting, without compromising accuracy in results, all reservoirs had level-area-storage curves simplified to first or second degree polynomials. For evaporation, only two reservoirs had a difference in the standard deviation greater than 0.5% of the long term average inflow from the estimated value to the calculated one. The processing time was reduced on average by 52%.

It consists of an on-board 10 MW wind turbine and eighteen wave energy capturing buoys along the front of a floating foundation, with pumped hydro-energy storage. The proposed floating foundation is designed for waters off the west coasts of North America and Europe, where strong winds and high waves prevail. To operate the wind turbine safely, the design provides viable performance in waves and possesses the hydrodynamic attribute of being a wave amplifier such that the buoys may capture twice as much wave energy as in open water. The proposed wave energy capture and conversion design provide both protection against breaking wave impacts and good access for repair and maintenance, heretofore two major technical obstacles in the way of offshore wave energy exploitation. As shown by rough assessment of the proposed floating facility, its improved cost effectiveness may allow a major move from onshore to offshore wind turbines. Since the levelized cost of onshore wind farms is about equal to conventional coal plants and roughly 30% lower than an advanced coal plant with carbon dioxide capture and storage, the proposed offshore facility may prove a viable, large scale alternative to coal plants since available land and wind resource are somewhat limited for onshore wind farms. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Buoys; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal storage; Cost effectiveness; Electric utilities; Offshore oil well production; Onshore wind farms; Wind turbines; Breaking wave impacts; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Energy conversion and storages; Floating foundations; Offshore facilities; Offshore wave energy; Pumped-hydro energy storages; Repair and maintenance; Wave energy conversion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887474967

Blood and tissues were collected for metabolic analysis and testes were removed for histology and morpho-metry.

Seminiferous tubules were greater in diameter in animals captured in fall and winter, indicating a higher investment in spermatic production during these seasons. The percentage of Leydig cells was higher in summer compared to fall and winter. We suggest that M. molossus presents a type of seasonal reproduction with two peaks of testicular activity: one in fall, with higher sperm production (spermatogenesis), and another in summer, with higher hormone production (steroidogenesis). The metabolic pattern may be associated with reproductive events, especially due to the highest fat storage observed in the fall, which coincides with the further development of the seminiferous tubules.","Histology; Insectivorous; Males; Metabolism; Spermatogenesis","Animalia; Chiroptera; Mammalia; Molossidae; Molossus molossus; glycogen; lipid; animal; article; bat; classification; cytology; energy metabolism; growth, development and aging; male; metabolism; obesity; physiology; season; seminiferous tubule; spermatogenesis; Adiposity; Animals; Chiroptera; Energy Metabolism; Glycogen; Lipids; Male; Seasons; Seminiferous Tubules; Spermatogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887355766

However, the feeding response to stress varies among individuals with some increasing and others decreasing food intake after stress. In addition to the impact of acute lifestyle and genetic backgrounds, the early life environment can have a life-long influence on neuroendocrine mechanisms connecting stress to feeding behavior and may partially explain these opposing feeding responses to stress. In this review I will discuss the perinatal programming of adult hypothalamic stress and feeding circuitry. Specifically I will address how early life (prenatal and postnatal) nutrition, early life stress, and the early life hormonal profile can program the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the endocrine arm of the body's response to stress long-term and how these changes can, in turn, influence the hypothalamic circuitry responsible for regulating feeding behavior. Thus, over- or under-feeding and/or stressful events during critical windows of early development can alter glucocorticoid (GC) regulation of the HPA axis, leading to changes in the GC influence on energy storage and changes in GC negative feedback on HPA axis-derived satiety signals such as corticotropin-releasing-hormone. Furthermore, peripheral hormones controlling satiety, such as leptin and insulin are altered by early life events, and can be influenced, in early life and adulthood, by stress. Importantly, these neuroendocrine signals act as trophic factors during development to stimulate connectivity throughout the hypothalamus. The interplay between these neuroendocrine signals, the perinatal environment, and activation of the stress circuitry in adulthood thus strongly influences feeding behavior and may explain why individuals have unique feeding responses to similar stressors. © 2013 Spencer.","Development; Glucocorticoids; Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; Insulin; Leptin","corticotropin releasing factor; glucocorticoid; insulin; leptin; adulthood; connectome; early life stress; feeding behavior; food intake; human; hypothalamus; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; maternal nutrition; negative feedback; nonhuman; nutrition; perinatal period; perinatal programming; physiological process; postnatal nutrition; postnatal stress; prenatal period; prenatal stress; review; satiety; stress",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886954178

Here, the HESS is a combination of Lithium battery and Ultra-Capacitor (UC), which is useful for many high energy and high power applications such as Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and renewable energy. The sizing formulas are based on initial cost and 10-years battery replacement cost which is arranged as an optimization problem. For battery replacement cost, the Lithium battery capacity depletion formulas are studied for a LiFePO4 battery. As a case study, application of HESS in a Series Hybrid Electric Bus (SHEB) is considered. The results show by the addition of UC, the Lithium battery life is improved significantly. Furthermore, the optimum sizing of the HESS is dependent to the SHEB driving cycle. Therefore, considering the power profile of the HESS in its sizing process may reduce HESS cost. This effect is studied in three different cycles of the SHEB. In addition, the formulation is applied to cyclebased optimization of the Power Distribution Control Strategy (PDCS) of the HESS by dynamic programming.

The energy harvesters provide an everlasting but unreliable energy source compared to conventional batteries with fixed energy storages. The packet loss probabilities of the Kalman filtering depend on both the sensor transmission energy and time varying wireless fading channel gains. We minimize either a finite horizon sum or the long term average (infinite horizon) of the trace of the expected error covariance of the Kalman filter subject to energy harvesting constraints. The resulting Markov decision process problems with constraints are approached using the dynamic programming principle for both causal and non- causal system information. Using the concept of submodularity, the structure of the optimal transmission energy policy is studied. Numerical simulation results are presented illustrating the performance of the energy allocation algorithms.

However, the present CO2 emission tends to be higher than expected due to the chilled water supply-demand gap. To efficiently manage the gap, this paper introduces a novel chilled water supply-demand gap model and proposes an integrated GDC and Data Center (DC) control based on the model. The gap model, defined by GDC plant and DC controllable parameters, estimates the required additional chilled water supply. Then, DC and chillers in the plant are controlled based on the model to minimize the required additional supply. The analysis using GDC operational data in Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS shows that the accuracy of the models depends on temperature differences between rooms and outdoor, Steam Absorption Chillers (SAC) operations and the target period of the models. Thus, the analysis suggests that GDC with room and outdoor temperature sensors, SAC operation scheduling, and thermal storage tank (TES) can improve accuracy of the model and optimize the GDC operations more accurately to reduce CO2 emission. © 2013 IEEE.","chilled water; Data Center; Gas District Cooling; job scheduling","Carbon dioxide; District heating; Heat storage; Scheduling; Water supply; Chilled water; Controllable parameters; Data centers; District cooling; Job scheduling; Operation scheduling; Outdoor temperature; Temperature differences; Cooling water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886577349

We undertook the current study to attempt to determine the degree to which up regulation of mRNA transcription was involved in the gland's activation. cDNA libraries were created from mRNA isolated from rectal glands of fasted (7 days post-feeding) and fed (6 h and 22 h post-feeding) spiny dogfish sharks (Squalus acanthias), and the libraries were subjected to suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) analysis. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was also used to ascertain the mRNA expression of several genes revealed by the SSH analysis. In total the treatments changed the abundance of 170 transcripts, with 103 up regulated by feeding, and 67 up regulated by fasting. While many of the changes took place in 'expected' Gene Ontology (GO) categories (e.g., metabolism, transport, structural proteins, DNA and RNA turnover, etc.), KEGG analysis revealed a number of categories which identify oxidative stress as a topic of interest for the gland. GO analysis also revealed that branched chain essential amino acids (e.g., valine, leucine, isoleucine) are potential metabolic fuels for the rectal gland. In addition, up regulation of transcripts for many genes in the anticipated GO categories did not agree (i.e., fasting down regulated in feeding treatments) with previously observed increases in their respective proteins/enzyme activities. These results suggest an 'anticipatory' storage of selected mRNAs which presumably supports the rapid translation of proteins upon feeding activation of the gland. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Elasmobranchs; Feeding; Ion transport; Metabolism; Rectal gland; Transcript regulation","adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); alpha 2 macroglobulin; alpha actinin 2; cystathionine gamma lyase; cytochrome c oxidase; endophilin; epididymal secretory protein; ferritin; glutamate ammonia ligase; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; high mobility group protein; inter alpha trypsin inhibitor; isopentenyl diphosphate delta isomerase; lactate dehydrogenase; malate dehydrogenase; messenger RNA; ornithine carbamoyltransferase; peptidylprolyl isomerase; phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); RNA directed DNA polymerase; succinate dehydrogenase; tetraspanin; transcriptome; tumor protein; voltage dependent anion channel; von Willebrand factor; animal tissue; article; catabolism; cell division; cell metabolism; cell proliferation; energy expenditure; ion transport; male; morphology; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; rectum gland; RNA processing; Squalus; suppression subtractive hybridization; upregulation; urea cycle; Elasmobranchii; Squalidae; Squalus acanthias; Elasmobranchs; Feeding; Ion transport; Metabolism; Rectal gland; Transcript regulation; Animals; Fasting; Food; Ion Transport; Male; Oxidative Stress; RNA, Messenger; Salt Gland; Squalus acanthias; Up-Regulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886479434

Conventional synchronous generators can help to compensate for wind fluctuations, but the slow behavior of such systems may result in stability concerns. Here, the virtual inertia method, which imitates the kinetic inertia of synchronous generator, is used to improve the system dynamic behavior. Since the proposed method focuses on short-term oscillations and incorporates no long-term power regulation, it needs no mass storage device. Thus, the method is economical. To prevent any additional cost, the rotating mass connected to the DFIG shaft or a super-capacitor connected to the DC-link of a back-to-back inverter of a wind power generator could be used. The concept and the proposed control methods are discussed in detail. Eigen-value analysis is used to study how the proposed method improves system stability. The advantages and disadvantages of using DFIG rotating mass or super-capacitor as the virtual inertia source are compared. The proposed approach also shows that while virtual inertia is not incorporated directly in long-term frequency and power regulation, it may enhance the system steady-state behavior indirectly. A time domain simulation is used to verify the results of the analytical studies. © 2012 IEEE.","DFIG; DG; Islanding; Microgrid; Rotating mass; Super-capacitor; Virtual inertia; Wind power","DFIG; DG; Islanding; Micro grid; Rotating mass; Super-capacitor; Virtual inertia; Capacitors; Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Synchronous generators; System stability; Time domain analysis; Virtual storage; Wind power; Electric fault currents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886446794

TS targeting methodology with Time Slices, which is comparable to Heat Integration for batch processes, have been introduced for a short-term, day-to-day analysis. Energy storage facility is integrated in the TS to address the problem of energy supply variation. However, previous studies have mostly dealt with the daily or short term variations. This work introduces an extended methodology for TS integration for the long-term energy supply and demand planning. The work is important in solving cases with a considerable temporal fluctuation of heat sources/sinks, in order to obtain more energy saving opportunities within a longer period of time (i.e., in the scale of weeks or even months). The energy fluctuation in processing plants may be caused by seasonal climate variations, long-term customer demands or even economic down-turn. Some other possibilities include operability issues and raw material availability. The methodology can also be implemented for district heating and cooling systems in countries with four seasons, assuming energy excess during the summer can be stored for use in other seasons e.g. during the winter. This methodology is demonstrated by a case study which involves integration of batch processing plants and space heating system together with cooling system which only operates during certain periods of time.

It consists of three major steps, in which thermal energy has to be supplied at different temperature levels, leading to multiple products, such as clean water, nutrients/salts and methane rich syngas. Microalgae have an important potential as a new source of biomass, principally due to the fact that they can grow much faster than others biomass feedstock available in nature. Considering the energy balance of the algae cultivation step, the gasification process and thecrude product upgrading step, part of the converted syngas has to be used to close the energy balance. In this context, solar heat can be considered as an alternative to replace the heat that has to be generated from product or crude product burning. This would lead to higher fuel production, higher carbon conversion efficiency and in general a better sustainable use of energy sources. In this paper, the goal is to show the integration potential of solar thermal energy use in the catalytic hydrothermal gasification of microalgae. In order to maximize the fuel production, thermal energy requirements of the gasification and SNG upgrading process can be generated in concentrating solar systems, coupled with thermal energy storage. This allows to continuously provide heat for the process at different temperature levels. A superstructure of design models will permit the estimation of the optimal size and integration of the solar utility for different process configurations. The optimal design configurations are evaluated by solving a multi objective optimization problem which aims at the maximization of conversion efficiency and the minimization of operating and total production costs.

Changes in ocean heat content dominate the Earth's energy storage; and the ocean's thermal expansion has been a major contributor to sea-level rise in the twentieth century and likely to be the largest contributor in the twenty-first century. The agreement between changes in ocean heat storage over recent decades and changes in the Earth's radiative balance, within uncertainties, provides strong support for current understanding of anthropogenic climate change. As a result of improvements in observations and modeling of sea level and components contributing to sea-level change, there is now an improved explanation for twentieth century sea-level rise. Models project a continuing sea-level rise during the twenty-first century and beyond. However, a number of uncertainties remain in our understanding of the global mean and regional distribution of sea-level rise resulting from changes in ocean circulation and changes in the Earth's gravitational field.

The enhanced reversible capacity of reduced graphene oxides is attributed to specific functionalities rather than to exceptional large specific surface area or structure defect. The contributed capacities at potential higher than 1.5 V and in region of 0.8-1.5 V are attributed dominantly to phenol groups and cyclic edge ether groups, respectively.

Two different types of problems are solved, minimum fuel and minimum time, with and without an extra energy storage. In the optimization both the output power and engine speed are free variables. For this aim a 4-state mean value engine model is used together with a model for the generator losses as well as the losses of the energy storage. The considered transients are steps from idle to target power with different requirements on produced energy, used as a measure on the freedom in the optimization before the requested power has to be met. For minimum fuel transients the energy storage remains unused for all requested energies, for minimum time it does not. The minimum time solution is found to both minimize the response time of the powertrain and also provide good fuel economy. For larger requested energies with energy storage the response time is immediate, with an energy storage of only 10-20Wh.","Diesel-Electric Powertrain; Optimal Control","Energy storage; Engines; Fuel economy; Fuels; Power quality; Powertrains; Electric power trains; Engine speed; Free variable; Mean value engine modeling; Optimal controls; Output power; Transient controls; Transient operation; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885935648

A feeding experiment was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant effect of dietary addition of rosemary, chokeberry pomace, rosehip, or nettle in comparison with vitamin E. Male Ross PM3 broilers caged in groups of 6 (4 replicated cages per treatment) were fed a balanced diet supplemented with 25 g/kg of herbal additive, 200 IU of α-tocopheryl acetate/ kg, or without supplementation from d 7 to 35. Intake, performance, and with the help of excreta samples, apparent fiber digestibility, ME content, and metabolizability of nitrogen and energy were recorded per cage. Feed was analyzed for total phenols and tocopherols. In each bird (n = 24 per treatment), carcass weight and relative organ weights were recorded, and skin and liver color were assessed. Abdominal fat was analyzed for induction time (h) of lipid oxidation (Rancimat). Breast meat was analyzed for total tocopherol content (mg/kg) and development of TBA reactive substances (TBARS; μg of MDA/kg) over 9 d of storage. Data were subjected to ANOVA considering treatment and, where applicable, storage time. Rosemary supplementation reduced oxidation (TBARS d 9: 201; induction time: 2.48) and elevated tocopherol content (5.72) of the meat compared with control (470, 1.87, and 3.53, respectively). Rosemary-treated birds had a slightly lower carcass weight and a reduced nitrogen and energy metabolizability. Rosehip addition numerically decreased TBARS (319) and enhanced carcass weight (1.71 kg) compared with rosemary-treated birds (1.54 kg). Only a trend in antioxidant activity could be ascribed to chokeberry pomace, although dietary phenolic content was highest. Nettle did not improve oxidative stability (TBARS: 506; induction time: 1.91), although tocopherol content was elevated (6.51).

However, the economic benefit of BECCS nearly vanishes if an overshoot of the temperature target is not allowed. Finally, the least-cost emission pathway over the next 50 years towards a 1.5 ° C overshoot target with BECCS is almost identical to a pathway leading to a 2 ° C ceiling target. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon capture; Bio-energy; Bio-energy systems; Carbon capture and storage; Economic benefits; Global energy; Global temperatures; Model results; Atmospheric temperature; bioenergy; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate modeling; concentration (composition); cost-benefit analysis; environmental economics; global climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885643388

The objective is to obtain, through a locally-defined geometric decomposition of a given drift vector field, a potential similar to the thermodynamically-defined availability function proposed in the literature. The mixed potential is obtained by homotopy integration of a differential one-form for the drift vector field which decomposes the system into an exact part (generated by a potential) and an anti-exact part (which is not directly generated by a potential). The key element in the proposed approach is the computation of an integrating factor for the anti-exact part of the dynamics.

However, given that their latency is only 50% lower than that of main memory, DRAM caches considerably increase latency for misses. They also incur a significant energy overhead for remote lookups in snoop-based multi-socket systems. Ideally, it would be possible to detect in advance that a request will miss in the DRAM cache and thus selectively bypass it. This work proposes a ""dual grain filter"" which successfully predicts whether an access is a hit or a miss in most cases. Experimental results with commercial and scientific workloads show that a 158KB dual-grain filter can correctly predict data block residency for 85% of all accesses to a 256MB DRAM cache. As a result, average off-die latency with our filter is within 8% of that possible with a perfectly accurate filter, which is impractical to implement. © 2013 EDAA.",,"Dies; Static random access storage; Data blocks; Energy overheads; Grain filters; Lookups; Main memory; Reduced energy; Scientific workloads; Working set; Dynamic random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885584097

The thin films have been characterized using Secondary Electron Yield (SEY) measurements, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) and X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS). For more than 100 carbon thin films prepared by sputtering the average maximum SEY is 0.98 ± 0.07 after air transfer. The density of the films is lower than the density of Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG), a fact which partially explains their lower SEY. XPS shows that magnetron sputtered samples exhibit mainly sp2 type bonds. The intensity on the high binding energy side of C1s is found to be related to the value of the SEY. In addition the initial surface concentration of oxygen has no influence on the resulting SEY, when it is below 16%. The thin films produced by PECVD have a much higher maximum SEY of 1.49 ± 0.07.

To reverse this trend, new products could be developed specifically targeted to high-value niche markets. Cereal bars stand out as fast food high in nutritional value. A bar formula mimicking cereal bars was prepared using a mixture of Brazilian cassava flour, hydrogenated vegetable fat, dried bananas, ground cashew nuts, and glucose syrup. After being pressed, the bars were dried for 1 hour at 65 °C, packaged in films, and stored under ambient conditions. Its stability was continuously monitored for 210 days in order to ensure its safety and enable its introduction to the market. Texture loss was observed in the packed bars after 90 days of storage, but the sensory characteristics allowed the testers to perceive this tendency after only 30 days of storage. However, chemical, physical, and microbial analyses confirmed that the bars were safe for consumption for 180 days. The results showed that a 45 g cassava flour-based bar enriched with nuts and dried fruits can meet 6% of the recommended daily fiber intake with a caloric value between that of the common cereal bar and that of an energy bar. Adapting the formula with ingredients (fruits, nuts) from different regions of Brazil may add value to this traditional product as a fast food.","Fast food; Market; Microbiology; Stability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885409452

The dehydration process could be an alternative for the exploitation of this product, and the relationship between moisture content and water activity provides useful information for its processing and storage. The aim of this study was to determine the thermodynamic properties of the water sorption of jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) as a function of moisture content. Desorption isotherms of the different parts of the jackfruit (pulp, peduncle, mesocarp, peel, and seed) were determined at four different temperatures (313.15, 323.15, 333.15, and 343.15 K) in a water activity range of 0.02-0.753 using the static gravimetric method. Theoretical and empirical models were used to model the desorption isotherms.

The issue of trace element emissions during coal combustion, however, has important implication on the operation of Oxy-fuel combustors using different types of coals, as the inclusion of excessive amounts of these elements in the gas is harmful to the health and environment with additional implications for CO 2 transport and storage. Though a number of studies have been carried out to investigate the distribution of trace elements in air combustion, limited data are available on Oxyfuel combustion for different grades of coals. In this study, thermodynamic equilibrium calculations, using FactSage software, were performed to predict the trace elements (Cr, As, Se and Hg) speciation during Oxy-fuel combustion of Victorian brown coal at different temperatures (800-1400 °C). These predicted trace element emissions from Oxy-fuel combustion were also compared with that from air combustion. It was found that the amount of toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) species, such as CrO2(OH)2, in the vapour phase was greater for Oxy-fuel combustion than that for air combustion. This is due to the presence of water vapour in the Oxy-fuel atmosphere. At low temperature the distributions of toxic arsenic and selenium species in Oxy-fuel combustion showed almost the same behaviour as in air combustion. The model also indicates that the mercury emissions were marginally greater for Oxy-fuel combustion than for air combustion. These results are important for the selection of operating conditions to the emitted trace elements within permissible limits. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) analysis based on the Black equation found that the EM failure times at room temperature are 1.2 × 104, 40 and 9.2 × 10 2 years and the activation energies (Ea) of EM process are 1.07, 0.57 and 0.68 eV for GST, N-GST and Ce-GST, respectively. Moreover, the calibration of the current density exponent, n, of Black's equation found n values are close to 2 for all samples, implying the dominance of grain boundary diffusion during the mass transport of EM process. For doped GSTs, the inferior EM failure lifespans and smaller Ea values were ascribed to the grain refinement effect which increases the number of grain boundaries in such samples. It consequently promoted the short-circuit diffusion and accelerated the EM failure in doped GSTs. The Blech-type tests on GSTs found that the threshold product, i.e., the product of current density and sample length ((j.L)th), is 200 A/cm for GST, 50 A/cm for N-GST and 66.67 A/cm for Ce-GST.

Analytical results illustrated that the electrostatic force effect dominates the EM failure in samples with short strip lengths while the electron-wind force effect dominates the EM failure in samples with long strip lengths.

High-temperature pretreatment (e.g., torrefaction) at the temperature range greater than 250 °C led to higher degradation rate of sugars and extractives, which is not preferable for fuel and chemicals production from lignocellulosic biomass. Instead, high-temperature pretreatment was used to upgrade the solid fuel for thermochemical conversion (e.g., combustion and gasification). It can remove the moisture and volatiles with a low-heating value of the native biomass, which favors for the ease of fuel combustion compared to the raw wood. In addition, it can increase the hydrophobicity of the biomass which improves their handling and storage performance. In this chapter, the production chain of the wood pellet production with incorporating recent novel pretreatment technologies (torrefaction, steam explosion, and hydrothermal carbonization) were discussed. The resulted pellets are a uniform feedstock for producing chemicals, heat, and energy via biochemical and thermochemical conversion, respectively. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Biomass preprocessing; Drying; Grinding; Hydrothermal carbonization; Pellet quality; Pretreatment; Steam explosion; Torrefaction; Wood pellet","Biomass; Carbonization; Combustion; Cost effectiveness; Degradation; Drying; Fuels; Grinding (machining); Indicators (chemical); Lignocellulosic biomass; Pelletizing; Thermochemistry; Wood; Wood fuels; Hydrothermal carbonization; Pellet quality; Pre-Treatment; Steam explosion; Torrefaction; Wood pellet; Wood chemicals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884233825

Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) is used to provide load shifted thermal energy at small temperature swing with high storage density, hence an overall more compact energy system. However, the low thermal conductivity of the majority of the phase change materials (PCMs) necessitates delicate design of the active storage unit to meet power demand (high enough energy extraction/storage per amount of time).A performance analysis of two LHTES configurations is carried out in this work. Thermal charge and discharge rate of single PCM is compared with multistage LHTES using a cascade design of multiple PCMs at various phase change temperatures in a submerged finned pipe heat exchanger design. The work is conducted with a validated finite element based numerical simulation for evaluation of both full charge/discharge cycle and continuous half charge/discharge cycles.The results show that in full charge/discharge mode, the thermal performance of a multi-PCM LHTES may be improved by 10-40% as compared to that of a homogeneous single-PCM storage unit in terms of thermal charge/discharge rate. This is due to the capability of the multistage LHTES to maintain a higher driving temperature difference for the heat transfer process in the charging and discharging processes. In half charge/discharge cycling mode, however, the thermal power rating performance of multi-PCM storage converges towards that of the single-PCM storage in melting process, reducing thus the multi-PCM enhancement.

The surplus is used in a local heat and power plant. Studies have been and are being carried out to find alternative use for the high calorific gases, especially the coke oven gas. The different gas flows typically are mixtures of irregularly distributed transients and non-periodic contents of different duration. Slowly varying fluctuations can probably be parried by good production planning. For shorter wavelengths some kind of safety margin could be appropriate, perhaps in the range 0.75-1.5kNm3/h. However, the existing buffer capacity in gasholders, etc. is too small to cover the fluctuations. Good production planning can partly compensate low buffer capacity. An example from a period without gas holder is discussed.We describe analysis of the gas flows that can be used both for better production planning and for efficient external use, e.g., for fuel production. Rather than traditional Fourier analysis, we use wavelet analysis, which is better suited for analyzing the irregular and nonperiodic characteristics of the gas flows.

Data compression is one of the techniques being explored to mitigate the effects of these issues. Compressive sensing (CS) introduces a means of reproducing a signal with a much less number of samples than the Nyquist's rate, reducing the energy consumption, data storage and transfer cost. This paper explores the applicability of CS for SHM, in particular for damage detection and localization. CS is implemented in a simulated environment to compress SHM data. The reconstructed signal is verified for accuracy using structural response data obtained from a series of tests carried out on a reinforced concrete (RC) slab. Results show that the reconstruction was close, but not exact as a consequence of the noise associated with the responses. However, further analysis using the reconstructed signal provided successful damage detection and localization results, showing that although the reconstruction using CS is not exact, it is sufficient to provide the crucial information of the existence and location of damage. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications.","Compressive sensing; Damage detection and localization; Wireless sensor networks","Compressed sensing; Concrete slabs; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Reinforced concrete; Signal reconstruction; Structural analysis; Structural health monitoring; Wireless sensor networks; Compressive sensing; Detection and localization; High energy consumption; Prevailing issues; Simulated environment; Structural damage detection; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Structural response; Damage detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883671996

In traditional power system, ES play a relatively minor role, but as the intermittent renewable energy (RE) resources or distributed generators and advanced technologies integrate into the power grid, storage becomes the key enabler of low-carbon, smart power systems for the future. Most RE sources cannot provide steady energy supply and introduce a potential unbalance in energy supply and load demand. ES can buffer sizable portion of energy generated by different intermittent RE sources during low demand time and export it back into the network as required. ES can be utilized in load shifting, energy management and network voltage regulations. It can play a large role in supplementing peaking generation to meet short-period peak load demand. ES technologies are classified considering energy and power density, response time, cost, lifetime and efficiency. Different application requires different types of ES system (ESS). IEEE 1547 and AS 4777 provide guideline to connect RE and storage into the distribution network. Based on the standards, utility operators plan in gradual integration of RE into the grid. Storage can play significant role in reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission by maximizing RE utilization. As the utility operator needs to support costly peak load demand which could be supported by storage and as a consequence, storage can help in energy cost reduction. Although, the present cost of storage considered a barrier for extensive use, however, research is going on for low-cost, high-performance storage system. Therefore, in the low-carbon future power system, ES will play a significant role in increasing grid reliability and enabling smart grid capabilities for sustainable future by balancing RE output. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.",,"Carbon; Cost reduction; Data storage equipment; Electric power transmission networks; Greenhouse gases; HPSS; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Voltage regulators; Advanced technology; Distributed generators; Energy cost reduction; Grid reliability; Low-carbon futures; Peak load demand; Renewable energies; Traditional power system; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883614069

The authors present Svalinn, a framework that provides comprehensive analysis of multibit error protection overheads to facilitate better architecture-level design choices. Supported protection techniques include hardening, parity, error-correcting code, parity prediction, residue codes, and spatial and temporal redundancy. The overheads of these are characterized via synthesis and, as a case study, presented here in the context of a simple OpenRISC core. The analysis provided by Svalinn shows the difference in protection overheads per component and circuit category in terms of area, delay, and energy. The authors show that the contribution of logic components to the area of a simple core increases from 35 percent to as much as 54 percent with comprehensive multibit error protection. They also observe that the overhead of protection could increase from 29 percent to as much as 97 percent when transitioning from single-bit to multibit protection. Analysis of Svalinn also suggests that storage components will continue to benefit from the use of error-correcting code, whereas products requiring comprehensive coverage of logic components might use redundancy and residue codes.

The field is 285 km offshore in water depths of 900 to 1000 m, and contains about 16 Tcf OGIP of very dry gas within a large, very low-relief faulted anticline covering about 800 sq. km. It has been appraised by four additional wells and a 3D seismic survey, and is being evaluated for development. The Scarborough reservoir consists of Early Cretaceous deepwater turbidite sands deposited in a basin-floor fan setting. These sands were sourced from the expansive, northward-prograding Barrow Group fluvio-deltaic system located some 50 km to the south of Scarborough. The reservoir interval is a three-tiered fan sequence with variable sand content and quality: A high-quality, high net-to-gross Lower Fan unit which contains the majority of the gas-in-place, overlain by lower net-to-gross and lower quality Middle and Upper fans. The dominant reservoir lithofacies are quartzose medium- And fine-grained sandstones which are largely unlithified and uncemented, with average porosities of greater than 30% and permeabilities of 100's to 1000's of millidarcies. The background lithofacies are mudstones and siltstones which straddle the silt-mud boundary. Static geological models and dynamic flow simulation models have been used to integrate seismic and well data, petrophysical analysis, and sedimentologic and stratigraphic interpretation. Outcrop analogues for deepwater basin-floor fan systems include the extensive, well-exposed and well-studied Permian Ecca Formation of the southern Karoo Basin, South Africa, the Carboniferous Ross Formation of western Ireland, and the Eocene Ainsa Formation of northern Spain. These outcrop analogues suggest that siltstone facies are bottom-loaded within genetically related depositional packages. Reservoir models were used to investigate the effects of stratigraphic organisation and lithofacies distribution on reservoir performance predictions. By reference to outcrop analogues, an hierarchical approach was developed to systematically distribute depositional facies and lithofacies within the models. This permitted investigation of the effect of stratigraphic features of different scales on predicted production rates, reservoir performance and individual well performance. Three hierarchical levels of facies models were incorporated into the stratigraphic zones. Two levels define deterministic and stochastic depositional facies geometries, and the third and finest level is lithofacies, or reservoir rock type. Seismic data were used to map large-scale depositional facies elements, and lithofacies were interpreted from well logs calibrated to conventional cores. The use of lithofacies distributed within depositional facies provides flexibility in the modelling workflow, provides the template for distribution of the rock properties of porosity, horizontal and vertical permeability, and water saturation, and allows systematic investigation of the effect of siltstone baffles on predicted flow streams, particularly on the timing of water arrival. The field is predicted to have a strong flank- And bottom-water drive in the Lower Fan and flank-water drive in the Middle and Upper fans. The siltstone baffles at various scales are expected to affect ultimate gas recovery, reservoir flow streams, and individual well performance, especially because of the limited gas column height and limited ability to handle water production. These baffles are expected to provide some protection from early water arrival.",,"Digital storage; Drive-in facilities; Energy management; Floors; Gas industry; Gases; Gasoline; Offshore gas fields; Offshore oil well production; Oil wells; Petroleum geology; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Petrophysics; Porosity; Seismology; Stochastic systems; Stratigraphy; Well logging; Hierarchical approach; Hierarchical level; North west shelves; Petrophysical analysis; Reservoir performance; Reservoir rock types; Stratigraphic features; Vertical permeabilities; Deposition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883401543

As a consequence, the use of stored energy to support and optimize the generation, transmission, and distribution subsystems has been grown up worldwide. One of the ESS applications is using them for load leveling. Since network losses is a square function of current, shifting load from peak to off-peak periods can potentially reduce system losses. This paper gives a quantitative survey of the possible reduction in losses, for a situation where distribution feeder load is shifted in time but not reduced. Load leveling practice will be done by an ESS unit installed in the distribution substation. Various factors governing loss reduction such as transformer side installation (MV/LV) are analyzed. Also, required ESS characteristics like Ampere-hour (Ah) capacity, current, power, and charge /discharge speed to ideally leveling the load are presented.

However, solar is an intermittent power source and households remain completely dependent on a ?less than green? electricity grid for reliable electricity. Further, much of the energy impact of PV occurs outside of the conventional boundaries of PV life-cycle analyses (LCA). This paper examines these competing observations and explores the broader impacts of a high penetration of household PV using Melbourne, Victoria as a reference. It concludes that in a grid dominated by unsequestered coal and gas, PV provides a legitimate source of emission abatement at high, but declining costs, with the potential for network and peak demand support. It may be technically possible to integrate a high penetration of PV, but the economic and energy cost of accommodating high-penetration PV erodes much of the benefits. Future developments in PV, storage, and integration technologies may allow PV to take on a greater long term role, but in the time horizon usually discussed in climate policy, a large-scale expansion of household PV may hinder rather than assist deep cuts to the emission intensity of Australia's electricity system. © 2013 by the authors.","Embodied energy; EROI; Greenhouse emissions; Peak demand; Solar PV","cost-benefit analysis; demand-side management; emission control; environmental management; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; photovoltaic system; power generation; production cost; renewable resource; residential energy; solar power; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883103340

The increasing capacity of the power storages in the electric vehicles (EV) motivates this concept and makes it more feasible. However, the privacy of the customers can be compromised by tracing the stations that an EV has been connected to during a period of the time. The stations that are providing power charging as well as purchasing the power back from EVs can be owned by third party businesses. EVs should be authenticated through these stations in order to give or receive appropriate credit for the power. In this paper, we identify potential privacy issues and propose a robust privacy-preserving authentication scheme for communication of the EV and the station to prevent customer information leakage. In our approach, the EV and the station communication utilizes pseudonym of the EV, in which only the smart grid server (a trusted entity) can map the pseudonym to the real vehicle identity and provide the identity management. The pseudonym of an EV changes when the EV moves from one station to another, which prevents the adversary from tracing foot prints of the EV. Our analysis shows that our model is robust enough to make sure the privacy of the customers is fully preserved, and at the same time, it is efficient by consuming very limited resources. © 2013 IEEE.","Electric Vehicle; Identity Management; Privacy; Pseudonymity; Security; Smart Grid; Untraceability","Authentication; Communication; Data privacy; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Sales; Smart power grids; Identity management; Pseudonymity; Security; Smart grid; Un traceabilitys; Vehicle to vehicle communications",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883005228

Consequently, the system frequency immediately reflects changes in the system loads. Pumped storage units are crucial for controlling power frequency. These units provide main or auxiliary capacities, reducing the allocation of frequency-regulating reserve (FRR) and further reducing generation costs in system operations. Taiwan's Longmen Nuclear Power Plant is set to be converted for commercial operations, which will significantly alter the spinning reserves in the power system. Thus, this study proposes a safe and economic pumped storage unit dispatch strategy.

Among available storage solutions, Li-ion batteries are considered as the most attractive and are set to be used in the next generation of hybrid and electric vehicles. This is due to their superiority in energy density, power density, and low self-discharge and high cycle life compared to other chemistries. However, there are some limitations associated with Li-ion battery; among them is the operating temperature range. Any deviation from a narrow temperature range may result in low overall performance and potential degradation of the cells. In this paper, impact of ambient temperature on the A123 Li-ion batteries performance is investigated. A123 cells have been tested under constant charge-discharge cycles, hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) tests and also standard drive cycle tests. Impact of temperature on the cell capacity, open circuit voltage (OCV) and internal resistance is discussed. Afterwards, a model of series hybrid Malibu developed in Autonomie software is presented.

For 1), a global search method was used to locate a suitable-sized battery set and SCs under a preset cost function and basic properties. The cost ratio (CR) was calculated to maximize the energy storage capacity. For 2), 10 subsystems of the electric bus, including the driver maneuver, traction motor, the lithium battery module, the SCs, the onboard DC/DC converter, the longitudinal vehicle dynamics, accessories, and the transmission were constructed. For the fast charger/bus stop station, an AC/DC inverter was modeled. All modulized subsystems were then integrated into the vehicle/station simulator. For 3), the 10-mode control strategy properly conducts energy management using rule-based control laws, which are functions of vehicle speed, state-of charges (SOCs) of dual energy sources, and driving conditions. The control output section delivers the commands to the subsystem controllers, relays, and converters/inverters.

The advantage of hydropower as a renewable energy is that it produces negligible amounts of greenhouse gases, it stores large amounts of electricity at low cost and it can be adjusted to meet consumer demand. This noble vision however is becoming more challenging due to rapid urbanization development and increasing human activities surrounding the catchment area. Numerous studies have shown that there are several contributing factors that lead towards the loss of live storage in reservoir, namely geology, ground slopes, climate, drainage density and human activities. Sediment deposition in the reservoir particularly for hydroelectric purposes has several major concerns due to the reduced water storage volume which includes increase in the risk of flooding downstream which directly effects the safety of human population and properties, contributes to economic losses not only in revenue for power generation but also large capital and maintenance cost for reservoir restorations works. In the event of functional loss of capabilities of a hydropower reservoir as a result of sedimentation or siltation could lead to both economical and environmental impact. The objective of this paper is aimed present the importance of hydropower as a source of renewable and clean energy in the national energy mix and the increasing challenges of sustainability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Catchments; Electric power generation; Environmental impact; Floods; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Losses; Sustainable development; Consumer demands; Contributing factor; Drainage density; Hydroelectric energy; Hydropower reservoirs; Rapid urbanizations; Renewable energies; Sediment deposition; Reservoirs (water); cost-benefit analysis; deposition; environmental impact; flooding; hydroelectric power; national economy; siltation; water storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881087237

Reversible phosphorylation is the only known natural starch modification and is required for starch degradation in planta. Critical to starch energy release is the activity of glucan phosphatases; however, the structural basis of dephosphorylation by glucan phosphatases is unknown. Here, we describe the structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana starch glucan phosphatase LIKE SEX FOUR2 (LSF2) both with and without phospho-glucan product bound at 2.3Å and 1.65Å, respectively. LSF2 binds maltohexaose-phosphate using an aromatic channel within an extended phosphatase active site and positions maltohexaose in a C3-specific orientation, which we show is critical for the specific glucan phosphatase activity of LSF2 toward native Arabidopsis starch. However, unlike other starch binding enzymes, LSF2 does not possess a carbohydrate binding module domain. Instead we identify two additional glucan binding sites located within the core LSF2 phosphatase domain. This structure is the first of a glucan-bound glucan phosphatase and provides new insights into the molecular basis of this agriculturally and industrially relevant enzyme family as well as the unique mechanism of LSF2 catalysis, substrate specificity, and interaction with starch granules. © 2013 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The mechanical system includes a three-stage chiller and an ice bank used for thermal energy storage (TES). Cooling can be provided to the indoor space either by directly using the chiller or by discharging the ice bank when electricity prices are high. The chiller is also used to charge the ice bank at night. By applying system identification techniques, a simplified linear thermal model for the building was derived from a detailed building simulation previously developed in EnergyPlus. The use of a simplified linear model - along with weather and internal gains forecasts - allows to readily calculate the required cooling power for a given temperature setpoint trajectory. By making use of simple parametric models for the chiller and the ice bank, an optimization algorithm is applied to decide on the optimal combination of chiller and ice bank cooling power contributions at discrete hourly intervals over the prediction horizon. The length of the prediction horizon alternates between 24 and 30. h in order to coincide with the beginning or end of charge/discharge periods. The formulation of the optimization problem is considerably facilitated by using cooling power as the main working variable and then writing the equations accordingly. The proposed MPC strategy is compared with two rule-based control strategies: a modified storage-priority algorithm (similar to the one currently used in the case study building) and a chiller-priority algorithm. With the considered pricing structure and mechanical system, the MPC algorithm results in typical savings of about 5-20% with respect to the modified storage-priority strategy and about 20-30% with respect to the chiller-priority strategy. © 2013.","Building simulation; Ice storage; Model predictive control; Simplified modelling; System identification; Thermal energy storage","Algorithms; Buildings; Cooling; Cooling systems; Costs; Heat storage; Identification (control systems); Mechanical engineering; Mechanics; Meteorology; Model predictive control; Optimization; Predictive control systems; Thermal energy; Virtual storage; Weather forecasting; Building cooling systems; Building simulation; Ice storage; Model based predictive control; Optimization algorithms; Rule-based control strategies; Simplified modelling; System identification techniques; Ice; algorithm; cooling; electricity supply; numerical model; optimization; thermal power; time dependent behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880818758

Control of real and reactive power of the SMES is utilized for riding the low-voltage conditions.

Straight vegetable oil was recently identified as a possible alternative to conventional biomass for rural energy supply. In this context, the Jatropha curcas Linn. species has been extensively investigated with regard to its potential as a biofuel feedstock. In contrast, only little is known about Jatropha mahafalensis Jum. & H. Perrier, which is an indigenous and endemic representative of the Jatropha genus in Madagascar. This paper explores the potential and suitability of J. mahafalensis as a biofuel feedstock. Seed samples were collected in the area of Soalara in south-western Madagascar in February and September 2011. Two agro-ecological zones (coastal area and calcareous plateau) and two plant age groups (below and above 10. years) were considered. These four sample groups were analyzed with regard to oil properties, element contents, and fatty acid profiles. Measured values differed greatly between the two harvests, probably owing to different climatic or storage conditions. No direct relation between age of trees or location and oil quality could be established. The analyses indicate that J. mahafalensis oil can be used in oil lamps, cooking stoves and stationary combustion engines for electrification or for biodiesel production. However, modifications in storage and extraction methods, as well as further processing steps are necessary to enable its utilization as a straight vegetable oil and feedstock for biodiesel production. If these technical requirements can be met, and if it turns out that J. mahafalensis oil is economically competitive in comparison with firewood, charcoal, paraffin and petroleum, it can be considered as a promising feedstock for rural energy supply. © 2013 International Energy Initiative.","Jatropha mahafalensis; Liquid biofuel; Madagascar; Rural energy supply; Straight vegetable oil","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Charcoal; Coastal zones; Energy resources; Fatty acids; Feedstocks; Fuel storage; Plants (botany); Regional planning; Rural areas; Vegetable oils; Jatropha; Liquid biofuels; Madagascar; Rural energy supplies; Straight vegetable oil; Oils and fats; agroecology; alternative energy; biofuel; biomass; fatty acid; renewable resource; rural energy; vegetable oil; Madagascar; Jatropha; Jatropha curcas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880611454

The VMC is developed from the traditional indirect matrix converter but operates in the reverse-boost mode rather than in the forward-buck mode. The reverse-boost mode is more relevant here since most renewable sources and energy storages have lower voltages than the grid. The eventual VMC developed uses an alternative nine-switch converter, rather than usual six-switch voltage-source converter, for providing six input terminals in total. One three-phase ac source and three dc sources, or other source combinations, can therefore be connected to the VMC. Powers from these sources are channeled to the three-phase utility grid through the VMC's current-source inverter. Their proper dispatches are guaranteed by the proposed control and modulation schemes, which also help maintain near-sinusoidal input and output current waveforms. Mathematical proofs, simulation, and experimental results have shown that the VMC can indeed operate as intended. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Direct power conversion; grid integration; hybrid ac/dc resources; versatile matrix converter (VMC)","Energy resources; Current source inverter; Direct power conversion; Grid integration; hybrid ac/dc resources; Indirect matrix converter; Mathematical proof; Matrix converter; Voltage-source converter; Power converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880253334

Based on the circuit model obtained, a new model-based feedback control scheme is presented to regulate the phase-to-phase input resistances of the circuit to desired values. The circuit can provide purely active power conversion of a band-limited input voltage source to a dc link, which is of interest in boost converters for certain energy conversion systems.

Seasonal storage of solar heat energy captured directly through the asphalt layer is a promising solution that can be achieved cost-effectively only if a necessary geostructure is used as heat-exchanger. Bridge piles and abutments are founded on piles that can be used as heat exchangers. Seasonal storage and natural thermal reload are two possible solutions for the operation of such a system, depending on local conditions. In particular, the presence of groundwater flow is thought to be a significant factor in such a design and is taken into account. The study aims at determining the geotechnical and energy design parameters through thermo-hydro-mechanical numerical simulations. A single heat-exchanger pile is taken as an example in this study. Given the presence of water flow, a three-dimensional FEM simulation needs to be carried out. The soil is described as a thermo-elastic porous medium, and various groundwater flow scenarios are studied. The capture of energy and the needs for deicing are based on the few existing structures that use other means of energy exchange with the ground. The article proposes an overview of all coupled phenomena, between thermal, hydraulic and mechanical aspects. Results show that only specific sites can be considered for using heat-exchanger piles for deicing bridges, but that the efficiency of the solution in those sites is high. Possible stability problems, in terms of foundation and structure are also considered, such as vertical displacements due to the dual use of the foundation piles. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Heat exchangers; Porous materials; Snow and ice removal; Structural design; Thermal conductivity; Coupled phenomena; Existing structure; Local conditions; Mechanical aspects; Presence of water; Stability problem; THREE-DIMENSIONAL FEM; Vertical displacements; Piles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880125896

They provide a good heat source for the heating and cooling of buildings but the temperature variations they undergo bring new challenges. Thermal expansion or contraction of the foundations can lead to building movements that must be kept within acceptable limits. Therefore, a thermo-mechanical design should be adopted. This paper presents recent advances in the understanding of the behaviour of thermo-active foundations. First, contributions of in situ experiments carried out on real-scale energy piles are reviewed. The outcome of these tests is a unique numerical design tool, called Thermo-Pile, which is presented. Next, an advanced constitutive model for environmental geomechanics accounting for non-isothermal conditions is detailed as well as the experimental evidence it was based on. Examples of thermo-hydro-mechanical analyses are presented to illustrate the challenges faced when using energy geostructures. Finally, the sustainability of heat storage through particular thermo-active foundations and tunnel anchors, is assessed. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Foundations; Heat storage; Piles; Sustainable development; Thermal conductivity; Thermal expansion; Environmental geomechanics; Experimental evidence; Heating and cooling of buildings; Non-isothermal condition; Temperature variation; Thermo-active foundations; Thermo-hydro-mechanical analysis; Thermo-mechanical design; Structural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880108610

Methods: -Control (C), sedentary cafeteria diet rats (DIO), and trained cafeteria diet rats (TDIO) accompanied from 21 days old to 120 days old were submitted to body weight and adiposity analysis, glycemic and lipid profile, liver histology, liver mitochondrial analysis (lipid oxidation and phosphorylation capacity). Results: -DIO presented elevated body weight and adiposity, and aerobic training (TDIO) improved these parameters. TDIO showed reduced triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol and elevated HDL-cholesterol. DIO presented higher fat liver accumulation that was revseed in TDIO. Liver mitochondria from DIO exhibited a higher α-oxidation capacity and an increase in the capacity of oxidizing succinate, with little effects of physical exercise. Our results demonstrated that in DIO, the development of steatosis preceded the establishment of body insulin resistance, which, in turn, has been considered the ""first hit"" in hepatic steatosis development. These suggest that some intrahepatic events could arise very early in conditions of poor nutrition and probably contribute to the development of NAFLD. Then, our results suggest that starting physical activity just after weaning decreased adverse effects of cafeteria diet on body composition, lipid profile, and liver fat deposition. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Cafeteria diet; Liver; Mitochondria; Physical training; Steatosis","glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; aerobic exercise; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body composition; controlled study; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; insulinemia; lipid analysis; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; liver histology; liver mitochondrion; male; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; oxygen consumption; phosphorylation; priority journal; rat; therapy effect; treadmill exercise; weaning; weight gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879843830

The configuration of micro-cogeneration systems is highly variable, as local climate, energy supply, energy market and the feasibility of including renewable type components such as wind turbines or photovoltaic panels are all factors. Large-scale lithium ion batteries for electrical storage in this context can provide cost savings, operational flexibility, and reduced stress on the distribution grid as well as a degree of contingency for installations relying upon unsteady renewables. Concurrently, significant advances in component materials used to make lithium ion cells offer performance improvements in terms of power output, energy capacity, robustness and longevity, thereby enhancing their prospective utility in residential micro-cogeneration installations.

The Power Pinch Analysis concept has been recently implemented for the optimal design of a HPS. This work introduces a new graphical tool known as the 'outsourced and storage electricity curves' (OSEC) to visualise the required minimum outsourced electricity and the current storage capacity at each time interval during HPS startup and continuous operation. Heuristics for load shifting for the integrated HPS system that can lead to further reductions of the maximum storage capacity and the maximum power demand (MPD) have also been introduced in this work. Note that the routine load shifting strategies in energy management cannot be used without the knowledge on how the integrated HPS components interact with one another. Application of the new approach on case studies demonstrates that the OSEC can provide vital insights for designers to perform the correct load shifting. The results show that up to 50 % reduction in the maximum storage capacity and the MPD is achieved. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Hybrid power systems; Load shifting; Power Pinch Analysis (PoPA); Process changes; Renewable energy sources","Fossil fuels; Hybrid power systems; Load shifting; Pinch analysis; Process change; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879420731

It is envisaged that energy efficiency of DEG systems can be improved via load shifting (LS). This study proposed a heuristic-based numerical approach to perform LS analysis on renewable stand-alone DEG systems. The technique is an extension from a method known as the Electric System Cascade Analysis (ESCA). The new technique, which focuses on efficient electricity utilisation is able to determine the optimal: (i) load profiles, (ii) capacity of power generator, (iii) capacity and power of energy storage (ES) and (iv) charging/discharging schedule of ES. The stage-wise technique allows user to compare and determine the optimal design in a flexible way while having a better understanding of the selection of options. The application of ESCA-LS on a case study revealed that after incorporation of direct LS (load manipulation) in addition to LS by ES (supply manipulation), the power generators and ES capacity can be further reduced.

In this paper, we focus on the question: What strategies can help decision-makers to better connect with stakeholders and overcome the challenges of conflicting interests when considering sustainability in their business models? Our research draws on two case studies in the Brazilian energy sector: the national oil company Petrobras and its attempts to develop biodiesel, and the national electrical utility Eletrobras and its attempts to provide electricity to impoverished communities. This paper is based on original qualitative data derived frominterviews with 138 key informants conducted between 2003 and 2010 with supply chain members and other stakeholders, as well as secondary sources. We draw from a number of literature streams to develop our paper. One stream relates to sustainable supply chain and the recognition of the relationship among economic, environmental and social values rather than only focusing on economic and/or environmental aspects. Another stream suggests that BOP (Bottom of the Pyramid) settings present potential ideal opportunities to connect business with sustainability. Finally, we use stakeholder theory to analyze how sustainable values can drive the operationalization of sustainable business models.

K. m/W. Obviously, there is room for improvement in the U-pipe design to decrease these values. Additionally, there is a need for methods of getting more detailed knowledge about the performance of BHEs. Performing Distributed Thermal Response Tests (DTRT) on new proposed designs helps to fill this gap, as the ground thermal conductivity and thermal resistances in a BHE can be determined at many instances in the borehole thanks to distributed temperature measurements along the depth.In this paper, results from three heat injection DTRTs carried out on two coaxial pipe-in-pipe BHEs at different flow rates are presented for the first time. The tested pipe-in-pipe geometry consists of a central tube inserted into a larger external flexible pipe, forming an annular space between them. The external pipe is pressed to the borehole wall by applying a slight overpressure at the inside, resulting in good thermal contact and at the same time opening up for a novel method for measuring the borehole wall temperature in situ, by squeezing a fiber optic cable between the external pipe and the borehole wall. A reflection about how to calculate borehole thermal resistance in pipe-in-pipe BHEs is presented. Detailed fluid and borehole wall temperatures along the depth during the whole duration of the DTRTs allowed to calculate local and effective borehole thermal resistances and ground thermal conductivities. Local thermal resistances were found to be almost negligible as compared to U-pipe BHEs, and the effective borehole resistance equal to about 0.03. K. m/W. The injected power was found to be almost evenly distributed along the depth. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Borehole heat exchanger; Borehole thermal resistance; Coaxial; Distributed thermal response test; Pipe-in-pipe","Heat exchangers; Heat resistance; Heat storage; Temperature measurement; Thermal conductivity of liquids; Borehole heat exchangers; Borehole resistances; Borehole thermal energy storage; Coaxial; Ground thermal conductivity; Pipe-in-pipe; Thermal contact; Thermal response test; Boreholes; borehole; design; geometry; heat balance; knowledge; performance assessment; pipe; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879321257

In principle, it is designed to maximize the utilization of solar energy through the seasonal storage. In a fully closed greenhouse, there is not any ventilation window. Therefore, the excess sensible and latent heat must be removed, and can be stored using seasonal and/or daily thermal storage technology. This stored excess heat can then be utilized later in order to satisfy the thermal load of the greenhouse. Thermal energy storage (TES) system should be designed based on the heating and cooling load in each specific case. Underground thermal energy storage (UTES) is most commonly chosen as seasonal storage. In addition, a stratified chilled water (SCW) storage or a phase change material (PCM) storage could be utilized as short term storage system in order to cover the daily demands and peak loads. In this paper, a qualitative economical assessment of the concept is presented. Here, a borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) system is considered as the seasonal storage, with a PCM or a SCW daily storage system to manage the peak load. A BTES primarily stores low temperature heat such that a heat pump would be needed to supply the heat at a suitable temperature.A theoretical model has been developed using TRNSYS to carry out the energy analysis. From the economical feasibility assessment, the results show that the concept has the potential of becoming cost effective. The major investment for the closed greenhouse concept could be paid within 7-8. years with the savings in auxiliary fossil fuel considering the seasonal TES systems. However, the payback time may be reduced to 5. years if the base load is chosen as the design load instead of the peak load. In this case, a short-term TES needs to be added in order to cover the hourly peak loads. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Closed greenhouse; Energy conservation; Heat transfer; Solar commercial building; Sustainable energy management system; Thermal energy storage system","Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy management systems; Greenhouses; Heat transfer; Office buildings; Phase change materials; Borehole thermal energy storage; Commercial building; Economical assessments; Heating and cooling loads; Phase Change Material (PCM); Sustainable energy management; Thermal energy storage systems; Thermal storage technology; Heat storage; design; economic analysis; energy conservation; feasibility study; fossil fuel; numerical model; pump; solar power; sustainable development; technological development; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879288674

Short-term moderate altitude exposure plus endurance physical activity has been found to improve glucose tolerance (not fasting glucose) in humans, which is associated with the improvement in the whole-body insulin sensitivity. However, most of people cannot accommodate high altitude exposure above 4500 M due to acute mountain sickness (AMS) and insulin resistance. There is a wide variation among individuals in response to the altitude challenge. In particular, the improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity by prolonged altitude hiking activity was not apparent in those individuals with low baseline DHEA-S concentration. In rats, exercise training recovery under prolonged hypoxia exposure (14-15% oxygen, 8 h per day for 6 weeks) can also improve insulin sensitivity, secondary to an effective suppression of adiposity. After prolonged hypoxia training, obese abnormality in upregulated baseline levels of AMPK and AS160 phosphorylation in skeletal muscle can be reversed. In humans, moderate hypoxia increases postprandial blood distribution towards skeletal muscle during a training recovery. This physiological response plays a role in the redistribution of fuel storage among important energy storage sites and may explain its potent effect on the favorable change in body composition. Conclusion: Altitude training can exert strong impact on our metabolic system, and has the potential to be designed as a non-pharmacological or recreational intervention regimen for correcting metabolic syndromes. © 2013 by The Chinese Physiological Society and Airiti Press Inc.","Glucose tolerance; Hypoxia; Insulin sensitivity; metabolic syndromes","adenylate kinase; membrane protein; prasterone sulfate; protein AS160; unclassified drug; altitude; altitude disease; article; body composition; enzyme phosphorylation; exercise; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; glucose transport; glycemic control; human; hypoxia; insulin sensitivity; metabolic syndrome X; muscle blood flow; nonhuman; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; protein phosphorylation; upregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879287192

One of the main challenges, however, is the enhancement of the efficiency of the process, by utilizing the heat produced during compression of air. Another important factor is the availability of safe storage volume for air at pressures reaching 70 to 100 bar. In Ticino, a research program exploits a decommissioned tunnel of the AlpTransit project for exploring the possibility of high pressure air storage in metamorphic rock of the Alpine arch (Leventina Gneiss).

The plant is compared with a generic PCC plant where all the thermal energy is provided by steam bled from the steam cycle. The individual merits of a suite of solar collector technologies which includes Flat Plate Collectors (FPCs), Compound Parabolic Collectors (CPCs), Linear Fresnel Collectors (LFCs), Evacuated Tube Collectors (ETCs) and Parabolic Trough Collectors (PTCs) to supply thermal energy for the PCC plant have been studied. The plant has been simulated for three different locations in Australia: Sydney, Townsville and Melbourne. The overall system consists of three subsystems: power plant, PCC plant and solar collector field. A base case scenario is studied in which there is no heat integration between the three subsystems and is compared to a system with heat integration. Additionally incentives such as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), carbon tax/credits and government subsidies have been added to the economic model and a sensitivity analysis performed for each scenario of incentives for all five solar collector technologies at the three locations. The ETC case performs best amongst solar collectors when the three subsystems have heat integration while PTCs perform best in the case with no heat integration. The best location for the solar-assisted PCC (SPCC) plant is Townsville. It was found that the addition of the solar field reduces the carbon tax in order to make carbon capture and storage viable in comparison with a conventional non-capturing coal fired plant. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture; Energy; Heat integration; Power plant; Solar thermal; Techno-economics","Carbon capture; Coal; Combustion; Economic analysis; Fossil fuel power plants; Power plants; Steam engineering; Thermal energy; Compound parabolic collectors (CPCs); Energy; Heat integration; Linear Fresnel collectors (LFC); Post-combustion carbon captures; Renewable energy certificates; Solar thermal; Techno-economics; Solar collectors; alternative energy; carbon sequestration; coal-fired power plant; combustion; economic analysis; pollution tax; renewable resource; sensitivity analysis; solar power; thermal power; Australia; Melbourne; New South Wales; Queensland; Sydney [New South Wales]; Townsville; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878492483

These sensor nodes have some constraints due to limited energy, storage capacity and computing power. The energy consumed to route data from the sensor node to its destination raises as a critical issue in designing wireless sensor network routing protocols. In order to prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor networks, this study presents a multi-hop routing protocol with distributed clustering (ELDRL). First, in order to overcome the defect that the clusters distribute unevenly, ELDRL selects nodes as a cluster-head with regard to neighbor cluster-heads. Second, it partitions the network into different layers of clusters.Cluster heads in each layer cooperates with the adjacent layer to transmit sensor's datato the base station. ELDRL spreads the workload across the sensor network, load balancingreduces hot spots in the sensor network and increases the energy lifetime of the sensor network. Moreover, the protocol not only increases the scalability but also decreases the traffic of WSN. Simulation results show that the scheme is more efficient compared with LEACH. © Maxwell Scientific Organization.","Distributed clustering; Large scale sensor network; Load balance; Multi-hop routing; Wireless sensor network",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878399702

Coupons of carbon steel and galvanised steel were immersed in soybean biodiesel with and without TBHQ for 12 weeks. Measurements of total acid number, peroxide value, oxidation stability (Rancimat induction period), metal release, and TBHQ consumption at different stages of corrosion were performed. After 12 weeks of the static immersion test with both steels, the non-stabilised biodiesels presented induction times below the EN 14214 limit (6 h); these results were in agreement with increase in the peroxide values. Zinc release was only detected in the non-stabilised biodiesel exposed to galvanised steel, whilst iron was not detected in any biodiesel samples exposed to carbon steel. The absence of zinc in the TBHQ-doped biodiesel exposed to galvanised steel indicates that TBHQ may have acted as a corrosion inhibitor. Additionally, TBHQ was rapidly consumed in the first 3 days of experiments, providing evidence of its activity. For a storage period of up to 56 days, both galvanised and carbon steels were shown to be compatible with biodiesel even in the absence of an antioxidant. The presence of zinc (&gt;2 μg g 1 after 28 days of immersion) due to corrosion did not promote biodiesel deterioration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The growing scientific literature on batteries reflects the high attention that currently rests on these technologies. This paper reviews the existing literature on lifecycle costs of batteries in stationary applications. The primary result of this review is that, despite the current high degree of variance in technological and economic battery data, a systematic assessment of the underlying uncertainty is lacking. The present paper addresses this disparity with an investigation of the impact of uncertainty in input parameters on lifecycle costs of four battery technologies across six electricity system applications. Based on input data collected from literature and via expert interviews, a probabilistic techno-economic model was built that calculates lifecycle costs and systematically addresses uncertainty in input parameters by applying a Monte Carlo simulation. The main conclusion of this paper is that the present uncertainty in cost and technical parameters of batteries exceeds by far the differences in lifecycle costs across technologies. For most electricity storage applications, the absolute differences in mean lifecycle costs across technologies are negligible compared to the uncertainty ranges of the mean lifecycle costs. Therefore, a competition still exists between the four analyzed battery technologies and so far a leading technology has yet to emerge in any of the investigated applications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Levelized costs of electricity (LCOE); Monte Carlo simulation; Techno-economic modeling; Uncertainty","Costs; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Intelligent systems; Life cycle; Monte Carlo methods; Secondary batteries; Uncertainty analysis; Levelized costs; Multiple applications; Probabilistic modeling; Renewable power generation; Stationary applications; Systematic assessment; Techno-economic model; Uncertainty; Power quality",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878216650

To solve this problem, many nuclear plants have started to install Spent Fuel Dry Storage Systems. Taiwan Institute of Nuclear Energy Research has started to use the CFD-FLUENT system to analyze and simulate the heat transfer phenomena of Spent Fuel Dry Storage Systems. CFD-FLUENT has a strong calculating function, but on the other hand, it also has disadvantages. For instance, we need to plug thermal properties of materials into a database before we use CFD-FLUENT. However, this CFD-FLUENT data bank is not convenient to build up for the necessary thermal properties of the Spent Fuel Dry Storage System. In addition, those limitations will make the simulating process complicated. The main purpose of this project is to write software which can make the process of plugging properties into the CFD-FLUENT database easier by the use of Visual Basic (version 6.0).

The proposed converter achieves zero-current switching (ZCS) of the primary-side active semiconductor devices and zero-voltage switching of the secondary-side active semiconductor devices. It is a potential topology for FCVs, front-end dc/dc power conversion for fuel cell inverters, and energy storage. A proposed secondary-modulation clamps the voltage across the primary-side devices (current fed) naturally and eliminates switch turn-off voltage spike concern with ZCS without any additional circuit. This leads to reduced footprints and lower cost. Voltage across the primary-side current-fed devices is independent of duty cycle like conventional current-fed converters but clamped at a reflected output voltage. Therefore, comparatively low-voltage-rating devices with a low on-state resistance are used, introducing low conduction losses and higher efficiency.

In addition, an electromechanical mechanism is proposed for the AS system energy regeneration, and the actuator dynamics and this mechanism's interactions with the ESS are modeled. Simulation results reveal that traffic conditions have a significant impact on the amount of regenerated energy produced by the AS system where more energy can be regenerated in extra-urban and highway traffic conditions than in congested and urban areas.

Although it is true that hydrogen has been safely used for many decades, this has occurred until now in activities mainly in the chemical industry, where skilful and highly trained personnel are engaged. Yet, no one is certain what would happen when a layman handles a potentially hazardous material such as liquid hydrogen to refuel our cars. Such thoughts are sustained by the fact that there is still a significant shortage of knowledge on hazardous properties of hydrogen. Scepticism is also emerging on the environmental effects of large hydrogen leaks when hydrogen will be extensively used worldwide.

These applications and services often impose multifarious resource demands (storage, compute power, bandwidth, latency) on the underlying infrastructure. Existing data center architectures lack the flexibility to effectively support these applications, which results in poor support of QoS, deployability, manageability, and defence against security attacks. Data center network virtualization is a promising solution to address these problems. Virtualized data centers are envisioned to provide better management flexibility, lower cost, scalability, better resources utilization, and energy efficiency.

Energy storage can be connected to the load side of a GCHP system, in the form of hot or chilled water storage tanks, or phase change materials. Integrating TES can reduce the first cost of building the system while lowering energy cost. This can provide the owner a better return on investment. Buildings with large intermittent and predictable peak heating, cooling loads or domestic hot water loads benefits the most from integration of TES devices by reducing peak loads to the ground heat exchanger (GHX).

In this study, an evaluation is made of future renewable electricity generation and gross electricity demand in Nova Scotia, Canada. These are coupled with an energy storage model for peak shaving and increased ramp-rate capabilities sufficient to retire coal-fired generation. The proposed storage system represents a feasible method to not only displace coal use, but to displace the need for fossil-fueled generating capacity as backup for renewable generators. Within the model, an aggregate electrical system load timeseries at 1 h intervals is developed for Renewable Energy Standard years 2015 and 2020 using publicly available historical data and existing load growth projections. This is compared to renewable energy generation projections, with the difference between generation and demand used as the input to an energy storage model wherein storage augments dispatchable generating capacity. The model estimates energy storage characteristics required to limit peak conventional generation capacity and ramp-rates.

The stored CHW is used to support requirement of chilled water during day time. Charging of the TES tank by the electrical chillers (EC) is done during off-peak hours. For the case of TES tank at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, the charging of TES tank is done from 6 p.m. to 6 am. To ensure optimum TES charging, the operations of EC need to adhere to an optimum scheduling strategy. To address this requirement, an assignment model using transportation model is proposed. The model is formulated as a zero-one programming model. Spreadsheet is used for solving the model. Results from analysis indicate that maximum production of chilled water depends on the generating capacity of the EC. Results from three case studies indicate that all EC were operated at below rated capacity. Based on the weekly data, the maximum operated capacities of EC1, EC2, EC3 and EC4 are 308, 288, 295 and 270 RT, respectively. This is below rated capacity 325 RT of the EC. The outcome is that TES is not charged to full capacity during off peak period. From the sensitivity analysis using the proposed model, TES could be fully charged during the off peak period. An example, if three of EC are operated to full capacities for specified off peak period, TES could be fully charged. The model could be useful for the UTP District Cooling plant to schedule EC for charging of TES during off peak hours. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Assignment model; Capacity peak period; Electrical chillers; Thermal energy storage; Zero-one programming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877050185

Methods: Cross-sectional study. Data were obtained from the Human Milk Bank registry regarding the source, the amount collected in liters, the amount of calories by liter assessed by crematocrit, and the acidity of human milk determined by titration in degrees Dornic. Results: Between 2006 and 2009, 30,846 samples of human milk were collected from donors coming from different locations and analyzed. A total of 5,869L of milk were collected and distributed. From the total human pasteurized milk, 53,5% was classified as hypocaloric (<580kcal/L); 36.4% as caloric, and 8.3% as hypercaloric (>711kcal/L). Regarding the several locations where the milk was collected, the Human Milk Bank at Londrina University Hospital wasthe location in which a larger number of donations were observed in the three classifications. The result of the Dornic test for acidity of the collected milk revealed that 60.8% had 4.1° to 8.0° Dornic. Conclusions: A large volume of the collected human milk is hypocaloric and appropriate for human consumption. Thereis the need to intensify collection procedures in order to meet the demand for hypercaloric milk for preterm newborn infants.","Breast feeding; Infant, premature; Milk, human","acidity; article; calorimetry; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; energy consumption; food analysis; food composition; food intake; food storage; health care facility; human; low calory diet; milk; university hospital; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals, University; Humans; Milk Banks; Milk, Human; Nutritive Value; Pasteurization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876974450

Mechanisms of overexposure of these tissues to fatty acids include increased de novo lipogenesis, impaired fatty acid oxidation and increased fatty acid flux to these organs. White adipose tissues are the main organs responsible for the regulation of circulating fatty acids. It has been clearly demonstrated that pre-diabetes individuals and individuals with diabetes display impaired adipose tissue dietary fatty acid storage that may lead to increased circulating flux and exaggerated lean tissue fatty acid exposure. Additionally, brown adipose tissue depots are less metabolically active in individuals with type 2 diabetes. We have developed a series of novel in vivo investigative tools using positron emission tomography to comprehensively assess postprandial interorgan fatty acid partitioning and white and brown adipose tissue metabolism in subjects with pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Our findings shed new lights into the sophisticated mechanisms that regulate fatty acid partitioning and energy homeostasis during the development of type 2 diabetes. New links between abnormal dietary fatty acid metabolism and early myocardial metabolic and functional defects are now being uncovered in humans with the hope to find novel ways to predict and avoid the devastating complications of diabetes. © 2013 Canadian Diabetes Association.","Brown adipose tissues; Fatty acids; Insulin resistance; Type 2 diabetes; White adipose tissues","14 6 thia fluoroheptadecanoic acid f 18; fatty acid; heptadecanoic acid; unclassified drug; adipose tissue; brown adipose tissue; disease course; ectopic fat deposition; energy balance; fatty acid analysis; fatty acid blood level; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid transport; heart function; human; impaired glucose tolerance; in vivo study; insulin resistance; lipid absorption; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipotoxicity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; positron emission tomography; postprandial state; review; thermogenesis; tissue metabolism; white adipose tissue; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathology; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fatty Acids; Humans; Insulin Resistance",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876816282

In this work, we generated time-resolved physiological data, quantitative metabolome (69 intracellular metabolites) and proteome (72 enzymes) profiles. We found that the diauxic shift is accomplished by three key events that are temporally organized: (i) a reduction in the glycolytic flux and the production of storage compounds before glucose depletion, mediated by downregulation of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase reactions; (ii) upon glucose exhaustion, the reversion of carbon flow through glycolysis and onset of the glyoxylate cycle operation triggered by an increased expression of the enzymes that catalyze the malate synthase and cytosolic citrate synthase reactions; and (iii) in the later stages of the adaptation, the shutting down of the pentose phosphate pathway with a change in NADPH regeneration. Moreover, we identified the transcription factors associated with the observed changes in protein abundances. Taken together, our results represent an important contribution toward a systems-level understanding of how this adaptation is realized. © 2013 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.","diauxic shift; fluxome; metabolome; proteome; Saccharomyces cerevisiae","6 phosphofructokinase; carbon; citrate synthase; glucose; malate synthase; pentose phosphate; proteome; pyruvate kinase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; transcription factor; enolase; glucose 6 phosphate isomerase; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; glyoxylic acid; phosphoglycerate kinase; transcription factor Hsf1p; transcription factor Ino2p; transcription factor Msn4p; transcription factor Pdr3p; unclassified drug; 6 phosphofructokinase; glyoxylic acid derivative; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; adaptation; article; chemical reaction; controlled study; down regulation; exhaustion; gluconeogenesis; glycolysis; metabolite; metabolome; nonhuman; pentose phosphate cycle; priority journal; protein analysis; protein transport; regeneration; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; yeast; alcohol consumption; Article; carbon metabolism; carbon source; citric acid cycle; deregulation; energy yield; enzyme mechanism; glucose intake; glucose metabolism; protein expression; temporal analysis; upregulation; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; metabolomics; time; Eukaryota; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Adaptation, Physiological; Citrate (si)-Synthase; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Gluconeogenesis; Glucose; Glycolysis; Glyoxylates; Malate Synthase; Metabolomics; NADP; Pentose Phosphate Pathway; Phosphofructokinases; Pyruvate Kinase; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876593243

White adipose tissue (WAT), with well-established roles in lipid storage and adipokine secretion, is advantageous over bone marrow as the source of MSCs due to relative abundance and ease of isolation of the tissue. ASCs reside perivascularly within WAT and physiologically undergo adipogenesis to support WAT expansion in response to increased energy intake. Apart from adipogenesis, ASCs can be induced in vitro to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondroblasts, myocytes, neurons and other cell types. ASCs can also be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells more efficiently than other cell types. ASCs are immunoprivileged cells and secrete immunomodulatory, angiogenic, anti-apoptotic and haematopoietic factors that facilitate tissue repair.

Yet, cursorial mammals are unable to support high intensity exercise with fat stores. We hypothesized that migratory bats and birds have converged on similar physiological mechanisms to fuel endurance flight with fat. We predicted bats would seasonally upregulate fatty acid transport and oxidation pathways when migration demands were high. We studied seasonal variation in mitochondrial oxidative enzyme activities and fatty acid transport protein expression in the flight muscle of hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus). Carnitine palmitoyl transferase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and citrate synthase activity increased during migration. There were no changes in expression of fatty acid translocase or plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein. Heart-type fatty acid binding protein expression increased 5-fold in migrating females, but did not vary seasonally in males. An aerial insectivore lifestyle, and the coincidence of migration and pregnancy may explain differences in transporter expression compared to previously studied birds. Overall, our results are consistent with seasonal upregulation of lipid metabolism and aerobic capacity, and confirm that migration poses distinct physiological challenges for bats. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Aerobic capacity; Fatty acid binding protein; Lipid oxidation; Lipid transport; Migration","3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase; CD36 antigen; citrate synthase; enzyme; fatty acid binding protein; fatty acid transporter; article; bat; bird; body fat; cell membrane; endurance; enzyme activity; fatty acid transport; female; flight muscle; Lasiurus cinereus; lipid metabolism; male; migration; nonhuman; oxidation; prediction; pregnancy; priority journal; protein expression; seasonal variation; upregulation; 3-Hydroxyacyl CoA Dehydrogenases; Animal Migration; Animals; Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase; Chiroptera; Citrate (si)-Synthase; Fatty Acid Transport Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; RNA, Messenger; Seasons; Up-Regulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876431625

Rotationally molded fuel tanks made of linear low density polyethylene or crosslinked polyethylene were used to appropriately mimic the storage environment of fuels, though the study also considered immersed polymer specimens as this test approach is more commonly reported on in the literature. The extent of oxidation for the fuels was monitored by determination of its peroxide value and acid number over time, with both values being consistently higher for blends with higher biodiesel content. Storage at 80°C for up to 56 days resulted in significant oxidation of the fuel while testing up to 380 days at 23°C produced no change in peroxide or acid concentration. The change in mechanical properties for the polyethylenes due to fuel was determined by tensile testing. Comparing the tensile data to the oxidation species in the stored fuels revealed that noted mechanical losses did not correspond with higher concentration of hydroperoxides or acid species but rather occurred as a result of fuel absorption. No difference was found in this regards between the two polyethylene species. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence of the protein to carbohydrate ratio (P:C) in diets of C57BL/6J mice on total energy intake, fat storage, and thermogenesis was investigated. Design and Methods: Male mice (9 weeks old) were provided ad libitum access to one of five isocaloric diets that differed in P:C. Food intake was recorded for 12 weeks. After 16 weeks, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) deposits were dissected, weighed, and the expression levels of key metabolic regulators were determined in BAT. In a separate cohort, body surface temperature was measured in response to 25 diets differing in protein, fat, and carbohydrate content. Results: Mice on low P:C diets (9:72 and 17:64) had greater total energy intake and increased WAT and BAT stores. Body surface temperature increased with total energy intake and with protein, fat, and carbohydrate, making similar contributions per kJ ingested. Expression of three key regulators of thermogenesis were downregulated in BAT in mice on the lowest P:C diet. Conclusions: Low-protein diets induced sustained hyperphagia and a generalized expansion of fat stores. Increased body surface temperature on low P:C diets was consistent with diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) as a means to dissipate excess ingested energy on such diets, although this was not sufficient to prevent development of increased adiposity. Whether BAT was involved in DIT is not clear. Increased BAT mass on low P:C diets might suggest so, but patterns of thermogenic gene expression do not support a role for BAT in DIT, although they might reflect failure of thermogenic function with prolonged exposure to a low P:C diet.",,"carbohydrate; fat; lipid; protein; animal experiment; article; body height; body surface; body weight; brown adipose tissue; caloric intake; carbohydrate diet; cohort analysis; controlled study; food intake; gene expression; hyperphagia; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; protein intake; protein restriction; thermogenesis; white adipose tissue; Adipose Tissue; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Adiposity; Animals; Body Temperature; Diet, Protein-Restricted; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Down-Regulation; Energy Intake; Gene Expression; Hyperphagia; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Thermogenesis; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876277420

The Canadian Macromolecular Crystallography Facility (CMCF) beamline 08ID-1 is the first small period (20 mm) hybrid small-gap in-vacuum undulator (SGU) to be employed at the CLS as a source of high harmonic, high brightness radiation (6.5-18 keV). The SGU was assembled and shimmed at the CLS Magnetic Mapping Facility. It is installed in the upstream part of straight section 8 of the CLS ring and chicaned inboard by 0.75 mrad. The downstream half of this section is reserved for future development. To achieve a maximum undulator field (B0) in conjunction with low sensitivity to radiation damage, a hybrid layout for the undulator is used with Sm2Co17 permanent magnets sandwiched between Vanadium Permendur ferromagnetic poles. To date, operations in the 6.5-18 keV energy range have been achieved using the 3rd to 9th harmonics, with gap sizes of 5.9-8.6 mm. Gaps smaller than 5.9 mm are not being used since in the 5.0-5.9 mm range the rms phase errors are larger than 2.5° and lower harmonics at larger gaps are being used instead. The goal of the present study is to measure the output spectrum for various gap sizes and compare these with theoretical expectations calculated from the magnetic characteristics of the undulator measured at the CLS Magnetic Mapping Facility. The 08ID-1 beamline now has several years of successful operation as a highly competitive, high brilliance beamline. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Crystallography; Energy storage; Harmonic analysis; Light sources; Magnetism; Mapping; Radiation damage; Storage rings; Synchrotron radiation; Synchrotrons; Vacuum technology; High brightness; In-vacuum undulator; Intermediate energies; Low sensitivity; Macromolecular crystallography; Magnetic characteristic; Output spectrum; Protein crystallography; Wigglers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876231405

To ensure great accuracy of the position of a hall sensor, we corrected the vertical and transverse positions during measurements.

Statistical methods for analyzing longitudinal data weren't readily accessible at that time. Objectives: To measure minimal rates of oxygen consumption (VO2, ml/min) in growing infants during the first postnatal weeks and to determine the relationships between postnatal increases in VO2, body size and postnatal age. Methods: We studied 61 infants of any birth weight or gestational age, including 19 of very low birth weight. The infants, nursed in incubators, were clinically well and without need of oxygen supplementation or respiratory assistance. Serial measures of VO2 using a closed-circuit method were obtained at approximately weekly intervals. VO2 was measured under thermoneutral conditions with the infant asleep or resting quietly. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects models. Results: During early postnatal growth, VO2 rises as surface area (m2)1.94 (standard error, SE 0.054) or body weight (kg)1.24 (SE 0.033). Multivariate analyses show statistically significant effects of both size and age. Reference intervals (RIs) for VO2 for fixed values of body weight and postnatal age are presented. As VO2 rises with increasing size and age, there is an increase in the skin-operative environmental temperature gradient (T skin-op) required for heat loss. Required T skin-op can be predicted from surface area and heat loss (heat production minus heat storage). Conclusions: Generation of RIs for minimal rates of VO2 in growing infants from the 1960s was enabled by application of mixed-effects statistical models for analyses of longitudinal data. Results apply to the precaffeine era of neonatal care. Copyright © 2013 S.

PV based power generating units performing the direct conversion of solar energy into electric energy constitute a major area of renewable energy based power generating systems. In practice, PV based power systems can be used to exploit the solar energy in almost all kinds of industrial and residential applications; however, designing a PV system depends on a variety of factors, such as, geographical location, solar irradiation, system configurations, operating modes and most importantly the load requirements. In this paper, a versatile standalone PV power system equipped with a battery energy storage unit is designed for a variety of small to medium power applications. To achieve a cost-effective design, both buck and buck-boost dc to dc converters are integrated to facilitate the maximum power point tracking (MPPT), battery charging/discharging and load voltage regulation functions.

The complex supply chain of forest biomass for energy generation, which consists of different players and products and is affected by biomass characteristics, such as low density and unpredictable quality, makes the energy generation cost from biomass higher than that of the conventional sources of energy, such as fossil fuels. Moreover, variability and uncertainty in this supply chain, mainly due to the nature of material, economic condition and market fluctuation, affect the amount of produced energy and its cost. Mathematical modeling, in particular optimization techniques, can be employed to manage the supply chain and achieve the optimum design. This paper reviews studies which used deterministic and stochastic mathematical models to optimize forest biomass supply chains for electricity, heat and biofuels production. Optimization models were used to provide the optimum solution for decisions related to the network design, technology choice, plant size and location, storage location, mix of products and raw materials, logistics options, supply areas, and material flows. Mainly, economic objectives were considered in these models. Further studies should consider environmental and social objectives, in addition to the economic ones, in the models. In non-deterministic models uncertainty mainly in the demand, supply, prices, and conversion yields were incorporated. Although material quality is an important uncertain parameter in the forest biomass supply chain that affects the amount and cost of produced energy, its variation was not considered in previous studies. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Forest bioenergy supply chain; Optimization; Renewable and sustainable energies; Uncertainty","Biofuels; Costs; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Optimization; Product design; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Bioenergy productions; Bioenergy supplies; Deterministic models; Optimization techniques; Stochastic mathematical models; Sustainable energy; Uncertainty; Value chain optimizations; Biomass; Biomass; Costs; Forestry; Mathematical Models; Optimization; Product Design; Renewable Resources; Supply Chain Management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875705245

The top level is the energy management and power regulation system. Depending on wind and load conditions, this system generates reference dynamic operating points to low level individual subsystems. The energy management and power regulation system also controls the load scheduling operation during unfavorable wind conditions under inadequate energy storage in order to avoid a system blackout.

The IEMS aims to find the optimal set points of DERs (distributed energy resources) and thermal and electrical storage systems, in such a way that the total operation cost and the net emission are minimized, simultaneously. For optimal operation of the micro-grid, a smart ESS (energy storage system) is introduced which consists of electrical and thermal storage systems. A comprehensive mathematical model for the ESS and also the economic and environmental objective functions are formulated. To solve the problem, we propose an efficient MBFO (modified Bacterial Foraging Optimization) algorithm. An interactive fuzzy satisfying method is also used to simulate the trade-off between conflicting objectives (cost and emission). To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compare the MBFO algorithm with some other previously proposed analytical methods. Finally, the proposed IEMS is applied to a micro-grid which consists of various DERs, CHP (combined heat and power) system, ESS and thermal and electrical loads.

Time-variable electricity prices and electricity buy-back from the grid to re-charge the energy storage is considered by adding electric heaters to the CSPonD concept [Slocum et al., [15]]. System-level models are developed and optimization of the design and operation is performed. Three case studies are considered: i) time-variable operation without electrical heating under time-invariant electricity price; ii) operation under time-variant electricity price without electric heaters; iii) operation under time-variant electricity price allowing charging of the pond using the grid electricity. These demonstrate the effect of time-invariant versus time-of-use feed-in-tariff. Two hourly price profiles are considered, representing a moderately and highly fluctuating price profile respectively. Uncertainty of the cost function is indirectly addressed: the approach optimizes for the expected value of profit. The results show significant increase in the revenue when adding electric heaters. Under the moderately fluctuating electricity price, the use of heaters increases the revenue significantly, compared to the same case with no electric heaters considered.

Several different redox couples have been investigated and reported in the literature. Only three systems as such have seen some commercial development, namely the all-vanadium (by VRB-ESS), the bromine-polysulfide (RGN-ESS) and the zinc-bromine (Powercell) systems. The vanadium-bromine system may be an attractive replacement for the all-vanadium system due to its higher energy density with possible applications as energy storage systems for electric vehicles. Other redox flow battery systems have faced problems due to slow electrochemical kinetics of redox couples, membrane fouling, cross-contamination, high costs (mainly due to the membrane as well as inefficient cell stack design), poor sealing, shunt current losses and low energy capacity (due to the use of aqueous electrolytes). One of the main factors limiting further development of the redox flow battery so far is the high costs associated with the ion-exchange membrane.

But the rapidly increasing interest in nanoscale materials and their outstanding properties has propelled nanoporous AAO to the fore as one of the most popular nanomaterial with applications across a gamut of areas including molecular separation, catalysis, energy generation and storage, electronics and photonics, sensors and biosensors, drug delivery and template synthesis. Material fabrication of AAO is based on facile and inexpensive electrochemical anodization with the self-ordering process of nanopores not requiring any lithography or templating, and the outcome of the process are perfectly ordered and size controlled nanopores with distinctive pore geometries. Recent research on AAO is characterized by a remarkable trajectory of innovation, in particular with regards to control of surface functionality and, concomitantly, to the design of intricate structural features such as modulated, branched, and multilayered pore architectures. This review illuminates research on recent development of AAO focussing on surface and structural engineering, and on emerging applications. Key examples and critical preparative issues and resulting improvements sparking opportunities for further applications in AAO properties are discussed.

The idea is to increase the capacitance of clamping capacitors with the use of supercapacitors and allow their voltage to vary within a defined range. Even though this unique approach eliminates the need of interfacing dc-dc converters for supercapacitors, the variable voltage operation brings about several challenges. The uneven distribution of space vectors is the major modulation challenge. A space vector modulation method is proposed in this paper to address this issue and to generate undistorted currents even in the presence of dynamic changes in supercapacitor voltages. A supercapacitor voltage equalization algorithm is also presented. Moreover, control strategies of the proposed system are discussed in detail.

WT and PV are the primary power sources of the system, and an FC is expected to provide long-term energy balance, whereas the UC is employed as buffer storage for the short-term compensation. The improvement in fuzzy logic strategies enhances dynamic response of the FC/UC power system under various load conditions by suitable rule base design for fuzzy controller. The combined use of FC and UC has the potential for better energy efficiency and lifetime increment of FC technology. These rules are designed such that charging and discharging the UC voltage is controlled automatically. The fuzzy controller creates a balance between production and consumption with determination of the exact reference values for WT, PV, and FC. This causes a good frequency controlled in the hybrid generation power system. The fuzzy logic strategies performance under different condition has been verified by using real weather data practical load demand profile.

When coupled to a lake model and driven with atmospheric reanalysis data between 1976 and 2002, RegCM4 reproduces the major characteristics of HLES. The influence of lake ice cover on HLES is investigated through 10 case studies (2 per Great Lake), in which a simulated heavy lake-effect event is compared with a companion simulation having 100% ice cover imposed on one or all of the Great Lakes. These experiments quantify the impact of ice cover on downstream snowfall and demonstrate that Lake Superior has the strongest, most widespread influence on heavy snowfall and Lake Ontario the least. Ice cover strongly affects a wide range of atmospheric variables above and downstream of lakes during HLES, including snowfall, surface energy fluxes, wind speed, temperature, moisture, clouds, and air pressure. Averaged among the 10 events, complete ice coverage causes major reductions in lake-effect snowfall (>80%) and turbulent heat fluxes over the lakes (>90%), less low cloudiness, lower temperatures, and higher air pressure. Another important consequence is a consistent weakening (30%-40%) of lower-tropospheric winds over the lakes when completely frozen. This momentum reduction further decreases over-lake evaporation and weakens downstream wind convergence, thus mitigating lake-effect snowfall. This finding suggests a secondary, dynamical mechanism by which ice cover affects downstream snowfall duringHLES events, in addition to themorewidely recognized thermodynamic influence. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric reanalysis data; Atmospheric variables; Dynamical mechanisms; Lower temperatures; Regional climate models; Surface energy fluxes; Theoretical physics; Turbulent heat fluxes; Atmospheric pressure; Climate models; Digital storage; Ice; Snow; Lakes; air temperature; atmospheric pressure; climate modeling; computer simulation; heat flux; ice cover; low temperature; moisture; regional climate; snowstorm; surface energy; wind velocity; Great Lakes [North America]; Great Lakes Basin; Lake Ontario",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874795858

If the contracts are properly designed, they can protect the company from fluctuations in electricity price and demand, at some cost to the company's expected profit. This reduction in profit can be mitigated by trading on the natural gas and electricity spot markets, but this trading activity may also sometimes result in losses. A stochastic programming model is formulated to capture the hedging decisions made by the company, as well as the interactions between the natural gas and electricity markets. The benefits offered by this approach for profit maximization in a variety of business scenarios, such as the case where the company can hold some amount of gas in storage are studied and presented.

The main points made were as follows. Neutrino mass is physics beyond the Standard Model; it presents a very deep puzzle to solve, with the answers to several fundamental questions as potential reward. Precision measurement of oscillation parameters is one essential way to access information needed to solve this puzzle and there is a relatively clear (but not easy) way forward. Large θ13 makes the appearance signals larger, but does not allow to relax the requirements on high beam intensity and large detector masses; it creates a difficult challenge on systematic errors, which will require dedicated ancillary experiments. Of particular interest is a low intensity muon storage ring for required cross-section measurements. There exist already extended bottom-up international collaboration in both physics and R&amp;D experiments. All three main regions have plans for upgraded super-beams and associated detectors, with a variety of (mostly) complementary baselines, proceeding in an incremental way. The ultimate precision and verification of the neutrino mixing picture requires new types of neutrino beams based on storage rings. For low energy neutrinos, the beta-beam is a possible (but substantial) intermediate step. The Neutrino Factory offers the best precision and best sensitivity to deviations from the standard picture. Coordinated international R&amp;D is pursued. International collaboration at the top level would be beneficial in acknowledging the process, so as make sure that intermediate steps are effectively building up in complementary fashion towards the ultimate goals.",,"Experiments; International cooperation; Neutrons; Storage rings; Beam intensity; Cross-section measurement; International collaborations; Large detectors; Low energy neutrinos; Low-intensity; Muon storage ring; Neutrino beams; Neutrino factories; Neutrino mass; Neutrino mixing; Oscillation parameters; Potential rewards; Precision measurement; Round tables; The standard model; Particle detectors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874690626

Results show that the validated models are in good agreement with measurements. On an annual basis a deviation of 2.5% out of 1099 kWh was obtained between the auxiliary energy from results and from the simulation model for a complete system. Using the validated model a system optimization was carried out with respect to control strategies for auxiliary heating, heat losses and volume of auxiliary storage. A sensitivity analysis was carried out regarding different volumes of retrofitted hot water boiler, DHW profiles and climates. It was estimated that, with adequate improvements, extended annual solar fractions of 60%, 78% and 81% can be achieved for Lund (Sweden), Lisbon (Portugal) and Lusaka (Zambia), respectively.

This study presents a 10-ms 18-band quasi-ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave filter bank for processing 24 kHz audio signals. We first discuss a filter order optimization algorithm to define the quasi-ANSI filters. The group delay constraint of filters is limited to 10 ms. The proposed design adopts an efficient prescription-fitting algorithm to reduce inter-band interference, enabling the proposed quasi-ANSI filter bank to compensate any type of hearing loss (HL) using the NAL-NL1 or HSE prescription formulas. Simulation results reveal that the maximum matching error in the prescriptions of the mild HL, moderate HL, and severe-to-profound HL is less than 1.5 dB. This study also investigates the complexity-effective multirate IFIR quasi-ANSI filter bank. For an 18-band digital hearing aid with a 24 kHz sampling rate, the proposed architecture eliminates approximately 93% of the multiplications and up to 74% of the storage elements, compared with a parallel FIR filters architecture. The proposed analysis filter bank (AFB) was designed in UMC 90 nm CMOS high-VT technology, and on the basis of post-layout simulations, it consumes 73 μW (@ VDD=1 V).

Moreover, the influence of waste availability as function of production planning without waste storage is analyzed in several multiperiod optimizations. There, it is demonstrated that this saving potential can be further increased by integration of multiperiod production planning with waste management policies, up to the level of 40% for the environmental impact, and more than 50% for the operating cost, compared to the industrial base case. In some specific cases, a proper matching of production planning and waste mixing policies can also turn the waste treatment into a source of profit exploiting energy production from the incineration process.This study reveals the savings potential of more flexible policies in waste management, in particular waste mixing of liquid waste in batch chemical industries treated in incineration, wet air oxidation, wastewater treatment plants, or recovered by distillation. Through a multi-objective optimization framework including models for operating costs and life-cycle inventories based on industrial data, operating constraints from industrial practice, and terminal constraints from legislation, savings potentials up to 50% for the operation cost and 40% for the environmental impact are demonstrated in two case studies.Supplemental Materials: Supplemental materials are available for this paper.

Phytic acid is, however, poorly hydrolyzed by pigs and poultry, and it has a capacity to complex dietary nutrients, thereby reducing nutrient digestibility. Reduced nutrient digestibility by PA implies reduced efficiency of utilization of the nutrients and increased discharge of the unabsorbed nutrients to the environment. Phytic acid has also recently been shown to increase the endogenous nutrient losses (ENL) in pigs and poultry. Because the increased ENL in the gastrointestinal tract are associated with increased maintenance requirement for the lost nutrients and of energy spent on their secretion, an increase in ENL due to PA implies that there are other adverse effects of PA on nutrient utilization in addition to reducing nutrient digestibility. In this review, the effects of PA on performance of pigs and poultry, and on the digestibility and ENL in these animals are discussed in detail. Also, the mechanisms by which PA reduces nutrient digestibility and increases gastrointestinal ENL in pigs and poultry are discussed, and areas that need further research to gain more insight into these mechanisms are suggested.","Nutrient utilization; Phytic acid; Pig; Poultry",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873977677

By implying the Fish Schooling Concept effectively and successfully, it is possible to advance the wind-energy technology more. In the last 3-4 decades, the wind turbine capacity has been increased around 30-40 times. With the increase of wind energy capacity, the demand of the energy storage system has been increased significantly. Along with the many energy storage systems, fuel cells and batteries are the two most promising devices to meet the demand in RE systems.

That equation includes variables such as inflow, volume storage and released water from the reservoir that are commonly related to each other by some constant coefficients in predefined linear and nonlinear patterns. Although optimization tools have been extensively applied to develop an optimal operational decision rule, only optimal constant coefficients have been derived and the operational patterns are assumed to be fixed in that operational rule curve. Genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary algorithm (EA), based on genetic algorithm (GA), which is capable of calculating an operational rule curve by considering optimal operational undefined patterns. In this paper, GP is used to extract optimal operational decision rules in two case studies by meeting downstream water demands and hydropower energy generation. The extracted rules are compared with common linear and nonlinear decision rules, LDR and NLDR, determined by a software package for interactive general optimization (LINGO) and GA. The GP rule improves the objective functions in the training and testing data sets by 2.48 and 8.53%, respectively, compared to the best rule by LINGO and GA in supplying downstream demand. Similarly, the hydropower energy generation improves by 48.03 and 44.21% in the training and testing data sets, respectively. Results show that the obtained objective function value is enhanced significantly for both the training and testing data using GP. They also indicate that the proposed rule, based on GP, is effective in determining optimal rule curves for reservoirs. © IWA Publishing 2013.","Decision rule; Genetic programming; Reservoir system",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873587242

Increasing reliance on wind generation poses challenges for electrical system operators because of the variable nature of wind, lack of storage, need for backup generation, transmission constraints and costs of building additional transmission capacity. The remaining power is generated by two dams used primarily for flood control. Although their capacity factors are less than 10%, a small subcomponent of the model simulates the operation of a hydro facility so that the system has some capacity to store wind generated electricity by holding back water.

Furthermore, it consists of fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAS) which have a great influence on biodiesel fuel properties and in the storage lifetime of biodiesel itself. The biodiesel storage stability is directly related to the oxidative stability parameter (Induction Time-IT) which is determined by means of the Rancimat® method. This method uses condutimetric monitoring and induces the degradation of FAAS by heating the sample at a constant temperature. The European Committee for Standardization established a standard (EN 14214) to determine the oxidative stability of biodiesel, which requires it to reach a minimum induction period of 6 h as tested by Rancimat® method at 110 °C. In this research, we aimed at developing a fast and simple alternative method to determine the induction time (IT) based on the FAAS ultrasonic-accelerated oxidation. The sonodegradation of biodiesel samples was induced by means of an ultrasonic homogenizer fitted with an immersible horn at 480 Watts of power and 20 duty cycles. The UV-Vis spectrometry was used to monitor the FAAS sonodegradation by measuring the absorbance at 270 nm every 2. Biodiesel samples from different feedstock were studied in this work.

Because of the higher values of the glass transition, it is recognized that the optimum behavior of the three-component system corresponds to the 10% loading level of iron nanoparticles. The addition of iron nanoparticles into the epoxy matrix resulted in a significant increment in the storage modulus and crosslink density. Also, the DGEBA/IPDA/10% iron nanoparticles showed an enhanced thermal stability owing to the introduction of iron nanoparticles as reinforcing filler. Curing reaction of DGEBA/IPDA with 10% iron nanoparticles was investigated by DSC at dynamic mode. Activation energy was calculated based on Kissinger method (66.52 kJ mol-1). Also, the advanced isoconversional method is utilized to describe the curing reaction process. In the dynamic DSC analyses, the curing kinetics could be successfully described with the two-parameter autocatalytic model (Sěsták- Berggren equation) and the overall reaction order was about 2.78. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Epoxy resin; Metal nanoparticles; Sestak-Berggren equation; Thermal properties; Thermoset","Advanced isoconversional method; Autocatalytic model; Cross-link densities; Curing behavior; Curing kinetics; Curing reactions; Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A; Dynamic DSC; Dynamic modes; Epoxy matrices; Iron nanoparticles; Kissinger methods; Loading level; Overall reactions; Reinforcing fillers; Sestak-Berggren equation; Thermo-physical property; Three-component system; Activation energy; Curing; Epoxy resins; Ethers; Glass transition; Loading; Metal nanoparticles; Reaction kinetics; Thermodynamic properties; Thermosets; Iron",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872487199

Therefore, a thermal explosion accident of CHP in oxidation tower in 2010 in Taiwan was investigated because of piping breakage. In general, high concentration of CHP for thermal analysis using the calorimeter is dangerous. Therefore, a simulation method and a kinetic parameter were used to simulate thermal hazard of high concentrations of CHP only by the researcher. This study was applied to evaluate thermal hazard and to analyze storage parameters of 80 and 88 mass% CHP using three calorimeters for the oxidation tower, transportation, and 50-gallon drum. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (a non-isothermal calorimeter), thermal activity monitor III (TAM III) (an isothermal calorimeter), and vent sizing package 2 (VSP2) (an adiabatic calorimeter) were employed to detect the exothermic behavior and runaway reaction model of 80 and 88 mass% CHP.

Therefore, applying data compression before transmission will significantly and directly help in reducing total power consumption of a sensor node thereby extending the network lifetime.

The potential applications of nanobiotechnology in bioenergy and biosensors have encouraged researchers in recent years to investigate new novel nanoscaffolds to build robust nanobiocatalytic systems. Enzymes, mainly hydrolytic class of enzyme, have been extensively immobilised on nanoscaffold support for long-term stabilisation by enhancing thermal, operational and storage catalytic potential. In the present report, novel nanoscaffold variants employed in the recent past for enzyme immobilisation, namely nanoparticles, nanofibres, nanotubes, nanopores, nanosheets and nanocomposites, are discussed in the context of lipase-mediated nanobiocatalysis. These nanocarriers have an inherently large surface area that leads to high enzyme loading and consequently high volumetric enzyme activity. Due to their high tensile strengths, nanoscale materials are often robust and resistant to breakage through mechanical shear in the running reactor making them suitable for multiple reuses. The optimisation of various nanosupports process parameters, such as the enzyme type and selection of suitable immobilisation method may help lead to the development of an efficient enzyme reactor. This might in turn offer a potential platform for exploring other enzymes for the development of stable nanobiocatalytic systems, which could help to address global environmental issues by facilitating the production of green energy. The successful validation of the feasibility of nanobiocatalysis for biodiesel production represents the beginning of a new field of research. The economic hurdles inherent in viably scaling nanobiocatalysts from a lab-scale to industrial biodiesel production are also discussed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Analytical techniques; Biodiesel; Enzyme; Nanofibre; Nanoparticle; Nanoscaffold; Nanosheet; Nanotube; Reactor; Stabilisation","Analytical techniques; Bio-energy; Biodiesel production; Catalytic potential; Environmental issues; Enzyme loading; Enzyme reactors; Green energy; High-tensile strength; Immobilisation; Large surface area; Mechanical shear; Nano-scale materials; Nanocarriers; Nanoscaffolds; Nanosupports; Optimisations; Potential applications; Process parameters; Reactor; Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Biosensors; Enzymes; Nanofibers; Nanoparticles; Nanopores; Nanosheets; Nanotubes; Stabilization; Nanobiotechnology; biodiesel; biofuel; molecular scaffold; multi walled nanotube; nanocomposite; nanofiber; nanoparticle; single walled nanotube; triacylglycerol lipase; bioenergy; biofuel; bioreactor; enzyme activity; immobilization; nanotechnology; sensor; stabilization; acylation; alpha helix; biocatalysis; bioenergy; biofuel production; bioreactor; biosensor; concentration (parameters); covalent bond; cross linking; enantioselectivity; enzyme activity; enzyme immobilization; enzyme stability; feasibility study; flow rate; heat tolerance; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; methanolysis; nanobiotechnology; nanocatalysis; nanopore; nonhuman; particle size; process optimization; response surface method; review; shear stress; surface property; tensile strength; thermostability; transesterification; Biofuels; Biotechnology; Enzyme Stability; Enzymes, Immobilized; Nanotechnology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872334138

Hypertri-glyceridemia; increased free fatty acid availability; adipose tissue release of proinflammatory cyto-kines; liver insulin resistance and inflammation; increased liver VLDL synthesis and secretion; reduced clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins; presence of small, dense LDL particles; and reduced HDL cholesterol levels are among the many metabolic alterations closely related to this condition. Age, gender, genetics, and ethnicity are broad etiological factors contributing to varia-tion in visceral adipose tissue accumulation. Specific mechanisms responsible for proportionally increased visceral fat storage when facing positive energy balance and weight gain may involve sex hormones, local cortisol production in abdominal adipose tissues, endocannabinoids, growth hormone, and dietary fructose. Physiological characteristics of abdominal adipose tissues such as adipocyte size and number, lipolytic responsiveness, lipid storage capacity, and inflammatory cytokine production are significant correlates and even possible determinants of the increased cardiometabolic risk associated with visceral obesity. Thiazolidinediones, estrogen replacement in postmenopausal women, and testosterone replacement in androgen-deficient men have been shown to favorably modulate body fat distribution and cardiometabolic risk to various degrees. However, some of these therapies must now be considered in the context of their serious side effects. Lifestyle interventions leading to weight loss generally induce preferential mobilization of visceral fat. In clinical practice, measuring waist circumference in addition to the body mass index could be helpful for the identification and management of a subgroup of overweight or obese patients at high cardiometabolic risk. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.",,"2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; endocannabinoid; fatty acid; fructose; glucocorticoid; growth hormone; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydrocortisone; insulin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; sex hormone; steroid; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; abdominal fat; adipocyte; adipose tissue; age; androgen deficiency; androgen therapy; article; body fat distribution; body mass; caloric intake; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular disease; cell count; cell size; cholesterol blood level; cholesterol synthesis; clinical practice; cytokine production; cytokine release; dietary intake; dyslipidemia; energy balance; energy expenditure; estrogen therapy; ethnicity; exercise; gender; heredity; homeostasis; hormone synthesis; human; hypertension; hypertriglyceridemia; hypophysis adrenal system; insulin resistance; intraabdominal fat; lifestyle modification; lipid storage; lipolysis; mesentery; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; neoplasm; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nutrition; obesity; phenotype; postmenopause; priority journal; risk assessment; sedentary lifestyle; sleep disordered breathing; steroid therapy; stress; subcutaneous fat; waist circumference; weight gain; weight reduction; Adiposity; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Energy Metabolism; Ethnic Groups; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity, Abdominal; Phenotype; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872327440

For large scale and low cost devices, structures with the use of earth abundant materials are attractive. In this study, we fabricated flexible and conductive nanopaper aerogels with incorporated carbon nanotubes (CNT). Such conductive nanopaper is made from aqueous dispersions with dispersed CNT and cellulose nanofibers. Such aerogels are highly porous with open channels that allow the deposition of a thin-layer of silicon through a plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) method. Meanwhile, the open channels also allow for an excellent ion accessibility to the surface of silicon.

Energy storage systems can mitigate these fluctuations by storing off-peak energy for use at peak-demand times. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is one of the most promising storage technologies due to the large amount of energy that can be stored at an economical cost. We evaluate the feasibility of improving the economics of CAES by distributing compressors near heat loads to enable recovery of the heat of compression to supply low-grade heating needs such as district heating. Distributed CAES (DCAES) is more efficient; however, it has higher capital costs due to the compressed air pipeline required between distributed compressors and the storage site. We evaluate the project economics of DCAES in a hypothetical scenario with a variable electric and heat load. The size and dispatch of a generation fleet composed of a wind farm, CAES or DCAES plant and conventional gas turbines are optimized to satisfy the annual electricity load at an hourly resolution at the lowest total cost. We find that the total cost of supplying heat and electric loads is less expensive with DCAES given a 50. km pipeline when fuel prices exceed $7.6/GJ. The cross-over fuel price depends on the distance as it drives the capital cost of the pipeline. The minimum effective fuel price required for economic superiority of the DCAES system is $7.0/GJ and $8.3/GJ at pipeline lengths of 25 and 100. km, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Compressed air energy storage; District heating; Economic analysis; Emission tax; Optimization; Waste heat recovery","Compressed air; Compressors; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Fuels; Optimization; Pipelines; Pressure vessels; Thermal load; Waste heat utilization; Wind power; Capital costs; Compressed air energy storage; Cross-over; Economical Costs; Electric grids; Electricity load; Energy storage systems; Fuel prices; Intermittency; Pipeline length; Project economics; Renewable energies; Storage sites; Storage technology; Supplying heat; Wind farm; District heating; capital; compliance; compressed air; cost-benefit analysis; econometrics; emissions trading; environmental constraint; feasibility study; heating; optimization; renewable resource; storage; tax system; wind farm",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871759871

The effect of operational conditions including the type of metalworking wastewater, reaction time, liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio, CO2 flow rate, and slurry volume on the CO2 fixation process was evaluated.

This paper addresses a probabilistic cost optimization scheme under uncertain environment for the MGs with several multiple Distributed Generation (DG) units. The purpose of the proposed approach is to make decisions regarding to optimizing the production of the DG units and power exchange with the upstream network for a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system. A PEMFCPP (Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel cell power plant) is considered as a prime mover of the CHP system. An electrochemical model for representation and performance of the PEMFC is applied. In order to best use of the FCPP, hydrogen production and storage management are carried out. An economic model is organized to calculate the operation cost of the MG based on the electrochemical model of the PEMFC and hydrogen storage. The proposed optimization scheme comprises a self-adaptive Charged System Search (CSS) linked to the 2. m + 1 point estimate method. The 2. m + 1 point estimate method is employed to cover the uncertainty in the following data: the hourly market tariffs, electrical and thermal load demands, available output power of the PhotoVoltaic (PV) and Wind Turbines (WT) units, fuel prices, hydrogen selling price, operation temperature of the FC and pressure of the reactant gases of FC. The Self-adaptive CSS (SCSS) is organized based on the CSS algorithm and is upgraded by some modification approaches, mainly a self-adaptive reformation approach. In the proposed reformation method, two updating approaches are considered. Each particle based on the ability of those approaches to find optimal solutions in the past iterations, chooses one of them to improve its solution.

Two different groups of nanotubes were studied: the first were (12,12) SiNTs, (19,19) CNTs, and (15,15) SiCNTs and the second were (7,7) SiNTs, (11,11) CNTs, and (9,9) SiCNTs with the diameters of 26 and 15 Å for the first and second groups, respectively. The simulations were carried out at different thermodynamic states. The potential energy functions were calculated using ab initio quantum mechanics and then fitted with (12,6) Lennard-Jones potential model as a bridge between first-principles calculations and GCMC simulations. The absolute, excess, and delivery adsorption isotherms of methane were calculated for two groups of nanotubes. The specific surface area and the isosteric heat of adsorption were computed. The radial distribution functions for the adsorbed molecules on different nanotubes were also calculated. Different isotherm models were fitted with the simulation adsorption data. According to the results, the excess uptake value of methane adsorption in (11,11) CNT array exceeded the US Department of Energy target (180 V/V at 298 K and 35 bar).

Kinetic energy is dissipated at much smaller scales in the turbulent boundary layers and in the ocean interior, where turbulent mixing controls the transport and storage of tracers such as heat and carbon dioxide. The primary site of wind power input is the Southern Ocean, where the westerly winds are aligned with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The potential energy created here is converted into a vigorous geostrophic eddy field through baroclinic instabilities. The eddy energy can power mixing in the ocean interior, but the mechanisms governing energy transfer to the dissipation scale are poorly constrained. Here we present simulations that simultaneously resolve meso- and submeso-scale motions as well as internal waves generated by topography in the Southern Ocean. In our simulations, more than 80% of the wind power input is converted from geostrophic eddies to smaller-scale motions in the abyssal ocean. The conversion is catalysed by rough, small-scale topography. The bulk of the energy is dissipated within the bottom 100 m of the ocean, but about 20% is radiated and dissipated away from topography in the ocean interior, where it can sustain turbulent mixing. We conclude that in the absence of rough topography, the turbulent mixing in the ocean interior would be diminished. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The kinetic characteristics of TAG turnover and homeostatic mechanisms linking uptake and storage dynamics in hearts have until now remained elusive. This work examines TAG pool dynamics in the intact beating heart, under normal conditions and in response to acute gene expression-induced changes in CD36. Dynamic mode 13C NMR elucidated multiple kinetic processes in 13C-palmitate incorporation into TAG: an initial, saturable exponential component and a slower linear rate. Although previous work indicates the linear component to reflect TAG turnover, we hypothesized the saturable exponential to reflect transport of LCFA across the sarcolemma. Thus, we overexpressed the LCFA transporter CD36 through cardiac-specific adenoviral infection in vivo. Within 72 h, CD36 expression was increased 40% in intact hearts, accelerating the exponential phase relative to PBS-infused hearts. TAG turnover also increased with elevations in adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and a modest increase in diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), without a significant expansion of the intracellular lipid pools. The results demonstrate a dynamic system of reciprocal gene regulation that couples saturable LCFA uptake across the sarcolemma to TAG synthesis/lipolysis rates.

The feasibility and cost of producing electricity from forest biomass depend on long term availability of biomass, its cost and quality, and the cost of collecting, pre-processing, handling, transportation, and storage of forest biomass, in addition to the operating and maintenance costs of the conversion facility. To improve the cost competitiveness of forest biomass for electricity generation, mathematical programming models can be used to manage and optimize its supply chain. In this paper, the supply chain configuration of a typical forest biomass power plant is presented and a dynamic optimization model is developed to maximize the overall value of the supply chain. The model considers biomass procurement, storage, energy production and ash management in an integrated framework at the tactical level. The developed model is a nonlinear mixed integer programming which is solved using the outer approximation algorithm provided in AIMMS software package. It is then applied to optimize the supply chain of a real biomass power plant in Canada. The optimum solution provides more profit compared to the actual profit of the power plant. Different scenarios for maximum available supply and also investment in a new ash recovery system were evaluated and the results were analyzed. The model in particular shows that investment in a new ash recovery system has economic as well as environmental benefits for the power plant. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Forest biomass power plant; Mathematical programming; Non-linear mixed integer programming; Optimization; Renewable energy; Supply chain management","Approximation algorithms; Competition; Costs; Electric generators; Forestry; Investments; Mathematical programming; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Power plants; Power quality; Profitability; Supply chain management; Ash management; Biomass power plants; Conversion facility; Cost competitiveness; Developed model; Dynamic optimization models; Electricity generation; Energy productions; Environmental benefits; Forest biomass; Integrated frameworks; Maintenance cost; Mathematical programming models; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Non-linear mixed integer programming; Optimum solution; Outer approximation algorithm; Pre-processing; Recovery systems; Renewable energies; Renewable sources; Supply chain configuration; Value chains; Wood biomass; Biomass; biomass power; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; forest resource; investment; linear programing; nonlinearity; numerical model; optimization; power plant; software; Biomass; Canada; Electric Power; Forests; Optimization; Power Generation; Power Plants; Profitability; Supply Chain Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870951251

This technique is used to improve the heat transfer during the melting process. It was found from experiments that dynamic melting was more effective than those without dynamic melting.

A proposed hybrid wind tower model composed of a concrete shaft and a steel mast with a height of 150 m was simulated using a single-degree-of-freedom system. The structural domain including the tank wall and a rigid mass was modeled using finite element method, while the fluid domain was simulated by finite volume method using CFX software. A parametric study was carried out to investigate the behavior of annular TLD under harmonic loads for different mass and frequency ratios as well as displacement amplitudes. The damping characteristics of the annular TLD model were derived by comparing the numerical results with an equivalent linear model. In addition, the effectiveness of annular TLD was estimated by comparing the numerically calculated damping ratios with those corresponding to the optimum damping ratio values derived for a particular mass ratio based on the concept of tuned mass damper. It was found that that the annular TLD is effective when the amplitude of excitation is small. Moreover, the response of TLD in terms of nonlinear free surface sloshing and the energy dissipated by the system was discussed.

Different configurations of pins on the tube have been analysed. The second model developed is similar to the first model; however, fins were embedded instead of pins. Different configurations of fins on the tube were also investigated. The last model developed was a plain copper tube surrounded by PCM with HTF flowing in it.

We have employed Hspice to evaluate various match-line sensing circuits using the Berkeley Predictive Technology Model (PTM) for 65 nm transistor model with supply voltage of 1.1 V and temperature of 25 °C. The simulation results show that the proposed DF-MLSA can achieve a search time of 0.49699 ns and an energy consumption of 0.201474 fJ/bit/search. The measured results show that the proposed DF-MLSA can reduce the energy consumption by 85.481%, 21.195%, and 10.545% compared to the conventional precharge MLSA, the stability-based MLSA, and the positive-feedback MLSA, respectively. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Content-addressable memory (CAM); match-line sense amplifier","Berkeley predictive technology models; Low Power; Match line; Measured results; Power savings; Pre-charge; Search lines; Search speed; Search time; Sense amplifier; Sensing circuits; Supply voltages; Switching activities; Ternary content addressable memories; Transistor model; Voltage swings; Associative storage; Energy utilization; SPICE; Microprocessor chips",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870861160

The optimization model prescribes the optimum number and location of farms and storages. It also determines the supply radius, the number of farms required to secure the annual supply of biomass and also the assignment of farms to storage locations. Given the specific design of the supply chain determined by the optimization model, the simulation model determines the number of required machines for each operation, their daily working schedule and utilization rates, along with the capacities of storages. To evaluate the impact of the storage systems on the delivered costs, three storage systems are molded and compared: roadside storage (RS) system and two satellite storage (SS) systems including SS with fixed hauling distance (SF) and SS with variable hauling distance (SV). In all storage systems, it is assumed the loading equipment is dedicated to storage locations. The obtained results from a real case study provide detailed cost figures for each storage system since the developed model analyses the supply chain on an hourly basis and considers time-dependence and stochasticity of the supply chain. Comparison of the storage systems shows SV would outperform SF and RS by reducing the total delivered cost by 8% and 6%, respectively. However, RS results in 10% and 8% decline in consumed energy and produced CO2 in logistics operations compared to SV and SF, respectively. Another finding is that the dedication of loading equipment to storage locations is an expensive option for agricultural biomass supply chain as loading operation is utilized 3%, 6% and 11% of its annual working hours in RS, SF and SV, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Agricultural biomass supply chain; Cellulosic ethanol; Optimization; Satellite storage; Simulation","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Cellulosic ethanol; Computer simulation; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Mathematical models; Optimization; Supply chains; Agricultural biomass; Combined simulation; Consumed energy; Developed model; Hauling contractors; Loading equipment; Logistics operations; Optimization models; Optimum number; Simulation; Simulation model; Specific design; Stochasticity; Storage location; Storage systems; Time dependence; Utilization rates; Working hours; Agricultural biomass; Combined simulation; Consumed energy; Developed model; Hauling contractors; Loading equipment; Logistics operations; Optimization models; Optimum number; Simulation; Simulation model; Specific design; Stochasticity; Storage location; Storage systems; Time dependence; Utilization rates; Working hours; Loading; agricultural land; biomass power; carbon dioxide; cellulose; computer simulation; cost-benefit analysis; ethanol; fuel consumption; numerical model; optimization; renewable resource; storage; biomass power; carbon dioxide; cellulose; cost-benefit analysis; equipment; ethanol; numerical model; optimization; stochasticity; storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870735332

The closed greenhouse can be considered as the largest commercial solar building. In principle, it is designed to maximize the utilization of solar energy by use of seasonal storage. In an ideal fully closed greenhouse, there is no ventilation window. Therefore, the excess heat must be removed by other means. In order to utilize the excess heat at a later time, long- and/or short-term thermal storage technology (TES) should be integrated. A theoretical model has been derived to evaluate the performance of various design scenarios. The closed greenhouse is compared with a conventional greenhouse using a case study to guide the energy analysis and verify the model. A new parameter has been defined in this paper in order to compare the performance of the closed greenhouse concept in different configurations - the Surplus Energy Ratio showing the available excess thermal energy that can be stored in the TES system and the annual heating demand of the greenhouse. From the energy analysis it can be concluded that SER is about three in the ideal fully closed greenhouse. Also, there is a large difference in heating demand between the ideal closed and conventional greenhouse configurations Finally, a preliminary thermo-economic study has been assessed in order to investigate the cost feasibility of various closed greenhouse configurations, like ideal closed; semi closed and partly closed conditions. Here, it was found that the design load has the main impact on the payback period. In the case of the base load being chosen as the design load, the payback period for the ideal closed greenhouse might be reduced by 50%. On the other hand, glazing type, ventilation ratio, and the closed area portion have a minor impact on the payback period. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Closed greenhouse; Energy conservation; Heat transfer; Solar commercial building; Sustainable energy management system; Thermal energy storage system","Design; Energy conservation; Energy management; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Investments; Office buildings; Solar buildings; Base-loads; Closed condition; Commercial building; Design load; Energy analysis; Heating demand; New parameters; Payback periods; Seasonal storage; Surplus energy; Sustainable energy management; Theoretical models; Thermal energy storage systems; Thermal storage technology; Thermoeconomic; Base-loads; Closed condition; Commercial building; Design load; Energy analysis; Heating demand; New parameters; Payback periods; Seasonal storage; Surplus energy; Sustainable energy management; Theoretical models; Thermal energy storage systems; Thermal storage technology; Thermoeconomic; Greenhouses; assessment method; building; cost-benefit analysis; energy efficiency; feasibility study; heating; integrated approach; solar activity; sustainable development; temperature effect; building; commercial activity; greenhouse gas; heat transfer; heating; performance assessment; solar power; sustainable development; theoretical study; thermal power; ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870728102

Many cool storage systems use phase change materials (PCMs) and achieve peak load shifting in buildings. This work presents numerical investigations of the performance enhancement of a free cooling system using a TES unit employing multiple PCMs. The TES unit is composed of a number of rectangular channels for the flowing heat transfer fluid, separated by PCM slabs. Using the effective heat capacity method, the melting and solidification of the PCM is solved. The forced convective heat transfer inside the channels is analyzed by solving the energy equation, which is coupled with the heat conduction equation in the container wall. The effect of design parameters such as PCM slab length, thickness and fluid passage gap on the storage performance is also investigated using an energy based optimization. The results show that a system which can guarantee comfort conditions for the climate of Tabriz, Iran has an optimum COP of 7.0. This could be achieved by a combination of CaCl2· 6H2O with RT25 with the optimum air channel thickness of 3.2 mm, length of 1.3 m and PCM slab thickness of 10 mm. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These effects are mediated by C5L2 receptor, which has also been associated with inflammatory effects. C5L2 deficient mice on a low-fat diet are hyperphagic yet lean due to increased energy expenditure. The present study assessed insulin sensitivity and metabolic and inflammatory changes in C5L2KO mice vs WT in diet-induced obesity. Methods: We placed C5L2KO and WT mice on a diabetogenic diet for 12 weeks and examined in vivo and ex vivo metabolism. Results: C5L2KO mice on a diabetogenic diet exhibit decreased insulin sensitivity. Whole body substrate partitioning is evidenced through increased glucose uptake by the liver and decreased uptake by adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Lipid content of both liver and skeletal muscle was higher in C5L2KO mice vs WT. Furthermore, elevated levels of macrophage markers were found in adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscle of C5L2KO mice vs WT.

It was further found that when energy recovery is of importance, making use of a vapor compression cycle increases the quality of the recovered energy, hence increasing its value. This was demonstrated by analyzing the synergy that can exist between the waste heat of a data center and heat reuse by a coal-fired power plant. It was found that power-plant efficiencies can be increased by up to 6.5% by making use of a vapor compression cycle, which results not only in significant monetary savings, but also in the reduced overall carbon footprints of both the data center and the power plant. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Coal-fired power plant; Cooling cycle; Data centers; Electronics cooling; Energy recovery; Experimental test; Liquid pump; Microchannel cooling; Monetary savings; On chips; Recovered energy; Second law analysis; Vapor compression cycle; Vapor compressors; Carbon footprint; Coal; Digital storage; Fossil fuel power plants; Vapors; Waste heat; Electronic cooling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870289391

Post-smolts in seawater (average mass 175. g) that had been reared at 12. °C were kept at three temperatures (8, 12 and 18. °C) and sampled after one and three months. After three months, the fish kept in 18. °C had decreased growth rate and condition factor, and elevated plasma levels of growth hormone (GH) and leptin, compared with fish kept at the lower temperatures. Food conversion efficiency was also decreased at 18. °C, while at the same time protein uptake was improved and thus was not a limiting mechanism for growth. Redistribution of energy stores in fish at the highest temperature is evident as a preference of maintaining length growth during times of limited energy availability. NMR-based metabolomics analyses of plasma revealed that several metabolites involved in energy metabolism were negatively affected by temperature in the upper temperature range of Atlantic salmon. Specifically, the high temperature induced a decline of several amino acids (glutamine, tyrosine and phenylalanine) and a shift in lipid metabolism. It appears likely that the decreased food intake at the highest temperature is linked to an anorexigenic function of leptin, but also that the decreased food intake, feed conversion efficiency and condition factor can be linked to changes in GH endocrinology. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Condition factor; Endocrinology; Fish; Growth; Metabolism; Metabolomics; NMR; Temperature","glutamine; growth hormone; leptin; lipid; phenylalanine; sea water; tyrosine; appetite; article; Atlantic salmon; controlled study; energy metabolism; food intake; growth hormone blood level; growth rate; lipid metabolism; metabolism; metabolome; metabolomics; nonhuman; storage temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870180455

Previous studies have shown that the highest costs are related to the provision and use of energy and that these costs could be reduced by utilising excess heat. In the present study, we investigated whether this principle could be applied to the oil refining industry. Four heat supply alternatives were evaluated: Natural Gas Combined Cycle; Natural Gas Boiler; Biomass Boiler; and Excess Heat. These alternatives were evaluated using future energy market scenarios and two levels of heat demand. The Natural Gas Combined Cycle alternative generated high levels of electricity (with CO2 capture), thereby producing the greatest reduction in global CO2 emissions. However, the avoided CO2 emissions from onsite the refinery were highest when excess heat or a biomass boiler was used. In the present study, the capture avoidance cost ranged from 40 to 263 €/tCO 2 avoided (excluding transportation and storage costs), depending on the heat supply alternative used and the heat demand. Moreover, with a high cost for CO2, CO2 capture using excess heat could be a cost-effective alternative to reduce CO2 emissions for oil refineries. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The size, increasing trend in the IPWP, calculated from the SST data is (0.18±0.01)×106km2/decade. Besides, the magnitude of increasing rate during the positive phase of the PDO is couple times higher than that during the negative phase. Furthermore, the SST trend is also associated with 1999/2000 climate shift. The heat increases in the IPWP from 1993 to 2011 implied an average warming rate of 1.41Wm-2.

Considering stochastic nature of wind, electric power generated by wind turbines is highly erratic and may affect both the power quality and the planning of power systems. ESS should play a key role in wind power applications by controlling wind power plants output and providing ancillary services to the power system, and therefore, enabling an increased penetration of wind power in the system. This article deals with the review of various storage systems for wind power applications. The main objectives of the article are the introduction of the operating principles, the presentation of the main characteristics of energy storage systems suitable for stationary applications, and the definition and discussion of potential ESS applications in wind power, according to an extensive literature review. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

For centuries, the transformed wind energy to drag-force has been used for transportation in watercrafts. With improvement of aerodynamics, the airfoil was invented to create and use a higher magnitude aerodynamic force, lift-force, in order to elevate airplanes. Later, the lift-force was horizontally applied as the thrust force in land/water wind-crafts. Whereas in airplanes horizontal airfoils (wing) create a vertical lift-force, installed vertical airfoils (wing-sail) produce a horizontal lift-force in wind-crafts. Therefore, this force can be used as thrust (driving) force in lift-based ice, water, and land vehicles. If the prevailing wind is constantly available, the vehicle speed can even exceed the wind velocity. Due to the complex kinematics of such vehicles, however, it should be noted that there would be always an optimum for the thrust force in order to control and navigate the vehicle to the destination point, and to avoid the severe undesired side-forces. This optimum is calculated in wind-craft trajectory software (WTS) which requires many inputs, including variable and constant parameters. Variable parameters consist of wind direction and magnitude in addition to vehicle's position, velocities, and accelerations. On the other hand, design characteristics of the wind-driven vehicle are known as constant parameters. The land-yacht body's drag is an unknown constant parameter which alters according to the relative wind. This implies that several wind tunnel experiment in different wind directions and speeds are required in order to obtain the drag coefficients. Therefore in order to bypass the wind tunnel measurements, this study aims to propose a fast and economical procedure to find the aforementioned drag coefficient by integration of a measurement and by a simulation approach. The obtained data can be later used in the optimization and control module of the WTS. The performance of this procedure has been investigated using a case study. For this purpose, a 1:4 prototype three-wheel land-yacht is first designed and fabricated. The land-yacht comprises of three major parts; horizontal airfoil (axle), vertical airfoil, and body. The dimensions of these elements are obtained after development of a code based on kinematics of the land-yacht. The axle is designed to increase the stability of the land-yacht, whereas the shape of the body is intended to produce a low drag coefficient in various directions. Furthermore, a set of experiments has been conducted to measure the body drag of the land-yacht in a direction parallel to the relative wind. This experiment is later used to develop and validate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model in order to estimate the drag of the land-yacht body in its various directions against the relative wind. The results show the adequate efficacy of this procedure to provide the required data for the optimization and control module of the WTS. © 2012.","Aerodynamics; Airfoil; CFD; Land-yacht; Wind energy","Aerodynamic forces; Alternative source; Constant parameters; Design characteristics; Destination points; Driving forces; Land vehicles; Land-yacht; Optimization and control; Prevailing winds; Simulation approach; Thrust forces; Variable parameters; Vehicle speed; Wind directions; Wind tunnel experiment; Wind tunnel measurements; Wind velocities; Aerodynamics; Air pollution control; Airfoils; Automobile manufacture; Axles; Computational fluid dynamics; Digital storage; Drag; Drag coefficient; Experiments; Kinematics; Lift; Optimization; Vehicles; Wind power; Wind tunnels; Yachts; Automobile bodies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868508155

Global warming is increasing along with the energy consumption. Many researchers are concerned about this present global environmental problem for fossil-fuel burning. Thermal energy storage system with phase change material is observed as a potential candidate for mitigating this problem. This paper emphasizes the opportunities for energy savings and greenhouse-gas emissions reduction with the implementation of PCM in TES systems. For instance, about 3.43% of CO2 emission by 2020 could be reduced through the application of PCM in building and solar thermal power systems.

Mineral carbonation technology is one of the types of CCS technology. In this process gaseous CO2 is converted into geologically stable carbonates. This process has some potential advantages compared to other available CCS technologies which have attracted the attention of researchers for further development of this technology for sequestering CO2. One of the potential benefits of this technology is its exothermic reaction process. This exothermic heat energy can be recovered and used in other energy consuming components of carbonation plant. Heat energy from the products of the carbonation process can also be captured. This technology has not fully been developed yet, in particular for implementing it into power plants. In this study a thermodynamic mass and energy balance model is developed using Matlab/Simulink software for investigating energy recovery opportunities. Wollastonite mineral is used as feed stocks. The amount of heat energy which can be recovered at different carbonation temperatures is determined and analysed for a case study power plant with capacity of 1400 MW. It is found from this study that the carbonation process in case study power plant is energy self-sufficient, even only by the exothermic heat produced from the reaction and no heat recovery is needed from the products of carbonation process. It is also found that the energy required to supply to the carbonation plant (i.e. to grinder and compressor) decreases with increase in carbonation temperature. The surplus exothermic heat energy and heat energy from carbonated products can be utilized to reduce the fuel energy required for the existing power plant. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The system is filled with salty water in order to form upper convective, non-convective and lower convective zones. A data acquisition device is used to measure and record the hourly temperatures at various locations in different solar pond zones (distributed vertically within and at the bottom of the pond, and horizontally and vertically within the insulated side-walls). A shading model is developed to gain a more profound understanding of the energy performance of the pond. The model results of the each zone are compared with and without shading effect, based on the corresponding energy efficiencies. The shading surface area of the zones does not contribute to the thermal performance of the pond but it takes place non-sunny area in the zones by shading. Thus, the efficiency of the solar pond decreases with increasing the shading area. The energy efficiencies of the inner zones with and without the shading effect for each zone in the energy analysis are specified as the average representative solar energy for each month of the year. The highest energy efficiencies for the cases of with and without shading area are found for the month of August to be: 4.22% and 4.30% for the upper convective zone, 13.79% and 16.58% for the non-convective zone, and 28.11% and 37.25% for the lower convective zone, respectively. The results confirm that the solar pond storage efficiency can be increased by eliminating the effect of shading area.

An electrolyzer produces hydrogen from surplus energy generated by the wind turbine and photovoltaic array of HGPS for later use by a fuel cell. The PSO algorithm is used to optimize membership functions of the FLC. The FLC inputs are (a) net power flow and (b) batteries state of charge (SOC) and FLC output determines the time for hydrogen production or consumption.

It is determined that FLC optimization results in (a) reduced fluctuations in batteries SOC which translates into longer life for batteries and the average SOC is increased by 6.18% and (b) less working hours for fuel cell, when the load is met by wind and PV. It is found that the optimized FLC results in lower O&M costs and LPSP by 57% and 33%, respectively, as compared to its un-optimized counterpart.

The conjugate heat transfer between the heat transfer fluid (HTF) and PCM, which undergoes a cyclic melting and freezing process, is solved numerically using the computational fluid dynamic approach utilizing enthalpy-porosity formulation. The results indicate that our novel festoon channel design yields improved heat transfer rate for both charging and discharging stages. To further enhance heat transfer performance, we introduce use of multiple PCMs with various configurations of different PCM arrangement. Advantages and limitations of each design are evaluated with respect to their heat transfer performance vis-à-vis heat storage capacity. Further R&D and experimentation is needed to arrive at commercially viable designs of PCM heat storage units. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the proposed system incorporates battery-based energy storage and a dc dc bidirectional converter to support the slow dynamics of the FC. The single-phase boost inverter is voltage-mode controlled and the dc dc bidirectional converter is current-mode controlled. The low-frequency current ripple is supplied by the battery which minimizes the effects of such ripple being drawn directly from the FC itself.Moreover, this system can operate either in a grid-connected or stand-alone mode. In the grid-connected mode, the boost inverter is able to control the active (P) and reactive (Q) powers using an algorithm based on a second-order generalized integrator which provides a fast signal conditioning for single-phase systems. Design guidelines, simulation, and experimental results taken from a laboratory prototype are presented to confirm the performance of the proposed system. © 2012 IEEE.","Boost inverter; Fuel cell; Grid-connected inverter; Power conditioning system (PCS); PQ control","Bidirectional converter (BDC); Boost inverters; Building blockes; Current mode; Generalized integrators; Grid connected inverters; Grid-connected; Grid-connected fuel cell systems; Grid-connected modes; Low costs; Low-frequency currents; Power conditioning systems; Second orders; Single-phase systems; Slow dynamics; Stand-alone modes; Voltage mode; Active filters; Electric inverters; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866403624

A residential solar PV-electrolyzer system is developed and coupled with a high temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system (PV-FC) for supplying the electricity demand. It is possible for the PV system to generate electricity in excess of the demand during off-peak hours. The surplus electricity is used by the water electrolyzer for hydrogen production. The hydrogen produced is stored in a storage tank. The fuel cell is fed with the hydrogen generated by the electrolyzer. The PV-FC system is coupled with a heat recovery unit, which provides the residential area with thermal energy, to improve energy utilization. The heat recovery unit consists of a heat recovery steam generator and an absorption chiller utilizing the thermal energy of the SOFC flue gas for heating and cooling purposes. Determining system operational parameters is important for the design and implementation of the CHP system in a residential area. Therefore, the residential CHP system is assessed here based on energy and exergy. The hourly demand of the residential area is taken into consideration for component selection and sizing, and energy and exergy efficiencies of the developed system are presented. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of discharge rate on these relationships is also investigated. Three of these properties are considered, revealing that at low discharge rates heat treated manganese dioxide is optimized by a pyrolusite fraction of ∼0.65, high Mn(IV), and low surface area; while at high discharge rates slightly higher pyrolusite content (∼0.73), high Mn(IV), and surface area around 44 m 2 g -1 are most beneficial.

A battery model that predicts current-voltage (I-V) performance with high accuracy is vital for circuit designers so they can design circuits to control the usage of the battery and improve its runtime and its safety during use. In this paper, a battery model with two resistance- capacitance (RC) parallel networks is used for modelling and the values for parameters are divided into two sets; one for loaded conditions and the other for unloaded conditions. A methodology of transient response correction is proposed for formulating the parameters of the loaded condition. The steps for parameter extraction are discussed and the proposed battery model is validated using data from several experiments. The comparison between experiment and simulation results shows that the proposed model is capable of predicting I-V performance of the battery with very little error. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is a decentralized energy management system tasked to aggregate the capacity of some Distributed Generations (DGs), storage facilities, and Dispatchable Loads (DLs) for the purpose of energy trading and/or providing system support services. Due to the stochastic behavior of the prime sources of some DGs, such as wind speed and temperature, the steady state analysis of the systems with integration of such DG units requires a probabilistic approach. In this paper, a probabilistic Price Based Unit Commitment (PBUC) approach using Point Estimate Method (PEM) is employed to model the uncertainty in market price and generation sources, for optimal bidding of a VPP in a day-ahead electricity market. Also, the uncertainty of stochastic DGs generations is handled through increasing the amount of required reserve. The proposed model allows a VPP to decide on the unit commitment of its DERs, and the optimal sale/purchase bids to the day-ahead market. The proposed optimization algorithm is applied to an 18-buses system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
