The samples were characterized in-situ during the growth of the films and after the irradiations by Auger and photoelectron spectroscopies without breaking the vacuum, and later, by scanning electron microscopy. The formation of the AlSb compound is observed above the fluence threshold previously reported. Lateral transport of matter and inhomogeneous reaction are observed after irradiation of the Al films deposited on Sb crystals, leading to the formation of an inhomogeneous surface with holes and particles. A strong chemical reaction between the substrate and the films also leads to a partial oxidation of the film evaporated on quartz or glass. We observed the same behaviour under the IR laser beam from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. One has taken advantage of fast thermal processes of thin films induced by pulsed or scanned CW laser beams for applications like synthesis of compounds by laser alloying, oxidation of thin films, planarization, and phase changes in optical data storage media. The relevant parameters needed to predict the evolution of the film/substrate interface under strong laser irradiation using the thermal model are not only: (i) the thermal properties of the substrate, and (ii) the optical characteristics of the film-substrate system, but also (iii) the chemical stability of the interface, and (iv) the free surface energies of the substrate and of the film, at least above the melting fluence threshold or if thermal cycling is expected over large periods of time. © 1990.",,"Chemical Reactions--Photochemical Reactions; Intermetallics--Synthesis; Laser Pulses--Radiation Effects; Spectroscopy, Auger Electron--Applications; Spectroscopy, Photoelectron--Applications; Interfacial Photochemical Reactions; Intermetallic Compound Synthesis; Laser-Evaporated Semiconducting Films; Pulsed Laser Film Annealing; X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Semiconducting Films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025545378

Attention is focussed on the stage of oxidation of water to molecular oxygen, i.e. modelling photosystem II.

Diets I, II and IV contained yeast, diet III was without yeast. Live food resulted in large hepatocyte nuclei, indicative of intensive cell metabolism, and in a strong development of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), indicative of strong hepatocellular protein synthesis. Among all dietary treatments, hepatic energy stores (glycogen) were lowest in the zooplankton group. The hepatocellular features described are indicative of primarily anabolic liver metabolism in zooplankton-fed larvae. The four dry diets led to significantly smaller nuclei, indicating lower cell metabolic activity. Diets I-III, which all contained wheat flour, resulted in poor development of the RER and in significantly increased hepatic glycogen storage, whereas the carbohydrate-free diet IV was associated with lower glycogen contents and improved development of the RER. It was concluded that coregonid larvae are not able to metabolize efficiently carbohydrates absorbed from the diet. The presence (diets I, II, IV) or absence (diet III) of yeast in the dry food was of no relevance for liver function, indicating that yeast is not a crucial ingredient for successful coregonid starter diets. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249017785

One technique for imaging surface magnetic microstructure on the 10-nm-length scale is scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis (SEMPA). This technique employs a scanning electron microscope (SEM) electron optical column to form a medium energy (10-50 keV), small probe (<50 nm) of high current (>1 nA) on a ferromagnetic specimen. Secondary electrons excited in the ferromagnet by the high spatial resolution probe retain their spin-polarization orientation as they leave the sample surface. The spin polarization of the emitted secondary electrons can be related directly to the local magnetization orientation. A surface magnetization map is generated when the spin polarization of the secondary electrons is analyzed as the electron beam is rastered point-by-point across the ferromagnet's surface. In this review article we review the important instrumental components characterizing the SEMPA system. Characteristics of the electron probe forming optics, electron spin-polarization analyzers with associated transport optics, and signal processing electronics will be described. Emphasis on the fundamental design requirements will be stressed. Data acquisition, storage, and processing, as it applies specifically to SEMPA, will be reviewed. Instrumental artifacts specific to SEMPA will be outlined and techniques for their correction given.

The recombination is catalyzed by both electrodes and the extent of the reaction increases on stirring, especially when D2 gas sparging is used for this purpose. Thermal effects of stored chemical energy, which include thermal power output exceeding electrical input in the short term and cathode meltdown from total sudden release, arise from storage of D atoms in supersaturated solid solution within the cathode volume. Their recombination to form D2 builds up high internal pressures, causing multiple fracture. Excess heat is liberated as D atoms and D2 molecules fall into deep traps created on fresh Pd surfaces, supplemented by D recombination heat.

We have built several lasers with diffraction-limited single-mode output of 380 mW. These lasers can be injection-locked in a chain configuration to sum their power, while maintaining diffraction-limited, single-frequency operation. We demonstrated this chaining technique with two lasers, with a total output of 340 mW, and expect that it is practical for up to about ten lasers. Thus with lasers of 380 mW, output of 3 Watts is possible. The chaining technique, if properly engineered, results in redundancy. Monolithic, diode-pumped Nd:YAG ring lasers can provide narrow-linewidth, tunable output which is adequate for use as a local oscillator in a coherent communication system. We build a commerical laser which has a linewidth of about 2 kHz, a power of 5 milliwatts, and which is tunable over a range of 30 MHz in a few microseconds. We phase-locked one of these lasers to a second, similar laser. This demonstrates that the powerful technique of heterodyne detection is possible with a diode-pumped laser used as a local oscillator. A key to the usefulness of these lasers in space communication is modulation. We have experimented with a technique for converting the cw, infrared output of these lasers into randomly pulsed, green output useful for Pulse-Position Modulation. Energy storage in an external resonant cavity permits peak green output to be much more powerful than cw infrared input.

Previously, the generation sources that were not owned by a utility were typically very large industrial plants with generators connected to the power system at a substation through a dedicated line. However, many of the non-utility generators (called DSG for dispersed sources of generation or dispersed storage and generation) built after 1979 are connected directly to the closest utility distribution circuit. With this configuration, the parallel generator may energize a distribution line after the utility circuit breaker or line recloser has opened. One study in particular addressed the economics of small cogeneration, considering the costs of capital equipment for installations up to 800 kW capacity. One notable conclusion of that study is that once the desired level of protection is defined, the costs to protect the interconnection do not vary with generation capacity. The study reports that 'utility grade' relays affording a 'high level' of protection will represent more than 25% of the cost of the major power system capital equipment at 800 kW and nearly 50% for a 100 kW installation. The obvious question is: 'Is it possible and practical, using advanced digital electronic design, to incorporate most (or all) of the required protection functions into one package and thereby significantly reduce the expense?' This question was turned into an objective, and the resulting multifunction protective relay is explained in this paper. The paper is written from the viewpoint of the power system protection engineer and considers the method used to decide which functions to include, the reasoning behind these decisions, and the general operation of the various functions.",,"Relay Protection--Applications; Multifunction Relays; Relay Functions; Cogeneration Plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025682267

The principal hypothesis is that maturation is regulated by the level of energy storage. The simulations fit adequately to the measurements of the egg-laying rate in constant as well as in varying food concentrations. It is demonstrated that the classical steady-state relationships between food and egg laying rate do not provide a good estimation of the fecundity of C. typicus when food fluctuates periodically. The model predicts that the average egg-laying rate of a population of C. typicus changes radically for periodicities of food variation <̃2 days. The average rate is insensitive to the periodicity of food variation for a period >2 days. It is suggested that the frequency of food variation is a parameter as important as quality and quantity, which must be taken into account to predict adequately the egg production of females during their lifespan. © 1990 Oxford University Press.",,"calanoid; copepod; reproduction; Calanoida; Centropages typicus; Copepoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025669725

Two main impacts of inadequate watershed management are discussed. These are increased reservoir sedimentation which reduces storage capacity which may in turn render water projects uneconomic, and changing patterns of stream flow. It is argued that watershed management should not be viewed exclusively from the narrow perspective of benefits to water projects alone.

After choosing the order of the transfer function at least equal to the total number of the energy storage elements of z1(s) and z2(s), the result can easily be extended to any all-pole lowpass response for any non-Foster positive-real impedances z1(s) and z2(s) except for the case where z1(s) and z2(s) have a common finite zero on the jω-axis.",,"Electric Networks--Equivalent Circuits; Mathematical Techniques--Poles and Zeros; Coupling Networks; Equivalent Network; Impedance Matching; Ladder Equalizer; Power Transfer; Scattering Matrix; Electric Filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025629571

Quenching rate constants by stable molecules span a wide range of values; those for diatomic molecules, with the notable exception of the halogens, generally are less than 1 × 10-14 cm3 s-1, but more reactive molecules, such as C2H4, NH3 and P(CH3)3, have rate constants of approximately 1 × 10-11 cm3 s-1.

As the voltage becomes large and the switching speed becomes extremely fast, the generation of high power electrical pulses using photoconductive devices becomes very complicated because of effects such as surface flash-over, stray inductance, stray capacitance, and abrupt impedance transitions. Two approaches were taken to produce maximum output voltage amplitude without degradation in switch risetime. A coaxial transmission line with a switch holder filled with a high dielectric strength liquid was fabricated for long pulsewidths (2 ns). For the narrow pulsewidths ( 2 ns) a quasi-radial transmission line was fabricated.

MITE is a power flow testbed that has been modified to conduct experiments in high-power plasma opening switch (POS) technology and apply this technology to inertial confinement fusion. The goal of the experiment is to develop a POS that conducts megampere currents for 300 ns, then opens in 5-10 ns. MITE/POS is an advanced power flow experiment that uses a magnetically insulated transmission line (MITL) as the inductive energy store and as a means to shape the output pulse. This experiment demonstrates that a simplified, lower-cost facility can be built by eliminating water pulse-forming lines and water switching. The disadvantage is that a new technology, the triggered POS, must be implemented. The triggered POS is necessary for synchronization of multiple modules with a long-conduction-time POS. The MITE facility has been modified to drive a 250-nH, 16.6-Ω MITL at 0.9 MA to accommodate this power flow experiment. A MITL inductive energy storage of 101 kJ is available for POS switching to a matched load.

The Mount Adams andesite-dacite stratocone itself is a compound edifice that includes the high cone above 2300 m (20-10 ka), remnants of at least two earlier andesite-dacite cones as old as 0.5 Ma, and 7 Holocene flank vents.

Crucial to the design of the magnetic refrigerator are the heat switches at both the hot and cold ends of the GGG pill. The 2 K heat switch utilizes a narrow He II filled gap. The 10 K heat switch is based on a narrow helium gas gap. For each switch, the helium in the gap is cycled by means of activated carbon pumps. The design concentrates on reducing the switching times of the pumps and the switches as a whole. A single stage system (one magnet; one refrigerant pill) is being developed.

To investigate some of the structural mechanics of our design concepts, we utilized an axisymmetric finite element model. This model was subjected to both cooldown stresses and magnetic body forces. Initial numerical results have shown that the strain-induced resistivity can be limited to an acceptable value.",,"Aluminum; Boron; Composite materials; Cryogenic liquids; Electric conductivity of solids; Electric conductors; Energy storage; Epoxy resins; Finite element method; Mathematical models; Reinforcement; Structural design; Brooks coil design; Magnetic energy storage; Plastic deformation; Plastic strains; Strain induced resistivity; Structural mechanics; Electromagnets",Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025574738

The viscosity of the as-prepared sols increased almost linearly with increasing PEG content. The increase in viscosity of the sols during the storage was retarded with decreasing molecular weight of PEG added and with increasing amount of PEG added. The viscosity increase of the sols during the storage, however, showed a similar temperature dependence, i.e. almost the same apparent activation energy was obtained, in the sols containing different amounts of PEG. These findings indicate that PEG added to the SiO2-TiO2 sols scarcely reacts with the hydrolyzed inorganic species. The hardness of the resultant PEG-containing gel films greatly decreased with increasing PEG content. The gel films containing PEG of the smaller average molecular weight showed the higher hardness and the steeper increase in hardness with increasing the heat-treatment temperature than those containing PEG of the larger average molecular weight. For a high performance in the fine patterning process and densification of the resultant patterned films, PEG of the smaller amount and the smaller molecular weight is favorable, provided the PEG-containing gel films are initially soft enough to emboss fine patterns by pressing a stamper. Incorporated PEG in the SiO2-TiO2 gel films decomposed completely at temperatures over 300°C and had a very slight influence on chemical bondings in the resultant films.",,"Films - Additives; Glass - Coatings; Optical Devices - Applications; Optical Properties; Glass Disks; Optical Memory Disk; Polymer Addition Effects; Pregrooving; Sol Gel Coating Technique; Data Storage, Optical",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025568814

Moreover, they have many problems in commercial use such as balance of electricity and heat demands, correspondence between electricity and heat generation, large electricity fluctuation, etc. Therefore, it becomes important to evaluate the energy conservation effect on cogeneration systems. Particularly, in Japan, cogenerators have almost imperfect interconnection to the centralized electricity grid. Namely, most cogenerators are only able to purchase electric power, not to sell.

One of the major goals was to extend the human presence beyond earth's boundaries and to advance the scientific knowledge of the solar system. A broad spectrum of potential civil space mission opportunities and interests are currently being investigated by NASA to meet the espoused goals. Participation in many of these missions requires power systems with capabilities far beyond what exists today. In other mission examples, advanced power systems technology could enhance mission performance significantly. Power system requirements and issues that need resolution to ensure eventual mission accomplishment are addressed, in conjunction with the ongoing NASA technology development efforts and the need for even greater innovative efforts to match the ambitious solar exploration mission goals. Particular attention is given to potential lunar surface operations and technology goals, based on investigations to date. It is suggested that the nuclear reactor power systems can best meet long-life requirements as well as dramatically reduce the earth-surface-to-lunar-surface transportation costs due to the lunar day/night cycle impact on the solar system's energy storage mass requirements.

This storage ring provides a stable (300-ps FWHM) e+-beam with a lower energy dispersion and higher current than ACO. The Nd:YAG laser oscillator has been modified by adding an acoustooptic mode-locker and an acoustooptic modulator with simple feedback and timing electronics to generate a stable pulse (300 ps FWHM with intracavity etalon) synchronized with the e+-packet. After amplification and frequency doubling, the system delivers 300-ps 100-mJ pulses at 532 nm with 5% stability, allowing the transfer of 150-MW peak power in the optical klystron. A significant improvement has been observed with approximately 3 × 108 photons/pulse at 173 nm, 1.5 × 106 at 106 nm, and approximately 105 at 76 nm in a 0.1-mrad angular spread. This is approximately 2 orders of magnitude better than on the ACO, and the stability of the third harmonic is also much better (20% peak to peak). These results are, however, less than theory would predict by nearly an order of magnitude.

When primary power from the spacecraft solar array/battery system is interrupted, the backup battery system, which is connected through a diode to the power input line, would automatically support the load to avoid a power interruption to the critical load for a time period long enough to ensure that ground control could access the satellite and correct the anomaly by sending appropriate commands to the spacecraft. Critical subsystems identified for the application are telemetry and command circuits, volatile computer memory, attitude control circuits, and some critical payloads. Due to volume packaging and weight restrictions that exist on most spacecraft, coupled with the long storage periods required, lithium cell technology was selected for the backup power source. Because of the high energy density (200-400 Wh/kg), long shelf life, and load capability (approximately 0.5 A), soluble cathode primary lithium technology was chosen. The most important lithium cell properties that require detail characterization for this application are capacity loss, shelf life, and the voltage delay mechanism. These are functions of storage time and temperature. During storage, a passive film builds up on the lithium electrode. The film protects the lithium electrode from progressive capacity decay but requires time to break down when a load is applied. This phenomenon results in a depressed voltage during the period of film breakdown which can last from fractions of a second to minutes.",,"Satellites; Spacecraft; Backup Battery Systems; Electric Batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025564923

The state of the building thermal storage can be controlled through variations of the zone temperatures over time within the thermal comfort region. The primary opportunities in varying zone setpoints in an optimal fashion are associated with shifting cooling loads from daytime to nighttime to (1) reduce peak electrical demands, (2) take advantage of low nighttime electrical rates, (3) offset mechanical cooling with 'free' cooling at night, and (4) enhance equipment operation at more favorable part-load conditions. The approach utilized in this study was to apply dynamic optimization techniques to computer simulations of buildings and their associated cooling systems for a range of conditions in order to determine the maximum possible savings. Results indicate that both energy costs and peak electrical use can be significantly reduced through optimal control of the intrinsic thermal storage within building structures. However, the cost savings depend upon several factors, including (1) utility rate structure , (2) part-load characteristics of the cooling plant and air-handling system, (3) weather, (4) the occupancy schedule, and (5) building thermal capacitance.",,"Air Conditioning--Energy Conservation; Buildings--Energy Storage; Control Systems, Optimal--Performance; Energy Storage--Control Systems; Energy Utilization--Costs; Building Thermal Energy Storage; HVAC System Operating Cost Reduction; Optimal Energy Storage Control Systems; Peak Electrical Demand Reduction; Office Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025564437

The technique used to predict the required ice production of the thermal storage system is conducted by training a neural network with the use of definition, fact, and training network files. Once the network is trained, any temperature pattern for a 24-hour period can be used to calculate the required next-day cooling load. Neural network training included unique temperature patterns for 'cold' and 'warm' weather fronts, as well as seasonally adjusted 'normal' temperature patterns. The resulting cold thermal storage prediction is then entered into a real-time expert system for the control of the overnight chiller operation and ice storage production.",,"Computer Systems, Digital--Real Time Operation; Control Systems, Programmed; Energy Conservation; Expert Systems--Performance; Neural Networks--Applications; Cold Thermal Storage Systems; Expert Thermal Storage Management Systems; Neural Network Based Expert Systems; Real Time Expert Systems; Thermal Storage Load Prediction; Air Conditioning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025547320

In such a situation, traditional, explicit methods (such as Runge-Kutta, etc.) may not always perform well, owing to the stability requirements of the stiff system. In such a case, certain specially designed implicit methods may be appropriate, but they require considerably more storage and computation and more sophisticated computer programs. To alleviate these problems, the authors have previously developed several simple explicit integration procedures with enhanced stability properties. These methods are useful for many stiff problems, but they have the disadvantage of a relatively low order of accuracy. A method which combines enhanced stability with third-order accuracy is presented. This is accomplished at the price of certain additional derivative evaluations. The new procedure is tested on some typical stiff problems, and comparisons are made to the traditional nonstiff RK2 method and to the other explicit stiff methods previously developed by the authors.",,"Electric Power Systems; Mathematical Techniques - Integration; Digital Simulation; Energy Systems; Computer Simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025547266

Results of heat transfer analyses of the phase-change salt contaminant canister are presented. A two-dimensional, axisymmetric finite-difference computer program which models the canister walls, salt, void, and heat engine working fluid coolant was developed. Analyses included effects of conduction in canister walls and solid salt, conduction and free convection in liquid salt, conduction and radiation across salt vapor filled void regions, and forced convection in the heat engine working fluid. Void shape, location, and growth or shrinkage (due to density difference between the solid and liquid salt phases) were prescribed based on engineering judgment. The salt phase change process was modeled using the enthalpy method. The influence of free-convection in the liquid salt on canister heat transfer performance is evaluated and shown to be important for interpreting the relationship between ground-based canister performance (in 1-g) and expected on-orbit performance (in micro-g). Attention is also focused on the influence of void heat transfer on canister wall temperature distributions.

However, relatively few experimental results have been published on the use of building thermal mass to offset demand. The use of off-peak cooling to extract heat from a building structure may increase the total energy use, while at the same time reducing peak cooling loads and cooling costs. This paper describes a project sponsored by ASHRAE TC 4.6 on thermal storage in a building. The purpose of this research project was to evaluate the effect of building thermal energy storage on the peak cooling load. To study the use of building thermal mass to reduce the peak cooling load, two experiments were performed on the independent Life Insurance building located in Jacksonville, Florida. The objective of these experiments was to 'pre-cool' the building at night and during the weekend to reduce daytime cooling loads. Supply air temperature and flow rate were measured on a floor that was being pre-cooled and on a control floor operated in a normal manner. Temperature and heat flux measurements at the concrete floor surface revealed the extent of charging and discharging of the thermal mass. Diurnal heat capacity calculations were used in analyzing the experimental results. The results showed an 18% reduction in cooling energy supplied during the daytime. There was no reduction in peak demand.",,"Air Conditioning--Energy Conservation; Buildings--Energy Storage; Building Cooling Load Reduction; Building Nighttime Precooling; Building Thermal Energy Storage; HVAC System Energy Conservation; Office Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025532316

Creep tests were carried out on internally gas pressurized tubular specimens with end plugs welded to both ends. The hoop creep strain up to the steady-state creep region was given by the following equation: ε{lunate} = 0.05{1-exp[-10(ε{lunate}st)0.51]} + ε{lunate}st, where ε{lunate}s = 1.02 × 105(E/T) exp (4060σ/E) exp (-Q/RT) (S-1), t is time (s), E is the elastic modulus (MPa), T is the temperature (K), σ is the applied stress (MPa), R is the gas constant (= 8.314 J/mol K), and Q the apparent activation energy (233 kJ/mol). The total creep deformation curve over the accelerated creep region could also be presented by the equation expressed as a function of true stress formulated on the basis of constant stress creep data. It is inferred that the transition from the steady-state to the accelerated creep region occurs without changing the deformation mechanism. It was also shown that most of the creep strain to rupture exceeded 100% and Zircaloy-4 had an extremely ductile rupture property. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010485685

A number of empirical observations strongly limit the nature of the mechanisms that govern charge injection and decay. Both electrons and holes contribute to the charge storage properties of the transistors, and the decay properties of both are thermally activated with a continuous distribution of activation energies (trap depths). Charge decay, for both charge states, is negligibly limited by mechanisms other than those which are strongly thermally activated. The programming temperature, relative to the storage temperature, significantly impacts the retention time of the excess electron state, while not affecting the long term decay of the excess hole state.

Measurements were performed by x-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS). Immediately after the HF treatment (1 min 5% HF, 2 min water rinse) vibrational spectroscopy (HREELS) shows a predominant coverage of the surface with hydride groups (80%-90% of a ML), which can be inferred from the presence of the stretching (2100 cm-1), scissor (900 cm -1) and bending (640 cm-1) vibrations in the spectra. A slight additional coverage with oxygen is proved by XPS and originates from Si-OH groups (3670 cm-1) and oxygen-related hydrocarbon groups (XPS). These Si-OH groups result from an exchange reaction of Si-F with water during the two-minute water rinse. The development of an oxygen coverage during subsequent storage in air occurs extremely slowly and shows a logarithmic behavior. A monolayer coverage of oxygen (7×1014/cm 2) is reached after approximately 7 days of storage in air. HREELS spectra exhibit the concurrent development of the asymmetric Si-O-Si vibration, which indicates that oxygen penetrates the lattice and breaks Si - Si bonds. During this period the Si-O-Si frequency shifts from about 1060 to 1100 cm -1. The penetration of backbonds of Si - H gets evident by broadening of the Si-H stretching vibration and finally by a shift to higher wavenumbers. Chemically shifted components of the Si 2p line (partially oxidized Si) are present with the SiO2-x component (chemical shift ≳3.4 eV) becoming dominant after roughly a week. Further oxidation proceeds essentially by an increase of the SiO2 peak in combination with a steeper slope of the logarithmic growth curve. The SiO2 thickness after half a year is about 8 Å. The frequency of the Si-O-Si vibration shifts up to 1120 cm-1, which can be related to a growing angle of the Si-O-Si bridge. Si - H groups are still present, the final peak position is about 2220 cm -1. The measurements show an extended induction period until the monolayer range of oxide coverage is attained. We ascribe this to the passivation of the surface by hydrogen and to a HF treatment according to Very-Large-Scale-Integration standards.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000813328

Laser-induced, collision-induced and metastable decomposition of the cluster ions were examined. Four kinds of metastable energy storage were identified: thermal, vibrational [N2(v = 1)], electronic and chemical. The argon-to-nitrogen loss-intensity ratio is a function of n and of the loss size, and also depends on the source of activation; it deviates strongly from the statistically expected values. The data lead to the conclusion that the ArN2n-2+ cluster ions are present as a mixture of N4+(ArN2n-6) and ArN2+(N2n-4) isomers, with distinct metastable electronic states and distinct but similar absorption spectra which are nearly independent of n, and have definite solid-like structures. The chemical metastability is due to the reaction Ar + N4+ → N2 + ArN2+ and is absent in the larger cluster ions, presumably because the Ar atom is separated from the N4+ core by a solid shell of N2 molecules. Delivery of energy by collision causes melting, conversion of N+4 to ArN2+ by chemical reaction, vibrational relaxation and evaporation. The interpretation of the data has been tested by measurements on cluster ions that were sputtered and then collisionally pre-heated prior to examination.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000267049

The experimental data are well described by the model. After implementation of the experimental results in the model we extrapolate the data retention lifetimes of the UV EPROM'S under operational conditions. Our measurements show that most of the tested UV EPROM devices (64 ko to 256 ko) have a similar operational lifetime, only the charge leakage activation energy differs (0.35 to 0.9 eV) depending on the type of component.

Thereafter, continuing groundwater depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer, escalating pumping energy costs, low farm profits, and government set-aside programs stimulated a decline in irrigated area. The irrigated area in the Texas High Plains declined from a peak of 2.25 million ha (6.0 million acres) in 1974 to 1.62 million ha (4.0 million acres) in 1989.

With a thermochemical method, in particular, the problem of economic transport of energy can be solved. Even for transmission of electrical energy over a long distance (more than 2000 km) it is sometimes advisable first to store the energy in the form of hydrogen.

Ordered structures are obtained for the ratio of average Coulomb to thermal energies of Γ ≫ 150.

First a zigzag pattern appears, then a helix with increasing number of particles per turn, then a tetrahedral structure of pairs of ions sitting opposite each other on a line perpendicular to the beam axis. With increasing density the average distance between nearest neighbours becomes constant. Above another linear density, ions begin to appear on the axis inside the shell formed by the helices and tetrahedra, with the number of shells increasing with linear particle density. On the surface of the cylindrical shells the particles form equilateral triangles arranged in a hexagonal structure characteristic of two-dimensional Coulomb solids. For the innermost helices the dependence of shell radii and of angles between particles are compared to analytic model calculations: at low densities the energies of these configurations are minimized with respect to the degrees of freedom, while for larger densities approximate geometrical models are used. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010399682

The basic element studied is the anionic phosphate group of DNA and its attendant counter ion Mn+ (where M is Li, Na, K, Mg or Ca). The resultant dipole moment arises from the activated localized hopping of the counter ions in double-minima potential energy wells, and for K+, Na+ and Ca2+ moments of around 1.6 × 10-29Cm are observed, which are significantly larger than those achievable using dipolar chemical groups. The careful introduction of water molecules was used to control the dielectric screening and competitive binding processes found to be important in determining the polarization of the counter ions. The relaxation time of ca 2 × 10-8s is considered to be associated with the enthalpy of activation for the rearrangement of two water molecules which occurs during the ionic hopping process.",,"Dielectric Properties; Logic Devices--Switching; Bistability; Ionic Transitions; Molecular Logic; Biological Materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025498643

Typical renewable sources considered are solar and wind energy, but the results are applicable to any other energy source. The block diagram of the plant includes renewable generator(s), storage battery, and standby diesel engine generator. At first, the authors developed an analysis based on a mathematical model that included only one renewable random source. This model related environmental statistical factors to the sizing parameters and consequently to the costs of each block. However, since the sizing is not univocally defined, the model takes the battery autonomy as 'variable' and executes on it an optimization process finalized to minimum overall cost. In conclusion, the resulting output gives either the optimized sizing parameters or the costs of each block. A step-by-step optimization procedure is described including annual cost vs. battery autonomy function consideration; mathematical approach to the environmental influence; sizing criteria of the renewable generator; the database utilized and its analysis; model algorithms; comparison between experimental and theoretical results; and the two renewable generators model.",,"Electric Batteries, Secondary; Electric Generators; Electric Power Plants; Hybrid Power Plants; Renewable Energy; Renewable Generators; Electric Power Systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025495844

This adaptation could depend on level of body energy storage. Moreover increases in resting metabolic rate (RMR) and in diet induced thermogenesis (DIT) occur after physical activity. Overeating, particularly carbohydrates overeating, leads to an increase in RMR and in DIT, which could be due on the one hand to the last hight caloric meal itself, on the other hand to an adaptation to repeated previous overeating. Very-low-caloric-diets lead to a drop in RMR in obese subjects, probably due in part to an increase in energy metabolism efficiency. Such a phenomenon has also been described in normal weight subjects after a low-caloric diet. The relationship between caloric intake and energy expenditure suggest the hypothesis of a body weight set point. But some questions are not yet settled. Could the cognitive component explain alone variations in energy storage? Does the set point value control the relationships intake-expenditure, or is the set point only the consequence of independent physiological pathways? What is regulated : body weight, adipose tissue level? Is set point genetically determined, can it change?

Reaction initiation that results from the absorption of thermal energy is a method for determination of propellant stability. An adiabatic calorimetry based, diagnostic system utilizes a commercially available accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) that has been modified to make it suitable for use with liquid gun propellants. The effects of contaminants and impurities on reaction onset temperature which is related to safe storage temperature are readily determined using the ARC. In addition to propellant safety studies, the ARC data also provide insight into propellant efficacy, since ignition and combustion are observed. Reaction onset temperatures, as determined with the ARC, are independent of the quantity of material being stored, thereby eliminating the extrapolation from small laboratory samples that is a common uncertainty in many stability evaluation test methods. The presence of nitric acid, a common propellant contaminant, affects both storage stability and propellant efficacy in the gun. The data indicate that storage stability is adversely affected to a much greater extent than efficacy. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949289669

The Ξc+ was reconstructed in the final state Ξ-π+π+, while the Ξc0 was seen in decay to Ξ-π+ and Ξ-π+π+π-. The average Ξc fragmentation spectrum has been determined, as well as the production cross section times branching ratio for each decay mode. The charged and neutral masses were measured to be 2465.1 ± 3.6 ± 1.9 MeV/c2 and 2472.1 ± 2.7 ± 1.6 MeV/c2 respectively, corresponding to a mass-splitting, M(Ξc+) - M(Ξc0), of -7.0±4.5±2.2 MeV/c2. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442712250

The applied voltage and the number of electrodes used to clear trapped ions are discussed and compared with experimental data. It was demonstrated that the ion effects were noticeably reduced by the beam size growth and the decrease of gas desorption by synchrotron radiation with a decrease in beam energy. It was also found that the ion trapping became harmless with ion management near 150 MeV where the Touschek lifetime in this ring was shortest.

Such a state is characterized by the storage of energy which is equivalent to heating the particles of UDP by tens of degrees. When UDP of aluminum are heated in air at high rates, it leads to considerable spontaneous heating (to 2200°C) and the appearance of a considerable amount of bound nitrogen (up to 30% AlN) in the products. The degree of oxidation of UDP attains more than 60% at less than 660°C of the external heater. Relaxation processes in heating of UDP of aluminum lower the temperature of the onset of oxidation. With increasing stored energy ΔE the temperature of the onset of oxidation drops, and between the rate and ΔE a direct correlation was not discovered.

We find that, relative to continued use of gasoline- powered vehicles, the use of electric vehicles would dramatically and unequivocally reduce carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. Under most conditions, nitrogen oxide emissions would decrease moderately. Sulfur oxide and particulate emissions would Increase or slightly decrease. Because other areas of the United States tend to use more coal in electricity generation and have less stringent emission controls on power plants, electric vehicles may have less emission reduction benefits outside California. © 1990 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Automobiles - Electric; Carbon Monoxide; Electric Power Utilization; Environmental Impact; Internal Combustion Engines - Exhaust Gases; Air Pollution; Air Quality; Electric Vehicles; Emission Control; Emission Impacts; Gasoline Powered Vehicles; Storage Battery Vehicles; carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; air pollution; article; electricity; methodology; motor vehicle; nonbiological model; suspended particulate matter; united states; air pollution; electric vehicle; emission impact; pollution reduction; urban area; USA, California",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025486318

The system replaces the traditional film-screen combinations by storage phosphor screens but continues to use cassettes in conventional X-ray equipment. Technical features such as consistently optimal image brightness and contrast across an extremely wide exposure range and edge-enhancement capabilities overcome deficiencies seen with conventional film-screen systems, such as improper exposure and poor contrast discrimination. Images obtained with a dual-energy radiation spectrum selectively demonstrate soft-tissue- or bone-equivalent structures and diminish the obscuring effect of bowel gas. Problems resulting from the singular reliance on film as a display and storage medium in conventional radiography are resolved in digital radiography by fast and simultaneous electronic access to images that can be displayed on high-resolution monitors or laser-printed films. The basic technical features of storage-phosphor digital imaging as compared to conventional radiography are described.

Intermittent 30-s exhaustive exercise bouts comprising 6-12 repetitions were interspersed with 60-s periods for 30 min. Venous blood samples were taken repeatedly during and after exercise for analyses of plasma free fatty acid (FFA) and glycerol concentration. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after exercise and assayed for glycogen, glycerol-3-phosphate, lactate and triglyceride (TG) content. The activities of citrate synthase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase, hexokinase (HK), myokinase, creatine kinase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD), were analysed. Histochemical staining procedures were used to assess fibre type composition, fibre area and capillary density. TG content before and after exercise averaged (SD) 23.9 (13.3) and 16.7 (6.4) mmol kg-1 dry wt. The basal triglyceride content varied sixfold among individuals and the higher the levels the greater was the change during exercise. The glycogen content decreased (P&lt;0.001) from 690 (82) to 495 (95) mmol kg-1 dry wt. and lactate and glycerol-3-phosphate increased (P&lt;0.001) to 79.5 (5.5) and 14.5 (7.3) mmol kg-1 dry wt., respectively, after exercise. The HK and HAD/CS content respectively correlated with glycogen or TG content at rest and with changes in these metabolites during exercise. FFA and glycerol concentrations increased slightly (P&lt;0.001) during exercise. Lipolysis may, therefore, provide energy during heavy-resistance exercise of relatively short duration. Also, storage and utilization of intramuscular substrates appear to be influenced by the metabolic profile of muscle. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.","Enzyme activities; Fast- and slow-twitch muscle fibres; Free fatty acids; Glycerol; Hypertrophy","fatty acid; glycerol; glycogen; muscle enzyme; triacylglycerol; adult; article; body building; exercise; human; human experiment; male; methodology; muscle biopsy; muscle cell; muscle metabolism; normal human; priority journal; 3-Hydroxyacyl CoA Dehydrogenases; Adenylate Kinase; Adult; Citrate (si)-Synthase; Creatine Kinase; Exercise; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Glycogen; Hexokinase; Human; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lipolysis; Muscles; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025013118

Eight heat acclimated, young adult male subjects received four doses of pyridostigmine (30 mg) or identical placebo tablets every 8 h, in a double blind, randomized, cross-over trial. A 30.3%, SD 4.6% inhibition of the circulating cholinesterase (ChE) activity was induced in the pyridostigmine-treated group. The subjects were exposed to 170-min exercise and heat-stress (dry bulb temperature, 33° C; relative humidity 60%) consisting of 60 min in a sitting position and two bouts of 50-min walking (1.39 m · s-1, 5% gradient) which were separated by 10-min rest periods. No differences were found between treatments in the physiological responses and heat balance parameters at the end of exposure: heart rate (fc) was 141 beats · min-1, SD 16 and 150 beats · min-1, SD 12, rectal temperature (Tre) was 38.5°C, SD 0.4° and 38.6°C, SD 0.3°, heat storage was 60 W · m-2, SD 16 and 59 W · m-2, SD 15 and sweat rate was 678 g · h-1, SD 184 and 661 g · h-1, SD 133, in the pyridostigmine and placebo treatments, respectively. The changes in Tre and fc over the heat-exercise period were parallel in both study and control groups. Pyridostigmine caused a slight slowing of fc (5 beats·min-1) which was consistent throughout the entire exposure (P&lt;0.001) but was of no clinical significance. The overall change in fc was similar for both groups. We have concluded that pyridostigmine administration, in a dose sufficient to induce a moderate degree of ChE inhibition, does not significantly affect performance of exercise in the heat. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.","Carbamates; Exercise-heat stress; Pyridostigmine; Thermal stress; Thermoregulation","carbonic acid; cholinesterase; pyridostigmine; adult; article; exercise; heart rate; heat stress; human; human experiment; male; normal human; oral drug administration; performance; priority journal; thermoregulation; walking; Adult; Body Temperature Regulation; Body Weight; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Double-Blind Method; Electrocardiography; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Heart Rate; Heat; Human; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Pyridostigmine Bromide; Random Allocation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025001436

Its counting rate is limited by the pulsation frequency of the synchrotron radiation (3.16×106 counts s-1), and can be theoretically extended to roughly 5×107 counts s-1 if used on a multibunch storage ring synchrotron radiation source. Its physical characteristics (fluorescence decay time and fast electronics) are such that the dead-time correction is entirely defined by the revolution period of the charged particles in the storage ring. It shows a broad spectral response and is particularly well adapted to the measurement of hard X-rays (from 6 to 25 keV). Its volume is small (diameter 60 mm; height 240 mm), and filters of small dimensions are used to preferentially remove the scattered radiation. The entrance window of the detector is placed at 2-3 mm above the top of the sample, and a solid angle of collection of nearly 50% of 2π sr is achieved. The shape of the plastic scintillator can be easily modified to fit various geometries. It operates in both horizontal and vertical planes. It is about ten times less expensive than an energy-dispersive detection system based on a single Ge solid-state detector. The detector presents a high sensitivity. It is possible to obtain the entire EXAFS spectrum of an electrochemically (under potential deposition) deposited monolayer of Cu atoms on gold, with acquisition time of less than one hour (compared to 25 h for a Ge solid-state detector). Orientation-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy was performed on thin (800 Å) copper phthalocyanine film, and the spectra of diluted Cu2+ ions in aqueous solution (18 ppm) and Co atoms in YBa2Cu3O7 powder (230 ppm) were also measured to assess the sensitivity of the detector. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0008689872

Except for the first 30 s of photosynthetic induction, a good correlation was found between photoacoustically detected oxygen evolution at 35 Hz modulation frequency and electron flow calculated from the fluorescence quenching coefficients qP and qN. The induction kinetics of the photothermal signal, i.e., the photoacoustic signal at 370 Hz, reveal a fast (tr&lt;10 ms) and a slow (tr≈1 s) rise component. The fast component is suggested to be composed of the minimal thermal losses in photosynthesis and thermal losses from non-photosynthetic processes. The slow phase is attributed to variable thermal losses in photosynthesis. The variable thermal losses were normalized by measuring the minimal photothermal signal (H0) in the dark-adapted state and the maximal photothermal signal (Hm) during a saturating light pulse. The kinetics of the normalized photochemical loss (H-H0)/(Hm-H0) obtained from high-frequency PA measurements were found to correlate with the kinetics of oxygen evolution measured at low frequency. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","fluorescence induction; heat emission; oxygen evolution; photoacoustics; photosynthetic energy storage; quenching analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002345811

The system is based on pulsed light-emitting diodes, the pulse program and pulse response analysis being computer controlled. Separation of various components in the overall photoacoustic signal is achieved by curve fitting analysis of the responses following individual measuring light pulses in the millisecond time domain. This procedure is in distinction to the conventionally used analysis in the frequency domain, with the advantage that various signal components are obtained by on-line deconvolution, yielding simultaneous recordings of photothermal (complement of energy storage) and photobaric (evolution and uptake) signals. The basic components of the new system are described by block diagrams and the principal steps for deconvolution of the overall photoacoustic response are outlined. An example of application with simultaneous recording of chlorophyll fluorescence is given. It is apparent that the photobaric uptake component represents a significant part of the overall signal, particularly during induction of photosynthesis after dark-adaptation. This component probably contains not only O2-uptake but uptake of CO2 as well. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","chlorophyll fluorescence; gas-exchange; heat evolution; O2-evolution; photoacoustics; photosynthesis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000022682

Our results exceed the previous experimental limits from the pp collider experiments, although there have been some combined analyses reporting the limits better than those obtained in the present analysis. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347096480

To investigate further this problem, we employed an animal model of obesity to study neonatal extrauterine metabolic adaptations in pups of obese and lean rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a 'cafeteria diet to induce obesity prior to and during pregnancy. Prior to mating, the cafeteria fed rats were significantly heavier (499 v. 345 g, P < 0.001) than the controls. Furthermore, weight gain during pregnancy and weight at term were also significantly greater in the obese rats even though they consumed less food during pregnancy. Pup weights and the number of pusp per litter were similar between the two groups. Pups born to obese mothers demonstrated hypoglycemia after being fasted for 150 and 180 min when compared with control pups. Hekepatic glycogen stores were increased in the fetus of pups born to obese mother. Glycogen content in pups born to obese mothers declined minimally after birth and remained greater than hepatic glycogen values in control pups throughout the study. In addition to increased fetal storage of glycogen, fetal hepatic triglyceride content was augmented in pups of obese rats. These triglyceride stores declined and were moblized during fasting after birth. In contrast, hepatic triglyceride content increased after birth among control rats. These results suggest that maternal obesity results in augmented fetal hepatic tissue stores of both glycogen and triglycerides. Hypoglycemia among pups of excessively obese mothers may be due to attenuated mobilization of hepatic glycogen. Alternate fuel utilization as evident by the mobilization (rather than storage) of hepatic triglycerides may contribute to energy metabolism during periods of hypoglycemia.","fasting metabolism; maternal obesity; newborn rat","animal cell; animal experiment; article; caloric restriction; female; fetus; hypoglycemia; metabolism; newborn; nonhuman; obesity; pregnancy; priority journal; rat; Animal; Animals, Newborn; Birth Weight; Body Weight; Embryo and Fetal Development; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Female; Fetus; Obesity; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Animalia; Cafeteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025358645

The design considerations for the ELETTRA control system are summarized with an overview of the various control-system building blocks: operator interface, networks, process computers, access to equipment, etc. This paper describes the fully distributed architecture of the system, pointing out the extensive use of standards for both hardware and software.

This problem arose in unifying the control systems of the injector linac and the storage ring making up the Photon Factory of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics. One easy approach is to unify only the operator consoles; the unified console is connected to both separate control systems using gateways. The operator-console system of the Photon Factory injector linac has been designed and constructed using this approach. It consists of several workstations interconnected via a local-area network, a gateway to the old linac control network and a CATV system for the real-time display of the accelerator status. In this way the linac will be controlled from the control center of the Photon Factory storage ring. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12244282853

This is a result of knowledgeable limnological management and biomanipulation and despite the eutrophic nature of the River Thames with its high nutrients (7 gN m-3; 1 gP m-3) and particulate organic carbon (2 gC m-3). Built-in possibilities of jetting input water are managed to prevent stratification, to ensure isothermy, to mix chemicals and plankton vertically and horizontally and to manipulate the mixed-depth of the algal populations such that their potential for biomass growth is reduced by light-energy limitation. Spring algal growth is delayed and the spring peak is reduced and curtailed by the grazing impact of considerable biomasses of large-bodied daphnid populations (Daphnia magna, pulicaria &amp; hyalina) whose development is also supported by the continuous input of high riverine algal crops. The existence of a large-bodied daphnid zooplankton in the reservoirs is associated with low levels of fish predation since the late 1960s.

Resistance does not prevent infection, but involves an ability to restrict parasite development and to tolerate infections. We examined selected and unselected oysters, from three geographical locations, all exposed to H. nelsoni infection, to determine the influence of selection, strain origin, and parasitism on gametogenesis. Gonadal development was most frequently correlated with geographic origin of oysters: northern strains (from Long Island Sound) ripened and spawned earlier than southern strains (from the James River), even after several generations of selection at a single location in Delaware Bay. Parasitism was associated with impaired gonadal development in May when gametogenesis was occurring, but not in August, when spawning was underway. Selection for disease resistance was associated with improved gametogenic development, but only in oysters with few or no patent infections. Both parasite burden and selection for resistance were correlated with gametogenesis only in strains from the two southern-most locations, the James River and Delaware Bay, and never in those from Long Island Sound. We suggest that our observations resulted from interference by H. nelsoni in energy acquisition, storage, and conversion cycles of the oyster, which, in turn, differed seasonally according to geographic origin. Gonad development appeared to be more sensitive to parasitism when gametes were in the formative stage rather than after they had matured. Thus, southern strains, which were still in the early stages of gametogenesis when they experienced typical high parasite loads in late May, showed significantly greater inhibition than northern strains, which already had well-developed gonads at the same time. In contrast to most reports that environmental stress correlates with an increased ratio of males to females, we found a three-fold increase in the proportion of females among H. nelsoni-infected oysters compared to uninfected oysters. There was no evidence of sex-associated differential infection or mortality rates and we suggest that parasitism inhibits the development of male gametes more than female gametes. © 1990.",,"disease; gametogenesis; oyster; parasite; selective breeding; sex ratio; USA, (Northeast), Delaware Bay; USA, (Northeast), Long Island Sound; USA, Virginia, James River; Crassostrea virginica; Haplosporidium nelsoni; Ostreidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025662738

Surrogate samples for power plant plume fly ash were created by using electrostatic precipitator (ESP) hopper ash. Particles of diameters less than 10 μm were suspended and mixed with three poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), one nitro-PAH, salt, and sulfuric acid. The particle mixture was then collected on filters to create surrogate samples. Samples were stored for periods of 30 and 120 days at either 20 or −79 ± 1 °C as well as under a set of variable conditions of temperature, light, and humidity. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive analysis were used to characterize changes in organic and elemental composition, particle size distribution, and particle morphology. Preservation of organic compounds in the samples was best achieved when the samples were packaged in Teflon-wrapped glass dishes. Both storage temperature and duration of storage can influence sample stability. In many cases storage at −79 °C provided statistically significant enhancement of organic compound stability after 120 days compared to storage at 20 °C. Particle agglomeration in some samples was suggested by microscopy results. Sulfuric acid had a deleterious effect on two of the spiked PAH. Considering all factors, the most favorable storage conditions were −79 °C in the dark. Under these conditions, loss of the lightest PAH (fluorene) was minimized; the heaviest PAH (chrysene) was stable for at least 120 days. © 1990, American Chemical Society.

Chromaffin granule ghosts, which have a well preserved ability to actively transport and store catecholamines, were used as a model for adrenergic synaptic vesicles due to their functional similarity. Prenylamine, which partially and reversibly deplete the endogenous stores of noradrenaline in adrenergic nerves and ganglia, was found to inhibit the generation of the transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient driven by a H+-lATPase, mainly by acting as an uncoupler of this ATPase. The inhibition of the energy dependent dopamine uptake (and noradrenaline biosynthesis) by prenylamine could be accounted for by its effect on the bioenergetics of the storage vesicles. The organic nitrates glyceryl trinitrate and isosorbide dinitrate also partly inhibited the catecholamine uptake in parallel with their effects on the proton electrochemical gradient. It is concluded that GTN is a weak catecholamine depletor.

Our earlier work showed that trees with relatively low winter starch reserves are more likely to be attacked by A. bilineatus the following summer. We hypothesized that such trees may have less energy available for defense (Callus formation and allelo-chemical synthesis) in tissues wounded by borer larvae. However, wounding experiments showed little or no relationship between winter or summer carbohydrate reserves, callus formation, radial growth, or concentrations of tannins and phenolics in wounded or nonwounded phloem tissues. Trees with relatively low winter carbohydrate reserves were again found to be attractive to adult A. bilineatus, although not all low starch trees were attacked or successfully colonized by borers. There was a trend for carpenterworm larvae, Prinoxystus robiniae (Lepidoptera: Cossidae), a generalist bark and wood borer, to be more successful in establishing galleries on low starch trees. Carpenterworms gained significantly more weight when fed phloem from trees attractive to A. bilineatus. Oaks that attracted large numbers of A. bilineatus or that were successfully colonized by the borer produced significantly less callus than did non-attacked trees when experimentally wounded at about the time of Agrilus egg hatch. Callus formation may limit the establishment of small larvae that feed slowly in the cambial region. These results indicate that current theory regarding relationships between increased tree stress and decreased allocation of energy reserves to radial growth and defense against phloem borers may be an oversimplification.

The geometric and surface gravity features of the theory are developed in terms of equipotential level surfaces and are sufficiently general so as to include eccentric orbits and nonsynchronous (even centrifugally limited) rotation and to treat multiple reflection. After discussions of cases which have been adequately treated already, the need for improvements, requirements for a fully adequate theory, and some historical notes, the requisite physics, mathematics, and logic are presented. Explicit introduction of a reflection ratio (R-function) allows for a simple and natural separation of the bolometric heating problem (invoking conservation of energy) from the wavelength-specific reradiation problem. That function also facilitates solution of the multiple reflection problem in a simple and flexible iterative way. The computations are organized so that a given quantity is computed only as often as necessary, emphasizing the distinction between local surface quantities and aspect-related quantities. The local geometric, bolometric, and wavelength-specific quantities are grouped for storage according to how often they need to be recomputed. The logic for repeating or not repeating computations of local quantities in differential corrections solutions of eccentric orbit light curves is rather complicated, and it is given in a table of decision control integers which apply to a program block diagram. Some tests of a computer program based on this reflection model are given in the form of graphs in which program results are compared to a special exact case, and with results from the author's earlier program. The new program gives intuitively reasonable output for all tests, and the tests give an idea of how accurate the old program is, adopting the detailed reflection computations of the new program as a standard for comparison. A table is given which shows the convergence of the multiple reflection computations to a constant distribution of surface effective temperature.","Stars: eclipsing binaries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243545533

Their carbohydrate content is a source of energy; however, their main importance is as a rich source of vitamins, particularly vitamins A and C. Increasing the shelf life of mangoes is desirable, since on ripening they become highly perishable and have a very short shelf life. Low-dose irradiation is considered to be a good method for extending their shelf life. This literature review examines the effect of radiation processing on the nutrients in mangoes. In general, irradiation has little effect on the main nutrients, vitamin C, carotenoids and carbohydrates. There is a significant loss of vitamin C only in a few varieties of mangoes, while in the others the vitamin C level is unaffected. The extension of shelf life also depends on the storage conditions, particularly temperature. While low-temperature storage followed by ripening at room temperature leads to high vitamin C levels, it reduces the carotenoid levels in some varieties. Thus, the storage and the ripening temperatures should be optimized for each variety to obtain the maximum benefit of irradiation.

ETOM addresses a means to achieve such memories. An ETOM disk is coated with II-VI phosphor material; rare-earth dopants are added to create various trapping levels. When the material is illuminated with a blue laser, electrons are accelerated to a higher energy state where they remain trapped at levels determined by the dopant materials.

The power supply, then, must serve the function of a precision capacitor recharging circuit.

Density varied seasonally in patterns unique to each depth. Leaf relative growth rates indicated a unimodal, rather than bimodal, growth pattern at this site. Leaf chlorophyll levels reflected both depth-related and seasonal influences, with levels at all depths increasing in times of high light attenuation. Based on results from leaf relative growth rates and proximate constituent levels, the degree of ramet interdependence appears to vary with sampling date and water depth. The degree of ramet interdependence appears to be maximal in times of genet expansion (June and August) and minimal in times of energy storage (November). Interdependence of ramets varies spatially as well; ramets are maximally integrated in shallow regions (on those dates when genet proliferation occurs), and minimally integrated at deep edges. Depth-related differences in ramet integration are probably due to the spatial heterogeneity of the primary resource limitation varying with water depth, and to depth-related differences in ramet population dynamics.

Satisfactory signals could only be obtained from samples bound to hydroxyapatite and all samples had a low signal-to-noise ratio compared to either PS I or PS II in thylakoid membranes. The energy storage signal was saturated at low intensity (half saturation at 1.5 W m-2) and predicted a photochemical quantum yield of &gt;90%. Exogenous donors and acceptors had no effect on the signal amplitudes indicating that energy storage is the result of charge separation between endogenous components. Fe(CN)6-3 oxidation of P700 and dithionite-induced reduction of acceptors FA-FB inhibited energy storage. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that energy storage in PS I arises from charge separation between P700 and Fe-S centers FA-FB that is stable on the time scale of the photoacoustic modulation. High intensity background light (160 W m-2) caused an irreversible loss of energy storage and correlated with a decrease in oxidizable P700; both are probably the result of high light-induced photoinhibition. By analogy to the low fluorescence yield of PS I, the low signal-to-noise ratio in these preparations is attributed to the short lifetime of Chl singlet excited states in PS I-40 and its indirect effect on the yield of thermal emission. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","energy conversion; P700; photosynthesis; quantum yield; thermal emission",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000986199

The design and alignment of an undulator beamline presented several unique problems not normally encountered in the design of bending magnet beamlines. The primary problem is the lack of visible radiation from the undulator source when it is operated under normal conditions. In this case a temporary beamline was installed to measure the intensity of undulator light transmitted through a pinhole which could be horizontally and vertically scanned through the undulator beam. This was used to adjust the steering of the beam to be centered in the port and to do some nondispersive characterization of the undulator. This temporary line was designed to permit precision alignment of the components of the beamline according to the measured position of the full energy beam. The monochromator used on this beamline is a 6 m toroidal grating monochromator (TGM). It allows further dispersive testing of the undulator and provides dispersed undulator flux for user experiments. The beamline is identical in terms of expected reflectivity losses and grating efficiencies to two similar beamlines implemented on bending magnets. This allows direct comparison of the flux available to experimenters from undulator sources to flux from bending magnets. Initial measurements indicate that with the undulator gap set for 50 eV, at the peak of the first harmonic, the undulator beamline produces 40 times more flux than a similar beamline using a bending magnet source. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149138247

Two of them are located next to the X-ray undulators and can be used as synchrotron radiation sources, providing circularly polarized hard X-rays, without any major changes of the lattice and beam lines during dedicated operation of PEP. Circularly polarized hard X-rays can be obtained by selecting radiation produced in the middle of the center pole and observing this radiation above and below the orbital plane. As in the case for a bending magnet, the ""out of plane"" radiation has circular polarization components of opposite handedness above and below the orbital plane. Calculations presented here show that, in this way, the brightness of 90% circularly polarized 75-keV X-rays is 1.9 × 1014 photons s-1 mm-2 mrad-2 at 0.1% bandwidth when PEP is operated at 8 GeV, 20 mA in the low emittance mode and the wiggler operates at 1.3 T. This is brightness higher than that of any other source in the world. A disadvantage to this scheme is that operation of the wiggler increases the electron beam emittance due to the nonzero dispersion at the wiggler location. The emittance increases by a factor of 1.5 for the example given above. This disadvantage could be eliminated by reducing the dispersion function to zero at the wiggler location. Possible limitations due to high power density on the crotch of PEP beamline are discussed. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149135866

Measurements performed with monochromatic synchrotron radiation X-rays and an iodine-containing contrast agent at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory have shown that such an intravenous angiography procedure would be possible with an adequately intense monochromatic X-ray source. Because of the size and cost of synchrotron radiation facilities it would be desirable to make the most efficient use of the intensity available, while reducing as much as possible the radiation dose experienced by the patient. By choosing contrast agents containing elements with a higher atomic number than iodine, it is possible to both improve the image quality and reduce the patient radiation dose, while using the same synchrotron radiation source. By using Si monochromator crystals with a small mosaic spread, it is possible to increase the X-ray flux available for imaging by over an order of magnitude, without any changes in the storage ring or wiggler magnet. The most critical imaging task for intravenous coronary angiography utilizing synchrotron radiation X-rays is visualizing a coronary artery through the left ventricle or aorta which also contain contrast agent. Calculations have been made of the signal to noise ratio expected for this imaging task for various contrast agents with atomic numbers between that of iodine and bismuth. The X-ray energy spectrum of the X-17 superconduction wiggler beam line at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory has been used for these calculations. Both perfect Si crystals and Si crystals with a small mosaic spread are considered as monochromators. Contrast agents containing Gd or Yb seem to have about the optimal calculated signal to noise ratio. Gd-DTPA is already approved for use as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging. Experiments have already been performed with Yb-DTPA in animals, and it appears to have a lower toxicity than that of Gd-DTPA. Reported animal experiments with Gd-DOTA contrast agent show no toxicity at all. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012287447

Economical hot-runner systems that satisfy even the most difficult medical/health care applications are now available. But it is for high-cavitation, small medical-part molds that hot-runner molding has real economic value. Many applications demand zero regrind, and when runner weights equal or exceed actual part weights, runner storage and handling can be costly as well as troublesome.

Increasing strain rates increased energy loss per cycle and decreased the relative recovery of energy put into the stretch. 4. These effects were due to increased viscous resistance and increased elastic tension with increased length, and increased viscous resistance with increased strain rates. 5.

Diaphragm muscle movements involving low velocity, small amplitude displacements at long muscle lengths are most effective at conserving net passive mechanical energy, while short muscle lengths minimize gross energy loss. © 1990 The Physiological Society",,"animal cell; article; diaphragm; energy metabolism; exercise; female; muscle length; muscle strength; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; tissue culture; viscoelasticity; Animal; Diaphragm; Elasticity; Energy Metabolism; Female; Muscle Contraction; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Stress, Mechanical; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Viscosity; Work of Breathing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025338374

The true stress-strain curves showed broad maxima in all instances, with negative strain-hardening rates being observed after the peak stress σmax. The stress exponent n increased from n ≈ 5 for T ≥ 900 K to n &gt; 19 for T ≤ 600 K, where T is the absolute temperature. The apparent activation energy QA for deformation decreased linearly with increasing stress when σmax &gt; 25 MPa from QA ≈ 350 kJ mol-1 at σmax = 25 MPa to QA ≈ 120 kJ mol-1 at σmax = 150 MPa; however, QA ≈ 320 - 350 kJ mol-1 when αmax ≤ 25 MPa. Microstructural observations of the deformed specimens showed that the CaF2 lamellae, while intact at the lower temperatures and higher stresses, had spheroidized at the higher temperatures and lower stresses. It is concluded from an analysis of the data that the deformation behavior of the hypereutectic salt can be divided into two separate regimes, both of which are controlled by the deformation of the CaF2 phase. The deformation mechanisms operating in this phase are examined. © 1990.",,"Calcium Compounds - Deformation; Lithium Compounds - Deformation; Strain; Stresses; Calcium Fluoride Salts; Lithium Fluoride Salts; Strain Rate; Stress Exponent; Stress-Strain Curves; Thermal Energy Storage; Salts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025417697

A thin coating of a polymer—liquid crystal mixture with a laser absorbing dye would be spin coated onto a substrate and recording would be done with two types of write laser pulses. One laser pulse would be of high intensity and focused to small diameter, giving large temperature gradients and relatively fast cooling rates. The other write pulse would have lower intensity and larger diameter, resulting in smaller temperature gradients and slower cooling. A third pulse, reserved for reading, would not have sufficient intensity at the wavelength absorbed by the system to heat significantly. It would be scattered at different intensities into a photodetector depending on the cooling history of the spot being read. The feasibility of the principle was demonstrated through an experiment in which a 4-8-iim sample coating is applied to clear resistor coated glass. Energy was put into the system by a pulse generator whose power and pulse duration can be controlled. Low intensity laser light scattering patterns were observed during and after the resistive pulse to monitor the sample morphology during the experiment.

Auxiliary chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements were made to estimate the fraction of open photosystem II (PS II) reaction centers. These measurements allowed a consistent quantitation of excitation distribution and transfer from PS II to PS I under the physiological conditions used. Maximum energy storage was obtained with modulated light absorbed almost exclusively by the phycobilins (light 2). Modulated light absorbed by chlorophyll a (light I) gave much smaller energy storage (about 1 3 of the maximum), which could be enhanced to the maximum by addition of background light 2. Addition of increasing intensities of background light 1 to modulated light 2 did not initially induce any effect and then decreased the energy storage to about half of the maximum. From the above results and with simple mathematical modelling, numbers were obtained for light distribution and energy transfer parameters. From the enhancement saturation curves of the effect of background light 2 on the energy storage in modulated light 1 we conclude that in state 1 light 2 is exclusively absorbed in PS II and that there is no energy transfer to PS I from open PS II reaction centers. From the value of the energy storage for light 2 in state 1 and the degree of openness of PS II reaction centers it is possible to conclude that energy transfer to PS I occurs from closed PS II reaction centers with a probability approaching 1. In state 2 light 2 is distributed more evenly (approximately in a ratio PS II PS I of 0.55:0.45) either by energy transfer via PS II from open PS II reaction centers, or by direct interactions of the phycobilins and PS I. Comparison of the maximum fluorescence values in the two states favors the second possibility. Energy transfer from PS II units with closed reaction centers occurs again in state 2 with a probability approaching 1. Comparison of energy utilization and oxygen evolution in light 1 relative to light 2 and the inhibitory effect of DCMU, which is complete in light 2 but only partial in light 1, suggests the existence of two types of PS I units: one type is engaged in electron transfer from PS II and the other type specializes in cyclic electron flow. The above quantitative analysis allows to estimate the ratio of the two types of PS I unit to be roughly about 0.3:0.7, respectively. © 1990.","(Marine alga); Energy transfer; Photoacoustics; Photosystem I; Photosystem II; Spillover","article; biological model; energy transfer; methodology; nonhuman; photoacoustic spectroscopy; photosynthesis; photosystem i; photosystem ii; porphyra; priority journal; red alga; algae; Porphyra; Porphyra perforata; Rhodophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025304969

Total enzyme activities were very low among embryos sampled 3 days prior to hatching. Protease and amylase activities increased slightly at the time of hatching and again during larval Stage I; lipase activity did not change. Activity of the three enzymes more than doubled among Stage II larvae and although there were slight increases in enzyme activities during Stage III, they were not significant. Protease activity peaked during Stage IV, whereas lipase and amylase activities were greatest among Stage V juveniles. Different patterns were observed when specific enzyme activities (normalized on the basis of protein) are examined. Specific activities of the three enzymes were very low in embryos just prior to hatching and increased slightly during the hatching process. During Stage I, the specific activity of protease doubled, lipase specific activity increased by a factor of 10, and that of amylase increased slightly. Activities of both protease and amylase more than doubled in Stage II larvae; in general, there were no significant differences in specific activities measured in Stages II through V. Lipase specific activity did not change significantly among Stages I through V. The increase in enzyme activities among the hatching stages correlates well with morphological changes observed in the midgut gland (hepatopancreas), specifically in regard to the presence of enzyme-producing B-cells. Changes in enzyme activities among the postmetamorphic Stages IV and V may be related to changes in body form, habitat, or patterns of energy storage and utilization. Lobster larvae normally hatch during early summer but embryonic development can be accelerated in the laboratory by maintenance at high (21°C) rather than ambient temperature. Temperature conditions during embryonic development, however, had no effect on digestive enzyme activities of larvae that were induced to hatch out of season. © 1990.","Amylase; Crustacean digestive enzyme; Homarus americanus; Lipase; Lobster larva; Protease",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000039056

The aim of our study was the development of a storage resonator to be used for an energy doubler (similar to the one used on the Stanford linac energy doubler (SLED) to increase the beam energy of the Stanford linac to 53 GeV), but to be used for a linac having a quite long filling time of 1.2 ωs. For this reason the storage resonator must be designed for an unloaded Q0 of roughly 105. By using our OSCAR2D computer code (which computes the resonant frequency, Q0 and geometry factor for any reasonable TE or TM monopolar mode of cylindrically symmetric rf cavities) we found an optimum resonator geometry. On this geometry we get the benefit of a Q0 about 10% higher than that of an ideal cylindrical cavity together with the splitting of TE0mn-like and TM1mn-like modes which in a cylindrical cavity are coalescent. © 1990.",,"Accelerators--Accessories; Energy Doubler; Pulse Compression; Resonators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025399926

The present study examines theoretically the relationship between the energy stored in the longitudinal arch and the inclination of the calcaneus, when a vertical load is applied. A simple two-dimensional model was used, consisting of two inclined rigid elements, hinged at the apex of the arch and connected by a horizontal tension spring at the bottom of the arch. The spring serves as the energy-storing element of the model, representing the foot plantar ligaments. The behaviour of the model was examined using both a linear and an exponential spring. It demonstrated that the stored energy depends strongly on the calcaneal inclination. For a given vertical load, the energy storage capacity is low at both large and small inclinations and rises markedly at an intermediate value. Assuming that the incidence of stress fractures during locomotion is affected by insufficient energy attenuation of the foot, this model provides an explanation for the higher prevalence of tibial and femoral stress fractures in subjects with high or low arches. © 1990 IFMBE.","Calcaneal inclination; Energy storage; Foot; Longitudinal arch; Model; Stress fractures","Biomedical Engineering--Living Systems Studies; Calcaneal Inclination; Energy Storage Capacity; Foot; Longitudinal Arch; Stress Fractures; Biomechanics; article; biomechanics; foot; human; stress fracture; theoretical study; Biomechanics; Calcaneus; Energy Metabolism; Foot; Fractures, Stress; Human; Models, Biological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025405555

Outstanding features of this device are the built-in amplification, the signal charge storage capability and the possibility of repeated non-destructive readout. The device was used for detection of X-rays from a 241Am and from Am and from an 55Fe source. Very low noise figures (σ=30 electrons corresponding to an energy resolution of FWHM = 250 eV at 6 keV energy) have been obtained at room temperature. Various applications of the structure either as detector or as purely electronic element are possible. One of the most intriguing is the use as a pixel detector with random access non-destructive readout. This device may be operated at very low power, as only reading (of one single pixel at a time), not storing, consumes power. Further options of the device are fast clearing, gating and variation of the pixel size during readout. The latter property can be used to drastically increase the readout speed compared to more standard two dimensional devices as e.g. CCD detectors, as one may restrict the high density readout to regions of interest determined beforehand by a coarse scan of the whole detector. An alternative use of the device is as an analog or digital memory, or as a simple transistor with drastically reduced parasitic capacitances. Possible further developments are the combination with a novel three dimensional analog storage device which may either be used as a detector with built-in storage of several charge images or as a three dimensional analog memory. © 1990.",,"Semiconductor Devices; Pixel Devices; Semiconductor Detectors; Radiation Detectors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025402473

The biochemical and clinical manifestations of acid maltase deficiency arise from a marked deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase), which normally degrades glycogen to free glucose. In the past few years, high-protein diets have provided an alternative energy source for these patients and resulted in improved muscle strength. Recently, we treated a ventilator-dependent acid maltase-deficient patient with a general diet supplemented with branched-chain amino acids. Branched-chain amino acids are the principal amino acids involved in muscle protein synthesis and utilization. While on this diet, the patient had improvement of respiratory function and muscle strength and was able to be weaned from the ventilator during the day. In addition to his nutritional status, levels of serum branched-chain amino acids, showed improvement within 2 months after the diet started. This diet shows potential advantages over a high-protein diet without supplemented branched-chain amino acids for the treatment of acid maltase deficiency. These include theoretical sparing of amino acids required for muscle protein synthesis by providing higher concentrations of postprandial branched-chain amino acids in the circulation. Also, the liquid formula would be better tolerated by a ventilator-dependent or debilitated patient rather than a high-protein general diet.

Since the use of direct rather than conventional methods adds a step which scales in cost with the fourth power of molecular size to a calculation which overall scales with the fifth power, this is an ideal case for the direct approach. The direct second derivative calculation must, however, be organized somewhat differently than the direct SCF itself in order to performed the O (N5) steps with the same efficiency as the conventional procedure. Additionally, certain classes of third derivatives, including the hyperpolarizability and the nuclear coordinate derivatives of the polarizability, can be handled directly. The result is a method which requires only O(N3) external storage (or main memory), is only 30% slower than the conventional method even for small cases (e.g., 16 atoms and 100 basis functions) and enables the prediction of vibrational spectra and electric field properties for much larger systems than was previously possible. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001618484

While each of these models implicitly defines the living, neither provides criteria by which the emergence of life could be recognized in the laboratory. An operational definition of the living makes explicit the system logic of metabolic self-production: (1) that whatever form it may take, life is a function of its biochemical processes; (2) that no single biochemical process has integrity apart from an entire network of processes; (3) that a network of processes can have continuity only by being enclosed within a boundary structure, i.e., by the selective partition of a microenvironment as a domain for the bioenergetic-biosynthetic network; and (4) that life is a single phenomenon, distinct in its continuity of capture and storage of energy in such networks, driving the processes that produce its material constituents. This paper presents autopoiesis as life-defining and discusses the utility of its criteria in our search for the origins of life on Earth. Enactment of the autopoietic criteria would result in a minimal cell and would demonstrate the experimental recapitulation of life's Archaean origins. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001029570

The energy storage rate as evaluated by the half-saturation measuring beam intensity (i50) was inhibited by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1 dimethylurea, by heat inactivation or by artificial electron acceptors specific for photosystem I or photosystem II; and was activated by electron donors to photosystem I. The reactions involving both photosystems were all characterized by a similar maximal energy storage yield of 16±2 percent.

Therefore we formulate semi-direct MP2 methods that utilize disk space (which is usually much larger than memory size) for the steps that require most storage. In terms of the molecular basis set size, they require as little as quadratic memory and cubic disk. The amount of input/output transfer between memory and disk is quartic plus the cost of transpositions, which is between quartic and quintic. A variety of calculations are presented comparing the fully direct, semi-direct and conventional algorithms. The semi-direct methods are shown to be superior to conventional algorithms despite requiring less disk space, and are also often preferred over the direct methods. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004214970

For the simulations, the rate equations for the adsorption of CO, O2 and H2 gases are derived and two models which differ in the type of contamination are considered. In the first model the gaseous impurity adsorbs strongly at the surface of the alloy and then completely deactivates some particles which are in contact with it immediately after the mixed gases are introduced during the hydriding reaction. The poisoned particles can no longer absorb hydrogen. In the second model the adsorption energy of the gas impurity is relatively small, and the surface of all particles is contaminated evenly and partially on each cycle. In the former case, the alloy is strongly deactivated by the gaseous impurity and the shapes of the hydrogen absorption kinetic curves do not change with cycling. In the latter case, the effect of the gaseous impurity on the hydrogenation properties of the alloy is relatively mild; however, the hydriding rate is retarded and the shape of the kinetic curve changes continuously with an increasing number of cycles. A comparison of the changes of the theoretical kinetic curves with the experimental results show that the alloy is degraded by the former type in the case of cycling in H2-CO and by the latter type, in the case of cycling in H2-O2. © 1990.",,"Hydrogen Inorganic Compounds; Hydrogen--Absorption; Nickel Compounds--Hydrogenation; Hydrogen Storage Materials; Lanthanum Nickel Hydrides; Metal Hydrides; Lanthanum Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025385416

The corresponding beam distribution has azimuthal periodicity and is Gaussian in all the phase-space variables. In the limit of weak dissipation and far from linear resonances, this fixed point can be approximated by a linear combination of three periodic Twiss matrices, associated with the normal modes of the system. To first order in the relative energy loss per turn, the coefficients of the linear combination are constant along the ring and coincide with the equilibrium beam emittances. A general formula is derived for the equilibrium emittances, which reduces to well-known expressions in terms of radiation integrals for a storage ring with no horizontal-vertical coupling and with vanishing dispersion in the RF-cavities. In case of linear resonance, it is shown that two further ""generalized equilibrium emittances"" are required to specify the beam-envelope matrix. It is also shown that, in the limit of weak dissipation, the asymptotic beam-envelope matrix can be derived from a variational principle. © 1990.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009302348

The addition of energy storage is perhaps the only method of further reducing the fuel consumption since the utilisation of the potential energy obtained on downhill running for subsequent hill climbing increases the average speed whilst maintaining the same maximum speed. As an energy storage system is most likely to be incorporated with an effective, continuously variable transmission (CVT), the engine can always be operated at maximum efficiency and at lower engine speeds, thus reducing the wear rate. The use of a non-conventional transmission also has the potential to reconfigure the semi-trailer-tractor layout which may lead to further reductions in the aerodynamic drag, e.g by eliminating the drag due to the vertical slat between the tractor and trailer.

These microcomposite films exhibit excellent mechanical stability under cyclic freeze-thaw conditions. However, their thermal energy storage capacities, as characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, decrease significantly following freeze-thaw cycling. It appears that the ultrastructure of the PBZT and the thinness of the film (which results in high cooling rates during freeze-thaw cycling) promote the retention of the amorphous form of the PCM rather than the crystalline form. Since the amorphous form of the PCM does not contribute to the latent heat of fusion, the heat storage capacity of the microcomposite is reduced. © Copyright 1990 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Amorphous films; Composite materials; Differential scanning calorimetry; Freezing; Heat storage; Mechanical stability; Phase change materials; Semiconducting films; Storage (materials); Thawing; Thermal energy; Crystalline form; Cyclic freeze-thaw; Freeze-thaw cycling; Heat storage capacity; High cooling rates; Latent heat of fusion; Micro-composites; Solvent exchanges; Polymer films",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072351951

An MPPT is necessary where to maximize the power delivered from solar cells to batteries. A design optimization for the tracker is crucial for its use in solar powered cars since these vehicles have a very limited amount of input power. Unfortunately, the power stage of a maximum power tracker, consisting of inductors, capacitors, diodes, and MOSFETs, may waste a small yet significant percentage of the total power out of the solar cells. Most trackers today are about 95% efficient. The objective here is to raise the efficiency to 98%. Once the input and output current and voltages have been selected, each component of the tracker can be optimized for maximum efficiency. After examining the conduction, switching, and gate losses of the MOSFET and diode, the optimum design can be found. The key to making the tracker most efficient is to look at the entire package of parts and optimize several variables at once: frequency, number of devices in parallel (a method of reducing resistive losses), and heat sinking. Using this information, other circuit configurations can be analyzed and external variables can be manipulated to obtain the maximum efficiency. Additional crucial parameters such as weight, cost and space taken up by the tracker must be considered in the design. In the end, based on the key equations which are derived, a super efficient maximum power point tracker can be designed and built to the specifications of the user. © Copyright 1990 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Efficiency; Maximum power point trackers; MOSFET devices; Solar energy; Static random access storage; Circuit configurations; Crucial parameters; Design optimization; Efficiency studies; Maximum Efficiency; Maximum power tracker; Several variables; Solar powered cars; Solar cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072350592

The first part of the paper considers the melting process ruled by pure conduction across the liquid phase, and the second part deals with the quasi-steady melting dominated by natural convection. The paper establishes the relationship between the total irreversibility of the melting process and design parameters such as the number of heat transfer units of the heat exchanger placed between the energy source and the phase change material, the duration of the melting process, and the position of the energy storage process on the absolute temperature scale. It is shown that the exergy transfer to the melting material is maximized when the melting temperature (Tm) equals the geometric average of the environment temperature (Te) and the temperature of the energy source (T∞), in other words when Tm = (TeT∞T∞T∞T∞)1/2.

On the other hand, economizer cycles have been widely used for many years in a variety of types of HVAC systems. Economizer cycles are widely accepted as a means to reduce operating time for chilling equipment when cool outside air is available. It has been suggested that heat reclaim systems should not be used in conjunction with an HVAC system which incorporates an economizer cycle because the economizer operation would result in heat being exhausted which might have been recovered. Others suggest that the economizer cycle can be used economically in a heat recovery system if properly controlled to maintain an overall building heat balance. This study looks at potential energy savings of such combined systems with particular emphasis on the effects of the solar load (amount of glass) and the internal load level (lights, people, appliances, etc.). For systems without thermal storage, annual energy savings of up to 60 percent are predicted with the use of heat reclaim systems in conjunction with economizers when the heat reclaim has priority. These results strongly demonstrate the necessity of complete engineering evaluations if proper selection and operation of combined heat recovery and economizer cycles are to be obtained.

Cyclic vol tarn mo grams of a porous carbon electrode coated with RuQ2 were measured in strong acidic electrolytes containing no molecular chlorine with and without Bi3+.

When a potential in the region was applied to the developed sensor, into which the sample electrolytes including molecular chlorine were flowed, the detected current was proportional to the concentration of dissolved chlorine at a constant temperature irrespectively of the presence of Bi8+. Plotting natural logarithm of current against the reciprocal of temperature gave a straight line with the slope of ca. 4.3 kcal mol-1, which corresponds to the activation energy on diffusion of dissolved molecular chlorine.

The GCC/methanol plant provides electricity generation and energy storage in one coal-based facility. It is of potential interest to electric utilities seeking to meet intermediate-load electrical demand on their systems. The plant configuration is determined by means of an economic screening study considering capital and fuel costs over a range of cycling duties (load factors). Estimated levelized electricity production costs indicate that a GCC/methanol plant could be of economic interest as premium fuel prices increase relative to coal.

The structure of mathematical cycle models as well as different approaches to set up and solve the resulting equations with computer programs are discussed in the first section. The second section describes the developed method. The mass and energy balance equations are set up and solved with an semi-parallel algorithm.

The example of two simple steam cycles demonstrates the applied technique. The method requires only a few-if any at all-iterations.

Upon arrival, a large maneuver near Saturn periapsis called Saturn Orbit Insertion (SOI) will reduce the energy of the spacecraft and result in capture into Saturn orbit. SOI is one of the most critical events of the entire mission. Therefore it is prudent to determine what resources must be dedicated to assure successful execution of SOI and what operational resources can be provided to satisfy SOI science objectives. To prolong undisturbed science observations near the periapsis, a delayed SOI burn strategy has been developed. To examine potential resource conflicts between science and engineering activities, key considerations such as power and data storage capability have been evaluated. Other constraints such as turning the spacecraft to burn attitude and slewing platforms for science have also been examined.

For the γ-ray shielding, the buffer material of high density was prepared using bentonite powder and heavy sand of zircon. The density of the dry buffer material was about 3 g/cm3. Heater test was carried out to study thermal characteristics of this buffer material and the waste package system. The buffer material was heated by an electric heater which was set at the center of the package to simulate the decay heat generation of HLW. The thermal conductivity of the buffer material was calculated from temperature distribution in the package. It was found that the measured thermal conductivity of the buffer material vary with the electric power of the heater and the radial distance from the heater surface. The thermal conductivity was in the range of 0.720~1.070 W/m·K at the electric power of the heater of 0.3 kW, and it was in the range of 0.685~1.410 W/m·K at 0.7kW. This is attributed to the water migration in the buffer material, caused by the heat flux. The changes of the swelling pressure and the water uptake rate in the buffer material was measured to study swelling pressure, water uptake rate and water diffusion coefficient of the buffer material by immersing double distilled water from the outside of the package. Consequently the water diffusion coefficient in the buffer material was calculated to be 2.5 × 10-10 m2/s. © 1990, Atomic Energy Society of Japan.

These coefficients were introduced into the model in the form of a Nusselt number/Reynolds number correlation developed in this study. The results of the present investigation include solid temperature, product gas temperature, pyrolysis mass loss, pressure, gas mass flux, gas-storage ratio, and expansion and volumetric heat-transfer coefficient profiles.

Parametric trade analyses included the study of performance, weight, and cost relationships of solar power, specific impulse, thruster efficiencies, transfer time, propellant use, navigation accuracy, steering accuracy, solar array aspect ratio, and array degradation. Specific impulse from 700 to 4000 sec was considered. Findings suggest that large trans-orbit steering errors are acceptable; gimballed thrusters are feasible; solar array degradation, shadowing, and imperfect array pointing affects transfer time and not propellant consumption; and solar array aspect ratio and shielding requirements have a large impact on control torques. Regarding ion thrusters, xenon propellant was shown to be costly and in limited supply for DOD missions. Krypton appears to be a suitable alternative. Regarding arcjets, hydrogen has significant performance advantages compared to ammonia, and mass efficient liquid hydrogen storage during the EOTV mission is feasible.

Similarly, myofilaments are absent from the mesothelia lining all parts of the sclerocoels and the lateral parts of the myocoels (the medial side of the myocoel is a myomesothelium comprising the striated muscles of the body wall).

Golden Delicious) at different temperatures (0, 12 and 35°C) decreased the water content in seed coats and endosperms, higher temperatures being much more effective than the lower (0°C) one. No effect of the temperature on the embryo hydration was found. However, a pronounced decrease in water potential in the embryos was observed during the first 9 weeks. The decrease was much faster and the water potential reached lower levels in embryos isolated from seeds pretreated with higher temperatures (12 or 35°C) than from cold‐pretreated (0°C) material. Higher temperatures of fruit storage also resulted in a decreased permeability of the embryo membranes to electrolytes and sugars. At the same time, membrane permeability to water was not modified. It is proposed that the previously observed occurrence of the discontinuous type of freezing in apple seeds (Nguyen and Kacperska, Physiologia Plantarum (X): 000‐000, 1989) is associated with the temperature‐induced dehydration of seed coat and endosperm, whereas a higher super cooling ability of the high‐temperature‐pretreated embryos is due to a decrease in the free energy of water in the system, and to the effective protection of embryo cells against heterogenous ice nucleation. The changes in water potential showed a high negative correlation with the embryo phospholipid content determined in the other work (Nguyen et al. Plant Physiol. Bio chem. 25: 697–703, 1987). Therefore, it is proposed that changes in matrix potential play an important role in the regulation of the water potential in the embryo cells. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

Acclimation of the algae to different salt concentrations did not change the fractions of light absorbed in PS II and PS I, but slowed down the transition time from state 1 to state 2.

Photoacoustic quantum yield spectra of energy storage indicated a larger energy storage at 700 nm induced upon stress. The additional ΔpH quenching of fluorescence and the additional quantum yield of energy storage at 700 nm, in the stressed algae, are consistent with the operation of a cyclic, energy‐storing pathway in PS I which is uncoupler sensitive.

Two forced oscillation instruments were used: cantilever bending on a Polymer Labs DMTA and torsion with a Rheometrics System Four. In the cantilever mode, the storage modulus on both samples was measured at about two to three times too low because of compliance of the instrument. The two instruments agreed and appeared to measure accurately tan δ on the graphite‐reinforced samples. Agreement was only fair on tan δ for the rubber‐modified sample. Multiple frequency data were used to separate the glass‐transition temperature of the rubber from the epoxy β transition. Activation energies of these transitions are within the range reported.

Although the major application of conducting polymers was suggested in several types of advanced energy conversion and storage devices, their specific features such as plasticity, thin film fabrication with ease, chromatic contrast and the like offers ample possibilities for the utilization of such materials in many instances of modern technology. Consequently, among several conductive polymers investigated, in this communication, as part of a project work, perfluorosulfonate ionomer (e.g. Nafion) and polyaniline modified electrodes were taken into account. Typical examples of application, such as in fuel cells and chlor‐alkali membrane cells etc., are provided. Characterization and performances of the material as well as the kinetics and mechanism of the corresponding reactions are briefly considered. In the case of polyaniline, the electropolymerization process, characterization of the product film, its application in high energy density Li‐batteries together with the kinetics and mechanism of polymer doping, the charge‐discharge reactions, including the parameters affecting the cell efficiencies, are discussed in some details. Merits and problem of the process and corresponding devices are pointed out.

First, physically large ceramic capacitors were very expensive and, second, total energy density obtainable was not nearly so high as in electrolytic capacitor types. More recently, the fabrication technology for MLC's has improved significantly, permitting both significantly higher energy density and significantly lower costs. Simultaneously, in many applications, total energy storage has become smaller, and the secondary requirements of very low effective series resistance and effective series inductance (which, together, determine how efficiently the energy may be stored and recovered) have become more important. It is therefore desirable to reexamine energy storage in ceramics for contemporary commercial and near‐commercial dielectrics. Stored energy is proportional to voltage squared only in the case of paraelectric insulators, because only they have capacitance that is independent of bias voltage. High dielectric constant materials, however, are ferroics (that is ferroelectric and/or antiferroelectric) and display significant variation of effective dielectric constant with bias voltage. The common ferroelectric materials, whether based upon barium titanate or lead manganese niobate (PMN), in the high‐field limit, exhibit an energy storage which increases linearly with bias voltage. Mixed phase, ferroelectric plus antiferroelectric, dielectrics from the lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT) system, as predicted theoretically, show the best energy density at low to moderate fields. Surprisingly, maximum energy storage is not obtained in high dielectric constant materials but in those materials which display intermediate dielectric constant and the highest ultimate breakdown voltages.

Propagules of the mangrove, Rhizophora mangle L., were precultivated for 9 months in a greenhouse. The young plants were transferred into unaerated nutrient solutions without and with 200 mol m 3 NaCl and subsequently their growth, their water relations and the photosynthetic properties of their leaves were studied. Growth of the salttreated plants was significantly increased, while the control plants gradually died off after finishing the experiments. The shoot water potential and the stomatal resistance of the leaves were lowered while the chlorophyll contents and the chlorophyll a/b ratio in the leaves of salt‐treated plants were increased by NaCl, the net result being an enhanced rate of CO2 assimilation. The leaves of both sets of plants showed diurnal fluctuations in malic acid concentration which were more pronounced in the leaves of salt treated plants which, additionally, were more succulent. However, the plants showed no net CO2 fixation at night, indicating that Rhizophora mangle is a CAM‐cycling plant. After 200 d of cultivation without or with NaCl, the Na+, Cl and K+ concentrations in tissues and vacuoles were measured. Energy‐dispersive X‐ray microprobe analyses on root vacuoles of control plants reveal Na+ preference, on those of salt treated plants a strong K+ preference. Vacuolar K+ concentrations are neither affected by NaCl nor do they vary across the root radius. High vacuolar Na+ and Cl concentrations are found in the hypodermis followed by a stepwise decrease towards the inner root cortex cells. Ion concentrations of the photosynthetically active leaf tissues seem to be regulated by (1) radial filtration across the root cortex: (2) ion exchange of the xlem parenchyma cells: and (3) sequestration of Na+ and Cl in the hypodermal water storage tissue of the leaves.

The model relates tissue growth to DNA accretion and protein turn-over. State variables include circulating amino acids, glucose, lipids and acetate; four protein pools (carcass, viscera, other tissues and wool) and storage triacylglycerol are also included. Equations are mainly of the Michaelis-Menten form, allowing for nutrient utilization patterns to be determined by relative tissue affinities for substrates (ko.5), enzymatic capacities (Vmax) and substrate concentrations ([S]). Protein degradation rates are defined as first-order with respect to protein. The model adequately simulated growth from 20 to 40 kg empty body weight. Simulated changes in nutrient input yielded reasonable energy balance response patterns, although theoretical growth efficiencies were greater than those observed in practice. Variations in volatile fatty acid absorption patterns were accommodated well, with predicted nitrogen retention closely approximating experimental observations. The model also responded appropriately to changes in dietary protein level, with body fat varying inversely with amino acid absorption. In summary, the model was found to perform adequately for the purpose of examining mechanisms responsible for alteration of growth and body composition. © 1990, British Society of Animal Science.

The significant levels of 20:4w6 in jellyfish total lipid (9.7-20.0% of the total fatty acids) and in the leatherback neutral lipid (1.0-10.9% of the total fatty acids) and phospholipid (0-6-15.5% of total fatty acids) fractions of all tissues sampled suggests that arachidonic acid assumes more importance in food chain relationships involving leatherbacks than in other marine food webs such as those involving fish. © 1990, Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.

Examples include: 1) diffusion of substrates is faster at these temperatures, thus contributing to higher reaction rates; 2) aqueous solutions have lower viscosity and therefore require less energy to mix; and S) there is less risk of microbial contamination. Thus enzymes that are able to catalyze reactions at these temperatures are highly desirable in industrial and other applied settings (6). Added advantages of thermostable enzymes are that they tend to be more stable than their thermolabile counterparts at lower temperatures, thus permitting their preparation and storage under ambient conditions, and some are more resistant to chemical denaturants and proteases. However, most enzymes from conventional sources are not thermostable; that is, they are denatured when heated. This paper will discuss and contrast three approaches to obtaining thermostable enzymes: isolation from thermophilic bacteria, enzyme engineering, and cloning and selection in thermophiles. Physical methods of enzyme stabilization, such as by immobilization or by conducting reactions in anhydrous organic solvents, are alternative approaches that are beyond the scope of this paper. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950723505

From the experimental results and theoretical considerations, dimensionless semi-empirical equations suitable for predicting the amount of cold water mixed into the hot water region and the thermal storage efficiency of the cylindrical water tank were deduced as a function of the Archimedes number based on inflow conditions, the Peclet number, the ratio of tank diameter to inlet tube diameter, and the ratio of liquid level to inlet tube diameter.

After the HF treatment, the wafer surface is As rich and partially covered with fluorine. The fluorine is bonded to Ga atoms as can be deduced out of a chemically shifted component in the XPS spectra. We cannot detect hydride groups using vibrational spectroscopy (HREELS). Fluorine on top of the wafer surface can be removed by a short water rinse. Depending on the storage time of GaAs wafers in HF the As enrichment of the surface increases. We present a model for the surface state after the HF treatment with an As overlaver on top of bulk GaAs. Consistent with our angular dependent XPS measurements, we can give values for the thickness of the As overlayer. Conditions of illumination and concentration of HF influence the reaction rate of HF on the GaAs surface. The reaction with water depends strongly on the illumination and whether the treatment in water is performed in static or dynamic conditions. Rinsing samples in running de-ionized water and dark storage in water results in an oxide removal.

It is based on an indium tin oxide-silicon nitride-aluminum-silicon dioxide-silicon (MNMOS) combination. The light signal is transformed to electric charge through optical excitation of charge carriers in the two metal layers. The charge is transported in the nitride conduction and valence bands to the aluminum. The latter layer is confined between the two insulator layers, thus forming a potential well for the storage of the optically induced charges.

The partial storage system was installed at a cost below a conventional cooling system when the building was initially constructed. The design analysis concluded that by reducing on-peak electric demand through shifting cooling energy use to nighttime operation, the system would save about $38 000 per year in electricity costs. During 1987, savings were roughly 10% of this estimate. Reasons for the discrepancy include the inability of the system to deliver the design cooling load, and poor operating and maintenance practices. The assessment is based upon monitoring of the cooling load, compressor electricity use, chilled-water pump electricity use, and whole-building electricity use, each measured at 15-minute intervals. A primary objective of the monitoring project was to compare electricity costs of the actual system to what they would have been with a conventional cooling system, without storage. We estimated the hourly electricity use of the base case conventional system using the measured hourly cooling load data and a part-load efficiency curve for a 1617 kWt (460 ton) centrifugal chiller. Five months of cooling load data were available (February - June). The maximum electric demand shift was 150 kWe (6.1 We/m2). The average monthly peak shift was 95 kWe. Over these five months the system COP decreased from 2.82 to 1.74, while the estimated COP for the conventional system ranged from 2.84 to 2.75. Since the analysis period, the system has undergone major retrofitting to alleviate the occasional overheating and further reduce electricity costs. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849146329

Marked differences however occurred at the higher relative humidities. These results indicate that up to a r.h. of 40%, the adsorption of water is a function of surface area alone for the untanned and tanned cow hides. Other factors are likely to influence the adsorption above this r.h. Analyses of the isotherms using the established sorption models indicate that the storage stability of the hides and skins decreased with an increase in temperature.

This distribution is compared with the second-order QCD prediction and s is determined to be 0.1230.0090.005 at ssSMZ (at the SLAC Linear Collider) and 0.1490.0020.007 at ss=29 GeV (at the SLAC storage ring PEP). The running of s between these two center-of-mass energies is consistent with the QCD prediction. © 1990 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4244179413

In addition to identifying these modal properties it would be desirable to determine spatially which parts of the structure are modeled poorly or well. This information could be used to improve the finite element model, or to point to faults in the structure and hence help to evaluate mechanical integrity. This paper shows how the pattern of discrepancies in the pole and the driving point zero frequencies of a structure can be linked to discrepancies in the mass or stiffness of the structural elements. Only nominal mode shapes, as opposed to mode shape discrepancies, are required. Because first-order errors in mode shape cause only second-order localisation errors, the nominal mode shapes need not be measured, but can be taken from a finite element model. The success of this procedure depends on the numerical conditioning of a modal reference matrix. Strategies to ensure adequate numerical conditioning require a formulation which avoids geometric and energy storage symmetries of the structure, and ignores structural elements which contribute negligibly small potential or kinetic energy to the excited modes. Physical insight into the numerical conditioning problem is provided by a numerical example and by the localisation of a mass discrepancy in a real structure based on laboratory tests. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38249019750

The results show that an increase in moisture content decreases the soil temperature differences between day-time and night-time, which provides protection to the plant root system against sharp and sudden changes of soil temperature. It is also found that the solar energy absorption increases as the moisture content increases, which results in a higher heat storage capacity at higher moisture content.

Chemical reactors are often operated with toxic or explosive fluids, and the discharged liquid vaporizing on the ground around the vessel may reach dangerous concentrations, causing explosions or accidents with poison gas. This paper describes work on designing systems to separate the liquid from the vapour for storage in a collecting vessel. The requirement for a separation rate of at least 80% was balanced against the need for the separated liquid flow back into the reactor during the pressure relief phase. For safety reasons, separation as well as re-storage had to be carried out without using external energy. Theoretical and experimental investigations of the pressure distribution within the tube to the relief valve and an integrated separator showed that the demand for re-storage of the separated liquid within the vessel could be satisfied under certain flow conditions. Therefore, the separator had to be integrated in the pipe at a certain height above the vessel, so that the hydrostatic pressure of the separated liquid was sufficient to lead it back through another pipe against the internal pressure of the vessel. First, several separators were tested with air-water mixtures, and a twist separator and a reversing separator were developed. Experimental results with air-water mixtures and refrigerant R12 upon pressure relief showed separation rates of 90–100% with low pressure loss within the whole working range. As an alternative to separation outside the vessel, a rotary separator fixed to the vessel outlet opening was developed. A centrifugal field is produced by the separator rotor and the heavier liquid is separated from the vapour, so that only drops of size 100 μm flow with the vapour towards the central standpipe. The vapour flowing out in this way leaves the separator via four tangentially arranged nozzles under critical flow conditions. The vapour flow momentum powers the separator rotor. The arrangement was developed and tested experimentally under pressure relief conditions using the refrigerant R12. Separation rates of 69–95% were achieved at rotation speeds up to 2000 rpm. © 1990, All rights reserved.","loss prevention; pressure system design; relief devices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3643054731

The energy emanated from the source is adapted by passive filters, which is often a compromise between volume and effective use. A classical rectifierfilter network presents a major disadvantage: a power factor less than one which is caused by distortion of the source current. The resolution of the high-frequency input current of the series-resonant converter introduces the possibility of controlling the waveform of the source current accurately. In combination with the accurate positioning of the high-frequency current pulses, it is possible to influence the exchange of power with the source by the introduced method of active filtering. A power factor equal to one would lead to an optimal operation. The method introduced can select any value for the power factor, even for distorted voltage waveforms. However the zero-crossing of the AC source voltage introduces the necessity of storing energy. Bulky low-frequency storage elements increase the specific volume and weight of the converter while the exchange of energy with storage elements decreases the overall efficiency. The energy stored in the resonant circuit is fundamentally too low to solve this problem. The stored energy in the output capacitor, necessary to decrease the high-frequency ripple voltage, is available for these purposes. To meet the optimal conditions for the power factor at the source, a bipolar flow of energy is required. The theory of single-phase AC-to-DC series-resonant power conversion with controllable reactive power is explained. The results of simulation and experiment will establish the extensive possibilities of the proposed systems. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249959395

It is supposed that the peaks are caused by breaking of the intermolecular bondings in the resin during the glass transition. The bondings are formed in the resin during the storage at room temperature. Thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) measurements were carried out in the temperature range of 290 to 350 K, with the samples having an average number molecular weight M̄n of 375 and 434.

The influence of poling temperatures, the influence of M̄n, the activation energy Ea, and the physical ageing of the samples were investigated. Physical ageing was determined as the reciprocal polarizability Rp vs. time of ageing. Samples. with higher M̄n showed a higher glass transition temperature, a lower Ea, and a higher increase in Rp than the sample with lower M̄n.

The effect of such restriction is greater for smaller fish. Weight-specific basal metabolism increases as size decreases; however, there is no corresponding increase in energy storage capacity. Thus, smaller fish tend to be less tolerant of starvation conditions because they exhaust their energy stores sooner. Such size dependence of starvation endurance has often been observed in laboratory experiments. In wild populations commonly subject to winter starvation, population viability hinges on the ability of young of year to complete a minimum amount of growth during their first year of life. From south to north, this ability is increasingly restricted as the growing season shortens and the starvation period lengthens. We show that this constraint is sufficient to explain the present locations of the northern distributional limit for yellow perch Perca flavescens in central and western North America, the northern distributional limit for Eurasian perch P. fluviatilis in Eurasia, and the northern distributional limit for smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieui in central North America. We also forecast how shifts in North American climate may relax this constraint and permit both yellow perch and smallmouth bass to thrive well to the north of their present distributions. © 1990 by the American fisheries society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33044499825

By invoking the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, these energies are used to generate potential surfaces for the interaction of a negative particle with an atom or small molecule. The results indicate that the particle-induced polarizations are significant even at 10-bohr separations in neon. Unusual behavior of the dipole moments of both argon and neon was calculated to occur as a function of separation. The molecular-orbital approach used here may also be useful in analyzing recent ionization behavior in low-energy pinert-gas scattering experiments. Furthermore, the calculated large degree of polarization further constrains the design of materials for long-term normal matter storage of antiprotons for advanced energy sources. © 1990 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25044436541

Results are presented as a function of Q2 and the center-of-mass energy W, with the Q2 range extending from 0.2 to 60 GeV2, and W in the range from 2 to 10 GeV. The data were taken with the TPC/Two-Gamma facility at the SLAC e+e- storage ring PEP, which was operated at a beam energy of 14.5 GeV. The cross section exhibits a gentle falloff with increasing W.

Agreement at high Q2 is improved if a minimum-pT cutoff (motivated by QCD) is imposed on the pointlike contribution. © 1990 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24544442099

Heger, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Epilobium ciliatum plants were grown under extreme shade conditions (ca 20 μmol m-2 sec-1). The photosynthetic characteristics of these low-light-grown (LL) leaves were measured using the photoacoustic technique and were compared to those of control (HL) leaves grown at a higher (5x) photon flux density (100 μmol m-2 sec-1). Adaptation to very low light was not associated with a significant change in the maximal efficiency of photochemical energy storage (value extrapolated to the zero photon density) which was around 16% in both types of leaves. The most salient characteristic of LL leaves was the very rapid saturation of the photochemistry with increasing light irradiance. This latter effect was particularly pronounced when photochemical energy storage was measured at modulation frequencies of between 450 and 600 Hz, suggesting that the rate-limiting step responsible for the rapid light-saturation of the photosynthetic electron flux in LL leaves had a time constant decay of about 3000 sec-1. The high-frequency data were confirmed by photoacoustic measurements of oxygen evolution at low modulation frequencies, which indicated that the reduction of the relative quantum yield of oxygen evolution Φ with increasing photon flux densities was considerably faster in shade-adapted adapted leaves than in control leaves. When compared to HL leaves, LL leaves had a lower Φ except, however, at very low photon flux densities (below about 10-15 μmol m-2 sec-1), where Φ drastically decreased in control Epilobium leaves (""low light state"") but not in LL leaves. The preservation of a high oxygen yield at low photon flux densities could partially explain the ability of Epilobium ciliatum to grow under extreme shade conditions. © 1989.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442317072

Melting and solidification time of the PCM were measured for three kinds of m.p. distributions. The charge and discharge heat transfer rates were estimated from the melting and solidification time respectively. Numerical results agreed with the experimental results. For the PCM with constant m.p. the charge and discharge heat transfer rates decreased downstream from the air inlet of the reservoir.

Sola of NASA. Since then a number of Products employing phase controlled thyristors for the control of applied voltage with closed-loop power factor regulation have been marketed under various brand names by a number of manufacturers. Further refinements in load and power factor sensing as well as control circuit hardware have been either claimed through patents by Sola and others or reported in the technical literature. Analytical studies of three phase induction motors operating from phase controlled thyristors in the stator circuits have also been well documented. Study of all of these references raises some very interesting questions such as: Do the power factor controllers really improve the system power factor as product manufacturers lead one to believe? Is it really necessary to regulate power factor to minimize no load losses by voltage control? Analysis and experimental data indicate that while the operating power factor of the motor does improve by voltage reduction by phasecontrolled thyristors in the stator circuit, the overall system power factor at the input to the controller does not change. Analytical explanation of this phenomena using circle diagrams and phasor relationships as well as experimental results are presented in this paper. A new controller design based on this research and development effort is introduced. © 1990 IEEE.",,"Controllers; Digital storage; Electric drives; Electric power factor; Energy dissipation; Induction motors; Industrial electronics; Manufacture; NASA; Power control; Stators; Thyristors; Analytical studies; Induction motor drive; Power factor control; Power factor regulations; Product manufacturers; Research and development; Technical literature; Three phase induction motor; Electric machine control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346282677

An algorithm in marker- and-cell (MAC) method has been widely used in the usual FDM. In this study, therefore, we develop the MAC method to a BFC method. The governing equations are written by use of Riemann geometry, and new additional terms emerging in the equations are discussed. Contra-variant physical components are employed as variables and compared with contravariant nonphysical components.

The experiment is complete in the sense that we characterize the desorbing particles by their rotationally and vibrationally resolved time of flight spectra via LIF (Laser Induced Fluorescence)- and REMPI (Resonance Enhanced Multi Photon Ionization)- techniques in the gas phase, and we characterize the solid surface before and after irradiation by electron spectroscopic methods, i.e., AES, LEED, and XPS. We find the build up of NiO after irradiation of the molecular adsorbates. The structure of the oxide is characterized by LEED. The electronic and geometric structure of NO and NO2 adsorbed on NiO is studied using angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARUPS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) measurements and the results are compared with those for NO and NO2 on clean Ni(100). For the ARUPS and NEXAFS measurements we have used synchrotron radiation from the storage ring BESSY I in Berlin. As expected, on NiO the desorption process has a much higher cross section than on the clean metal surface. A ""photodesorption"" channel of NO desorbing from NiO is clearly identified by the rotationally resolved time-of-flight spectra. In addition to the photodesorption channel a ""thermal"" channel is observed.

These states play an important role in N-atom recombination. The collisional coupling of these states to other excited electronic states strongly influences the electronic emission spectrum of N 2 observed in atom recombination. Since these states are not dipole coupled to lower excited electronic states of N2, they are considered metastable and are possible candidates for high energy density storage media. We have examined the stability of N2(5Σ) state in a discharge flow reactor. The 5Σ state is produced from the N2(A 3Σ) energy pooling reaction and probed via laser-induced fluorescence on the C″ 5Π′-A 5 transition. While no laser-induced fluorescence from excitation of the A′ state is observed, comparison of signal levels with laser-induced fluorescence on theB 3Πg-A 3Σ u- transition enables us to establish an upper limit on the gas phase lifetime of this state at pressures of a few Torr. Experimental evidence is presented which suggests that the primary mode of A′-state quenching is through collisional coupling to the B 3Πg state. However, other matrix isolation experiments suggest that the A′ state may be stabilized in cryogenic rare gas matrices. © 1990 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039184906

This paper examines the potential of this concept by reviewing the processes of synthesis of the molecule and the chemical reactions that it undergoes. Methyl formate can be produced by a variety of routes from a number of feedstocks. The reaction between methanol and carbon monoxide is an efficient process, used commercially. Combination of an efficient synthesis of methyl formate and its facile decomposition allows the molecule to be used as a means for separation, storage and transport of synthesis gas. The number of reactions that convert methyl formate to other chemicals is large. In particular, the synthesis of large volume chemicals such as methanol, acetic acid and ethylene glycol deserves serious consideration. Examples are provided of applications in the chemical and energy industries involving methyl formate. The reactions involved in the synthesis and transformation of methyl formate are mostly catalytic in nature. Many currently known catalytic systems are not efficient to compete with conventional routes involving methanol or synthesis gas. Fundamental research to understand the catalytic chemistry involved is highly desirable in order to improve the performance of the catalytic systems. © 1990.",,"Catalysis; Catalysts; Chemical Reactions--Dehydrogenation; Esters--Synthesis; Synthesis Gas--Chemical Reactions; Carbonyl Transfer Reactions; Methyl Formate; Oxidative Dehydrogenation; Steel Mill Off Gases; Methanol",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025698037

It was found that for every mortality level there exists a critical proportion of persistent organs. Below this critical value it is optimal to grow without reproduction for the first years until a characteristic size is reached; afterwards, that size is maintained year after year and all extra resources are devoted to reproduction. Some storage is also necessary to maintain constant size. If the proportion of retained vegetative mass is above the critical value, the optimal strategy is gradual growth to an asymptotic size, with growth and reproduction occurring in several years following maturation. In this case real storage occurs only until maturation is reached, then storage is realized only by energy relocation from the vegetative body. Although the optimal solution changes abruptly qualitatively at a given proportion of resources saved from year to year, further growth of this proportion above the critical level brings about a greater difference between size reached at maturity and final size. The predictions of the model seem to follow the pattern of nature qualitatively. © 1990 Chapman and Hall Ltd.","Optimal life histories; perennial plants; relocations","growth; perennial plant; reproduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025694413

Both models suggest that birds will increase the amplitude of the daily cycle of body mass as midwinter approaches and decrease the amplitude toward spring. Seasonal changes in night length and night temperature cause seasonal variation in thermoregulatory demands, hence seasonal variation in amplitude of the daily mass cycle. Only the first model proposes an increase in dawn body mass toward midwinter, and a subsequent decrease in mass toward spring; in the second model, the daily minimum mass remains seasonally constant. Because fat is a major component of daily and seasonal variation in body mass, these contrasting strategies for body mass regulation have been termed ""true winter fattening' and ""constant dawn mass' strategies, respectively. In the former case, the seasonal increase in the dawn body/fat mass is considered to represent an emergency energy supply to be used during sudden poor feeding conditions.

The quality of the liver does not appear dependent upon the time of preservation but may be dependent upon the condition of the donor. In this study we have investigated the effects of fasting on the quality of livers for transplantation. Rabbits were fasted (48 hr) and livers preserved in the UW solution for 6-8 hr. Functions of the liver were analyzed by isolated perfusion for 2 hr. Also, pigs were fasted for 72 hr, livers preserved for 12 hr, and viability determined by orthotopic transplantation. Fasting depleted the liver glycogen by 85% but had no effect on ATP or glutathione concentrations. Rabbit livers from fasted animals produced similar amounts of bile, released similar concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate amino transaminase (AST) into the perfusate, maintained similar concentrations of ATP and glutathione in the tissue, and had a similar intracellular K: Na ratio after 24-hr preservation when compared to livers from fed animals. After 48-hr preservation, livers from fasted animals were less viable than livers from fed animals, including: reduced bile production (2.0±0.3 vs. 5.0±0.9 ml/2 hr, 100 g), greater release of LDH (3701± 562 units vs. 1123±98 units) and AST, less ATP (0.326±74 vs. 0.802±160 nmol/g), less glutathione (0.303±13 vs. 0.933±137 nmol/g), and a lower K: Na ratio (1.5±0.9 vs. 7.4±0.6). Pigs receiving livers from fed animals preserved for 12 hr had better survival (5/ 6, 83%) than livers from fasted animals (3/6, 50%). The results show that the nutritional status of the donor can affect the outcome of liver preservation and transplantation. Increased injury in livers from fasted animals may be due to the loss of glycogen that may be an essential source of energy in the initial posttransplant period. In clinical liver transplantation the nutritional status of the donor may be an important factor in the initial function of the liver, and methods to increase the nutritional status of the donor may be important in increasing the quality of livers. © 1990 by Williams and Wilkins.",,"glycogen; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; diet restriction; graft survival; liver transplantation; nutritional status; organ preservation; priority journal; rabbit; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Cold; Fasting; Glutathione; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Liver; Liver Glycogen; Liver Transplantation; Organ Preservation; Rabbits; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025689813

The heat content of the system, the fraction of recoverable heat, and the rate at which this fraction can be extracted are important factors in the technical and economic viability of a geothermal project. They depend greatly on the characteristics of the bearing rocks. Only a limited amount of appropriate rock property data is available. This restricts geothermal energy development.

To gain more insight into these questions a method was developed to record directly in vivo forces from the human Achilles tendon (AT). The paper focuses on the details of the various techniques including the design, surgical implantation and calibration of the transducers. The implantation is performed under local anaesthesia and the measurements can last up to three hours, after which the transducer is removed. Exemplar results are presented from the measurements during walking, running and jumping. The loading of AT reached in some cases values as high as 9 KN, corresponding to 12.5 times the body weight or, when expressed per cross-sectional area of the tendon, the value was 11 100 N cm-2. During the early contact phase of running the rate of AT force development increased linearly with the increase of running speed. Indirect measurements of the length changes of the muscle-tendon complex was used to plot the force-length and force-velocity relationships in the various activity situations. The observed results demonstrated that in normal locomotion involving the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) muscle actions, the mechanical response of the triceps surae muscle is very different from the classical curves obtained in isolated muscle preparations. In agreement with the animal experiments using a similar in vivo technique, the natural locomotion with primarily SSC actions may produce muscle outputs which can be very different from the various conditions of the isolated preparations, where activation levels are held constant and storage and utilization of strain energy is limited. It is suggested that despite some limitations (due to e.g. difficulties in obtaining volunteers for AT force measurements, possible inaccuracies in transducer calibration and in muscle length estimates) the in vivo force measurement technique has an important role in studying the mechanical behaviour of muscle and its control under normal movement conditions. © 1990.",,"Biological Materials - Muscle; Transducers; Achiles Tendon (AT); Jumping; Running; Stretch Shortening Cycle (SSC); Biomechanics; biomechanics; conference paper; exercise; human; male; muscle force; Achilles Tendon; Biomechanics; Calibration; Equipment Design; Human; Male; Prostheses and Implants; Reference Values; Running; Transducers; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025668479

Further, they are often used to model inputs for building thermal analysis and solar energy systems analysis using periodic or frequency response methods. In such cases it is usually necessary to represent solar radiation transmitted through glazings with discrete Fourier series before performing the energy balances. This paper presents a method based on the circular convolution theorem for determining the Fourier coefficients (Sn) of the solar radiation transmitted through glazings S(t) from the coefficients τn and Gn of the discrete Fourier series representations of the transmittance function τ(t) and of the incident solar radiation G(t), respectively. Only the significant coefficients of τ and G need to be used in this computation, resulting in computer file size reduction of at least 80% and high computational efficiency. This method may also be used for estimation of the long-term averages of transmitted solar radiation. Applications are given for weekly and for daily solar radiation data. © 1990.",,"Computer Programming--Algorithms; Computer Programs; Circular Convolutional Theorem; Discrete Fourier Series; Incident Solar Radiation; Transmittance Function; Solar Radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025664986

A Gammacell 220 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd., Ottawa, Canada§ § Use of trade names is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by the Public Health Service or by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.) was used to subject 38 viruses grown in either susceptible tissue cultures or embryonated chicken eggs to various doses of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 source. The radiation required to reduce viral infectivity was 0·42 to 3·7 megarads (Mrad). The effect of gamma treatment on the antigenic reactivity of reagents for the complement fixation (CF), hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminadase assays was determined. Influenza antigens inactivated with 1·7 Mrad displayed comparable potency, sensitivity, specificity and stability to those inactivated by standard procedures with beta-propiolactone (BPL). Significant inactivation of influenza N1 and B neuraminidase occurred with &gt;2·4 Mrad radiation at temperatures above 4°C. All 38 viruses were inactivated, and CF or HA antigens were prepared successfully. Antigenic potency remained stable with all antigens for 3 years and with 83% after 5 years storage. Influenza HA antigens evaluated after 9 years of storage demonstrated 86% stability.

Conceptual design of a TF (toroidal field) coil HPG (homopolar generator) module (approximately 1-GJ energy storage and 12.5-MA peak current) for IGNITEX is presented. The HPG power supply, designed to provide a 150-MA, 12-GJ, 10-s-long pulse to the TF magnet, is accomplished with a modular approach where several generators are used in parallel. The PF (poloidal field) coil power supply requirements are less demanding in terms of energy storage (2.6 GJ) and peak current (22 MA) than those of the TF coil generators. The PF circuits are underdamped to provide ringing and thereby lower peak currents. Active control of all magnet currents during an experiment is provided by continuous adjustments to the HPG excitation fields. The proposed machine consists of a conventional iron-core HPG for voltage generation and current collection and a fiberglass reinforced epoxy-composite flywheel which provides most of the energy storage function. Titanium web structures are used to attach the flywheel to the rotor shaft and a face spline provides coupling to the ferromagnetic rotor. A successful demonstration of the proposed HPG module will provide the power supply capability required for ohmic fusion ignition.",,"Electromagnets; Nuclear reactors, Fusion; Plasmas--Heating; Homopolar Generators; Ignitex Experiment; Summary Only; Toroidal Fields; Electric coils",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025659227

A methodology is presented that accurately quantifies both types of energy flows, with or without storage, from one compartment to another. It is shown how increased cycling and storage both tend to increase the ratio of indirect to direct flows, and contribute to properties of network amplification and homogenization of energy availability over all trophic levels. These properties of realistic food webs are not present in the classical acyclic food chain paradigm. Consequences include an age distribution of energy within actual organisms, and an apyramidal trophic structure of standing stocks, in which organisms at any trophic distance have about equal access to available energy reurces. © 1990.",,"ecosystem structure; energy storage; food web; trophic dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025658879

The heliostat field needs investigation, as it is the most expensive component of the system. Moreover, it is one of the unconventional components, and is not used in existing power plants. This study identifies the starting time of the power plant, the height of the tower, the distance between the tower and the heliostat mirror, and the location of the power plant as the design parameters for Iraq. A mathematical model simulating the movements of the sun, the heliostat mirror and its shadow have been made. The results indicate that the shading length is about twice the length of the heliostat mirror. An average optimal size of the mirror is 2m. The optimal distance from the tower up to which the mirrors can be placed varies with the height of the tower and is about 1.25 of it, the location of the plant is preferred to be at a lower latitude. A central receiver solar power plant can be operated for 4 h in winter and 10 h during summer. © 1990.","Central receiver power plants; Heliostat field; Shading and blocking; Solar energy; Tower power plants","Mathematical Models; Solar Power Plants--Energy Storage; Blocking; Central Receiver; Heliostat Field; Tower Power Plant; Solar Radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025643719

Alternative energy sources are then examined. These include (i) tidal power from the proposed Severn Estuary Scheme, (ii) development of pumped storage such as that proposed at Craigroyston above Loch Lomond, (iii) small-scale.hydro using low head hydro-turbines permitting development of previously uneconomic schemes on rivers, (iv) wind power from wind farms which would utilise the favourable wind patterns which exist in the U.K., (v) use of North Sea gas for combined cycle plant, (vi) development of small scale coal-fired stations, particularly those which use the more efficient and cleaner fluidised bed system, and (vii) utilising wave power although there are doubts as to how much would be economically viable. Other alternatives assessed include generation of electricity by incineration of municipal waste, burning of methane gas generated by decomposition of effluents and rubbish, and the generation of electricity as a bi-product of chemical processes. Small city combined heat and power plants are then discussed. The competitiveness of imports from France via a second Cross Channel Link, and from a 2000 MW Submarine Cable Power Link with Iceland where Hydro and Geothermal power is harnessed, is also examined.

Birds were trapped through the winter and selected individuals fitted with radio transmitters to monitor continously their location, movements and activities from roost departure until re‐entry. Merlins maintained individual home ranges in winter, with extensive overlap between neighbouring birds in some cases. Yearling home ranges were not significantly different in size from those of adults. The winter home ranges of adults were closely associated with their previous nest site. Both adults and yearlings made significantly greater use of Residential habitat in the city than expected based on the area available in their home ranges. However, while adults remained largely in the two oldest habitat types, yearlings were also found in more recently built areas of the city. Home ranges held within the city were sometimes combined with foraging areas in the adjacent countryside. The use of foraging areas in farmyards and cattle feedlots outside of the city was most notable in adults, although some yearlings apparently learned this strategy in their first year. Merlins also used Commercial‐Industrial habitat for hunting at levels much higher than expected from its availability in their home ranges. Diets in summer and winter had a high degree of overlap; house sparrows Passer domesticus and bohemian waxwings Bombycilla garrulus made up a large proportion of the diet during both seasons. Hunting activity peaked at 09:00 and 16:00 h, reflecting the replenishment of energy stores lost over‐night, and the storage of energy in preparation for the next over‐night fast.

For cure temperatures ≥ 385 K, the storage modulus curing curves, G′(t), exhibited abrupt changes in slope which occurred at various times depending on the curing temperatures. These slope changes were attributed to the onset of gelation. Crossover points between G′(t) and G″(t) curves were observed for curing temperatures ≥ 400 K. The gelation and the crossover points obtained from the chemorheological measurements, therefore, defined two characteristic resin states during cure. Although gelation theory did not predict them correctly, the degree of cure in each of these states was approximately the same for every cure temperature. The temperature dependency of the viscosities in the characteristic resin states, and the rate constants of increase in moduli at different stages of curing were analyzed. Various G′(t) and G″(t) isothermal curing curves were also shown to be capable of being superimposed to one another by the principle of time‐temperature superposition. The resultant shift factors at(T) and aη(T) were shown to follow Arrhenius type relationships.

In the ""hummingbird model', energy-maximizing birds feeding on energy-concentrated foods should exhibit longer food-retention times than birds feeding on energy-dilute foods, birds should exhibit digestibilities of sugars close to 100%. The optimal throughput times and sugar digestibilities predicted by the hummingbird model are independent of the cost of feeding. In the ""frugivore model', uptake of sugars had a substantial passive-diffusion component: when birds feed on hexoses, optimal retention times and digestibilities of sugar decrease as functions of the increased concentration of sugars in food. In the frugivore model, increasing the cost of feeding increases the time food should be retained in the intestine and, hence, the digestibility of sugars. -from Authors",,"bird; digestibility; frugivory; nectarivory; sugar composition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025628961

The wind energy converters, equipped with asynchronous generators, and a fast pitch control, work in parallel with a synchronous generator. The generator is driven by a diesel engine by means of an overrunning clutch, and is started by a small d.c. motor. If the diesel is off, or the starting process by the d.c. motor is finished, the synchronous generator works as a rotating phase-shifter and takes over voltage control and supply of reactive power. The speed versus power control of the wind energy converters makes possible an optimized parallel operation with the diesel-generator unit, and also directly takes over frequency control when operated singly without the diesel engine. The location of the wind turbine does not depend on the site of the diesel engine, because control cables are not necessary. To avoid too frequent starting of the diesel, a storage battery is installed.

The Los Alamos Trailmaster plasma implosion program is exploring the concept of coupling together a plasma flow switch (PFS) and an explosive pulsed power system to drive a foil-plasma z-pinch experiment. The PFS provides an opening switch inside the vacuum region of the experiment and allows energy to be delivered past the vacuum-dielectric interface at lower voltage than is possible with external switches. Experiments are being conducted to determine whether conventional fuse or explosively formed fuse (EFF) opening switches offer better performance in the role of the external switch in this system. In the experiments, a MK-IX generator powers a approximately 60-nH storage inductor and the external switch then diverts current to the plasma gun of a PFS. The goal is to drive the PFS plasma to a velocity of approximately 7 cm/μs while carrying as much current as possible. Circuit models suggest that currents of 14-16 MA will be delivered to the end of the gun where it will ultimately be available to deliver about 1 MJ of kinetic energy to a z-pinch implosion.

Cold-induced inhibition of reproduction may result from a depletion of available metabolic energy due to the increased requirements for thermogenesis or, alternatively, from mechanisms unrelated to energy expenditure. We examined the relationship between energy availability (in the diet and the body fat stores) and cold-induced anestrus in Syrian hamsters. In experiment 1, hamsters were housed in the cold (5 °C) and fed diets that differed in the amount of effort required to ingest them. The number of consecutive estrous cycles was positively correlated with caloric intake and negatively correlated with body weight loss in the cold. In experiment 2, hamsters were fed these diets for several weeks, so that they differed dramatically in body weight and fat content before cold exposure. Half of each group retained the same diet during cold exposure , whereas the other half were fed a regular chow diet. The effects of body weight before cold exposure were less pronounced than the effects of caloric intake during cold exposure. In experiment 3, females were fed different diets before cold exposure, then, during cold exposure, all were fed in a manner that decreased food intake and increased the effort required to obtain food. This energetic challenge exaggerated the effect of prior body weight on the latency to cold-induced anestrus. Thus the latency to cold-induced anestrus in Syrian hamsters is primarily a function of the availability of metabolic energy. The total supply of metabolic fuels potentially available for oxidation depends on the energy intake, storage, and expenditure. The number and acquisition cost of calories ingested during cold exposure had dramatic long-term effects on the latency to cold-induced anestrus, whereas the amount of body fat stored before cold exposure appeared to be of importance only during the period immediately after the onset of cold exposure, before food intake had risen to meet the increased energy demands of thermoregulation in the cold.","caloric intake; estrous cycles; metabolic fuels; reproduction","anestrus; animal experiment; article; caloric intake; estrus cycle; hamster; nonhuman; priority journal; reproduction; thermoregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025611655

The mechanical behaviour of crushed rock salt is of interest to the WIPP Project because the mined WIPP salt is a candidate material for use as backfill around the waste packages and in the underground openings during and after the operational phase. It is anticipated that in response to the convergence of the mine openings, the crushed salt will compact sufficiently to serve as an effective component in WIPP seal systems. In this paper, the model for isostatic hot-pressing which was developed by Helle et al. is applied to the problem of compaction of both pure NaCl and natural (WIPP) salt to develop a model capable of predicting densification rates as a function of temperature and applied pressure. Calculations for pure dry NaCl suggest that under conditions in situ, the contribution to densification by diffusional processes is negligible; all compaction will occur by dislocation creep. Assuming then that compaction will occur only by dislocation processes, the model is extended to nominally dry, WIPP rock salt. Model predictions are shown to agree favourably with available test data, and the kinds of laboratory tests that may be done to validate the model are discussed. Hot-pressing mechanism maps for dry WIPP salt under anticipated repository conditions indicate that fractional densities in excess of 0.95 are attained in about 30 yr. At this density, connected porosity, and hence permeability, diminish rapidly, and the recompacted salt can begin to serve as an effective seal material. This prediction underestimates consolidation rates in situ, because moist salt will compact even more rapidly. It will be shown how the model may be extended to include the effects of brine on densification rates. © 1990.",,"Geology; Radioactive Wastes--Geological Repositories; Refractory Materials--Hot Pressing; Rock Mechanics; Hot Isostatic Pressing; Salt Formations; Waste Isolation Pilot Plant; Sodium Chloride; backfill; hot pressing mechanism; radioactive waste storage; rock salt; sodium chloride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025598405

However, when using hydrogen for automotive applications, large and heavy tanks are required. This problem can be lessened by the proposed thermocontrolled tank concept which uses well insulated high pressure cylinders initially filled with liquid hydrogen which changes phase to compressed gas at a low temperature of 100 to 200 K and high pressure of 300 bar. The gas pressure is maintained during vehicle operation at over 100 bar by the heat transfer to the tank and used for direct hydrogen injection. To increase the heat transfer, the energy of the engine exhaust gases can be used. This concept requires an electronic control based on microprocessor technology with temperature and pressure sensors, as well as electronically actuated valves for the control of heat transfer from the engine exhaust gases to the tank. © 1990.",,"Automobiles - Fuel Tanks; Heat Transfer - Control; Internal Combustion Engines - Exhaust Gases; Tanks - Heating; Waste Heat Utilization; Direct Hydrogen Injection; Electronically Actuated Valves; Hydrogen on Board Storage; Liquid Hydrogen Storage; Thermocontrolled Tank Concept; Hydrogen Fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025596832

Shorter channel lengths and higher power supply voltages caused the ratio, M, of upset charge to deposited charge to increase. As a result of this multiplication factor, actual devices are more likely to upset (i.e., upset at lower energy) than expected from an analysis of only the collected charge. A mixed mode simulator, previously developed at Aerospace Corporation [1], was then used to model the charge collection process. This simulator combines PISCES II, a two dimensional transistor simulator, with a SPICE-like circuit simulator. Results of this study showed that the M factor is a very fluid number which is dependent on minority carrier lifetime, drain voltage, and the switching dynamics of the cell in addition to the dependence on mobility ratio and channel length reported by Rollins [1] Parasitic bipolar gain at high injection levels appears to be the primary mechanism allowing collected charge to be greater than deposited charge. In conclusion, the simulator and experimental data show that, as floating body static memory transistors are down scaled, the particle energy needed to upset the cell is reduced because of the enhanced parasitic bipolar gain effect as well as a reduction in the node capacitance. This result is shown by simulation to also apply to fully depleted SOI transistors. © 1990 IEEE",,"Cosmic Rays; Data Storage, Digital--Random Access; Transistors, Bipolar; CMOS/SOS Circuits; Integrated Circuits, CMOS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025592884

Solutions are obtained for a wide range of storage media (the solid phase) properties, namely density, thermal conductivity and specific heat. The results show that increasing either the density or specific heat increases the rate and capacity of energy storage, and decreases the rate of temperature rise throughout the storage medium. On the other hand, increasing the thermal conductivity is found to markedly increase the rate of temperature rise and energy stored inside the bed up to a certain time during charging, beyond which this trend completely reverses.

Most models assume that all of this energy is expended in lateral melting at floe edges. In reality, only a portion of Iw contributes directly to lateral melting, with the remainder going to bottom ablation and warming of the water. This partitioning of Iw affects not only the magnitude, but also the character of the predicted ice decay, reducing the change in ice concentration and enhancing the thinning of the ice and the storage of heat in the water.

The computed results agree very well with the insolation values used by the designers. The study shows that only about 6% of the available solar energy is fed to storage batteries, and the final energy utilization amounts to about 3.9% of the incident insolation. Since its installation, the PV arrays have been used to charge batteries that are used to provide night-time lighting, and are disconnected as soon as the batteries are fully charged. The findings of the study suggest that instead of disconnecting the arrays after the batteries are fully charged, the energy could have been used for water pumping, grinding and other basic industrial purposes. © 1990.",,"Data Processing--Natural Sciences Applications; Energy Conversion; Meteorology; Solar Power Plants--Performance; Mito Plant; Stand-Alone Photovoltaics System; Photovoltaic Cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025568728

In order to prevent possible accidents, with a large release of tritium, it must be trapped in solid and reversible solution forms by absorption beds. Moreover, residual gaseous form tritium in the pipelines, and permeation through the primary containment system, must be minimized. For storage, transfer, injection and recovery, a suitable system can be designed which uses metallic getter beds. Reversible solid solutions by tritium sorption are formed with low residual partial pressure, and re-emission by heating at low temperatures, which results in the reduction of permeation. This work shows the possibility of the use of a combination of two ZrVFe getter beds with different alloy compositions as an alternative to the usual uranium beds.

The plant has a capacity of 120 m3/d and uses seawater as the feed to a multieffect-stack (MES) distillation unit. The thermal energy requirement of this distiller is provided by a bank of evacuated-tube, flat-plate collectors having a total collector area of 1862 m2. The plant consists also of a heat-accumulator system which allows the solar energy collected during the day to be utilized at nighttime, thus allowing the plant to run continuously 24 hours per day. The heat accumulator is of the thermally stratified type and uses distilled water as the heat-storage medium. The temperature distribution inside this heat accumulator affects significantly the performance of the MES evaporator and its water production. To be able to predict accurately how this temperature distribution varies throughout the day remains a matter of importance to the designer of such solar desalination plant. Our main aim in this paper is to develop a one-dimensional, unsteady-state heat-transfer computer model and compare the results of this model with the actual temperature measurements taken at the solar plant. The model was developed in such a way as to take into consideration the different modes of operation of the heat accumulator, namely, charging, discharging, combined charging/discharging, and free cooling. A comparison between the calculated and measured temperature distributions indicates that the accuracy of the model is reasonably good. © 1990.",,"Computer Simulation; Computers--Applications; Desalination; Solar Energy--Applications; Temperature Measurement; Flat-Plate Collectors; Heat Accumulator; Multieffect Stack; Performance Simulation; Solar Desalination Plant; Thermal Energy; Heat Transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025537794

However, when the PV power generation level is high, the fluctuations and uncertainty of PV power would make the planning, operation, and control of a power system more difficult. This paper proposes and demonstrates that a superconductive magnetic energy storage (SMES) system can be used to overcome these difficulties and support large-scale use of PV power generation. Two system configurations for a PV/SMES hybrid system were described in this paper. In both cases, the SMES charging/discharging power is changed in response to PV fluctuations so that the combined PV/SMES power is smooth and controllable. With SMES support, large-scale use of PV power generation can be used in a power system without causing adverse effects. A coordinated PV/SMES scheme that is applicable for various weather conditions is presented in this paper. The combined PV/SMES power is dispatchable and is shown to have advantages over PV or SMES alone. PV arrays can be installed on the surface of the land occupied by an underground SMES system. With SMES support, all of the PV power can be utilized and no oversizing is needed. These benefits improve the economics of PV power generation. © 1990.",,"Control Systems; Photovoltaic Cells; Photovoltaic Effects; Solar Energy--Applications; Daily Load Curve; Energy Storage Schemes; Large-Scale PV Power Generation; PV Generation Systems; PV/SMES Hybrid System; SMES; Power Generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025534826

New rhizome extension and associated production of new culms and nodal roots are initiated following onset of rain in autumn. Rate of growth of these parts remains slow through winter, peaks in spring and early summer and then becomes much reduced in the hot, dry summer. The bulk (87%) of the season’s dry matter increment of new ramet parts is estimated to be derived from current photosynthesis, the remaining 13% by mobilisation of dry matter from older parts of the ramet, especially from 1- and 2-yearold culms. Growth of new organs is severely reduced by removal or shading of culms at the beginning of the season. Older culms and rhizomes carry substantial starch reserves, but mobilisation of this reserve accounts for 2% at most of the dry matter gain of new organs of intact ramets, 19% of that of shaded and 65% of detopped ramets. A substantial fraction of the starch pool of a rhizome segment normally remains until its senescence, possibly as a long-term energy reserve, utilisable after destruction of above-ground parts by fire or grazing. Concentrations of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in organ dry matter of A. nitens are generally very low in comparison with species other than those Cyperaceae or Restionaceae from similar habitats. There is no evidence of preferential storage in below-ground parts, and efficiencies of emptying of nutrient reserves from senescing ramet parts are not high. Mobilisation from older source organs of ramets of intact, unstressed clones is estimated to provide 14% of the new organ’s seasonal gain of P, 16% of Mg, 21% of Ca, 22% of N and 58% of K. Annual factorial increases of a ramet in the studied nutrient elements range from 1.3 (for K) to 2.4 (for P), indicating flexibility in exploiting sources of different nutrients as their respective availabilities change from season to season. © 1990, CSIRO.

A generic commercial building design of 27, 000 square feet (2508 m2) was selected for the optimization project. Several different types of thermal mass designs were considered as potentially practical for a commercial building. These included a “sandmass” design such as the mass incorporated in the previously monitored commercial building mentioned above, a foundation slab of sufficient thickness to serve as a significant building thermal mass, and the use of poured cement in interior wall and floor construction. Five different office building thermal designs were selected which represented various thermal storage features and two different building insulation levels (R10 and R20). Energy performance of the five thermal designs was modeled in building energy simulations using DOE 2.1C (Department of Energy 2.1C) energy simulation code. Results of the simulotions showed a reduction in peak heating and cooling loads would be experienced by the HVAC equipment. The reduction in peak heating and cooling loads was anticipated because thermal mass within a building serves to average peak heating and cooling loads due to the capacity of the thermal mass to store and release heat from all building heat sources over a period of time. Peak heating loads varied from 1972 kBtuh (578 kW) for the R-10 light construction base case to a minimum of 980 kBtuh (287 kW) for the R-20 heavy construction sandmass storage case. Peak cooling loads dropped from 772 kBtuh (226 kW) for the R-20 light construction case to 588 kBtuh (172 kW) for the R-20 heavy construction sandmass storage case. Results of the simulations also showed annual energy savings for the high thermal mass designs. Energy savings varied from 20 percent [16.0 kBtu/ft2 (50 kWh/m2)] for the R-10 high thermal mass design in comparison to its base case to 18 percent [12.2 kBtu/ft2 (39 kWh/m2)] for the R-20 high thermal mass design in comparison to its base case. The annual energy savings are due to the ability of the thermal mass to absorb heat from all sources of heat generation (lights, occupancy, solar, and auxiliary) during occupied periods and release the heat during unoccupied periods. An optimized thermal design was developed based on results from the DOE 2.1C simulations. The initial cost for the optimized thermal storage design is lower than the initial costs for light construction office buildings, since the lower initial cost of the down-sized HVAC system for the optimized thermal storage design more than offsets the increased cost of wall and floor systems incorporated in the optimized design. Annual energy savings are realized from the high thermal mass system in both cooling and heating modes due to the interaction of building HVAC systems operation in the simulated 27000 ft2 (2508 m2) office building. Annual operating savings of $3781 to $4465 per year are estimated based on simulation results. © 1990 by ASME.",,"Air Conditioning - Calculations; Energy Conservation; Energy Storage - Costs; Heating Season; Peak Cooling Demand; System Sizing; Thermal Mass; Buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025510965

The results were discussed in comparison with the predictions made from the modified Taylor model and observations in single crystals in the literature, which suggest that either γ′1- or β′1-martensite could be stress-induced. The observed yield stress was close to the predictions made assuming these martensites, but definitely smaller than either of them, the difference being larger as temperature increased. This disagreement is primarily attributed to the simultaneous formation of the two types of martensites, which is facilitated by the effect of intergranular constraint. The difference of the observed value for the SIM formation rate to the prediction, on the other hand, was far larger than that for the yield stress, so that the work done by the applied stress was significantly larger than the energy consumed for the formation of SIM.

For initial electron temperatures, magnetic fields, and charged particle densities—as, for instance, are apparently attainable in the experimental storage ring (ESR) at GSI Darmstadt—electrons tend to be trapped in the vicinity of their nearest ion neighbor. This results in an energy exchange with the ions that is qualitatively different from conventional models, where electron cooling is described in terms of small angle collisions or within the linearized dielectric response theory. Such models are justified for situations where the potential energy of interaction is small compared to the relevant kinetic energy; e.g., for light ions. For the case of high-Z ions, however, it is the trapping process itself that drives the cooling. Using a variety of parameterizations of the electron shielding of the ions, it is found that the resulting steady-state ion temperature parallel to the magnetic field is less than a factor of ten higher than the original parallel electron temperature. The e-folding times of approach to the equilibrium temperature have been found to be of the order of a few milliseconds for Z in the range of 20 and above.

Therefore, the most difficult cases that can be solved using elementary chemical kinetics have been one-dimensional transient and two-dimensional steady formulations. This limitation and the established shortcomings of global reactions have encouraged recent development of simplified but accurate multi-step kinetics schemes. The present investigation uses one of these simplified reaction mechanisms to determine if solution of a multi-dimensional, transient, reacting flow problem is possible without resort to overly simplified, global kinetics. A laminar, two-dimensional, transient, viscous flow model has been developed which incorporates a chemical kinetics mechanism for propane consisting of four reversible reactions and only seven species. The model is used to investigate the initiation and propagation of a flame subjected to heat transfer, wall motion and shear flow. The mathematical model simulates the physical and chemical processes occurring near the centerline of a thin-gap formed by two cold, solid surfaces as one surface moves first toward and then away from the other. The governing conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy and chemical species are simplified using the thin-gap approximation. The problem is transformed to eliminate the continuity equation by using a compressible stream function formulation. The resulting mixed order system of nonlinear, boundary value problems is solved by a semi-discrete numerical procedure which employs a finite element collocation method and adaptive grid technique. Both non-reacting and reacting cases are solved to demonstrate the effect of the shear flow and cold surfaces on the flow field and on the developing laminar flame. The results reveal a complex flow with numerous substructures caused by the interaction of the developing flame with cold fluid trapped in the boundary layer adjacent to the stationary wall. The reacting flow results represent the first calculation of a laminar, reacting flow in a moving wall geometry using nonequilibrium, multi-step chemistry while simultaneously resolving the momentum and thermal boundary layers. © 1990.",,"Chemical Reactions--Reaction Kinetics; Flame Research; Fuels--Combustion; Mathematical Models; Propane--Combustion; Reversible Reactions; Thermal Boundary Layers; Two-Dimensional Combustion; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025498893

The experiments on a wire under cyclic uniaxial tension were carried out and the influences of test temperature, maximum strain and shape memory processing temperature on the cyclic behaviors of these strain energies were investigated. The results obtained are summarized as follows. (1) The recoverable strain energy was large as the test temperature became high, and decreased with the number of cycles. (2) The dissipated strain energy depended little on the test temperature for small maximum strain, but decreased significantly in the early cycles at low test temperatures if the maximum strain was larger than the range of stress-induced martensitic transformation. (3) Among the attenuation rates of various strain energies under cyclic deformation, the attenuation rate of dissipated strain energy was largest. The variation of attenuation rate of every strain energy was significant in the early cycles, but became almost constant after the 20th cycle. This means that the training before the actual use is effective for the cyclic stability of each strain energy.

The study includes thermal investigations before and after the irradiation, investigations of the form stability, gel content determinations and microscopic investigations of HDPE. An electron energy of 0.4 MeV and a radiation dosage of 200 kGy were found to be the optimum conditions for the irradiation of the investigated HDPE in air. The pellets obtained were form‐stable owing to the formation of a thin crosslinked surface layer (about 0.5 mm thickness). In spite of the presence of oxygen during irradiation, the melting enthalpy of the initial state was retained almost quantitatively. Apart from that, a quasicomplete irradiation of the pellets in volume in air, with a higher electron energy, is also possible. In this case about 95% of the initial melting enthalpy is obtained, providing a maximum gel content of 50%. Moreover, the paper offers a possibility of overcoming the low heat transfer power of HDPE by applying it in form of modified pellets in a ‘Galisol’ model storage unit with water as the heat transfer liquid. Owing to the large heat transfer area connected to boiling and condensation of water, excellent values of heat transfer power of 100–114 W/kg HDPE (ΔT=16 K) are obtained. These are comparable to those of salt hydrates, provided there is sufficient form stability. The significant influence of somewhat lower form stability on the heat output is shown.

We have, therefore, chosen the high, medium and low load days in winter (January) and summer (July). The daily peak load has varied from 5838 MW to 9712 MW. These six days are studied for reference (no PV), high, medium, low and intermittent PV output cases. Results from these 30 case studies are summarized in this paper. In order to study the impact of operating photovoltaic (PV) systems on the electric utility production cost (fuel and variable O&M) we have chosen the load profile of a southeastern utility and the PV output data from solar test facilities in Virginia and North Carolina. In order to incorporate the short term variations we have used 10-minute resolution data for both load and PV output. Fifty generating units are made available to serve the load. These include nuclear, coal, combustion turbine, hydroelectric and pumped storage power plants. These units are scheduled in such a way that the impact of PV output can be seen primarily on the combustion turbine and thermal steam units. This is done to maximize the savings due to the PV energy. The performance analysis shows that, while the total production (fuel and variable O&M) cost savings are higher for high solar days, the increase is not proportional to the amount of PV energy output. This observation reflects very clearly on the per unit PV energy value. It is seen that the high solar day never produced the highest per unit PV energy value. In fact the highest per unit PV energy values for both winter and summer days are found to be for the low solar days. This is because during those days the PV energy outputs come closest to displacing their full equivalent amount of combustion turbine (CT) generation. As CT generation is the most expensive, this scenario gives the highest per unit PV energy value. In our study we have seen the best per unit PV energy value for the low PV output on a medium load day in winter. © 1990 IEEE","Dispatchable generation; Economic dispatch; Energy value; Photovoltaics; Production cost; Ramp rates; Unit commitment","Electric Utilities--Fuel Economy; Solar Cells; Daily Peak Load; Solar Days; Summer Days; Photovoltaic Cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025492249

In quest of a possible means of avoiding the edge walls, we minimize the energy of an infinite strip composed of two laminations connected along their edges. Under the conditions that the spacer thickness is ≥ 0.2 x (magnetic-sublayer thickness) and that the energy is less than that of the closure-domain state, we predict: 1) Fully stray-field-free flux closure with no walls occurs if the sum of anisotropy and exchange - stiffness energies within the magnetic connections is negative. 2) If this energy sum is positive, then a part of the flux leaks through the spacer, forming edge walls whose angle is < 90°. Polarization switching of these walls contributes to hysteresis. 3) If a pair of would-be edge walls are so thick as to impinge on each other then the actual ground state is one of saturation along the hard axis. An advantage of closed edges is the need for thicker and therefore fewer sublayers. A disadvantage of thicker sublayers is greater eddy currents. © 1990 IEEE",,"Data Storage, Magnetic; Magnetic Heads; Micromagnetics; Recording Heads; Magnetic Materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025490973

The investigated test specimens are solid, 99% pure n-eicosane paraffin, which are cast in place by using the conductivity cell as a mold. The conductivity is determined as a function of the mean temperature of the specimen, and its sensitivity to a number of parameters is investigated. These include the presence or absence of vacuum during casting, the rate of solidification during casting, the thermal contact between the conductivity cell walls and the test specimen, the temperature difference across the specimen, the experimental site, and the aging of the apparatus and the paraffin. In supplementary experiments, the density of the solid paraffin and its melting temperature are determined. For specimens cast without vacuum, the thermal conductivity is virtually independent of the specimen temperature and of the solidification rate.

A new model is presented which more realistically takes into account the complex physical structure of AC beds. An intraparticle microporosity as well as the classical interparticle macroporosity are treated.

This class of problem offers its particular challenges. The accurate computational simulation of conduction with thermally‐dependent properties requires a solution technique with good conservation properties. The boundary‐fitted co‐ordinates of an arbitrary solution domain typically yield grids which are non‐orthogonal and which, consequently, make energy conservation difficult to model. In the current article, a technique is described to simulate accurately the conduction heat transfer in materials of thermally‐dependent properties in irregular domains. The method combines boundary‐fitted co‐ordinates with the finite volume method, FVM, to produce a numerical technique which will accurately solve this non‐linear conduction problem using a grid which may be highly skewed. This capability is achieved through a unique treatment of the cross‐derivative terms that arise when the heat conduction equation is transformed to a non‐orthogonal grid. The cross‐derivative terms represent the non‐normal components of the heat fluxes into the skewed control volume. The tangent components of the heat fluxes are interpreted in a special way to produce finite difference expressions which accurately model the cross‐derivative partial. The numerical procedure is validated by comparing it against a purely analytical mathematical method. Although the numerical results have been obtained using a highly skewed grid, they exhibit close agreement with the analytically‐derived solution.

This method can represent the power losses between the generating units and the storage system, losses of the transmission network and the nonlinear production cost functions. The power system security is also incorporated in this method. For the sake of comparison, the problem is also solved by the DPF, and the results show that the proposed method is computationally efficient and is suitable for practical applications.",,"Energy storage; Mathematical programming, Dynamic; Cost Functions; Energy Interchange; Generalised Network Programming; Integrated Power Systems; Multiple Area Systems; Electric power systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025465269

Particularly important issues are the selection of a suitable energy source and the sensitivity of vehicle dimensional characteristics to mission requirements. This paper suggests a method of comparison based on an approximate but comprehensive approach, which refers to specific parameters derivable from known designs or literature. Specific energy and energy density of candidate systems are derived with due consideration to depth resistant vessels. The impact of the energy system choice is then highlighted, going beyond the simplistic comparison of the former parameters. A design model has been developed which allows quick sensitivity analyses and mass/volume breakdowns of alternative configurations under varying mission requirements; these are exemplified in the paper with reference to a design case. The procedure allows the correct specification of power, energy, surface-handling system for more detailed comparative analyses, given a common project goal and a basis for realistic cost comparison. The results show the wide difference in energy capacity of AUV’s complying with the same mission data, but equipped with different energy systems. Another conclusion is that rechargeable electric batteries, even of high energy density, imply unacceptably heavy vehicles for ranges around 1000 km unless very low drag characteristics are achieved. Closed-cycle diesel and fuel cell systems would instead allow the AUV mass to be kept below 10t. © 1990 IEEE","AUV; configuration analysis; energy systems; pressure vessels","Electric Batteries; Electric Power Supplies to Apparatus; Mathematical Techniques--Sensitivity Analysis; Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV); Configuration Analysis; Depth Resistant Vessels; Energy Storage Unit; Submersibles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025464371

This charge relaxation is governed by three characteristic times: τ (the relaxation time of the charged powder or liquid that governs decay of the initial volume charge within the material), τck1 (an extrinsic time constant dependent upon the vessel geometry that controls the redistribution and decay of surface charge at discontinuities), and τδ (the relaxation time associated with leakage of charge through the liner). The relative ordering of τ, τCK1, and τδ determines the time course of the charge redistribution and ultimate decay. In the case of thin insulative liners, the residence time for charge is dramatically increased, and the redistribution is seen to increase the fraction of electrostatic energy available for a discharge, leading to the possibility of greatly increased risk of ESD-induced dust or vapor ignition. In the present work, a simple model for the transient charge decay dynamics in lined vessels is presented. A simple canonical form is revealed for the extrinsic circuit time constant which may be used to estimate the time required for the decay of the charge accumulated on the liner. In addition, methods of calculating the time-dependent potential drop and capacitive energy per unit area of a vessel liner are presented. Such calculations provide the means to estimate time-dependent ignition hazard probabilities associated with energetic Lichtenberg and propagating brush discharges. © 1990 IEEE",,"Electrostatics; Relaxation Processes; Silos; Bulk Storage Operations; Electrostatic Discharge Hazards; Ignition Hazard Probabilities; Lined Vessels; Surface Charge Accumulation; Transient Charge Decay; Materials Handling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025463451

Comparison of the reaction rate data obtained by the pressure sweep method with the theoretical rate equations suggests that the hydriding rate-controlling step has changed from dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen molecules at the surface to hydrogen diffusion through the hydride phase with increasing hydriding fraction. This hydriding kinetic mechanism does not change during cycling. However, the intrinsic hydriding reaction rate of MmNi4.5Al0.5 after 5500 cycles increases significantly compared with that of the activated alloy. It is suggested that the change in the hydriding kinetic behaviour due to the intrinsic degradation of MmNi4.5Al0.5 can be explained by the formation of nickel clusters at the surface of the sample and the exchange of host metal atoms in the bulk by thermal cycling. © 1990.",,"Energy Storage - Materials; Hydrogen - Diffusion; Hydriding Rate; Hydrogen Storage; Misch Metal; Thermal Cycling; Rare earth compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025447109

The measurements were performed using thin, ultrahigh vacuum evaporated samples of magnesium covered with a thin palladium coating. Hydrogen uptake was measured by a piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance on which the samples were deposited. Sample purity was controlled by Auger electron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In a limited pressure-temperature regime, equilibrium can be established between H2 gas and magnesium at isothermal conditions. The experimental data in this region reveal several features not previously reported for the H-Mg system. In the α phase, fast kinetics and p1 2 dependence of the uptake at low hydrogen concentrations are followed by a stronger p dependence and accompanying slower kinetics at concentrations of about [H] [Mg] ≈ 0.01. The latter observation may indicate the onset of attractive H-H interaction at concentrations below the solvus. In the α + β phase, the absorption and decomposition isotherms (plateau pressures) are widely separated in pressure, i.e. large hysteresis effects are observed. The enthalpies of hydride formation and decomposition derived from the measured plateau pressures are 60.7 ± 6.3 kJ mol - 1 H2 and 71 ± 4.2 kJ mol - 1 H2 respectively. The measured decomposition plateau pressures agree well with extrapolations from reported high pressure measurements. The results obtained in this work are compared, whenever possible, with the available high temperature data for the H2-Mg system, and with other metal-hydrogen systems. © 1990.",,"Energy Storage; Hydrogen; Hysteresis; Pressure Effects; Thermodynamics; Absorption-Decomposition Isotherms; Decomposition Kinetics; Hydride Formation; Hydrogen Uptake Kinetics; Magnesium Hydrogen System; Palladium Coated Magnesium; Magnesium and Alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025430555

The heat transfer from the refrigerant loop to the hot water storage tank took place through a condenser of novel design integrated within the collector frame. The effect of the condenser inclination on the system efficiency was remarkable for natural circulation water flow but had no significant effect for forced circulation flow. The difference in thermal response between the refrigerant and water loops caused buildup of stored energy in the condenser. This energy affected the buoyancy forces and generated flow pulsation that caused a harmonic‐like variation of the system efficiency. This effect vanished with forced water circulation flow. The system efficiency varied between 20 and 50% depending on the solar insolation.

The purpose of this system was to provide the electrical energy to operate the space platform sensor subsystem. Because, at this time, the required power level range was fairly broad (e.g., 1 to 20 kWe) and the operating time periods very short (e.g. 1000 seconds continuous/1000 seconds intermittent) various candidate energy storage type power systems could be considered. This paper identifies seven (7) possible candidate systems and briefly describes the performance and operating characteristics. These systems were NiCd battery, NiH2 battery, NaS battery, LiSO2 Cl2 battery, LiAl-FeS2 battery, H2/02 fuel cell and inertial flywheel-generator. These systems encompassed a current or projected specific energy range of from 15.0 to 100 watt/hr/lb. While total mass was one of the most important system parameters, other criteria such as development risk, technology readiness and survivability/ hardness capability were equally important factors. Therefore, in order to arrive at a meaningful basis for comparison and to aid in system selection, a figure-of-merit (FOM) was established. Though somewhat qualitative in content, scoring weighting factors were utilized to further quantify the results. Using this approach, it was possible to arrive at the selection of a specific candidate power system. Finally, because these results are of a preliminary nature, the paper recommends extending these analyses to include reliability and cost factors. in addition, since integration of these candidate systems into the overall spacecraft can have a major impact on all the parameters considered, additional comprehensive analyses in this area was also strongly recommended. © 1990 IEEE",,"Electric Batteries; Electric Generator Motors, AC; Electric Generator Motors, DC; Fuel Cells--Electrolytes; Radar, Optical--Space Applications; Inertial Flywheel Generator; Laser Radar Sensor System; Nickel/Cadmium Battery System; Nickel/Hydrogen Battery System; Sodium/Sulfur Battery System; Electric Power Supplies to Apparatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025404154

The peak temperatures of the damping factor (tan δ) and the dynamic shear loss modulus (G″) were shifted by an amount which depended upon the quantity and type of filler added to each polymer. The temperatures corresponding to the step discontinuity of specific heat also shifted, but to a lesser extent than those measured mechanically. The degree of Tg shift per unit of volumetric filler addition increased with polymer pendant group polarity for both measurement methods. Utilizing a Tg‐crosslinking analogue, a model was developed that related positive Tg shifts to polymeric segmental adsorption onto filler surfaces. This model also incorporated negative contributions to the Tg shift from energy storage mechanisms arising from particle–particle interactions, as well as corrections due to effective surface area available for polymer adsorption.

However, various problems still exist. The main problems are device switching losses and electromagnetic interference (EMI) since the devices in the inverter operate in a force-commutated mode. To minimize these problems, this paper proposes a so-called parallei-resonant dc link (PRDCL) circuit topology as an interface between dc voltage supply and the inverter to provide a short zero voltage period in the dc link of the inverter to allow zero voltage switchings in the SMVC. The proposed circuit along with SMVC can compensate for leading and lagging displacement power factor with a high switching frequency at singificantly reduced switching losses. The new circuit is especially suitable for high power SMVC applications using GTOs or other gate turn-off devices. The proposed circuit is analyzed in detail and its operation principle is explained. Several design considerations are addressed and the design formulas are obtained.

The authors approached this question by studying 719 boys from worldwide populations with marked differences in long-term carbohydrate intake. Fasting serum triglycendes, total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations were measured in boys aged 8 and 9 years from 12 countries-eight in Europe, three in Africa, and one in Asia. A standardized protocol was used for obtaining tasting blood and for the preparation, storage and transport of serum, and all measurements were made in one laboratory. Published values were used for the United States. Mean values for lipid levels per country were compared with the percentage of daily energy intake consumed as carbohydrate or fat, as determined by survey. Boys from populations with higher carbohydrate and lower fat intake had lower low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (univariate regression coefficient (± standard error, -0.028 ± 0.009 mmol/liter for each percent of energy from carbohydrate; p < 0.01, n = 13), but they also had higher fasting triglycerides (0.010 ± 0.002 mmol/liter for each percent ofenergy from carbohydrate; p < 0.01, n = 13) and lower HDL cholesterol levels (-0.022 ± 0.003 mmol/liter for each percent of energy from carbohydrate; p < 0.001, n = 13). These trends agree with results from epidemiologic studies within populations and from controlled dietary trials, and suggest that in normolipidemic healthy subjects, high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets cause higher triglyceride levels than diets that are higher in fats and oils. © 1990 by The Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health.","Carbohydrates; Child; Fats; Lipoproteins, HDL; Lipoproteins, LDL; Triglycerides","cholesterol; high density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; Africa; article; Asia; blood; carbohydrate diet; child; comparative study; diet restriction; Europe; fat intake; feeding behavior; human; male; metabolism; Africa; Asia; Child; Cholesterol; Comparative Study; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Europe; Fasting; Food Habits; Human; Lipoproteins, HDL; Male; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025381744

The pesticides involved were the organochlorines, dieldrin and heptachlor. The problems were caused by the persistence of organochlorines in soils and their illicit use or contamination of storage facilities. Animals grazing contaminated pasture, ingesting contaminated feed or held in contaminated yards over a period, bioaccumulated residues in their adipose tissues which eventually exceeded maximum residue limits (MRL) and caused violations. Though there was no immediate public health risk, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) of the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE), acted expeditiously to determine and eliminate the factors causing these problems, which threatened Australia's beef export industry worth in excess of two billion dollars annually. An overall strategic plan, ""The Integrated Action Plan"", was formulated and implemented by AQIS with the assistance of the relevant Departments of the States and the Northern Territory (NT), meat processing and export industries and livestock producer bodies. As a result of this action, the likely sources of contamination were identified and controlled. The National Residue Survey (NRS) was enhanced, a National Residue Data Base (NRDB) was established and a centralised computer system interactive with abattoirs, laboratories and animal health authorities developed. The cattle farm identity tail tag system already in place, capable of tracing cattle to the farm of origin was refined and trace back systems for sheep and pigs were utilised.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,"dieldrin; heptachlor; pesticide residue; animal; article; Australia; food contamination; meat; soil pollutant; Animals; Australia; Dieldrin; Food Contamination; Heptachlor; Meat; Pesticide Residues; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025379624

Individual fibers were investigated to determine whether fibers of all types were completely devoid of glycogen phosphorylase activity and whether the involved fibers might be biochemically altered in a fiber type dependent manner to enhance the energy‐generating capabilities of the cells through other metabolic pathways. Using highly sensitive biochemical assays, a complete absence of glycogen phosphorylase, a and b, activity was found in fibers of all types in the McArdle's patients. Levels of enzymes representing glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and high energy phosphate metabolism were essentially normal in each fiber type, indicating an apparent lack in metabolic adaptation of these energy pathways to the absence of fatty acids (β‐hydrosyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, βOAC) was elevated in all patients, and substantially in 4 of the 5. This suggested that lipid substrates can provide support for oxidative endurance capacity in some patients. Individual fiber analysises indicated that the compensation involved fibers of all types.

To examine the short term actions of GH on glucose turnover, fuel oxidation and regional forearm metabolism, six normal volunteers were each studied twice for 5.5 h after having received a 4-h infusion of GH (20 ng/kgA min) or saline. GH induced slightly falling plasma glucose levels, acute 40–50% decreases in forearm glucose uptake, and no change in glucose turnover. Furthermore, substantial increases in circulating concentrations and forearm uptake of nonesterified fatty acids and 3-hydroxybutyrate were recorded. Although GH infusion was followed by a 50% reduction of forearm alanine release hepatic nitrogen excretion seemed unaffected. Energy expenditure was not influenced by GH, but the nonprotein respiratory exchange ratio decreased from a basal value of 0.778 ± 0.008 to 0.732 ± 0.007 after GH treatment (P < 0.05). Correspondingly, lipid oxidation increased from 1.20 ± 0.06 to 1.48 ± 0.09 mg/kgA min, and glucose oxidation decreased from 0.97 ± 0.12 to 0.39 ± 0.06 mg/kgA min (P < 0.05). Nonoxidative glucose utilization tended to increase. These data indicate that GH, by promoting lipid utilization and decreasing glucose oxidation, diminishes the need for gluconeogenesis and, therefore, could be protein preserving in the long term. Overall, we found no evidence of GH having acute insulin-like effects on glucose metabolism. GH appears to increase glucose storage, leaving total energy expenditure unaffected. © 1990 by The Endocrine Society.",,"glucose; growth hormone; human growth hormone; adult; article; forearm; glucose metabolism; glucose oxidation; human; human experiment; intravenous drug administration; lipid metabolism; male; normal human; priority journal; 3-Hydroxybutyric Acid; Adult; Alanine; Blood Glucose; Calorimetry, Indirect; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Forearm; Gluconeogenesis; Glucose; Glycerol; Growth Hormone; Human; Hydroxybutyrates; Infusions, Intravenous; Liver; Male; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025361468

All livers that received initial arterialization showed uniform diffuse perfusion, whereas those with initial portal perfusion were patchy and well perfused only in the right lobe. In the experimental animal, initial arterialization using an end‐to‐end method was much casier and required less retraction. The energy charge and ATP levels dropped sharply during brief warm ischemia but returned rapidly to normal on revascularization. Although the decline in energy charge was less in stored livers, the return to normal was slower and incomplete. Plasma levels of AST indicated much greater damage in the stored livers and were lowest in recipients in unstored livers that were arterialized first. After longer warm ischemia, energy charge values declined and only completely returned to 60% of preoperative values within 2 hr of grafting. Despite this, the survival rate of these animals was very poor and only one survived overnight. Seven of the 12 survived the procedure, but in five death occurred within 30 min of full revascularization. In this group, AST levels rose sharply after revascularization to a mean level of 1,000 U. The resutls suggest that while initial arterizlization is beneficial if brief warm ischemia has occurred, it has no advantages other than improved subjective appearance of the liver and ease of performance after a 4‐hr period of cold storage. Neither order of revascularization reversed the damage caused by 1 hr definitive warm ischemia. Although the advantages were limited, there were no appearent detrimental effects of primary arterialization and thus this order could be undertaken if so desired.(HEPATOLOGY 1990;11:471–476.)

Reperfusion began after 15-, 25-, or 60-min ischemia at 37°C. After 60-min ischemia, reperfusion at pH 6.4 or 6.6 attenuated the reperfusion-induced Ca gain so long as the acidotic conditions were maintained (3.08 ± 0.22, 1.37 ± 0.41, and 16.96 ± 1.18 μmol Ca gain/g dry wt for pH 6.4, 6.6, and 7.4, respectively after 15-min reperfusion). Conversely, reperfusion under alkalotic conditions (pH 7.9) after 60-min ischemia exacerbated the gain (27.45 ± 4.75 and 8.92 ± 1.53 μmol Ca gain/g dry wt during 5-min reperfusion at pH 7.9 and 7.4, respectively). Similar, but less pronounced Ca gains occurred during reperfusion after 15- or 25-min ischemia. Sodium content during reperfusion, but not during aerobic perfusion, was also found to be pH sensitive with acidosis causing a reduction and alkalosis an increase. These results could not be explained in terms of an effect of pH on recovery of high-energy phosphates, percentage 'reflow' during reperfusion, or reperfusion-induced increases in tissue water or resting tension. The results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the 'inhibitor' effect of acidosis on postischemic Ca overload could involve an effect of pH on the Na+-H+ exchanger and intracellular Ca storage.","calcium ion overload; hydrogen ions; ischemia; reperfusion injury; sodium-hydrogen ion exchanger","acidosis; alkalosis; animal cell; article; calcium cell level; calcium transport; female; heart; ischemia; metabolism; nonhuman; organ culture; pH; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025347194

Body fat and fat-free dry mass of fa/fa and Fa/- littermates differed at 21 but not at 16 days of age. The excess energy deposited as fat was partly derived from decreased nonthermoregulatory energy expenditure and decreased synthesis of lean body mass. Calculations support the speculation that a greater extraction of energy from the synthetic diet additionally supports the excess fat deposition. Decreased thermoregulatory thermogenesis and excess fat storage appear to be secondary and independent consequences of the primary genetic lesion.","artificial rearing; brown adipose tissue; development; newborn animals","animal experiment; animal model; article; brown adipose tissue; newborn; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; rat; thermogenesis; thermoregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025333344

The relationship between in vivo behavior and in vitro characteristics of 59 platelet concentrates (PC) stored for up to 14 days in a synthetic medium or in CPDA‐1 plasma was systematically investigated. 25 paired studies (1 study was incomplete) were performed comparing platelets suspended either in the synthetic medium or CPDA‐1 plasma with 5 days (n = 5); 7 days (n = 10); 10 days (n = 5); and 14 days (n = 5) of storage. In addition, 10 control studies were performed with freshly prepared PC (6–24 h) in CPDA‐1 plasma. Both percent recovery and survival estimations showed decreases with increasing storage duration, irrespective of storage medium used. In both media, with prolonged storage, the platelet survival curves not only became shorter, but also increasingly exponential, suggesting that in vitro storage caused progressive damage to the platelets present in circulation. Survival curves of platelets suspended in synthetic medium remained more linear, indicative of less random damage during storage. Mean population lifespan (MPL) of the stored PC was determined by the area below the survival curve divided by the mean percent recovery for the fresh PC, which was 55%. MPL decreased from 4.5 days (fresh PC) to 0.4 days after 14 days of storage in plasma, with a 50% reduction (t½) estimated at 7.2 days of storage. MPL t½ for PC stored in the synthetic medium was estimated to be 8.8 days. The decrease in in vivo viability with prolonged storage was paralleled with loss of energy‐dependent in vitro parameters such as hypotonic shock response, shape change with ADP, and ATP levels, and with increased lactate levels. Although the length of the storage period was shown to be the major factor responsible for the variability in MPL observed in this study, multiple linear‐regression analysis showed also that platelet discoid shape, as measured by the shape change, and lactate production were independent in vitro parameters with significant predictability of the in vivo viability. Combined with days of storage in the regression equation, these parameters were found to ‘explain’ 78% of the variability of the MPL found in this study. © 1990 S.

Nonetheless, our current understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the regulation and subordination of protein synthesis to the overall metabolic and stimulus-response status of the cell is inadequate. The endoplasmic reticulum is central to these concerns. Potential roles of the endoplasmic reticulum in the regulation of protein synthesis are largely unexplored. We have attempted in this rather speculative review, based largely on our own data, to project a view of the endoplasmic reticulum as moderating the rate of translation through a mechanism sensitive to sequestered Ca2+. Compensatory routes whereby cells accommodate to Ca2+ deprivation so as to resume reasonable rates of protein synthesis are seen also to focus on the endoplasmic reticulum. With additional research, the underlying relationships that exist among reticular Ca2+ storage, protein processing, and mechanisms of translational control should become more broadly evident. The prevailing view of Ca2+ as a regulator of cytosolic processes may require some extension if sequestered Ca2+ participates in biological control mechanisms emanating from the endoplasmic reticulum. In effect, a reciprocal relationship would presumably exist among processes supported by cytosolic free Ca2+ vs those promoted by sequestered stores of the cation. Speculatively, such reciprocity would allow the rapid diversion of energy from one set of processes to the other. Conceivably, chronic Ca2+ loading at sequestered sites may be related to certain cellular adaptive Ca2+ loading involving tissue hypertrophy. Potential examples of stretch-induced responses that could be cited include thickening of arteriolar smooth muscle walls in hypertensive and cardiac hypertrophy in aortic stenosis.","BiP/GRP78; endoplasmic reticulum; GH3 pituitary cells; mRNA translation; phorbol ester","angiotensin; calcimycin; calcium; cyclic AMP; egtazic acid; ionomycin; phorbol ester; protirelin; vasopressin; adenohypophysis; animal cell; calcium cell level; cell culture; endoplasmic reticulum; nonhuman; priority journal; protein synthesis; rat; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025326163

They therefore are an ideal model to learn about the metabolic adaptations which develop during endurance exercise leading to glycogen depletion. This review summarizes the current knowledge of ammonia and amino acid metabolism in these patients and also several new data. During incremental exercise tests in patients with McArdle's disease, forearm venous plasma ammonia concentration rises to a value between 200 and 500 μM. Femoral arteriovenous difference studies show that muscle produces the ammonia. The leg release of both ammonia and glutamine (inμmol/min) has been estimated to be five-to tenfold larger in one of these patients than in healthy individuals exercising at comparable relative work load. Patients with McArdle's disease have a larger uptake of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) by exercising leg muscles and show a more rapid activation of the muscle branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex, a key enzyme in the degradation of the BCAA. In general, supplements of BCAA taken before the exercise test lead to a deterioration of exercise performance and a higher increase in heart rate and plasma ammonia during exercise, whereas supplements of branched-chain 2-oxo acid improve exercise performance and lead to a smaller increase in heart rate and plasma ammonia. At constant power output, patients with Mcardle's disease show a rapid increase in heart rate and exertion perceived in the exercising muscles, which peak within 10 min after the start of exercise and then fall again ('second wind'). Peak heart rate and peak exertion coincide with a peak in plasma ammonia. Ammonia production during exercise in these patients is estimated to exceed the reported breakdown of ATP to IMP and therefore most likely originates from the metabolism of amino acids. Deamination of amino acids via the reactions for the purine nucleotide cycle and glutamate dehydrogenase are possible pathways. Deamimation of glutamine, released by muscle, by glutaminase present in the endothelial cells of the vascular system may also constribute to the ammonia production. The observations made in these patients have led to the hypothesis that excessive acceleration of the metabolism of BCAA drains 2-oxoglutarate in the primary aminotransferase reaction and thus reduces flux in the citric acid cycle and impedes aerobic oxidation of glucose and fatty acids. This draining effect is normally counteracted by the anaplerotic conversion of muscle glycogen to citric acid cycle intermediates, a reaction which is severely hampered in these patients due to the glycogen breakdown defect. Deanimation of amino acids is required then to regenerate 2-oxoglutarate, but inevitably leads to ammonia generation. It is suggested that similar metabolic adaptations may occur in healthy individuals during prolonged exhaustive exercise leading to glycogen depletion.",,"ammonia; branched chain amino acid; glutamate dehydrogenase; purine nucleotide; adult; clinical article; endurance; exercise; glycogen muscle level; glycogen storage disease type 5; human; human experiment; male; muscle fatigue; muscle metabolism; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025309167

Three cellular populations encompass the yolk mass during dispersion, namely, 1) the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) or periblast, which lies directly over the surface of the yolk; 2) the deep blastomeres of the blastoderm, which engage in morphogenetic movements on the surface of the YSL and beneath the enveloping layer prior to forming the future embryo; and 3) the enveloping layer (EVL) of the blastoderm, which is a cohesive epithelium that forms the outermost cell layer of the blastoderm. Deep blastomeres contain numerous mitochondria and scattered glycogen rosettes that appear to function in the utilization of energy reserves. These cells also possess surface extensions such as filopodia and ruffles. Numerous microfilaments running parallel to the plasma membrane occur in cell extensions and in the cortical cytoplasm of neighboring blastomeres. In bleb‐like extensions such as ruffles, microfilamentous stress fibers run parallel to the plane of the plasma membrane and prevent cellular organelles from entering the hyaline cap of the ruffle. Deep blastomeres also have basal projections that contain glycogen as well as pits in the basal membrane. Blastomeres move about using the YSL as a substrate. The YSL possesses specializations for nutrient uptake, storage, and transport such as numerous multivesicular bodies and large amounts of glycogen. Glycogen, in the rosette form, occurs in extraordinary amounts, virtually occluding the cytoplasm. Glycogen reserves are postulated to serve as an energy source during diapause. Glycogen is sometimes contained within villous projections that extend from the apical surface of the YSL. This configuration suggests the possibility of glycogen transport to the overlying deep blastomeres. Specializations of the EVL include apical tight junctions and basal lateral zonulae adherentes that interdigitate with those of adjacent EVL cells. The EVL serves as an impermeable membrane that protects the developing egg from the vicissitudes of its environment.

Thereafter they were randomly attached to one of the following groups. Group I: reperfusion with whole blood (n = 6), group II: reperfusion with low-leukocyte blood (n = 6), group III: reperfusion with low-leukocyte blood plus phenyl-isopropyl adenosine (PIA) (n = 6). Hearts in group I showed an increase of high energy phosphates (HEP) within the first 30 minutes, and a significant decrease during the subsequent 30 minutes. Concomitantly the initially soft hearts turned into stone hearts. In group II and III a significant increase of HEP was seen during the entire reperfusion. After 60 minutes of reperfusion myocardial ATP levels in group III were significantly higher than in group I. All hearts in group III were soft after reperfusion.

When submaximal treadmill exercise continues long enough, body temperature stops changing, S becomes zero, and the heat storage term is dropped from equation 1. For uphill walking the equation becomes 2) M = ∑Q + Wvert, and for downhill walking it becomes 3) M = ∑Q −Wvert. This study tested the energy balance equations with direct measurements of heat exchange using a suit calorimeter and M from standard measurements of respiratory gas exchange. Ten healthy men walked on a motor driven treadmill at 1.5 m·s−1 at grades of 0, 5, 10, −5, and −10% for 70-90 min to ensure a thermal steady state. As expected, +Wvert was identified as a power output, whereas −Wvert was accounted for as a power input, totally transformed to heat in the downhill walking subject. There also appeared to be a quantity of non-thermal energy, Wwalk, needed to satisfy the energy balance equation. This was significant at 0, 5, and 10% grades (P < 0.01) but not significant at −5 and −10% grades (P > 0.05). The data confirm previous results for level walking and extend them to include uphill walking. While it had been suggested that Wwalk represents an externalization of energy at the foot, the present data suggest an alternative explanation. With the positive phase of the walk cycle, the center of mass is displaced against gravity, causing an externalization of a fraction of metabolic energy which is not precisely balanced by energy internalized as heat occurring during the negative phase of the walk cycle. © 1990 by the American College of Sports Medicine.","Human calorimetry; Human energy expenditure; Power","adult; article; calorimetry; energy expenditure; exercise; human; human experiment; male; normal human; priority journal; walking; Calorimetry; Energy Metabolism; Exercise Test; Exertion; Human; Male; Movement; Oxygen Consumption; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025291950

A close simulation of marasmic- kwashiorkor syndrome was obtained in the experimental group. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated, and the functional and structural integrity was determined using biochemical standard parameters. Results show that the respiratory control ratio (RCR) is reduced by 50% in the experimental group, using any of the pyruvate/malate, β-hydroxybutyrate or succinate as substrate. The effects of storage at 0°C were more pronounced in mitochondria from protein-depleted rats as these mitochondria are more leaky to protons (H+); hence they are defective in carrying out chemiosmotic oxidative phosphorylation. There is a drastic reduction in the basal ATPase and cytochrome oxidase activities with low ATP production and a decline in energy expenditure.

The mean contents of P, F, C, and energy (E, calculated from P, F, and C) were 9.0 g/L, 39.0 g/L, 71.9 g/L, and 696 kcal/L, respectively. There was a large variation in the concentration of energy-yielding macronutrients. The contents of P, F, C, and E in the samples with the highest values (97.5 percentile) were 2.3-, 4.8-, 1.2-, and 2.3-fold, respectively, above the contents in the samples with the lowest values (2.5 percentile). The P content decreased exponentially during the 1st 8 months, followed by an increase during the following months. The F content decreased during the 1st 4 months, followed by an almost linear increase. The possible influence of different maternal characteristics on the macronutrient content of the milk was examined. The main results were as follows: the P and F contents increased slightly with increasing body mass index of the mother, the P content decreased with increasing amounts of milk delivered to the milk bank, and the F content was higher in mothers delivering large amounts of milk. By selecting incoming milk with a high P content, we have developed a “high-protein” milk with a P content of about 12 g/L (true protein) and an E content of about 725 kcal/L. Thus, by continuous monitoring of macronutrient content in human bank milk it is possible to develop a “high-protein” milk with sufficient P and E content to cover the needs of preterm infants with very low birth weights (<1,500 g). © 1990 Raven Press Ltd, New York.","Carbohydrate; Fat; Human milk; Milk bank; Preterm infants; Protein","carbohydrate; fat; protein; article; breast milk; food storage; human; human cell; milk level; monitoring; nutrient; priority journal; Adult; Carbohydrates; Fatty Acids; Female; Human; Infant Nutrition; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Milk Proteins; Milk, Human; Nutritive Value; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025284499

Of the reversible metal‐hydride–metal systems, the MgH2Mg system is particularly attractive as a hydrogen and a high‐temperature heat storage material because of its high hydrogen content and the high energy content of the Mg–H bond. The advances made in this area over the past few years, namely in catalytic hydrogenation and the doping of magnesium powders, have led to the development of “active MgH2Mg systems” for energy storage. The first experimental results on high‐temperature heat storage (also with cooling) by coupling a MgH2Mg storage system with a low‐temperature metal hydride storage system are presented.

The platelets were prepared from buffy coats in PVC/DEHP bags and stored for 7 days at room temperature at a concentration of 1.0 x 109/ml with horizontal agitation. The total amount of ATP and ADP decreased with 40% during this storage. This decrease correlated with the disc-to-sphere transformation associated with the loss of platelet viability. During storage, the ability to incorporate 3H-adenosine into metabolic ATP and ADP (45 min at 37°Cc) decreased with 50%. Via measurement of the specific activity of actin-bound ADP and the amount of incorporated radioactivity into total ATP and ADP, we calculated the content of the metabolic and storage pools of ATP and ADP. The results indicate that the decrease in adenine nucleotide levels during storage was mainly caused by a depletion of ATP and ADP from the storage pool, whereas the metabolic pool remained nearly intact. After 7 days, the ATP : ADP ratio of the storage pool had decreased from 1.0 to 0.3, indicating hydrolysis of ATP. Diadenosine-triphosphate and diadenosine-tetraphosphate (present in the storage pool) decreased with only 30%, and the serotonin content remained nearly constant. Therefore, it is unlikely that the storage pool was completely secreted. Probably, the storage pool of nucleotides serves as an internal supply for maintaining the contents of the metabolic pool of ATP and ADP during storage of platelets.",,"adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; nucleotide; article; cell culture; cell storage; human; metabolism; priority journal; storage; thrombocyte",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025265467

Autoxidation was interpreted as a first order kinetic reaction. Storage temperature effect on kinetic and equilibrium constants was analyzed; reaction enthalpy and activation energy were calculated. MbO2 and MetMb production during beef oxygenation was represented as a consecutive first order reaction system determining previous vacuum storage time and temperature influence on oxygenation capacity. Vacuum packaging of frozen beef increased color stability maintaining MetMb concentration levels lower than those corresponding to just frozen samples wrapped in polyethylene.

Possible technical solutions will be presented concerning storage of the solid propellant and propulsion systems, which was studied with and without air augmentation due to noise limitations and power requirements. A parametric system analysis was made, based on a computer simulation model, which led to the calculation of reference launchers. The computed results of reference launchers, based on todays technology, show that they won't be competitive to launch systems in service due to very high structural respectively tank masses required to guarantee storage conditions of temperatures near 0.1 k, although high specific impulses are realizable. However, future operations of monatomic hydrogen propulsion systems, especially those using air augmentation, are imaginable if technological improvements will take place as a result of considerable research efforts in the direction of structure mass savings. © 1990.",,"Hydrogen; Propellants; Launchers; Monatomic Hydrogen; Propulsion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025254861

Specifically, consideration is given to the rectangular cavity with inside dimensions of 100 × 60 × 50mm. The vertical side walls and bottom temperature of this cavity are maintained constant by heating the circulated water flow. The other surfaces are subjected to an adiabatic condition. Based on observation of the melting phenomena and data obtained, a theoretical model is developed and its solution is derived analytically. The time-dependent, solid-liquid interface contour is measured photographically during the melting process. According to the shadowgraph technique, the maximum displacement on the screen represents the temperature gradient. This temperature gradient on the wall is measured by the shadowgraph method, which results in calculation of heat transfer coefficients. The scale analysis method is used to find the functional dependence of the dimensionless parameters, providing a reference frame for data reduction. The theoretical prediction is compared with experimental data and an excellent agreement is obtained.

By performing a recursive preprocessing step in the space domain before transforming, edge discontinuities are reduced so that energy packing efficiency can be higher.

During use, the transport incubator has to frequently rely for its energy supply solely upon the storage capacity of a 'built-in' electric battery, which is the principal inhibiting factor limiting the available performance and duration of operation. During the present study of the environmental and engineering factors which affect the performances of such transport incubators, carried out for Air-Shields Vickers plc, consideration has been given to the use of two technologies to seek to improve both the quality of the artificially created internal environment in the incubator and the duration of operation independent of external electricity supplies. In particular, consideration has focused upon two possibilities: 1. 1. The use of a thermoelectric heat-pump (a) as a substitute for the conventional resistance heater within the incubator, so that the utilisation of the existing electric-battery charge would thereby be enhanced; and (b) to provide active refrigeration within the incubator without incurring the problems of noise and vibration normally associated with the presence of a compressor refrigerator. 2. 2. The potential for stored thermal energy to augment the energy-storage capacity of the electric battery. It has been shown that the use of a thermoelectric heat-pump can approximately triple the duration of use per electric-battery charge, as well as provide refrigeration cooling without incurring a significant weight penalty. The cost of the thermoelectric heat-pump is less than the additional expense incurred for the larger battery, which would otherwise be necessary to achieve the required operational duration.

At birth the digital flexor and extensor tendons of pigs have identical mechanical properties, exhibiting higher extensibility and mechanical hysteresis and lower elastic modulus, tensile strength, and elastic energy storage capability than adult tendons. With growth and aging these tendons become much stronger, stiffer, less extensible, and more resilient than at birth. Furthermore, these alterations in elastic properties occur to a significantly greater degree in the high-load-bearing flexors than in the low-stress extensors. At maturity the pig digital flexor tendons have twice the tensile strength and elastic modulus but only half the strain energy dissipation of the corresponding extensor tendons. A morphometric analysis of the digital muscles provides an estimate of maximal in vivo tendon stresses and suggests that the muscle-tendon unit of the digital flexor is designed to function as an elastic energy storage element whereas that of the digital extensor is not. thus the differences in material properties between mature flexor and extensor tendons are correlated with their physiological functions, i.e., the flexor is much better suited to act as an effective biological spring than is the extensor.","digital tendon; extensor; flexor; hysteresis; mechanical properties; modulus of elasticity; strain energy","age; aging; animal cell; article; biomechanics; energy expenditure; measurement; methodology; muscle elasticity; muscle mechanics; muscle stiffness; nonhuman; priority journal; swine; tendon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025215287

Using this technique, frequency-domain finite-difference solutions accurate for propagation angles out to 60° are readily generated for both 2-D and 3-D models. Solutions for 3-D problems are computed by applying the 2-D paraxial operators twice at each extrapolation step. The azimuthal anisotropy is essentially eliminated by adding a phase-correction operator to the extrapolation system. For heterogeneous models, scattering effects are incorporated by determining transmission and reflection coefficients at structural boundaries within the media. The chief advantages of the paraxial approach are that 1) active storage is reduced, 2) the decomposition in frequency allows the technique to be implemented on highly parallel machines, 3) attenuation can be modeled as an arbitrary function of frequency, and 4) only a small number of frequencies are needed to produce time slices. -from Authors",,"finite difference; paraxial extrapolator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025209505

The model is based on a subdivision of the basin into elevation bands. The energy input into the snowpack is computed by the energy-balance approach, using physically based preset parameters. The internal processes are parameterized by introducing heat and water storage capacities. The state of the snow cover throughout the basin is charactacterized by distinguishing three zones with different melt and drainage conditions. The lowest zone is saturated and runoff-producing. Above it, there is a transition zone of partly soaked snow. In the uppermost portion of the basin, no liquid water is stored in the snow. Snow line, saturation line and dry-snow line form the boundaries between the respective zones. Time variations of snow cover conditions are described by the altitudinal fluctuations of the lines. In performing simulation runs, the three boundary lines are found to follow different patterns during a six-day test period. Due to the prevailing melt conditions, the snow line rises monotonically and is only slightly influenced by different weather conditions. The saturation line and consequently the band width of the soaked zone, however, are controlled by day-to-day and diurnal changes in meteorological variables and exhibit a significant increase on rainy days and pronounced fluctuations during fair weather. The dry-snow line shows minor fluctuations. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the influence of model parameters on simulated melt rates is moderate or small when simulation periods of several days are considered so that parameters may be pre-set without inducing much additional uncertainty. The influence of model parameters on simulated melt and dynamics of basin snow cover conditions is discussed. The snowmelt routine was developed with the intention of starting it during the ablation period. Thus, initial conditions for the above mentioned boundary lines are required. Based on sensitivity analyses, it is found that the elevation of the snowline must be derived from current observations. For saturation line and dry-snow line, simple relations to air temperature are given.

Near the ground, the growth of the internal boundary layer is controlled by friction velocity in accordance with surface layer theory. Farther downwind, the growth is determined by the atmospheric stability and friction velocity within the internal boundary layer, and the temperature gradient in the air above. the wind profile inside the internal boundary layer is assumed to follow Obukhov similarity theory. an expression for the strength of the inversion that caps the layer is derived and used in the model. A comparison is carried out with independent experimental observations of internal boundary layer growth in the sea‐land transition.

As the layer grows, the importance of the Zilitinkevich correction diminishes. Then mechanical turbulence dominates the growth process until the internal boundary layer has reached a height of approximately −1.4L. Further growth is controlled mainly by convective turbulence. Conditions of high wind speed and large values of the potential temperature gradient over water result in a deep zone where the growth of the internal boundary layer is controlled by mechanical turbulence. With near‐zero potential temperature gradient over water, the zone becomes shallow and may vanish.

The in-situ Testing Program is aimed at the total repository system, emphasizing the concepts of waste confinement and isolation. The three technical areas-Thermal/Structural Interactions (TSI), Waste Package Performance (WPP), and Plugging and Sealing (P&S)-together respond to the many issues associated with these concepts.

Using in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the metabolic effects of the gerbil model of transient bilateral carotid artery occlusion were quantified. By examining the changes in the inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphocreatine (PCr) and β-ATP peaks, the PCr/Pi ratio, the PCr/β-ATP ratio and intracellular pH (pHi) before, during and after an ischaemic insult were calculated. Preischaemic values for these parameters were: PCr/Pi = 2.466 ± 0.130, PCr/β-ATP = 1.691 ± 0.053, pHi = 7.112 ± 0.021. By the end of 20 min of global ischaemia, the PCr and β-ATP peaks fell to levels similar to background in most animals. Calculated values were: PCr/Pi = 0.488 ± 0.126, PCr/β-ATP = 1.833 ± 0.179, pHi = 6.551 ± 0.258. With reperfusion, PCr/Pi increased rapidly back towards preischaemic levels but pHi improvement was delayed 10 min after that of PCr/Pi. By 1 h of reperfusion, both PCr/Pi and pHi were statistically equivalent to preischaemic values. During ischaemia, ATP was lost more rapidly than the storage form, PCr, but recovery of both was parallel. This suggested an intact ability to store such energy. These data indicate that the gerbil brain recovers normal high energy phosphate levels within an hour following a 20 min ischaemic insult, but that initial reperfusion does not immediately correct intracellular acidosis.

Untreated PSII membrane preparations exhibit a multiline EPR signal assigned to a manganese cluster and associated with the S2 state when illuminated at 195 K, or at 273 K in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,l-dimethylurea (DCMU). We used the extent of suppression of the multiline EPR signal observed in samples illuminated at 195 K to determine the fraction of PSII reaction centers set back to a hydroxylamine-induced S0-like state, which we designate S0*. The manganese K-edge X-ray absorption edges for dark-adapted PSII preparations with or without hydroxylamine are virtually identical. This indicates that, despite its high binding affinity to the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in the dark, hydroxylamine does not reduce chemically the manganese cluster within the OEC in the dark. After a single turnover of PSII, a shift to lower energy is observed in the inflection of the Mn K-edge of the manganese cluster. We conclude that, in the presence of hydroxylamine, illumination causes a reduction of the OEC, resulting in a state resembling S0. This lower Mn K-edge energy of S0*, relative to the edge of S1, implies the storage and stabilization of an oxidative equivalent within the manganese cluster during the S0 → S1 state transition. An analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of the S0* state indicates that a significant structural rearrangement occurs between the S0* and S1 states. The X-ray absorption edge position and the structure of the manganese cluster in the S0* state are indicative of a heterogeneous mixture of formal valences of manganese including one Mn(II) which is not present in the S1 state. © 1990, American Chemical Society.

A ninth reactor, the N Reactor, was constructed between 1959 and 1963 and was operated between 1963 and 1988 for the dual purposes of producing both steam for electric power generation and plutonium for use in weapons. The N Reactor has been shut down, but it is available for operation and is therefore outside the scope of the decommissioning EIS. Because both elemental lead (defined as a hazardous waste when it is considered to be a waste) and radionuclides exist in the reactors and because overlapping environmental laws and regulations exist, the potential arises for multiple regulation of the ultimate disposal of the reactors. This multiple regulation includes both federal and state agencies and federal and state regulations. The two major federal environmental laws are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which regulates the treatment, storage, and disposal of existing and newly created wastes, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which regulates previously disposed wastes. The major state environmental regulations are the Washington State Dangerous Waste Regulations. The two major environmental agencies involved are the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Washington State Department of Ecology (WDOE). The situation is not unique, but it is one that can require early and continuous communication among the regulators and the regulatee to resolve the issues.

Nodule detection primarily depends on contrast resolution. Unfortunately, contrast resolution in conventional chest radiography is limited because of scattered radiation and the wide range of densities that must be encompassed by the receptor (film), which has limited latitude. Several interrelated new techniques have emerged that can potentially improve contrast resolution and thus nodule detection. These techniques include 1) photostimulable storage phosphor technology, also known as computed radiology; 2) dual-energy subtraction radiography [DESR]; 3) computerized equalization radiography [CER]; 4) post-acquisition digital image processing; and 5) computerized automated nodule detection. Computed tomographic scanning is not only the standard for detecting and characterizing nodules within the lung (Lee et al. eds., in Computed Tomography of the Body with MRI Correlation, Raven Press, 1989, pp 321-333), but also provides information about the mediastinum, hila, and thoracic wall that often cannot be obtained from projection radiography. In a patient with a known malignancy, a highly sensitive technique is needed, and CT scanning is commonly used for the staging, follow-up, and detection of pulmonary metastases. CT scanning's drawbacks with respect to conventional radiography are that it is more expensive and time-consuming. The situation is different if the patient being screened does not have a known tumor. In this case, the pretest probability of pathology is low, and the risk of additional radiation may outweigh the potential benefits of early nodule detection. The key requirement then for a new technique to be useful is not that it be the most sensitive test for detecting a pulmonary nodule (currently CT scanning), but rather that it improve or replace conventional chest radiography as a screening examination for detecting an asymptomatic nodule. The new technology must meet certain criteria: it should be cost-effective and convenient to use; provide images within an acceptable period of time; not interfere with other radiographic tasks, eg, detecting interstitial lung disease or pneumothorax; and not substantially increase radiation dose to the patient.",,"classification; computer analysis; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic imaging; human; image processing; lung nodule; methodology; short survey; Coin Lesion, Pulmonary; Human; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025182159

Energy balance during a 25-d refeeding period was assessed in rats that had been food restricted (at 50% of normal intake) for either 30 or 10 d. Relative to weight-matched controls (with comparable lean tissue mass and similar food intake), refeeding following both periods of low food consumption (30 or 10 d) was associated with a 10% reduction in energy expenditure (p < 0.001). Analysis of body composition revealed that virtually all the energy saved as a result of this metabolic (as opposed to tissue mass) adaptation was deposited as fat rather than protein. After the energy cost for depositing the extra fat is accounted for, the metabolic component represents a net 15% lower energy expenditure when normal food intake is resumed. These adaptative changes in energy expenditure may thus constitute an important mechanism for the rapid replenishment of energy stores in preparation for recurrng food shortages and may also underlie the ease with which the obese condition is rapidly reachieved after weight loss.","energy expenditure; fat; low-calorie-diet; obesity; rats; thermogenesis; undernutrition","animal experiment; article; energy expenditure; low calory diet; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; rat; thrombogenesis; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025171248

The mechanism of toughness improvement by the diminution of P component was examined by mechanical tests, microstructure observation and computer simulation of the grain boundary segregation. The critical CTOD value and Charpy absorbed energy in the base metal showed remarkable deterioration as increasing P content, when the cooling rate after tempering was lower than 1 × 10−2 K/s. Simulated bonds showed reduction of toughness when the P level was higher than 0.008 % and/or the cooling rate after post weld heat treatment (PWHT) was lower than 1 × 10-2 K/s. The Charpy absorbed energy of base metal was higher than that of PWHT welded joint when they showed the same critical CTOD value. Intergranular ductile fracture was occurred in the base metal, while intergranular brittle fracture in PWHT welded joint was observed. The effect of cooling rate following the tempering on the grain boundary segregation of P was estimated by computer simulation, based on Guttmann-McLean theory. The computed amount of P segregation in grain boundary was closely related to the toughness both for a base metal and a simulated bond. It was also suggested that when the grain boundary segregation of P was lower than 0.1,high toughness level was obtained in the base metal and the simulated bond. The difference of toughness between the base metal and the simulated bond was attributed to the coarsening of grain size by the welding thermal cycle. The 9 % Ni steel with P level lower than 0.005 % shows excellent toughness in the base metal and the welded joint. © 1990, The Iron and Steel Institute of Japan.

This stimulation is due to excessive concentrations of catecholamines within the underperfused myocardium, in combination with enhanced myocyte sensitivity to adrenergic stimuli. Various mechanisms may account for local accumulation of catecholamines in the extracellular space of the ischemic but still viable myocardium. In early myocardial infarction, plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations are enhanced, reflecting increased activity of the whole sympathetic nervous system, rather than local activity in the heart. In uncomplicated infarction, these concentrations are only five times the normal levels at rest, and there are no convincing data that these mildly increased levels of plasma catecholamines directly induce a major deterioration of myocardial function during the ischemic process. Of more importance is the reflex increase in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity that is induced by pain, anxiety, and a fall in cardiac output or arterial blood pressure and that is accompanied by local exocytotic release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerve endings of the heart. Excessive accumulation of the neurotransmitter, however, is prevented by at least three mechanisms: 1) Released noradrenaline is rapidly removed so long as neuronal catecholamine reuptake is functional. 2) Adenosine accumulating in the ischemic myocardium effectively suppresses exocytotic noradrenaline release by stimulating presynaptic A1-adenosine receptors. 3) Exocytotic catecholamine release ceases when the sympathetic neurons become depleted of adenosine triphosphate since this release mechanism requires high-energy phosphates. However, with progression of ischemia (i.e., &gt;10 minutes), the myocardium is no longer protected against excess adrenergic stimulation since local metabolic release mechanisms become increasingly important. This release, which is independent of both central sympathetic activation and extracellular calcium, occurs in two steps. First, catecholamines escape from their storage vesicles and accumulate in the cytoplasm of the neuron. In the second, rate-limiting step, noradrenaline is transported across the axolemma from the cytoplasm to the interstitial space via the neuronal uptake carrier in reverse of its normal transport direction. As a consequence of this nonexocytotic local metabolic release, extracellular noradrenaline reaches 100-1,000 times its normal plasma concentrations within 30 minutes of ischemia. Concentrations of this magnitude are capable of producing myocardial necrosis, even in the nonischemic heart, and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ventricular fibrillation in early ischemia.",,"catecholamine; desipramine; verapamil; anxiety; conference paper; heart arrhythmia; heart muscle ischemia; human; pain; priority journal; psychological aspect; Animal; Biomechanics; Catecholamines; Coronary Disease; Exocytosis; Extracellular Space; Human; Myocardium; Norepinephrine; Osmolar Concentration; Reflex; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Sympathetic Nervous System; Time Factors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025131441

Substrate movements in forearm muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue were studied, by measurement of arteriovenous differences and blood flow, in seven normal subjects after an overnight fast and then for 6 h after ingestion of a mixed meal. Overall substrate balances were examined in terms of the flux of gram-atoms of carbon. 2. As found previously, the forearm was approximately in carbon balance (import equal to export) after the overnigh fast, whereas adipose tissue was a net exporter of carbon, mainly in the form of non-esterified fatty acids. 3. After the meal, arterialized plasma concentrations of glucose and lactate rose sharply (peak at 60 min), whereas those of non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol fell (nadir at 60-120 min). Plasma triacylglycerol concentrations rose slowly to peak at 240 min; much of this rise was accounted for by a rise in the chylomicron fraction. 4. Both tissues took up glucose at an increased rate after the meal. Release of non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol from adipose tissue was suppressed. Clearance of triacylglycerol by both tissues increased after the meal, but was more marked in adipose tissue, where the fractional extraction of chylomicron-triacylglycerol reached 44% at 240 min. 5. The forearm rapidly became a considerable net importer of carbon, and remained so until 6 h after the meal when it was again in approximate carbon balance. Glucose uptake dominated the forearm carbon balance. Adipose tissue was a net importer of carbon from 30 min until 5 h after the meal and then reverted to next export. Clearance of triacylglycerol carbon made the largest contribution to this positive balance, but towards the end of the study this was increasingly counterbalanced by simultaneous non-esterified fatty acid release. 6. Skeletal muscle plays a major role, and adipose tissue a minor one, in the disposal of ingested carbonhydrate; adipose tissue plays a major role and skeletal muscle a minor one in clearance of dietary-derived triacylglycerol. The role of adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase is not, however, simply the uptake of triacylglycerol for storage within the tissue; rather, it appears to play a central role in the distribution of dietary-derived lipid energy.","Adipose tissue; Chylomicrons; Forearm muscle; Free fatty acids; Glucose; Insulin; Triacylglycerol","fatty acid; adipose tissue; adult; article; diet; female; forearm; human; male; methodology; normal human; normal value; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025119485

The transient fluorescence changes induced by acid to base transitions of chromatophore suspensions were used as an empirical calibration [Casadio, R. &amp; Melandri, B. A. (1985) Arch. Biophys. Biochem. 238, 219–228]. The kinetic competence of the probe response was tested by accelerating the Δφ decay with the ionophore nigericin. The time course in the dark of the increase in the internal pH in pre‐illuminated chromatophores was analyzed on the basis of a model which assumes a certain number of internal buffers in equilibrium with the free protons and a diffusion‐controlled H+ efflux [Whitmarsh, J. (1987) Photosynt. Res. 12, 43–62]. This model was extended to include the effects of the transmembrane electric potential difference on the H+ efflux. The diffusion constant for proton efflux was measured at different values of the internal pH by evaluating the frequency of trains of single‐turnover flashes capable of maintaining different Δφ in a steady state. The steady‐state equation derived from the model does not include any parameter relative to the internal buffers and allows unequivocal determination of the diffusion constant on the basis of the known H+/e− ratio (equal to two) for the active proton translocation by the bacterial photosynthetic chain. A value for the first‐order diffusion constant corresponding to a permeability coefficient, PH= 0.2 μm · s−1, was obtained at an external pH of 8.0; this value was constant for an internal pH ranging over 7.0–4.7. Using the value of the diffusion constant determined experimentally, a satisfactory fitting of the kinetics of Δφ decay in the dark could be obtained when the presence of two internal buffers (with pK values of 3.6 and 6.7, respectively) was assumed. For these calculations, the time course of the transmembrane electric potential difference was evaluated from the electrochromic signal of carotenoids, calibrated with K+‐induced diffusion potentials. The two internal buffers, suitable for modelling the behaviour of the system, were at concentrations of 250 mM (pK= 3.6) and 24 mM (pK= 6.7) respectively. The ability of the chromatophore suspension to store free and bound protons in the internal compartment, evaluated theoretically from the model on the basis of the above concentrations and pK values of the internal buffers, was compared with the quantity of protons disappearing from the outer suspending buffer measured with a glass electrode. Different steady states for the internal pH and for proton uptake were obtained in continuous light, adding subsaturating concentrations of nigericin. A close agreement between these two sets of data could be demonstrated. From the results of this study, a complete phenomenological description of the properties of the H+‐binding groups present in the internal compartment of chromatophores can be obtained. This allows a quantitative estimate of the quantify of inner bound protons as a function of the internal pH, information useful for evaluating the storage capacity for chemiosmotic energy of this system.

Impairment of long-chain fatty acid metabolism and failure of energy production affect tissues reliant on oxidative metabolism. The accumulation of toxic fatty acyl derivatives impedes gluconeogenesis and urea cycle function which, in turn, causes hypoketotic hypoglycemia, transaminase elevations, and hyperammonemia. Oxidation of accumulated fatty acids through an alternative pathway, ω-oxidation, produces dicarboxylic aciduria. Carnitine must be transported into skeletal muscle. Myopathic carnitine deficiency occurs when this transport mechanism is defective. Most systemic carnitine deficiencies are secondary to other disorders that promote excretion of carnitine as acylcarnitine; however, primary systemic carnitine deficiency, likely due to impaired renal conservation of carnitine, also occurs. © 1990.",,"coenzyme a; long chain fatty acid; brain disease; cardiomyopathy; carnitine deficiency; human; lipidosis; review; Carnitine; Human; Metabolic Diseases; Muscular Diseases; Syndrome",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025101871

This framework envisages that there is a homeostatic control of nutrient balance, the control of which is centered in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly the hypothalamus. The afferent signals arising from external sensory cues, internal oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal stimuli, and nutrient, endocrine, or substrate stimuli in initiating and terminating the feeding response are reviewed. The role of the vagus nerve in relaying these afferent signals is emphasized. The neural centers and pathways involved in the control of food intake and the effects of their associated neurotransmitters and neuropeptides are discussed. The CNS control systems have both sensing elements to transduce afferent signals and efferent signalling systems. These control feeding, food selection, and peripheral energy metabolism and storage. The sympathetic nervous system appears to have a dominant role in the efferent pathways. It is proposed that all experimental obesities result from an absolute or relative decrease in the nutrient-stimulated activity of the thermogenic components of the sympathetic nervous system that arise from abnormalities in the afferent sensing systems. An exaggerated vagal efferent response to nutrients leading to hyperinsulinemia may potentiate the obesity and explain many of the peripheral abnormalities observed in some of the experimental models. Corticotropin releasing factor may have a major role in modulating the central control system and preventing the development of obesity.",,"animal experiment; animal model; brown adipose tissue; controlled study; mammal; neuroendocrinology; nonhuman; obesity; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025094662

A detector sandwich consisting of storage phosphor imaging plates and an interdetector filter is used. The goal of this process is to provide a simple dual-energy method using typical plane-projection radiographic equipment and techniques. This approach exploits the transparency of the storage phosphor plates, using radiographic information that would be otherwise lost, to provide energy selective information essentially as a by-product of the radiographic examination. In order to effectively make use of the large dynamic range of the storage phosphor imaging plates (10 000:1), a computed radiography image reading mode of fixed analog-to-digital converter gain and variable photomultiplier sensitivity provides image data which can be related to relative incident exposure for export to the decomposition algorithm. Scatter rejection requirements necessitated crossed 12:1 grids for a field size of 36x36 cm. Optimal technique parameters obtained from computer simulation through minimization of the aluminum and Plexiglas equivalent image uncertainty under conditions of constant absorbed dose resulted as: 100 kVp using a 0.15-mm-thick tin (Sn) interdetector filter for the lung field. This yields a surface exposure of 23 mR and a surface absorbed dose of 0.26 mGy for a 23-cm-thick chest.

At equilibrium, phosphatidylcholine bilayers are saturated when equimolar levels of cholesterol are incorporated; the cholesterol molecules interfere with the cooperative lateral interactions of the phosphatidylcholine acyl chains and restrict the fluidity relative to pure liquid-crystal phosphatidylcholine bilayers. Mixed cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine bilayers containing more than equimolar cholesterol are metastable; on storage excess cholesterol is released from the vesicles and forms cholesterol monohydrate crystals. This process models the formation of cholesterol gallstones in bile and the growth of the crystals probably involves, at least in part, diffusion of cholesterol molecules from the vesicle bilayer to the crystal surface. The cholesterol-phosphatidylcholine interaction energy in the lipid-water interface of the donor vesicle has a critical effect on the rate of this transfer process.",,"cholesterol; phosphatidylcholine; conference paper; gallstone; human; priority journal; Animal; Cholesterol; Crystallization; Human; Lipid Bilayers; Phosphatidylcholines; Solubility; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025094585

A neutralized perchloric acid extract of freeze-dried human or rat skeletal muscle tissue was injected on to a reversed-phase silica column and eluted by a gradient composed of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate buffer and methanol. Good resolution for all the nucleotides was achieved within a retention time of about 20 min. Linearity for each of the nucleotides within the concentration intervals obtained in the samples was demonstrated. Purity of each peak was verified by use of the photo-diode array technique. Reproducibility for biological samples with variation coefficients below 3.6% for ATP, ADP, AMP, inosine and hypoxanthine and 6.7% for IMP was obtained. The stability of the compounds after extraction was specifically addressed. Storing of frozen extracts at -20oC for 24 h gave acceptable values, while storage for 7 days cannot be recommended.

Regimens were given consecutively to each subject in random order. Concentrations of glucose, glycerol, fatty acids, 3-hydroxybutyrate, urea, insulin, and glucagon were determined in plasma, and of epinephrine and norepinephrine in urine. In normal subjects, there was no increase in energy expenditure with increasing glucose, although estimated costs of glucose storage as glycogen or fat could account for an increase of 4%. Thus, storage costs of glucose do not necessarily constitute an obligatory increase in energy expenditure. Rates of glycerol turnover and fat oxidation, and plasma glycerol concentrations were lower with the high than the low rate of glucose infusion, and lower than values reported by others during fasting or glucose infusion. Rates of fat oxidation were higher and glucose oxidation lower in patients than in controls, even though insulin concentrations were more than twice as high in patients. This confirms previous studies comparing injured and septic patients to depleted patients or historical controls.

Special attention was paid to the biomechanical properties of the intact chorioamniotic membrane and the amniotic and chorionic components, separately, and thickness and storage of membrane samples. The load-strain and stress-strain relationships, and parameters calculated from the curves: extensibility, strength, elastic stiffness and failure energy, express the visco-elastic behavior of these membranes. The mechanical properties of the chorioamniotic membranes are determined by the interaction between the amniotic and chorionic components of the membrane. The strength of the intact chorioamniotic membrane, however, is primarily determined by the amniotic component, because the amniotic component is much less extensible. Thus, the chorionic component only contributes 10-15% of the strength when the amniotic component breaks. The chorionic component is twice as extensible as the amniotic component. Samples of fetal membranes can be stored at -70 °C, with no significant changes in the biomechanical properties. No significant differences were found between specimens, which were oriented in parallel with and at right angles to the placental edge. Small samples can be analysed and the localization of samples in relation to the placental edge and rupture site of the membranes can be standardized.

In three separate experiments, two replicates underwent sib selection for both increased and decreased storage. In the first study, flies were selected on the basis of total triacylglycerol for ten generations. This experiment resulted in no significant direct response, but there was a significant change in total body weight, underscoring the importance of concern for the allometric relationship between body weight and lipid content. In the second study, selection was performed for 15 generations on the percentage of body composition that was triacylglycerol. A significant direct response was obtained, and the two replicates revealed heritability estimates of 0·40 and 0·43. The third study selected glycogen content for 15 generations, and produced a significant response with heritabilities of 0·25 and 0·31. A series of 12 biochemical and enzyme kinetic traits was examined at five generation intervals in all experiments, and a number of correlated responses were detected.

The latter two mechanisms are examined using examples from high-speed running in lizards and escape swimming in scallops. During running, inertial loading and elastic energy storage probably mitigate the effects of thermal alterations in intrinsic muscle shortening velocity. The result is a rather low thermal dependence of stride frequency over a 15-20°C temperature range. However, at lower temperatures, the longer times required for deactivation cause the thermal dependence of frequency to increase greatly. Scallops use a single muscle to swim by jet propulsion. In vivo shortening velocity in these animals also shows a low thermal dependence. As with high-speed running, the mechanics of jet propulsion may limit the effects of thermally induced changes in intrinsic shortening velocity. The largest thermal effect during swimming is on the initial phase of valve opening. The effects of temperature on the rate of deactivation of the adductor muscle could play an important role in limiting reextension of the muscle, which is dependent on elastic energy storage in the hinge ligament. These examples illustrate that the relative importance of various intrinsic contractile properties in controlling locomotor performance depends on the mechanics of the movements.","muscle contraction; relaxation; running; swimming; temperature","Amphibia; animal experiment; conference paper; invertebrate; locomotion; muscle contraction; nonhuman; priority journal; running; swimming; temperature dependence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025046941

Oxygen consumption, glucose output, ATP content, and tissue pH were measured in isolated perfused rat liver at 37°C. In fresh liver, a two-fold increase in glucose output and oxygen consumption was induced by norepinephrine (1 μM), while changes in ATP content and tissue pH were minimal. In stored liver, the cumulative increments in glucose output and oxygen consumption induced by norepinephrine were 30 and 27% those of fresh liver, respectively. ATP content of the unstimulated liver was 76% that of the fresh liver, then decreased to 50% during stimulation. A transient decrease in tissue pH (0.14 pH unit) was significant compared with that of fresh liver.

Recent studies with isolated granules, however, have suggested that granule storage forms may be relatively osmotically inactive due to oligomerization involving hormonal intermolecular disulfide bonds. Thus, expenditure of metabolic energy by the cell in order to maintain granule integrity would be reduced. When secretion is stimulated, oligomer depolymerization by thiol exchange mechanisms has been proposed to occur before or even concomitant with exocytosis. The present studies were designed to investigate the influence of metabolic inhibitors, thiols, and divalent cations on PRL storage in situ, rather than in isolated granules. The results suggest that 1) PRL granules require little energy to maintain their structure, since a combination of azide (10 mM), fluoride (10 mM), and cyanide (1 mM) had no effect on PRL granule morphology in normal anterior pituitary cells in primary culture; 2) disulfide linkages are involved in the osmotic activity of the PRL granule contents, since thiols induced granule swelling in lightly fixed cells; and 3) thiols and divalent cations are capable of altering the arrangement of stored hormone molecules, since PRL immunoactivity could be modified by these agents in glycol methacrylate-embedded exposed gran-ule cores. © 1990 by The Endocrine Society.",,"azide; cyanide; edetic acid; fluoride; glutathione; magnesium; zinc; adenohypophysis; animal cell; article; cell culture; female; metabolism; morphology; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; secretory granule; ultrastructure; Animal; Cations, Divalent; Cells, Cultured; Cytoplasmic Granules; Fixatives; Immunohistochemistry; Microscopy, Electron; Prolactin; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025020988

The main focus was on the epithelia. Previous studies have indicated that the digestive gland, where intracellular digestion occurs, plays the major role in the digestion process. The main cell types of the tract are ciliated cells and cells with microvilli. The presence of ciliated cells reflects transport of food particles and faeces. In particular areas, viz. the prooesophagus and the pylorus, the epithelium is almost exclusively composed of ciliated cells. Both cell types show signs of endocytosis, lysosomal breakdown of substances, and storage of reserve materials (glycogen, lipid, protein). These features are very prominent in the crop and in the first part of the prointestine and they would indicate that absorption of energy‐rich substances can occur in the whole tract. Ten types of gland cells were distinguished. Their possible functions are discussed on the basis of their histochemical properties and ultrastructure of the secretion products. The observations suggest that some of the cell types produce two different substances, one of which may have enzymatic properties. The epithelium of the gizzard consists of cells possessing stout microvilli, which extend into a special coating produced by these cells. The morphology of the epithelium reflects the function of the gizzard, which is comminution of food particles. In the mid‐ and postintestine occur areas composed of villi cells that possess an extensive basal labyrinth.

The power system consists of a solar concentrator, solar heat receiver, Stirling heat engine, linear alternator and waste heat radiator. The solar concentrator focuses the sun's energy into a heat receiver. The engine and alternator convert a portion of this energy to electric power and the remaining heat is rejected by a waste heat radiator. Primary liquid metal heat pipes transport heat energy to the Stirling engine. Thermal energy storage allows this power system to operate during the shade portion of an orbit. Lithium fluoride/calcium fluoride eutectic is the thermal energy storage material. Thermal energy storage canisters are attached to the midsection of each heat pipe. The primary heat pipes pass through a secondary vapor cavity heat pipe near the engine and receiver interface. The secondary vapor cavity heat pipe serves three important functions. First, it smooths out hot spots in the solar cavity and provides even distribution of heat to the engine. Second, in the event of failure, the secondary heat pipe cavity can transfer heat from other operating primary heat pipes to the engine heat exchanger of the defunct heat pipe.

RG12 6EY, United States","The use of viscoelastic measurements in studying interactions in concentrated dispersions has been demonstrated by using various model systems. These include charge-stabilized polystyrene latex dispersions, sterically stabilized dispersions containing grafted poly(ethylene oxide) chains, or physically adsorbed poly(vinyl alcohol). With electrostatically stabilized dispersions, the system became predominantly elastic when double-layer overlap occurred. This was the case at low electrolyte (10-5 mol dm-3 NaCl) concentrations since the effective volume fraction ϕeff is significantly larger than the actual volume fraction ϕ. Increasing the electrolyte concentration to 10-3 mol dm-3 caused compression of the double layer, and the dispersion became relatively more viscous than elastic. With sterically stabilized dispersions, elastic interaction occurred as soon as the volume fraction reached a value whereby the grafted or adsorbed polymer chains start to overlap. Viscoelastic measurements could also be applied for studying flocculated systems. Three main types were investigated: weakly flocculated dispersions produced by addition of free (nonadsorbing) polymer (depletion flocculation), sterically stabilized dispersions flocculated by reduction of solvency to worse than 0-conditions (incipient flocculation), and strongly flocculated (coagulated) dispersions produced by addition of electrolyte to a charge-stabilized system. With weakly flocculated disperions, all rheological parameters show a rapid increase above a critical volume fraction of the added free polymer. In this case, it was possible to calculate the energy of separation of particles in the floe from the yield value. This was compared with theoretical calculation of the free energy of depletion flocculation. With sterically stabilized dispersions, reduction of solvency was produced by addition of electrolyte or increasing temperature at constant electrolyte concentrations. The results showed an initial reduction in modulus due to collapse of the chains, followed by a rapid increase above the flocculation point. Coagulated suspensions obtained by addition of electrolyte to an electrostatically stabilized system were investigated by using strain and oscillatory measurements. The strain sweep experiments indicated a sudden reduction in moduli value above a critical strain. This indicated breakdown of the structure above this value. The results also show that the modulus increases with the volume fraction ϕ through a power law with an exponent in ϕ of the order of 6. From the critical strain and the storage modulus in the linear region, the energy of cohesion in the floe, Ec, was calculated. Ec was also found to increase with ϕ through a power law with an exponent of 9 in 0. © 1990, American Chemical Society.

After initial radical production, four reaction stages are found in the overall autoxidation of unsaturated lipids: (1) formation of peroxyl radicals by addition of molecular oxygen to the initial carbon radicals, (2) consumption of oxygen in the autoxidation cycle, (3) decay of the lipid peroxyl radical into allylic and pentadienyl radicals, and (4) recombination of the carbon-centered radicals. Kinetic analyses reveal that peroxidation of the initial carbon-centered radicals (stage 1) is controlled by O2 migration which has an apparent activation energy of 24 kJ/mol in unsaturated lipids. The autoxidation cycle (stage 2) is dependent on the nature of the parent lipid matrices. Our analysis gives the activation energies of 9 ± 2, 34 ± 8, and 88 ± 11 kJ/mol for the decay of the peroxyl radical into allylic and pentadienyl radicals (stage 3) in trilinolenin, trilinolein, and triolein, respectively. The very low activation energy found for radical decay of the trilinolenin peroxyl radical suggests this process proceeds easily through intra- or interchain hydrogen abstraction and cyclization at low temperatures (&lt;140 K). In stage 4 the allylic and pentadienyl radicals recombine at temperatures near the softening points with an apparent activation energy of ca. 40 kJ/mol. Peroxyl radical decay in saturated lipids follows second-order kinetics with an apparent activation energy of ca. 50 kJ/mol. We find that, for polyunsaturated lipids, even at quite low temperatures (120 K), the autoxidation process occurs readily and must be considered in the storage of biological samples. © 1990 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009939066

Changes in growth have been ascribed to many causes, including density and genetic composition of the fish stock, both of which are also believed to vary with location in the bay. The objectives of this study were to compare growth and maturation of yellow perch from inner and outer Saginaw Bay, to investigate the existence of different fish stocks, and to compare growth of yellow perch in Saginaw Bay to growth in other locations to determine the degree of stunting. Yellow perch were collected from four sites in inner and outer Saginaw Bay from 1983 to 1983. Size distributions differed between the inner and outer bay sites: larger and older fish were more common in the outer bay. Percentage of body water, body energy density, gonadosomatic index, and age at maturation did not differ between the inner and outer bay sites. Growth in weight, total body energy, and condition factors differed significantly. These results indicate that growth conditions differ between the inner and outer bay, but the fish populations may not be isolated completely, as has been suggested. Results also suggest that the growth differential has not caused large geographic differences in growth rate, but has caused small condition differences. Yellow perch growth is poor in Saginaw Bay, and the fish appear unable to store substantial energy reserves at any time of year. It appears that behavioral differences between young and old fish may cause the differential distribution of fish by size in Saginaw Bay. © 1990 by the American fisheries society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001701426

These jets are typically heavier than air. The subject of this paper is the description of a turbulent entrainment model that predicts the trajectory and dilution of such releases when the release point is elevated above ground-level in a horizontal wind. The model is compared with available field test data for pressurized liquid releases and is found to describe the observations to a degree of accuracy adequate for most hazard assessment purposes. The comparisons include the field measurements made during the liquid ammonia (NH3) and liquid hydrofluoric acid (HF) release test series, namely Desert Tortoise and Goldfish respectively, at the US Department of Energy Fuels Test Facility. The model indicates that over the 3000 m distance in which measurements were made, there is no need to invoke atmospheric turbulence to explain the dilution of the ammonia jet. However, atmospheric turbulence is predicted to dominate the mixing in the far field of the weaker HF jet. © 1990.","modelling; release; wind speed",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001444251

The first device maximizes the power output of the wind turbine, while keeping it wihin mechanical design limits; the second is added to the conventional regulator of the diesel for continuous adaptation of plant output to the requirements of the consumer. This paper deals with the design of robust regulators for the second requirement. Highly detailed linear dynamic models are first derived for the three modes of operation of a basic system comprising one wind turbine and one diesel unit (D, W/D and W). Numerical analysis of these operating modes provides a better understanding of the unregulated system and allows for development of a systematic design procedure for the PID regulators required to smooth the frequency. Taking a system with 20% and 100% wind-energy penetration, the robustness of this supplemental regulation is then demonstrated by investigating its performance with respect to rejection of disturbances due to load demand and wind. © 1990.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001305276

Solid-state greenhouse calculations have shown that sunlight can generate substantially elevated subsurface temperatures. A variety of models for the storage of solar energy in a sub-greenhouse layer and for the supply of gas and energy to a geyser are examined. ""Leaky greenhouse"" models with only vertical gas transport are inconsistent with the observed upper limit on geyser radius of ∼1.5 kilometers. However, lateral transport of energy by gas flow in a porous N2 layer with a block size on the order of a meter can supply the required amount of gas to a source region ∼1 kilometer in radius. The decline of gas output to steady state may occur over a period comparable with the inferred active geyser lifetime of five Earth years. The required subsurface permeability may be maintained by thermal fracturing of the residual N2 polar cap.

Of these, only those incorporating n-cadmium chalcogenide electrodes have been demonstrated to be conducive to thin film6 or in situ storage systems7. Previous studies of photoelectrochemical current and voltage limitation2,3,5,8,9 have focused on modification of the semiconductor electrode. Here we take the alternative approach by demonstrating that energy conversion can be improved by prevention of electrode surface modification and by systematic modification of the electrolyte. Electrolyte modification entails investigations of the primary photo-oxidized species, the nature of the counter ion, the distribution of species in solution, and related competing reactions. Optimization of the distribution of species and addition of cyanide to n-CdSe/([KFe(CN)6]2-/3-)aq PECs enhances the available voltage and the ease of charge transfer, and suppresses related decomposition products. The resultant PEC achieves an open-circuit potential of 1.2 V, an efficiency of 16.4% - the highest for any wide-band-gap (1.7 eV) solar cell (solid state or photoelectrochemical) - and a 100-fold improvement in photocurrent lifetime.

While the measured particle intensities and energy spectra of these two events are typical of large, gradual events, their composition closely resembles that of small, highly impulsive 3He-rich solar particle increases. In particular, the enhanced 3He/4He and e/H ratios and the heavy element ratios, especially Ne/O and Fe/O, are just the features found in 3He-rich events. This suggests the unusual situation in which a second-phase gradual process predominantly reaccelerates energetic seed particles earlier accelerated in the first-phase impulsive process, rather than ordinary coronal material. The fraction of the accelerated particles escaping into interplanetary space is very small during the first phase, but large during the second phase. The energy spectra for both events are rederived using the event-integrated intensities. This method is thought to be preferable to the time-of-maximum (TOM) analysis previously reported because of the strong anisotropies that persist well after the time of peak intensity. The event-integrated hydrogen and helium spectra (γ = ∼ 2 and ∼ 3 for the two events) are consistent with shock acceleration. The electron spectra are significantly flatter, so that electrons may have to be accelerated separately (possibly by whistlers at higher altitudes, from which escape into interplanetary space is very easy).

The influences of temperature and water activity (aw) on the rates of endosperm yellowing were dominant, O2 tension had a slight effect and CO2 concentration had no significant effect. The yellowing rates were similar to those of milled Pelde and Calrose, and were well described by the kinetic model reported previously for milled rice. Rate data for paddy were pooled with correponding data for milled rice to produce a model with common coefficients (apparent activation energy 103 MJ/kg mol). There was no need to invoke fungal growth to explain the yellowing observed. Recently presented data for various paddy cultivars stored at 60 °C were consistent with rates of yellowing calculated from this model for aw up to 0·8, but not above. The model appears to provide a general method for predicting yellowing in paddy and milled rice under conditions typical of grain storage in the humid tropics. The effects of altered O2 and CO2 concentrations were sufficiently small as to be unlikely to justify commercial use of controlled atmospheres specifically to retard yellowing of the type studied here. © 1990, Academic Press Limited.

The pH-gradient dependent decrease of Na+ uptake by ATP-depleted tissues served as an indication for such antiport at the plasma membrane. Metabolic-energy dependent uptake by the tissues, in the presence of excess K+, indicated the functioning of Na+/H+ antiport at the tonoplast. Evidence for Na+/H+ antiport was found in four species and for its absence in five species. In seven species the evidence was not unequivocal. It was concluded that the presence of a Na+/H+ antiporter is not an ubiquitous characteristic of plant cells. © 1990, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.
