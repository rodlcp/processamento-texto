The instrument has been designed especially to make best use of the outstanding properties of synchroton X-rays, i.e. high collimation, polarization, wavelength (energy) tunability, and overall high intensity. Its central feature is a rigid two-crystal diffractometer bench which is mounted on a swing so that it can be rotated about the axis of the incident beam. Thus the diffraction plane of the bench can assume any orientation between horizontal and vertical which permits the polarization of the source to be conveniently exploited. The orientational flexibility of the two-crystal bench is complemented by a preceeing monochromator the diffraction plane of which can independently be chosen between horizontal and vertical. A solid state detector separately mounted on another swing of corresponding design can freely follow the movement of the two-crystal bench without direct mechanical coupling to it. Thus the vibrational noise at the bench is kept low. The double-crystal bench is capable of carrying a pair of medium size temperature stages enclosing the crystals. All essential movements including vertical adjustment of the whole instrument with respect to the synchrotron beam feature fully automated operation through an on-line computer. Due to its versatile and flexible design the diffractometer can be employed for a great variety of different experiments such as high resolution two-crystal topography and diffraction line analysis, high resolution small angle scattering, Compton scattering, energy and momentum resolved X-ray scattering, anomalous dispersion measurements, fluorescence and ordinary X-ray spectroscopy, etc. © 1981.",,"ACCELERATORS, SYNCHROTRON - Instruments; DIFFRACTOMETERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019740680

Technical details and chemical background of this system are discussed. The permeator is fed by mixed bed deionised water of very low solids content. The main advantages of such a system, which does produce water conforming to pharmacopoeial specifications, are the small initial investment and running costs as compared with a distillation unit; the fact that no heat energy is required and that the production rate of pyrogen free water is as high as 300 l/h and upwards, thus obviating the need for storage. Disadvantages are the need for a variety of monitoring arrangements to control correct membrane function, especially membrane integrity and the possible leakage past gaskets; the necessity of regular sanitisation with formaldehyde, which is not without its own inherent difficulties; and the fact that an absolutely sterile product water cannot be consistently guaranteed. Some of these aspects are also discussed with respect to the recent CGMP/LVP proposals of FDA. © 1981 Bohn, Scheltema & Holkema.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250241603

The mechanism is based on the modification of local energy levels on an atomic scale due to structural adjustments occurring during times of applied high-field stress (write/erase cycling). The modified energy levels that are frozen in after removal of the high-field stress, due to structural irreversibilities, allow enhanced communication between what would otherwise be completely localized states. These new communicating states are called delocalized states. The presence of such delocalized states enhances the continuation of the delocalization process, eventually leading to the formation of a network of states throughout the solid. This process results in enhanced decay and, eventually, breakdown of the film.

A biphasic change in maternal storage of adipose tissue fat, insulin secretion, insulin resistance, glucose assimilation, and HDL cholesterol concentrations have been emphasized as milestones of progress during pregnancy by which the changes in diabetic control can be predicted and timed with respect to insulin management. The changes in maternal fuel utilization appear to pivot about approximately the 27th week of gestation, the time gestational diabetes commonly becomes manifest and the diabetic mother is most prone to the development of ketoacidosis. At this time, the mother switches from primarily a glucose-based energy economy to a lipid-based energy economy derived either from circulating fats or stored adipose tissue so as to spare glucose for fetal growth. Moreover, in the diabetic pregnancy, it appears that, not only glucose, but other circulating nutrients have the potential for increased transplacental transport to the fetus. All of these nutrients could contribute to the observed macrosomia. Thus, management of the pregnant diabetic should focus on a normalization of all circulating fuels, not just plasma glucose concentrations. It is clear from the physiologic view presented that the fetus can not only pull nutrients from the maternal circulation as would a siphon, but that the mother also adapts to push nutrients to the fetus at the time of greatest fetal fuel requirement, i.e., the third trimester of pregnancy. Adaptation to this push mode occurs in the time of greatest stress on maternal fuel homeostasis and insulin regulation of fuel metabolism. Particularly at the time between the second and third trimester, the clinician must guard against sudden progression into ketoacidosis or exacerbation of maternal hyperglycemia in order to protect fetal life. An appreciation of the physiologic guideposts provides important milestones for the clinical management of the diabetic pregnancy.",,"major clinical study; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; Abnormalities; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Glucagon; Glucose; Humans; Insulin; Ketone Bodies; Lipid Metabolism; Lipoproteins; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Diabetics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019863772

Using rats, we tested whether this condition was linked to the use of plasma free fatty acids (FFA), which normally rise with exercise. Before a 1-h swim, animals received an injection of either saline (S) or nicotinic acid (NA). The nicotinic acid treatment dramatically suppressed the rise in plasma FFA observed in the S-group. Exercise caused a significant but similar reduction (35-38%) of the myocardial glycogen content in both groups. After 1 h of recovery in the S-group, myocardial glycogen reached a value of 30.3±1.7 Μmol·g-1 or 113% of that measured before the exercise began. In contrast, the value for hearts from the NA-group with reduced FFA levels was 24.0±1.9 Μmol·g-1 or only 91% of that measured before exercise. After 2 h the values were 33.8±1.4 and 29.0±1.9 Μmol·g-1 respectively. These data indicate that glycogen repletion in rat heart after exercise is related to the amount of FFA present in the plasma. We suggest that carbohydrate metabolism is diverted towards synthesis and storage as a result of the glycolytic inhibition exerted by the increased use of fat as an energy source as previously observed in hearts from fasted or diabetic animals. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.","Exercise; Free fatty acids; Glycogen; Heart; Nicotinic acid","fatty acid; glycogen; nicotinic acid; animal experiment; blood and hemopoietic system; carbohydrate metabolism; exercise; fatty acid blood level; heart; heart muscle; intraperitoneal drug administration; rat; Animal; Blood Glucose; Exertion; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Glycogen; Male; Myocardium; Niacin; Nicotinic Acids; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019775563

The increase of the rates of ATP-Pi exchange upon subsequent addition of Pi to Mg-ATP was less prominent. Mg-ADP induced a Δψ (60-70 mV, positive inside), almost equal that induced by Mg-ATP. In both cases Δψ was significantly higher in the absence of Pi than in its presence. At pH 7.4 of the medium the ΔpH was 1.4 units indicating an internal pH of 6. It was stable during the reaction time in the presence of Mg-ATP, while in the presence of Mg-ADP the internal pH increased gradually by 0.2 units. Both the ATP forming reactions as well as the nucleotide induced Δψ were uncouplersensitive (CCCP). Though inhibiting ATP formation from ADP + Pi by 50%, 0.1 mM AP5A (an inhibitor of adenylate kinase) did neither affect Δψ nor ΔpH, hence ruling out the possibility that ΔμH induced by Mg-ADP would be actually due to ATP formed from ADP. Membrane ghosts were not able of ATP synthesis (in the absence of valinomycin), the ATP-Pi exchange was only 10–20% of that of intact organelles, due to the low ΔμH in the absence of intravesicular soluble constituents. It is proposed that the energy for ATP synthesis is furnished by the high gradients of protonated soluble constituents in the intact organelles. © 1981, Walter de Gruyter.

The instrumental advantages in the far infrared region included a lower tolerance for the mirror drive of a Michelson interferometer, a smaller dynamic range of the interferogram, and a longer sampling time which resulted in a reduced number of data points. However, far infrared spectroscopy also had its apparent difficulties such as low-energy sources, poor detectors, a lack of suitable optical materials, and spectral interference of water. Researchers in this area have overcome most of these difficulties and therefore investigations in the far infrared spectral region have become widespread. In this presentation some of the applications of Fourier transform far infrared spectroscopy will be examined. The three areas in which research was initially carried out using Fourier transform far infrared spectroscopy were investigations of pure rotational spectra, studies of molecules in the solid state, and studies of heavy atom vibrations and skeletal bending modes. These initial studies did not show a significant departure from the mainstream of far infrared research since a majority of them could be carried out utilizing dispersive instrumentation, but in the field of solid state research, the interferometrically obtained spectra provided data which were not easily obtained by grating instruments. Thus, physicists have put interferometers to use in the study of the solid state to determine optical constants such as the index of refraction, complex indices, phase angle transmission coefficients, and the electronic processes in insulating crystals, as well as the intermolecular vibrations of molecular crystals. Such studies have been important in the development of interpretative theories of solid state behavior. For the sake of brevity I shall mainly discuss current uses of far infrared interferometry for the study of molecules in the gas phase which contain very anharmonic vibrations, such as torsional vibrations and ring-puckering motions in some small ring compounds, and for conformational analyses by the spectral assignment of the asymmetric rotor transitions. The interpretation of the far infrared data for several molecules will be illustrated and many examples will be provided. © 1981 SPIE.",,"Digital storage; Fourier series; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Infrared devices; Interferometry; Michelson interferometers; Molecular crystals; Molecules; Refractive index; Chemical applications; Conformational analysis; Far-infrared spectroscopy; Fourier transform interferometry; Fourier transform spectroscopy; Intermolecular vibrations; Spectral interference; Transmission coefficients; Vibration analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957505885

Regional and temporal differences were quantified with an automatic image analyser by estimation of stained material in subpial regions of cerebral cortex, thalamus, superior colliculus and medulla. The cellular localization of glycogen particles was investigated by electron microscopy on ED 18, ED 20 and PD 2. On ED 14 the first signs of glycogen storage were found in parts of the immature choroid plexus and in radial glial cells in the midbrain and medullary raphé. With advancing foetal age these structures retained their high capacity for glycogen storage but, in addition, an increasing number of radial fibres in most of the brain stem regions and in the cerebral cortex of older foetuses (ED 18-20) showed significant amounts of glycogen. The storage of glycogen in cerebral cortex was relatively low at all foetal age intervals studied. In new born animals the distribution of glycogen particles was similar to that found in the late foetal brain. A decrease of glycogen content commenced from PD 1 to 3 and reached the pattern of the adult brain between PD 7 and 21.

Our purpose was to find out whether the activity patterns of the major limb muscles were consistent with the two mechanisms proposed for storage and recovery of energy within a stride: a 'pendulum-like' mechanism during a walk, and a 'spring-like' mechanism during a run. In the stance phase of the walking dog, we found that the supraspinatus, long head of the triceps brachii, biceps brachii, vastus lateralis, and gastrocnemius underwent only minor length changes during a relatively long portion of their activity, Thus, a major part of their activity during the walk seems consistent with a role in stabilization of the joints as the dog 'pole-vaulted' over its limbs (and thereby conserved energy). In the stance phase of trotting and/or galloping dogs, we found that the supraspinatus, lateral head of the triceps, vastus lateralis, and gastrocnemius were active while being stretched prior to shortening (as would be required for elastic storage of energy), and that this type of activity increased with increasing speed. We also found muscular activity in the select limb flexors that was consistent with storage of kinetic energy at the end of the swing phase and recovery during the propulsive stroke. This activity pattern was apparent in the latissimus dorsi during a walk and trot, and in the biceps femoris during a trot and gallop. We conclude that, during locomotion, a significant fraction of the electrical activity of a number of limbs muscles occurs while they undergo little or no length change or are being stretched prior to shortening and that these types of activities occur in a manner that would enable the operation of pendulum-like and spring-like mechanisms for conserving energy within a stride. Therefore these forms of muscular activity, in addition to the more familiar activity associated with muscle shortening, should be considered to be important during locomotion.",,"animal; article; dog; electric conductivity; gait; locomotion; movement (physiology); muscle; physiology; Animal; Dogs; Electric Conductivity; Gait; Locomotion; Movement; Muscles; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019629037

Amsterdamse Bak) which stores sucrose and reducing sugars. Before storage of sugars in the taproot started, root respiration was high and up to 50% inhibited by salicyl hydroxamic acid (SHAM), indicating a high activity of the alternative pathway.The onset of sugar storage in the taproot coincided with a sharp decrease in alternative pathway activity. When sugars were stored in the taproot, the alternative pathway in the taproot was not operative, although present.It was concluded that the alternative pathway only consumes sugars that are not used for energy production in growth or maintenance processes, for carbon skeletons, osmoregulation or storage, in accordance with the energy overflow model. A positive quantitative relationship exists between the storage of sugars in the taproot and the efficiency of root respiration. After day 32 the amount of daily produced carbohydrates transported to the root system increased and these sugars were stored in the taproot. In this period less sugars were invested in structural shoot growth.In the present investigation no positive influence from the developing sink is found on photosynthetic rate or net assimilation rate.

The intent was to make these equations as general as possible such that one set of equations would predict the performance of Li-Al/FeS or Li-Al/FeS2 cells with bicell (one positive electrode and two facing negative electrodes) or multiplate cell configurations. Data from 33 cells were used in the analysis of specific energy, and 26 cells were used to develop the specific power equation. The calculated specific energy and specific power showed good agreement with the measured values for these cells. In general, the deviation between the calculated and measured values was within ±10%. A check of the predictive capability of these equations also showed good agreement. The specific energy and specific power calculated for 14 cells not used in the regression analysis deviated by ±10% from the measured values. These equations were used to identify the most likely cell designs to meet selected electric-vehicle battery performance goals.

Information is recorded by thermal melting of the media surface. The material consists of an organic film containing dispersed metal particles which have such a high volume concentration that the surface has a mirrorlike appearance. However, the particles do not touch one another; and, therefore, the surface is electrically nonconductive. When recording, the laser-beam energy is absorbed by the metal particles, which rise in temperature and cause melting of the organic film at temperatures in the range of 200C. This melting creates spots of low reflectivity in a field of high reflectivity. The metal particles do not melt since their melting temperature is much highter than that of the underlying organic film. It is possible that one version of the media could achieve archival life of a hundred years. This version comprises three ingredients, all of which have rated archival lives of hundreds of years: (1) cross-linked, photographic-quality gelatin, (2) filamentary silver crystals, and (3) spheroidal silver crystals. This archival version of the media is produced from special, fine-grained silver-halide emulsions. © 1981 SPIE.",,"Digital storage; Emulsions; Laser beams; Laser recording; Melting; Organic lasers; Reflection; Silver halides; Storage (materials); Archival data storages; Dispersed metals; High reflectivity; High volume concentration; Laser beam energy; Photographic quality; Recording materials; Silver halide emulsion; Optical data storage; DATA STORAGE, OPTICAL; ARCHIVAL DATA STORAGE; DIRECT-READ-AFTER-WRITE; FINE-GRAINED SILVER-HALIDE EMULSIONS; OPTICAL MEMORY; REFLECTIVE LASER RECORDING MATERIAL",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019713521

The work done at each step to lift and accelerate the centre of mass of the body has been measured in competition walkers during locomotion from 2 to 20 km/hr. 2. Three distinct phases characterize the mechanics of walking. From 2 to 6 km/hr the vertical displacement during each step, Sv, increases to a maximum (3.5 vs. 6 cm in normal walking) due to an increase in the amplitude of the rotation over the supporting leg. 3. The transfer, R, between potential energy of vertical displacement and kinetic energy of forward motion during this rotation, reaches a maximum at 4‐5 km/hr (R = 65%). From 6 to 10 km/hr R decreases more steeply than in normal walking, indicating a smaller utilization of the pendulum‐like mechanism characteristic of walking. 4. Above 10 km/hr potential and kinetic energies vary during each step because both are simultaneously taken up and released by the muscles with almost no transfer between them (R = 2‐10%). Above 13‐14 km/hr an aerial phase (25‐60 msec) takes place during the step. 5. Speeds considerably greater than in normal walking are attained thanks to a greater efficiency of doing positive work. This is made possible by a mechanism of locomotion allowing an important storage and recovery of mechanical energy by the muscles. © 1981 The Physiological Society",,"article; biomechanics; energy metabolism; gravity; human; kinetics; locomotion; sports medicine; competition; embryo; energy transfer; muscle; musculoskeletal system; normal human; walking; work; Biomechanics; Energy Metabolism; Gravitation; Human; Kinetics; Locomotion; Sports Medicine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019393671

Somatic growth occurred in spring as adductor muscle, mantle, and digestive gland body components increased in dry weight and protein content. Reserve energy was stored in the digestive gland as lipid and in the adductor muscle, the primary energy storage site, as glycogen and protein. Gametogenesis in summer was associated with an increase in gonad dry weight and lipid and protein contents and took place at the expense of the previously stored energy reserves. Digestive gland lipid utilization was associated with initiation of the oocyte growth phase. Decrease in adductor muscle glycogen content was significantly correlated with increase in oocyte diameter during cytoplasmic growth and vitellogenesis. Adductor muscle protein was utilized to meet maintenance demands during the later gametogenic stages and spawning.

I shall be selective in the choice of Calorimeter Facilities; strictly speaking there are only two in existence at storage rings, MARK-J at PETRA and MAC at PEP, each having the distinction of including hadron calorimetry. The examples chosen will all be taken from the storage ring environment, where the conditions are quite different from those which prevail at fixed target facilities. The apparatus sits in the centre of mass, consequently the average energy of the particles is lower and they enter the calorimeters at large angles to the normal. Each example will be used to illustrate the basic principle of a method of calorimetry or readout. The outline of the talk is as follows: What is a calorimeter? Facilities MARK-J. JADE-lead glass.

This review addresses some of the metabolic sequelae of total parenteral nutrition with hypertonic glucose as the primary source of non-protein calories. The consequences of administering glucose calories in excess of energy requirements are considered. The patterns of gas exchange, fuel utilization and fuel storage in nutritionally depleted and hypermetabolic patients are discussed with specific reference to fat metabolism. Administration of glucose in hypercaloric quantities may produce a respiratory as well as a metabolic stress. The former appears to be related to a ventilatory stimulus associated with an increased rate of carbon dioxide production. In acutely ill patients, this response is magnified and there is also a considerable rise in oxygen consumption and free norepinephrine excretion. It is this group of patients which shows the most profound elevation in minute ventilation. The metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms which may be involved are discussed.

These efforts have so far resulted in several generations of iron-air batteries, high energy density nickel-iron batteries and a multi-purpose filter press cell for electrochemical synthesis. In a metal-air battery it is necessary to have a uniform distribution of air over the air electrodes and a good circulation of electrolyte through the system. These two requirements together with a need for low volume can be met by a filter press stack design where the electrodes are welded to polymer frames which form a stable and compact pile. Prototype batteries with capacities up to 30 kWh have been tested in vehicles and the cell design has proved to fulfil the requirements. With the objectives to develop a modular cell that can be used in laboratory and pilot evaluations, as well as in commercial manufacture of chemicals, a new monopolar membrane cell system has been designed in accordance with the filter press principle. The electrodes attached to injection moulded frames are made of polymer material, and stacked with membranes (if needed) in between to form modules of desired size. The projected electrode area of such a module can be in the range 0.08 to 1.04 m2. By electrically connecting several modules in series, cell systems of different sizes can be obtained. This system has been evaluated in well known reactions and shown a markedly improved current yield and selectivity when compared to results obtained from other cell designs. In both these cases the technique of injection moulding the frames was chosen in order to obtain an economical production. Many of the most critical tasks for the frames such as uniform flow distribution, electrode fixing, turbulent promotors etc., can be obtained through this technique. Furthermore, exclusive polymer materials resistant to most chemicals and heat can be used. In this paper, the design principles of different electrochemical cells are presented together with the two systems developed by SU. © 1981 Elsevier Sequoia S.A.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49149135950

This paper explores the role of electrochemistry in replacing oil with other energy sources at a minimum capital cost. This role may be very important in developing a new energy economy in which heat-engines are replaced by fuel cell devices at much higher second-law efficiencies, and in which energy utilization is optimized by storage.

TBPP was selected because the simple decomposition pattern of the pure product facilitates an interpretation of the concentration dependence. Differential thermal analyses, isothermal and adiabatic storage tests have been used analysis of the decomposition. From the experimental results it is found that the total heat of decomposition is proportional to the peroxide concentration, the activation energy is independent of concentration, and the reaction order varies slightly with concentration. The type of diluent influences the reaction rate. The results are applicable in the 290-360 K temperature range.

As the cost of energy increases, so increases the desirability to place these marginal fields on stream. This paper presents the Sea Plex, a conceptual design that offers the offshore industry a new and innovative drilling/production/storage system complex that can be retrieved once the reservoir is depleted... and then, can be towed to another site for reuse after meeting any inspection and recertification requirements. It combines the proven technologies of the concrete storage caisson with that of the jackup to form a stable offshore structure. Also, it is capable of safely storing several days' production, thereby offering continuous on-station operation. Initial results of development studies indicate this concept to be feasible for worldwide applications in water depths ranging from 30 to 150 m (98-492 ft) and for severe sea states and environments such as those found in the North Sea.

In many instances the injected steam prematurely breaks through into producing wells creating steam channels. It is believed that overall recoveries of a steam drive can be improved if the steam channeling can be controlled. This paper documents efforts under a Department of Energy cost sharing contract to reduce steam channeling in a conventional steam drive using ancillary materials. A steam foam solution and a steam foam encapsulated in a polymer gel are being introduced in four steam injection patterns in the North Kern Front Field near Bakersfield, California. The ability of the ancillary materials to improve recovery will be determined through injection profiles, chemical tracer surveys casing vent gas analysis, core and log data, and irllll oil saturation data, as well as through temperature and production data. It has been shown that in-situ steam foams can be used to alter the steam injection profiles to prevent excessive steam channeling. The results of early production data have indicated that as much as 125 B/D of incremental oil is being produced by the four chemical treated patterns. © Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE/DOE Enhanced Oil Recovery Symposium, EOR 1981.

Specific conditions are established for the last assumption, which may be in force for stably operated squeeze film bearings. Relatively simple expressions are presented for the thermal performance variables (temperature field, average temperature, Nusselt number) for a variety of cases. The results are interesting from a heat transfer point of view in that the proper energy balance consists of dissipation, conduction, and storage terms, rather than convection terms as is usual in lubrication studies. Thus inferences drawn from other thermal analyses may be in error. Both average cross-film temperature rise and heat transfer are seen to increase from zero Peclet number and asymptotically approach constant values. Due to the negligible convection conditions, the conventional definitions of bulk temperature, Nusselt number and Peclet number are not appropriate.

The two designs differ in method of transferring heat from hot combustion gases to produce steam. A low pressure combustion design transfers energy to water through a heat exchanger thus enabling the combustion process to be conducted at a pressure less than the injection pressure; a high pressure combustion design mixes the combustion gases directly with water, resulting in the injection of steam and combustion gases into the reservoir. The comparative development program has included analysis of energy efficiency, computational examination of recovery, core recovery experiments, and field evaluation. Field tests have been conducted under low reservoir injection pressure (2.76 MPa). The tests were carried out in a 260 m (800 ft) deep reservoir utilizing a 2.5 acre five spot pattern. Data collected from injection and production wells included fluid flow rates, fluid compositions, and energy content. The reservoir conditions were monitored by a combination of global flow measurements and simultaneous core flow tests. Test resufts have demonstrated that the recovery with the high pressure combustion design is equivalent to the low pressure design at low reservoir pressure. The injection of combustion gases with steam have reduced the quantity of air contaminents released to the atmosphere. © Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE/DOE Enhanced Oil Recovery Symposium, EOR 1981.

The storage, distribution, and power facilities were fully adequate at the time they were constructed and were planned for eventual expansion to additional areas. However, changes in cropping patterns, a need to provide full irrigation service, rising ground water levels and increased operation and maintenance costs created a need to improve and modernize the irrigation facilities. In addition, significant increases in fuel costs have made several potential hydroelectric sites appear to be feasible for construction. Beginning in 1970, the District initiated an extensive program to modernize its irrigation facilities and add hydroelectric generating capacity. The paper describes the steps being taken to improve and modernize the system. (from authors abstract)",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040211365

Storage and tidal data have been used in the computation of the annual energy which would be obtained from a barrage located in Strangford Narrows. Suitable turbo-generators have been selected and optimal speeds, rated head, installed capacity and submergence requirements determined. Annual energy outputs for various combinations of turbines and refilling sluices have been calculated and the upper limits of development established. Several possible barrage sites have been considered and a final preferred site has been selected at Kilclief Point near the outlet of Strangford Narrows to the Irish Sea. Barrage construction has been considered in sufficient detail to determine the likely forms of construction for the Power Station, the sluiceways, and the embankment sections. The use of the barrage as a road link is discussed, as is the effect of such a barrage on flood control, land drainage and sewage disposal. The major environmental issues are outlined and problem areas requiring further investigation and research are identified. The principal conclusion of the study is that despite the rather small tidal range at Strangford, the combination of very large storage with short barrage length make future tidal energy costs attractive when compared with predicted oil-based electricity prices.

Embryonic, larval and adult stages of development have characteristic types of energy metabolism. The lipid catabolism of the embryonic stage is substituted during larval development by anabolic pathways based on resorbed sugars absorbed from spruce needles. During the first larval stages these soluble carbohydrates are directed to a glycogen pool in relatively large amounts. This pool is only slightly enlarged whereas lipids are synthesized in relatively large amounts between the 14th and 28th day after oviposition. Metamorphosis is correlated with a decrease of glycogen. Lipids are used as an energy source by imagines and in eggs. “Energy” is distributed in the body by movement of trehalose in the larval stage and by a proline‐alanine‐shuttle in the adult stage. 1981 The Netherlands Entomological Society",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032098446

The ecosystem (which might be a forest glade, a cornfield, or a wood lot) is above the size scale of a leaf, an insect, an animal, and a human being as a locus of energy transactions. Horizontal uniformity is the principal criterion. Areal extent influences development of the unique atmospheric boundary layer of an ecosystem, hence its coupling with the atmosphere. Size tends to be small in urban landscapes and larger in areas of mechanized flatland agriculture. As size increases, the interaction with neighboring ecosystems diminishes. Land form, especially in dissected topography, affects the income of radiant energy and the power of the atmosphere to ventilate an ecosystem, illustrated in the contrasts of temperature in concave and convex topography. It also affects the substrate. The soil of an ecosystem provides essential storage space for energy, water, and other substances. As this storage is alternately drawn down and replenished, it evens out the responses of the ecosystem to fluctuations in radiation and other inputs. The sun, a major but variable source of energy for all ecosystems, is the only source for the energy-conversion process of photosynthesis, which yields the highest-grade output that ecosystems produce; it also provides lower-grade (longer in wavelength) energy that is important in other aspects of ecosystem energy budgets. © 1981 Academic Press Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023425443

Aquatic ecosystems characteristically are deep, and this implies a storage capacity that is large even if stratification develops. Whether its components are emergent plants, submerged macrophytes, or algae and other microphytes, the large depth of a supporting fluid distinguishes aquatic from terrestrial ecosystems. The fluidity of water, its low viscosity, and large specific heat make it an ideal heat carrier, and turbulence in a water body efficiently diffuses sensible heat, especially in the upper photosynthesizing zone. Aquatic ecosystems extract sensible heat from the atmosphere more easily than terrestrial ones because their daytime surface temperature is generally lower than that of the air in summer and almost always so in spring. Aquatic ecosystems also extract vapor from moist air.

The subterranean part of a terrestrial ecosystem has a substantial capacity to take in, store, and pay out heat, which buffers the fluctuations in ecosystem temperature that result from fluctuations in absorbed radiant energy. The substrate flows of heat determine the warming and cooling of ecosystem soil and its overall temperature, which affects water uptake, decomposition of carbon compounds, fixing of atmospheric nitrogen and other vital processes. Ecosystem soil forms a closed system, and in analysis heat flux data are combined with thermal capacity. The thermal capacity of a substrate is one factor governing how much heat can be removed from the surface and is the product of specific heat per kilogram of the material and its density. Substrate heat fluxes are large in desert ecosystems because much of the heat-storing soil body lies exposed to incoming radiation and so becomes the active surface. Storage of sensible heat in the soil does not occur in one continuous 6-month wave, but rather is the accumulation of hundreds of daytime intakes and nocturnal withdrawals of heat. Substrate storage of heat is a clear expression of seasonality, which is a large-scale variable in the energy climate of a region. © 1981, Academic Press Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023374298

In an actual rotor design, specific swept volume and specific energy storage should be maximized using practical manufacture techniques and available fibre materials. Several rotor designs are explored including: multimaterial - multiring and single material multiring with low modulus interfacial wraps; single material and mutimaterial ring-on-ring with manufacture controlled interfacial pressure; and multimaterial bi-annular ring-on-ring with dynamic interfacial loading through material selection.

Fossil energy in the management of extensively exploited ecosystems includes wilderness and wildlands; rangeland; and forest. Ecosystems that receive outside material inputs that contain fossil energy are receiving an energy subsidy. The chapter describes the fossil-energy conversions in farm operations. Land preparation and management is back-breaking work, and new machines are introduced; each one represented an input to the farm of urban labor and industrial energy that increasingly came from coal. These machines are horse-drawn for several decades, and the inputs of fossil energy to agriculture consisted largely of that incorporated in the steel used. The economic and energetic integration of maize, oats, and alfalfa ecosystems into an operating farm system is made possible by physical integration of material flows. Green chop is carried from the alfalfa field to the cow barn for daily consumption; harvested hay and corn are collected at the farmstead and after processing (grain drying, silage shredding) are put into storage in corn cribs, silos, and hay barns. © 1981, Academic Press Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023332258

The dissociation pressure of Mm3-mA1Ni3 (A : Al, B, Cu, Mn and Si) hydrides was higher than that of MmNi5 hydride, whereas the dissociation pressure of Mm∗ N′h-yBy (B : Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Si, Ti, V and Zn) hydrides depended on the content of the metals, which substituted partially for nickel, and log P decreased in proportion to y. The dissociation pressure of MmKu-vBy hydrides decreased in the following order : Mn&gt;Al&gt; Cr&gt;Si&gt;Fe&gt;Co&gt;Cu. A linear correlation was found between log P and the cell volume of the alloy for the MmNi5_yBr The trend of lower pressures along with the Mn and Al contents were in agreement with the cell volume correlation observed in other AB5 compounds.

The enthalpy changes in hydride formation determined from the dissociation isotherms for MmNi4.5Al0.5-H, MmNi2.5Co2.5-H, MmNi4.5Cr0.5-H and MmNi4.5Mn0.5-H systems were -5.5, —8.4, —6.1 and —4.2 kcal/mol H2, respectively. These values were smaller than or nearly the same as those of LaNi5 and MmNi5. The dissociation pressures were 2. 5, 2. 0, 4. 8 and 2. Oatm at 20°C, respectively. The apparent activation energy of hydrogen desorption for these alloys were smaller than those of LaNi5 and MmNi5. For MmNi4.5Al0&gt;5, MmNi2.5» Co2.5, MmNi4.5Cr0.5 and MmNi4.5Mn0.5 the hydrogen absorption-desorption cycles were repeated 500 times but no variation in the hydrogen absorption-desorption capacity was observed.

The objective of this system is to store solar heat during the daytime by circulating the warm greenhouse air through the pipes buried in the greenhouse soil, and to gain heat from the soil through the pipes during the nighttime. However, the problem is that the frequent attack of energy crisis on Japanese protected cultivation has forced the farmers to adopt this system without any quantitative analysis. Of course, some experimental results are available but theoretical analysis has not been conducted as far as the authors know. The purpose of the present study is, therefore, to check the performance of the system as well as to evaluate the parameters involved in the system. The effectiveness of the temperature increase in the greenhouse is found to be evaluated by the ratio of the overall heat transfer coefficient around pipes times the total pipe surface area plus the overall heat transfer coefficient through the greenhouse soil surface times the greenhouse floor surface area to the overall heat transfer coefficient at the greenhouse cover times the greenhouse surface area (see Fig. 3). It is also apparent from this ratio that the heat release from the greenhouse soil surface is rather significant in this system and in general it would be 20—30% of the heat gain through the buried pipes. The effect of the material difference of the pipes has been examined and it is concluded that the effect on the greenhouse air temperature is within 0.2°C among PVC, polyethylene and steel (Table 3). From the evaluation of the pipe dimensions, it is concluded that the difference of thickness is not significant and the optimum diameter is 11cm as far as the greenhouse air temperature is concerned (Table 4). In order to select an adequate fan for the system, the friction loss due to the plenum duct made of concrete can not be neglected. It is found that the adoption of smooth ducts could reduce the friction loss of this part significantly and the consumption of electricity, consequently the greenhouse air temperature is increased (Fig. 4). The same tendency is clear in the case of two way air flow direction system against one way (Fig. 5). © 1981, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

These quantities are needed for combustion stability analysis of solid rocket motors. The experimental set up consists of a tube with a disk of solid propellant sample placed at one end and a combination of an exhaust valve and an acoustic driver placed at the other end. Performing a test consists of turning on the acoustic driver to excite a standing wave of a predetermined frequency in the tube, ignition, and burnout of the solid propellant sample. During a test, acoustic pressure data is measured by fifteen pressure transducers distributed along a distance that includes, at least, two standing wave pressure minima. The data are transferred via a fast analog-to-digital converter to a minicomputer system for immediate storage and later analysis. The measured acoustic pressure amplitude and phase data are input into a newly developed data reduction procedure that is based upon the solution of the impedance tube wave equations, for the determination of the admittance and response function of the tested solid propellant sample and the acoustic energy losses in the gas phase. The paper presents results obtained in a series of tests conducted with an A-14 propellant.

A complete mechanism has been proposed which accounts for virtually all of the known observations on this reaction. This reaction is novel in that both the triplet and the singlet state of AOH+ appear to be active photochemically. We have shown that mechanisms previously proposed for this reaction are probably incorrect due to an artifact. At pH 7 the fluorescence quantum yield φs of AOH+ is 0.26 ± 0.02 and the fluorescence lifetime is 1.8 ± 0.2 ns. φs is pH dependent and reaches a maximum of 0.56 at pH 4. The fluorescence of AOH+ is quenched by MV2+ at concentrations above 1 mM and the quenching obeys Stern‐Volmer kinetics with a quenching rate constant of (1.0 ± 0.1) × 1010M−1 s−1. The quenching of the AOH+ excited singlet state by MV2+ almost certainly returns the AOH+ to its ground state with no photochemistry occurring. EDTA also quenches the fluorescence of AOH· with Stern‐Volmer kinetics but with a smaller rate constant (6.4 ± 0.5) × 108M−1s−1 at pH 7. In this case the quenching is reactive resulting in the formation of semireduced AOH. In the presence of MV2+, flash irradiation of AOH+ does result in the reversible formation of the semireduced MV† which absorbs at 603 nm. We attribute this to a photochemical reaction of the triplet state of AOH+ with MV2+. The initial quantum yield for formation of MV† (φMV:)0 was found to be constant at 0.10 ± 0.05 for [MV2+] from 5 × 10−5 to 1.0 × 10−3 with [AOH+] = 8 × 10−6M. Previous workers had found that (φMV:)0 appears to decrease with decreasing [AOH+]; however, on careful investigation, we found this was most probably due to quenching of the triplet state of AOH+ by trace amounts of oxygen. When EDTA is added to a mixture of AOH + and MV2+ at pH 7, the photochemical formation of MV† becomes irreversible as the [EDTA] is increased. The quantum yield for the irreversible formation of MV† exceeds 0.10 becoming as large as 0.16 for [EDTA] = 0.014M. This fact requires that an alternative photochemical process must be operative and we present evidence that this is a reaction of EDTA with the excited singlet state of AOH+ to produce the semi‐reduced AOH‐ which then reacts with MV2+ to produce MV†. The full kinetic scheme was tested by computer simulation and found to be totally consistent. This also enabled the processing of a full set of rate constants. When colloidal PtO2 was added to the optimal mixture [EDTA] = 3.4 × 10−2M; [MV2+] = 5 × 10−4M; [AOH+] = 4 × 10−5M; pH6 H2 gas was produced at a rate of 0.2μmol H2h−1. Thus, acridine orange should serve as an effective sensitizer in reactions designed to use solar energy to photolyze water. Copyright © 1981, Wiley Blackwell.

The storage temperatures were: (1) ‐23°C, constant; (2) ‐23°C and ‐21°C; (3) ‐21°C and ‐18°C. Compared to the ‐23°C, constant room (as reference), a net energy saving of 6 and 14% was obtained for the two di‐thermal storage rooms by maintaining the temperatures at the lower levels for one 12‐hr period followed by the higher levels for another 12‐hr period. The weight loss for most products was negligible, except for bulk‐packed hamburger patties which lost over 1%. The results on sensory, nutritional, and other quality attributes of frozen boxed beef products showed no serious quality damage from both constant and di‐thermal storage after 1 yr, except for MPB and beef patties whose practical shelf life was limited to 6 months.

Gold-Selective Plating (GSP) substrates for multi-chip package, Thick Film (TF) substrates for multi-chip package and Single Chip Packages (SCP) which have a trimetal combination of refractory metal (tungsten), Nickel and Gold. The bonding parameters such as the bonding tool (thermode) temperature, pressure, bonding time and preheat temperature were examined on each substrate to get optimum values. As the result, a relation between pull strength and the lead deformation shows that the TAB leads should be bonded with 15-65 percent deformation, the recommended parameters are; the tool temperature of 380-430°C, the bonding pressure ranging from 35 to 45 kg/mm2, with the preheat temperature of 150°C and the bonding time from 1.0 to 2.5 seconds. The evaluation of initial bondability shows that TAB GANG Bonding has the capability of excellent bonding strength; above 120 grams with standard deviation of less than 20 grams, and the necessity of OLB pads flatness; less than ±12 /xm for one ounce copper lead. The normal storage of the substrate and the lead does not affect the bondability. And the results of accelerated aging test of 125°C, 150°C and 175°C for more than 8,000 hours show that a lifetime of greater than 70 years at 65 °C operating temperature is predicted. The effective activation energy for the pull strength degradation is 0.86-1.05 eV. This is in reasonable agreement with predictions for interdiffusion of Cu-Au. And no significant degradation of the electric resistance was observed on the GSP samples. The feasibility and the high reliability of the GANG Bonding for gold-plated TAB outer leads were confirmed. © 1981, Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Aging of materials; Bonding; TAPE AUTOMATED BONDING; Integrated circuit testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956443637

This development has opened exciting opportunities for engineering science and technology. Among these are the use of the underground for the production, storage, conversion, transportation and final use of energy including the ultimate disposal of radioactive waste products from nuclear power plants.Improved methods for the production of primary energy by conventional means such as drilling for petroleum and mining for coal are now supplemented with in situ processes. These mean enhanced recovery and will make currently nonaccessible sources of fossil fuel available for future exploitation.Oil importing countries' desire to hedge against sudden supply shortages make huge underground cavities necessary for the storage of petroleum. With respect to natural gas the necessity to cope with large load variations calls for short term storage facilities. Here liquid natural gas in underground caverns may offer attractive solutions both from the economical point of view and when safety aspects are considered.Long term storage of solar energy as well as the tapping of geothermal heat flows implies large underground storage cavities as well as subsurface heat extraction methods.Medium to small thermal nuclear plants may be safely located nearby or even within urban centers to be used for district heating. It has also been suggested that nuclear reactors for power generation should be placed underground both for the sake of public safety and for economical reasons.Using water as an energy vector for fairly long distance transportation of heat in unlined rock tunnels is already a proven technology. This offers economically alternative means for the utilization of waste heat from nuclear power plants. The method applies to district heating and to consumers of low temperature heat such as green houses.For energy intensive industrial applications surface location may be excluded in built up areas. Here the subsurface space may provide unconventional siteing possibilities.The final disposal of radioactive waste presents a serious problem for which subsurface space at present seems to offer the only viable solution. © 1981 Pergamon Press Ltd Published by Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Disposal of radio active waste; Energy production; Storage and distribution of energy; Subsurface energy technology",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944044049

The experiments performed on these complementary types of cooling systems over the past year have reinforced the design of an antiproton collection system using both methods of cooling. Antiprotons from a target bombarded by 80-GeV protons are collected in a storage ring at 4.5 GeV and stochastically cooled in a stepwise deceleration scheme to achieve a momentum-spread reduction of a factor of about 250 in about 9 seconds. The antiprotons are then transferred to a lower-energy electron cooling ring for further cooling and accumulation. This system, using the virtues of both stochastic and electron cooling, will allow the accumulation of enough antiprotons in a few hours to give luminosities of 1030 cm-2 sec–1 for collisions between protons and antiprotons at about 2-TeV center-of-mass energy in the Fermilab Tevatron.

The magnitude of the biases depends on heating rate, activation energy (E), and rate constant (k0). Typical errors are -10 to -15% in k0 and +0.5 to +1.0kcal per mole in E. An iterative linear solution is proposed to eliminate these errors. A nonisothermal storage test enables the activation energy and frequency factor of a reaction to be obtained from a single experiment. Several methods have been described which differ in their time-temperature relationships or in the numerical methods used for parameter estimation1-0. Within the pharmaceutical area the first of these methods was devised by Rogers (1963)1. In the Rogers' method the temperature is programmed so that the reciprocal of the absolute temperature varies logarithmically with time: Substituting this into the Arrhenius and first-order equations and integrating yields: Rogers has suggested that the last term on the right hand side becomes negligible as the temperature increases (i.e. k greatly exceeds k0) so a plot of log[In(C0/C)] versus log(1+t) will be linear provided initial data are omitted. Hence E and k0 can be evaluated. The method has been assessed experimentally by Cole &amp; Leadbeater (1966)' who suggested that it yields accurate and reliable results. However an examination of their aqueous kinetic results indicates that parameter estimates may be biased; therefore the method has been re-assessed. This has been done using synthetic data so eliminating random variation which may obscure biases in individual experimental tests. Thus expected or long term average biases have been estimated. © 1981 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907035629

Green vegetables are generally considered as good sources of folic acid. In this study, the folacin content of a popular Egyptian vegetable, mulukhiyah (Corchorus oliterius) was analyzed and found to be substantially higher than that of other folacin-rich vegetables. The free folacin activity of the fresh mulukhiyah (containing 74.6 percent moisture) was 556 mcg and the total folacin activity, 800 mcg per 100 g fresh weight. The corresponding values for the dry vegetable (containing 8.6 percent moisture) were 662 and 1132 mcg per 100 g dry weight. The moisture loss and folacin retention in mulukhiyah under three drying conditions were compared. Freeze drying and tray drying were more efficient in water removal from the vegetable than room drying, but would require additional equipment and energy cost. The folacin retention resulted from tray drying, and freeze drying was only 7–10 percent higher than that attained in room drying. Thus, room drying seems to be an economical and convenient method for home preservation of mulukhiyah in Egypt without significantly affecting the folacin content in the dried product. Dry mulukhiyah was stored for 48 weeks at room temperature under various packaging conditions.

Here, we suppose we can substitute for the complex effective intermolecular potential, different mean potentials acting on each individual molecule. The defining assumptions for a discotic mesophase include the stipulations, first-that each simple disk-like molecule is, during most of the time, confined to a cell, secondly-that each molecule has an external rotation which is more or less hindered by a periodic potential. The cells are stacked in columns and the columns form a regular hexagonal array, each molecule moves in a cell as in an infinite potential well due to the neighbouring molecules. This model has allowed the general formulation of the mesophase-free energy. From this, we obtain the form of the coefficient of isothermal compressibility when the external rotations of the molecules are hindered and the vibrational energy is weak. © 1981 the Indian Academy of Sciences.","cell theory; Discotic mesophase",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51649163054

The image storage process relies on optically induced changes in the switching properties of ferroelectric domains (photoferroelectric effect). Stored images are nonvolatile but can be erased by uniform UV illumination and simultaneous application of an electric field. Although high quality images, with contrast variation of ≥100 : 1 and spatial resolution of ∼10 μm, can be stored using the photoferroelectric effect, relatively high exposure energies (∼100 mJ/cm2) are required to storethese images. This large exposure energy severely limits the range of possible applications of nonvoltile image storage in PLZT ceramics. We have recently found from studies of H, He and Ar implanted PLZT that thephotosensitivity can be significantly increased by ion implantation into the surface to be exposed. For example, the photosensitivity after implantation with 5 × 1014 500 KeV Ar/cm2 is increased by about three orders of magnitude over that of unimplanted PLZT. The image storage process and the effect of ion implantation is presented along with a phenomenological model which describes the enhancement in photosensitivity obtained by ion implantation. This model takes into account both light- and ion implantation-induced changes in conductivity and gives quantitative agreement with the measured changes in the coercive voltage with light intensity for ion implanted PLZT. © 1981.",,"DATA STORAGE - Optical; FERROELECTRIC MATERIALS - Ion Implantation; DATA STORAGE - Optical; FERROELECTRIC MATERIALS - Ion Implantation; CERAMIC MATERIALS; Ceramic materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49149136585

At 298 K the primary photoreaction directly occus from the S1(n,π*) and T2(n,π*) states, and it proceeds from T1(π,π*) and from S2(π,π*) either directly or via T2. At lower temperature on direct irradiation. S1→T intersystem crossing and triplet reaction compete with reaction from the singlet. The rearrangement 12a→14a-c proceeds along three reaction paths evolving from the two primary photochemical processes of naphthyl-vinyl and vinyl-vinyl bonding in β-position to the CO (12→25+29). Two ground-state triplet diradical intermediates such as 25 and 27 have been shown to intervene consecutively-for the first time in di-π-methane photochemistry. Each has been characterized by ESR and IR, and the second one additionally by fluorescence and fluorescence excitation, and by laser flash photolysis. The failure of products 14a-c to interconvert photochemically is ascribed to efficient energy dissipation through thermally reversible pbotocleavage of the 3-membered ring. Compounds 12 and 14 thermally interconvert in the dark which constitutes the first example of a ground-state counterpart of a di-π-methane photorearrangement. The thermal reaction includes a path with highly regioselective (and possibly concerted) product formation competing with a stepwise process causing positional scrambling. The sequence 12→14 (photochemically; Φ = 1.0 at 366 nm and 298 K) and an electrophile-catalyzed reversal 14→12 in the dark is a model of a chemical light energy storage cycle which can be conducted without loss of reactants. © 1981.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49149134844

LNG must be stored in a cryogenic temperature of -162°C. The storage tanks now existing throughout the world can be divided into above-ground and inground types. In the Tokyo area, there are now 22 in-ground LNG storage tanks, either in operation or under construction, which are constructed with primary consideration given to safety and earthquake-proof design because of the circumstances around the LNG terminals. In the feasibility study of a very large-scale, in-ground LNG storage tank, comparative preliminary studies were made of various construction methods. Among them, the method using artificial ground freezing was proposed, in which it was planned to utilize the frozen soil as the means of ground water control and the temporary retaining wall. To confirm the feasibility of the design, a model tank test was conducted by freezing the actual tank yard. The yard ground, composed of sand and silt layers, was artificially frozen 10 m in diameter and 50 m in depth; in the frozen soil a shaft of 4 m in diameter was sunk to a depth 26 m below the ground level for various tests and measurements. The purpose of the test was mainly to confirm the construction method and to examine the agreement between theory and practice. Although this construction method has not been adopted in the actual tank work, the feasibility of the method itself has been confirmed as a result of the test.

The SOLAR DESAL program could also be used to simulate desalination units of RO and ED which employ diesel generators. The program has been structured to allow the interchange, substitution, and elimination of major subsystems, a flexibility necessary for tradeoff analyses and parameter studies. Reliability considerations are included in the code calculations by the computation of times of failure and of repair. Program logic is based upon the availability of a particular component/ subsystem in addition to the usual temperatures, flow rates, etc. The desalination code simulated the production of water from a wind energy conversion system powered reverse osmosis plant. The plant included pretreatment, battery storage, backup diesel generator, and water storage and demand simulations. This is in addition to solar thermal collectors, photo voltaics, a second desalination subsystem, heat engine, waste pond, recovery turbine, and various minor subsystems and components such as heat exchangers piping, pumps, chiller, etc. Program modifications include the TRNSYS 10.1 solar radiation processor to compliment the existing distribution functions, including Weibul, found in the code.

The code has the capability of two different types of solar thermal collectors, two different photovoltaic cells, and two different, or two similar, desalination stages. Solar energy calculations are made for basic units such as a row of thermal collectors connected together to provide the necessary temperature and mass flow, or photovoltaic modules connected in series and/or parallel to obtain sufficient voltage and current.

The present experiment was done at the center-of-mass energies s=62 and 44 GeV and in the dimuon pair invariant-mass region m=3-25 GeV. The dependence on the Feynman variable x has been measured. The average transverse momentum is found to increase with s and with mass and reaches pT 1.9 GeV, compatible with predictions from quantum-chromodynamic gluon processes. © 1981 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243610147

Four spacecraft have now travelled beyond the orbit of Jupiter - Pioneer 10/11 and Voyager 1/2 - and are producing a growing body of distant observations of solar cosmic ray events. Initial studies using Pioneer 10/11 data out to ∼6 AU interpreted flare particle observations in terms of a diffusion model, including the effects of convection and adiabatic energy loss. This model enjoyed general success in explaining the time-intensity profiles in cases where the spacecraft connection longitude at the sun did not change significantly with time. The results implied that the radial diffusion coefficient (Kr) increased slowly with distance over that radial range. More recent results at larger distances imply that Kr may begin to decrease beyond ∼5 AU. It is not yet clear whether the standard diffusion model will be adequate to explain solar events well beyond 5 AU. The fact that large events at very large distances can last up to two solar rotations implies that solar wind stream structure will also play a role in the event dynamics. In general, however, observations at large distances offer perhaps the best hope of separating interplanetary propagation effects from coronal storage and propagation effects which frequently dominate observed event profiles at 1 AU. © 1981.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41749122987

At low mercury pressures ≲1 Torr, the well-known UV emission band due to HgNH3* is dominant; this regime has been investigated extensively over the past ten years. However, at higher pressures the UV band disappears and is replaced by a strong green emission band, centered near 500 nm. From a detailed study of the spectral and temporal characteristics of the green band, it is concluded that it arises from the formation of the Hg 2NH3* (or Hg2ND3*) excited molecular complex. The lifetime of this exciplex has been measured and is found to be 3.8 μsec (±25%). Because of interest in the system as a potential energy storage laser medium, optical transmission measurements have been carried out at selected wavelengths. Net absorption has been observed across the green band at high mercury density, as well as in the UV band in the low density regime. © 1981 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36749111456

The model includes an account of soil heat storage and of the action of a simplified crop canopy in regard to radiation absorption, heat dissipation, transpiration and stomatal movement. The fluid-roof greenhouse concept embodies a selectively absorbing aqueous solution that slowly flows through a transparent, hollow roof to a storage tank and back. It has been suggested that such a device could be used to store unneeded day-time solar energy for later use, thus reducing day-time heating of plants and external energy needs for both night-time heating and day-time ventilation of the greenhouse space. Our calculations show this to be true for both winter and summer in South-Central Texas and in South-East France, near the Mediterranean. Reductions in heating requirements of 20-40% and virtual elimination of the need for forced ventilation are predicted. The theoretical calculations justify additional engineering and horticultural research to exploit the fluid-roof solar greenhouse concept in a practical way. © 1981.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249751861

The modular nature of both solar cells and storage batteries make it possible to use either a centralised or a decentralised system within a village. A critical analysis of the electrical energy requirements of the village including its domestic, agricultural, community and street lighting needs and its technoeconomic aspects is therefore to be made for the most cost effective and maximum beneficial choice between (a) the centralised village energy centre or (b) highly decentralised roof top units within the village. A methodology is first developed in this paper to investigate this problem on the basis of balance of systems (BOS) cost per peak watt and is then applied to a typical village in West Bengal, India.

The organization of the components involved in the photoinduced process in interfacial systems leads to efficient compartmentalization of the products. Several interfacial systems, e.g. lipid bilayer membranes (vesicles), water-in-oil microemulsions and a solid SiO2 colloidal interface, were designed to accomplish this goal. An electron transfer across a lipid bilayer membrane leading to the separation of the photoproducts at opposite sides of the membrane is facilitated by establishing a transmembrane potential and organizing the cotransport of cations with specific carriers. Colloidal SiO2 particles provide a charged interface that interacts with charged photoproducts. By designing a system that results in oppositely charged photoproducts, a retardation of recombination by the charged interface can be produced. The photosensitized reduction of a neutral acceptor by positively charged sensitizers is described. The reactions are substantially enhanced in the SiO2 colloid compared with in the homogeneous phase. The effect of the SiO2 interface is attributed to a high surface potential that results in the separation of the intermediate photoproducts. The quantum yields of the photosensitized reactions are correlated with the interfacial surface potential and the electrical effects of other charged interfaces such as micelles are compared with those of SiO2. The possible utilization of the energy stored in the stabilized photoproducts in further chemical reactions is discussed. Special attention is given to the photodecomposition of water. © 1981.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27844463174

In the present study, the one-photon ionization of perylene (Pe) and tetracene (Tet) in anionic lauryl sulfate (NaLS) or neutral Triton X 100 (TX 100) micelles has been compared with the photoionization process in homogeneous solutions (tetramethylsilane (Me4Si) or methanol). The photoionization yield as a function of the exciting photon frequency has been measured by photocurrent recording (in Me4Si) or by scavenging the hydrated electrons by various neutral or charged scavengers (N2O, NO3-, H+). The shape of the photoionization efficiency curves in the threshold energy region is found to differ markedly for Pe or Tet in NaLS micelles on one hand and neutral micelles or homogeneous solutions on the other. It is suggested that such a difference illustrates the reduced recombination of geminate ion pairs in the former case. The lowering of the ionization threshold energy of Pe and Tet in micelles (ΔIMi) relative to their gas-phase ionization potential amounts to 2.3-2.35 eV for both solutes. ΔIMi is interpreted in terms of the parameters which have been currently considered to govern the optical ionization of impurity molecules in condensed media. In such a framework the electric field gradient at the micelle-water interface does not seem to contribute significantly to the observed ΔIMi value. © 1981 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542533940

Since the ion confinement property of the r.f. quadrupole trap for externally injected ions is energy dependent, phase-synchronized switching-on of the driving r.f. field can be employed to trap only a narrow energy portion of the ion beam, which is incident with a large spread. It is shown that the magnitude and the width of the accepted ion energy can be selected and that energy-selective storage of ions can be achieved in two different ways. The first way is to choose suitable trap operation parameters to achieve a very narrow time delay interval for ion confinement at theion energy of interest. The second way is to allow a field-free drift distance before ion injection and to take advantage of the energy spread of the ion packed. In both ways an energy window of less than 1 eV at an ion energy of 10 eV cam be obtained. When the ion trap is operated at the mass-selective tip of the stable region instead of at the center, an even higher energy-selectivity is possible.

To cite an exemple, recent work on a model bitumen-silica composite has given insight into the role played by the interface. In this case, the respective influences of interfacial area and degree of matrix/filler interaction on the storage modulus of the composite have been quantitatively established. Although many factors intervene, clearly the strength of the interface must depend to a large extent on both the number and the nature of the bonds between the two phases. In cases in which only physical bonds (e.g. Van der Waals) are formed, the interfacial strength may be predicted from the surface characteristics of the two solids in contact. A study of such a system, aluminium/elastomer, has shown the significant contribution of the free surface energies of the two components to mechanical resistance, locus of failure and environment effects. In many real composite materials, interfacial bonds of a chemical nature must be taken into account. The influence of these chemical bonds will be examined by considering results obtained from polymer/polymer and polymer/glass interfaces. Despite the general applicability of the conclusions of these interfacial studies, it mustnevertheless not be forgotten that, in certain cases, the properties of the interphase in the proximity of the interface, are of fundamental importance. It is for this reason that it is of the utmost importance to define tests which enable the direct measurement of the stress-transfer capacity of both interfaces and interphases in composite materials. © 1981, Walter de Gruyter.

With the recent efforts to commercialize active collectors of solar radiation, interest in developing solar-powered desalting systems has been revived. Among the new viable concepts is the design of a Hybrid RO-ED commercial plant to desalt sea water. The design is based on the development of a stand-alone system that provides 6,000 m3/day at a minimum cost of product which can eventually compete with cost of water from conventional desalting plants. A detailed design description, design parameters and cost estimates are provided in this paper. The plant is based on the combined use of reverse osmosis and electrodialysis in a flexible multi-staged hybrid technique. AC power is to be generated for the reverse osmosis first stage using a solar thermal power system based on line focusing thermal collectors and ranking cycle power conversion. DC power for the electrodialysis second stage will be produced directly from a solar photovoltaic field. Although both the ED and RO desalting concepts are individually inherently more adaptable to solar energy than vapor phase processed because of their energy efficiency, there is considerable merit in the hybrid concept as applied in this design over the choice of either concept for the total desalting process. First, the RO first stage and ED second stage can be completely decoupled in their operation. This provides for a significant operating flexibility since with power supplied by a flat plate photovoltaic array, the ED system can be run under conditions of diffuse insolation which would render the thermal concentrating collectors very ineffective. Each stage in conjunction its power source can be optimized with respect to its own operating day. In addition, because the output rate of the ED system can be adjusted to respond to varying available power levels, the ED system can be run at partial output at portions of the day when solar thermal power is unavailable with no loss in process efficiency. A total reverse osmosis system offers no such operating flexibility requiring either larger arrays or large amounts of storage to be available for converting an irregular daily insolation energy pulse to a square wave power output. Second, the interface between the RO and ED is adjustable providing a range of first stage product salinities and blending ratios of RO product and pretreated feedwater. This allows an optimum system which minimizes product cost by minimizing RO size and ED energy use, thus minimizing overall thermal and photovoltaic array requirements. Unlike the RO system, which suffers severe membrane degradation at high temperatures, the ED membranes are tolerant to feedwater temperatures as high as 160°F. The energy usage of the ED process decreases with increasing feed stream temperature. The second stage feedwater can be used for condenser cooling providing the synergistic effect of reducing parasitic pumping and the ED power requirement. Finally, the ED and RO systems are of rugged design with few moving parts other than pumps. This feature provides maximum reliability in often hostile operating environments, minimizing maintenance requirements over vapor phase systems. The plant is sized to operate 2A hours per day with minimum battery storage to reduce the cost. The selected system has several innovative features, although it is designed using off-the-shelf components and equipments. Variation in the salinity of the sea waters could be handled by controlling the blending ratio of the feed to the ED. Such control is much simpler than recycling or change in pressure. The function of the ED stack as an active part of the PV-DC electrical circuit would be to provide a constant overall rate of production independent of the hourly variation in insolation. Also, the ED can be designed to save power demand from the PV system by heating the feed and by changing the load. Recirculation of the product in the ED system to assist the RO system in case of emergencies is also possible. Furthermore, the use of ORC allows the use of low temperature thermal system. © 1981.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242644440

Light efficiencies of flash tubes can be increased by choosing gases of high atomic mass and total efficiencies, as defined by the ratio of light energy integrated over all wavelengths to electrical energy of the storage capacitor, of about 40% and more have been achieved. The optical properties are determined by temperatures and densities in the channel during the discharge. It is found that the time dependence of emission can be measured by multipliers, fast cameras, and spectrometer. © 1981, Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039501020

The equilibrium dissociation constant for [3H]dihydrotestosterone (Kd=(2-5)×10-11 M) was estimated from independently determined rates of association and dissociation, and was lower by one order of magnitude than the value obtained by saturation analysis (Kd=(2-8)×10-10 M). Evaluation of the effect of temperature on receptor binding of androgen allowed the estimation of several thermodynamic parameters, including activation energies of association (4 kcal/mol) and dissociation (14 kcal/mol), the apparent free energy (-13 kcal/mol), enthalpy (-9 kcal/mol), and entropy (+14 cal/mol per K). The receptor was greatly stabilized when bound with androgen. The results indicate how the lability of the unbound receptor and slow rate of dihydrotestosterone-receptor interaction can influence the estimation of dissociation constants by usual saturation analysis. The sedimentation coefficient of androgen receptor in freshly prepared cytosol was 6S, and became 7S after storage for 2 months at -80°C. The 7S conversion of the receptor was reversed by treatment with heparin. In all cases, a single 7S peak was obtained in the presence of 0.5 M KCI. On electrophoresis in heparin-containing polyacrylamide gel, protein-bound radioactive androgen migrated as a single peak (Rf=0.5 in 5% gel). Differences in reported values for the sedimentation coefficient of androgen receptor in cytosol of Shionogi carcinoma 115 appear to be derived largely from aggregation of the receptor protein during the assay procedure. © 1981, by the Japanese Biochemical Society.",,"androgen receptor; androstanolone; binding affinity; breast; breast carcinoma; in vitro study; Animal; Binding Sites; Centrifugation; Cytosol; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Female; Kinetics; Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental; Mice; Receptors, Androgen; Receptors, Steroid; Stanolone; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Temperature; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019831064

The identified new applications totaled 950 000 m3/d (280 000 acre-ft/year), in addition to the 200 000 m3/d (60 000 acre-ft/year) now in operation. The total market was visualized in order of development as existing A-level projects (200 000 m3/d); B-level greenbelt and lower-order industrial projects (374 000 m3/d); C-level industrial and power-plant cooling projects (200 000 m3/d); and D-level groundwater recharge projects (372 000 m3/d).

According to California Department of Health Services' project criteria, the standard treatment process for B-level projects is activated sludge secondary treatment, followed by dual media filtration and chlorination to ensure a virologically safe effluent. C users will require lime softening prior to filtration in order to provide adequate cycles of concentration in cooling towers. Much of the variation in delivery system cost among projects was attributable to differences in pumping energy and degree of user clustering. Generalized curves for estimating delivery system capital and O&amp;M costs for pipelines, pump stations, storage reservoirs, user hookup, and replumbing were displayed as a function of total dynamic pumping head and degree of user clustering. (Costs for advanced treatment may be added separately on the basis of judgment). Despite the wide variation in cost from project to project, the percentage contribution of individual components to delivery system capital cost was fairly stable, with pipelines typically accounting for 70-75%; pump stations, 10-15%; storage, 5-10%; and onsite replumbing and user connections, 5-10%.",,"cost; economic aspect; prevention; therapy; waste water recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019830259

It was purified 10–30‐fold by DEAE Sephadex chromatography (Fraction I). The enzyme required divalent metal ions for activation; Mn2+ was almost as effective as Mg2+, but Ca2+ was only a weak activator. Activation by Mg2+ took place over a very narrow concentration range (0.5–3 mm). The specificity of the enzyme activity to nucleoside triphosphates was broad, to the nucleoside diphosphates narrow, favouring adenosine diphosphate. In dependence on the pH the activity increased from pH 4 to pH 7 and remained constantly high between pH 7 and 9. The Arrhenius plot was linear between 5 and 70°C, with an activation energy of 11.1 kcal/mol. The phosphoryl group transfer reaction depended on the function of thiol groups; p‐hydroxymercuribenzoate inhibited 50% of the enzyme activity; dithioerythritol reactivated it completely. Gel electrophoresis revealed that in Fraction I, a protein of molecular weight about 45,000, was enriched compared with the total soluble proteins. The enzyme‐enriched Fraction I differed significantly in its relative amino acid composition from that of the total soluble proteins; in general, the acidic amino acids were reduced and the more basic acids enhanced.

IR values, defined as the relative intensities of two characteristic diffraction peaks of unstable A-form and stable B-form were useful for this purpose. Storage experiments using Witepsol H-15 suppositories containing 1% Brilliant Blue were performed. During storage, the changes of melting point, softening time and drug release rate were measured and compared with IR. Each of these properties showed a correlation with IR value irrespective of storage temperature or period. With lapse of time, the IR values commonly fell to a minimum in the earlier period, subsequently increased to a maximum and then remained constant. This change depended markedly on the storage temperature, so we attempted to predict the IR change using two rate parameters. One was the half-transition time t1/2 and the other was the shift factor AT calculated by the reduced variable method. On plotting these rate parameters against 1/T, good linear relations were obtained, and the activation energies were 98 kcal and 108 kcal for t1/2 and AT respectively. Using these values, prediction of the physical stability of the suppository seems to be possible. It was also shown that this IR method is applicable to other commercial fatty vehicles. © 1981, The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

Med., Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States; McClellan, G.","Approximately 60-70% of the total fiber calcium was localized in the terminal cisternae (TC) in resting frog muscle as determined by electron-probe analysis of ultrathin cryosections. During a 1.2 s tetanus, 59% (69 mmol/kg dry TC) of the calcium content of the TC was released, enough to raise total cytoplasmic calcium concentration by ~1 mM. This is equivalent to the concentration of binding sites on the calcium-binding proteins (troponin and parvalbumin) in frog muscle. Calcium release was associated with a significant uptake of magnesium and potassium into the TC, but the amount of calcium released exceeded the total measured cation accumulation by 62 mEq/kg dry weight. It is suggested that most of the charge deficit is apparent, and charge compensation is achieved by movement of protons into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and/or by the movement of organic co- or counterions not measured by energy dispersive electron-probe analysis. There was no significant change in the sodium or chlorine content of the TC during tetanus. The unchanged distribution of a permeant anion, chloride, argues against the existence of a large and sustained transSR potential during tetanus, if the chloride permeability of the in situ SR is as high as suggested by measurements on fractionated SR. The calcium content of the longitudinal SR (LSR) during tetanus did not show the LSR to be a major site of calcium storage and delayed return to the TC. The potassium concentration in the LSR was not significantly different from the adjacent cytoplasmic concentration. Analysis of small areas of 1-band and large areas, including several sarcomeres, suggested that chloride is anisotropically distributed, with some of it probably bound to myosin. In contrast, the distribution of potassium in the fiber cytoplasm followed the water distribution. The mitochondrial concentration of calcium was low and did not change significantly during a tetanus. The TC of both tetanized and resting freeze-substituted muscles contained electron-lucent circular areas. The appearance of the TC showed no evidence of major volume changes during tetanus, in agreement with the estimates of unchanged (~72%) water content of the TC obtained with electron-probe analysis.",,"calcium; animal experiment; electron microscopy; muscle; muscle spasm; sarcoplasmic reticulum; Animalia; Anura",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019810179

The boiler consisted of a double-glazed flat-plate solar collector, a flash chamber, a water cooled surface condenser, a circulating pump, and a temperature-controlled preheater to simulate constant temperature thermal storage. Data were obtained on this boiler from October 1980 to May 1981. During this period, the instantaneous total incident solar radiation at noon, as measured by a pyranometer in the plane of the collector ranged from 0.7 to 1.0 kWm-2 and the diurnal total incident solar radiation ranged from 13 to 29 MJ m-2day-1. At these conditions the instantaneous efficiency of the collector ranged from 30 to 55 percent while the diurnal efficiency ranged from 20 to 44 percent. The results show that the performance of the solar collector was the dominant factor in determining the performance of this boiler.

Respirometry experiments were conducted to assess the role of various endogenous foodstuffs in providing reduced two‐carbon fragments for aerobic metabolism. Liver composition was measured as a reflection of foodstuff flux and storage. Catabolism of 14C‐labeled substrates to 14CO2 was monitored to estimate the tissue capacity for utilization of various classes of compounds. When measured at the temperature of acclimation, oxygen uptake (V̇O2 by liver slices shows near perfect compensation between 15 and 25° C, whereas a 2.75‐fold increase is found between 5 and 15°C. Respiratory quotients (R.Q.) near unity are found at 5° C and decrease to 0.85 and 0.82 at 15 and 25° C, respectively. Inhibition of V̇O2 by iodoacetic acid, a glycolytic inhibitor, is near 60% at 5° C and decreases to 30–40% at 15 and 25° C. Evolution of 14CO2 from 14C‐labeled glucoses and palmitate confirms a conservation of liver tissue capacity for carbohydrate utilization between acclimation temperatures of 5 and 15° C, and an increasing capacity for utilization of fatty acids as temperature increases. Ratios of 14CO2 from 14C‐6‐and 14C‐1‐labeled glucoses indicate a relative increase in the participation of the pentose shunt in carbohydrate metabolism with cold acclimation. The results are consistent with an increasing reliance on carbohydrates for energy metabolism in the cold, whereas lipid substrates are utilized more at warm temperatures. These changes may be adaptive in partitioning energy reserves for seasonal activities of migration and reproduction.

However, rehabilitation of old systems and pumped storage arrangements may make hydro projects more attractive. Constraining factors include the reluctance of a large power organization to deal with management of a string of small plants, problems with control and technical questions about price, and high engineering and environmental assessment costs. This paper compares the economic aspects and environmental effects of several types of power generation: oil, coal, gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, and innovative technologies. Major factors in the use of alternative power generation methods are the escalating costs, especially of oil; land destruction and acid emissions connected with coal; large reserves and easy transmission of gas; and public concern over long-term effects of nuclear plants. Hydropower, on the scale of thousands of MW, will continue to be the main focus in the Canadian power industry. As the large sites are developed, attention will turn to low head sites with capacities of hundreds of MW. -from Selected Water Resources Abstracts",,"electric powerplants; energy sources; environmental effects; hydroelectric power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019745434

Using a dynamic computer simulation model, two solar-driven systems are considered: one using flat-plate collectors and a 76°C MEE desalination plant, the other using evacuated tubular collectors and a 95°C MEE plant. Various combinations of collector area and thermal storage volume are considered, and optimal values determined for each case. For the particular example chosen (lOOm3/day, located at 23 1 2°S) the flat-plate collector system was superior at current prices, giving an overall water cost of $5.82/m3 versus $7.34 for the second system.

A field of line-focus tracking solar collectors is used to heat a high pressure liquid-vapor water storage tank supplying two compound reciprocating steam engines, one direct-connected to the RO high-pressure pump and the other to an electric generator for auxiliary power. An auxiliary heating loop with an oil-fired boiler is also used to supply the steam engines. The system operates in either all-solar, all-oil, or mixed solar/oil modes. Primary operating mode is assumed to be a mixed solar/oil mode in which the oil-fired boiler is used only to prevent shutdown of the RO system during the course of a partly sunny day. In this mode, the RO system does not come on line in the morning until the solar collector field has brought the high-pressure storage tank to a point near maximum operating pressure. Thereafter, the oil-fired boiler comes on automatically whenever the storage tank is drawn down to a pressure near minimum full-power operation (due to inadequate or intermittent insolation) and remains on, supplying the steam engines, until the solar collectors have again brought the storage tank to the high-pressure cutoff. In the all-solar mode, the system continues to operate at reduced power as storage tank pressure drops below the point at which the oil-fired boiler would otherwise come on. A portion of the RO system is shut down to maintain pressure in the remainder. The all-oil mode is used whenever fresh water is required during non-sunny periods, or to increase fresh water production in sunny periods. © 1981.",,"SOLAR ENERGY - Applications; SOLAR POWER PLANTS - Saudi Arabia; SOLAR DESALINATION PLANTS; DESALINATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019739422

We explicitly take into account the convective heat and mass flux through the pond surface and evaluate the temperature and heat fluxes at various levels in the pond during its year round operation by solving the time dependent Fourier heat conduction equation with internal heat generation resulting from the absorption of solar radiation in the pond water. Eventually, an expression, for the transient rate at which heat can be retrieved from the solar pond to keep the temperature of the zone of heat extraction as constant, is derived. Heat retrieval efficiencies of 40.0 per cent, 32.1 per cent, 28.3 per cent and 25.5 per cent are predicted at collection temperatures of 40, 60, 80 and 100°C, respectively. the retrieved heat flux exhibits a phase difference of about 30 to 45 days with the incident solar flux; the load levelling in the retrieved heat flux improves as the thickness of the non‐convective zone increases. the efficiency of the solar pond system for conversion of solar energy into mechanical work is also studied. This efficiency is found to increase with collection temperature and it tends to level around 5 per cent at collection temperatures about 90°C.

Injection and recovery temperatures, flow rates, and temperatures at six depths in 10 observation wells and hydraulic heads in seven wells were recorded twice daily. The second‐cycle injection, which was performed in a manner similar to the first, began on September 23, 1978, and continued until November 25, 1978, when 58,010 m3 of water had been pumped into the storage aquifer. The major problem experienced during the first cycle, a clogging injection well, was reduced by regular backwashing. This was done 8 times during injection and resulted in a 24% average injection rate increase compared to the first cycle. A 63‐day storage period ended on January 27, 1979, and production of hot water began with an initial temperature of 54°C. By March 23 this temperature had dropped to 33°C, with 66,400 m3 of water and 76% of the injected thermal energy recovered. This compares to 66% recovery during the first cycle over the same drop in production temperature. Production of hot water continued until April 20, at which time 100,100 m3 of water and 89% of the injected thermal energy was recovered at a final production temperature of 27.5°C. During the second cycle, measurements were made of relative land subsidence and rebound to a precision approaching 0.1 mm. The surface elevation near the injection well rose 4 mm during injection, fell during storage, and fell more rapidly toward its original elevation during production.

The method consists of rewriting the stochastic nonlinear optimization problem of n state variables as n −1 problems of two state variables which are solved by dynamic programing. The release policy obtained with this method for reservoir i is a function of the water content of that reservoir and of the total amount of potential energy stored in the downstream reservoirs. The method is applied to a power system of four reservoirs, and the results obtained are compared to the true optimum.

The unit stores a substantial amount of heat for the next day morning's use when the top cover is insulated during the off-sunshine hours.

The SPEWP consists of a solar cell array, storage of electrical energy or water, controls, an electric motor and a pump. This paper deals with the characteristics of each element in a spewp and its mathematical model. The mathematical model of the whole system is studied and analysed. The solutions of the non-linear equations yield a method for determination of the rate of volume flow, the head of water and the efficiency of the system as a function of the radiation levels. The pump motor is studied and so is its operation point and the torque under varying conditions of the load and the solar energy available. A numerical solution of the mathematical equation is presented describing the torque of the series d.c. motor as a function of its characteristics and the non-linear nature of the solar cell array (SCA). The centrifugal pump operation is analyzed by the torque equation and its variations as a function of the pumped rate of flow and the rotation velocity is studied. A method for determination of the pump parameters is given. Finally, we discuss the principles and method for obtaining the rate of volume flow and the head of water as a function of the radiation levels. The theoretical results are compared to measured ones allowing us to examine the validity of correction factors. The authors believe that this paper contributes to better design of SPEWPs, which, in many cases, even without improvements are being chosen today over conventional water pumping systems. © 1981.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SOLAR CELLS - Arrays; SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR POWERED ELECTRIC WATER PUMPS; PUMPS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019711354

In order to facilitate calculation of this irradiance, five typical sunshapes are chosen from the widest to the narrowest shape in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory data and are approximated by a sum of 6 gaussian distributions. An effective sunshape can then be obtained by convolution with error-cone distributions that represent a statistical description of uncertainties encountered in an optical concentrating system. Convolution of circular-normal error cones first with the sum of gaussians and then with actual sunshape indicates good agreement whenever the error-cone dispersion is greater than 0.0012. Thus the analytic convolution can replace more costly (in time and computer storage) numerical calculation.

The onset of ignition was determined by time-resolved absorption of the 3.39 μm He-Ne laser line. Measured induction times ranged from 15-1200 μs over the temperature interval 1200-1850 K at total densities near 3×10-5 mol/cm3, corresponding to a pressure of about 4 atm at 1600 K. It was found that the induction time of a mixture of 1% CH4 in air is shortened by factors of 3, 9 and 13 for the addition of 0.2% C3H8, 0.2% C2H6+0.1% C3H8 and 0.2% C2H6 +0.1% C3H8+0.1% n-C4H10, respectively. The temperature variation of the induction times for these fuel mixtures is essentially constant and given by: exp (26000±600 K/T), in agreement with ignition delay studies of CH4 in O2/Ar mixtures. The activation energies for ignition of mixed fuels are thus controlled by the oxidation mechanism of CH4. A qualitative interpretation based on changes of initiation and branching rates introduced by the additives is provided to account for the shorter induction times. © 1981 Combustion Institute.",,"AIR - Combustion; EXPLOSIONS; GAS STORAGE; NATURAL GAS, LIQUEFIED - Combustion; NATURAL GAS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019706107

The model was validated using experimental results of a solar pond located at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC), Wooster, Ohio. The model was then used to analyze the transient energy phenomena which occurred within the storage zone of the pond. Generalized daily weather functions used were the incident solar radiation upon a horizontal surface, the daylight length and the daily maximum and minimum ambient air temperatures. Various simulations were performed to evaluate the OARDC solar pond and to improve its overall effective capacity of heat storage. It was found that 4-6 weeks variation in start-up time and 5-10°C variation in start-up temperature had no effect on late summer peak storage temperature. The pond operated at a 20 per cent collection efficiency with a 1.5-m deep gradient. Insulating the pond in the winter would be beneficial if no heat was removed during the fall. Reducing the gradient zone thickness to 1 m and enlarging the storage zone could improve the performance of a 3-m deep pond. The model could be used to predict and analyze the transient thermal response of large storages associated with solar heating system for a variety of purposes and climatic conditions. © 1981.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR PONDS; SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019704510

Such an approach appears to be most suitable when the heat engine rotational speeds are high ( >6000 r/min) and, in particular, if they are operated in the variable speed mode and if utility-grade a.c. is required for direct insertion into the grid without an intermediate electric energy storage and reconversion system. Predictions of overall efficiencies based on conservative efficiency figures for the FMGS are in the range of 25 per cent and should be encouraging to those involved in the development of cost-effective dispersed solar thermal power systems. © 1981.",,"SOLAR ENERGY; THERMIONIC POWER GENERATION; ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019689362

An input energy-output energy lumped parameter transfer function was estimated from the data using ordinary least squares regression and several statistical tests to elicit an optimal order for the model.

The first of these is concerned with finding a least-cost solar system by considering the alternative use of either thermal or water storage. The second involves the determination of areas where solar energy would be economically competitive with electricity or fuel as a power source for pumping installations. A linear programming solution is developed to find the optimal combination of thermal and water storage for a solar installation. The formulation is then extended to determine a least-cost system when hybrid systems are considered. A hybrid system may incorporate a combination of solar, electric and fuel power inputs. The concept of a breakeven ""critical"" distance from existing infastructure for solar installations is developed, and an example problem is provided to illustrate typical values of this distance and to show its sensitivity to the base energy costs and rate of inflation for those costs. It appears that electrical pumping is probably the most economical alternative provided that electric infrastructure is located nearby. Fuel power will also be more economical than solar if there is a source of fuel near the proposed pumping site. However, solar systems may be economically competitive when considered for installation at realistic distances from existing infrastructure. © 1981.",,"ECONOMICS; ENERGY MANAGEMENT - Mathematical Models; PUMPING PLANTS - Energy Utilization; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019679975

The brine effluent of up to 680, 000 barrels per day at 90% saturation is the result of leaching storage caverns in the underground salt dome at Bryan Mound near Freeport, Texas, or the result of filling already leached caverns with petroleum.

The primary project study areas are physical oceanography, analysis of the discharge plume, water and sediment quality, nekton, benthos, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and these areas are supported by management, field and data management components . This paper summarizes the results from the predisposai and intensive postdisposal periods. During these periods, the project has generated a unique collection of base line data which have been collected for coastal waters over an extended period of time and placed in the public domain.

The study is based on a computer simulation which is supported by monitoring data from an existing installation, the Terrosi-Grumman house in Quechee, Vermont. Three different SAHP configurations as well as conventional solar and air-to-air heat pump systems are evaluated for a northern New England climate. All systems are evaluated both with and without a peak/off-peak electricity price differential. The SAHP systems are: (1) the series system in which the solar storage serves as the energy source for the heat pump, (2) the series off-peak system in which the heat pump in the series system operates only during certain periods of the day under a special electric rate structure, (3) a parallel system in which the environment is the source for both the collector and the heat pump, and (4) a peak/off-peak parallel system in which oil is operated during the period of peak electricity price. Hybrid air-to-air heat pump/oil systems are also evaluated. For all alternatives, two different economic analyses are used: (1) the rate of return which emphasizes the return earned on the capital investment, and (2) the life cycle critical price which compares the current capital cost to the present worth of the stream of all future energy savings. Both economic measures select the air-to-air heat pump/on-peak oil system when there is a peak/off-peak electricity price differential. (In this case the ratio of off-peak to average price is 40 per cent.) When there is no price differential, the air-to-air heat pump/oil system is still preferred, but the oil system is now operated when the ambient temperature falls below -6.7°C (20°F). When the electricity price is doubled (from 19.5 to 40$/GJ), solar/oil is the preferred system. © 1981.",,"COMPUTER SIMULATION; HEATING - Solar; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SOLAR ENERGY; HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019667979

The results of the present analysis (in the absence of withdrawal of hot water from the tank) are seen to be in better agreement with experiments than the corresponding results of Ong, obtained by use of the finite difference method.

Box 3745, Jerusalem, Israel","Tabor, H., The Scientific Research Foundation, P.O. Box 3745, Jerusalem, Israel","This report provides the background to, and the current status of, solar ponds as proven viable large-area collectors capable of providing both low-cost thermal energy and mechanical or electrical energy using state-of-the-art low-temperature turbo-generators. After a short background statement giving the history and motivation to create a viable large-area collector with built-in storage, the basic theory of salt-gradient solar ponds is sketched. (More detailed-theory is available from the given references, particularly two recently published handbooks.) NaCl and MgCl2 are two common and low-cost salts suitable for solar ponds. A number of problems such as the adverse effect of wind, leakage, fouling-and their solutions-are indicated as are some fundamental constraints (Section 8) that limit the sites suitable for solar ponds. Practical details include how ponds are built and filled and how the heat is extracted. Section 7 presents a condensed account of solar pond experience in a number of countries. Practical operating temperatures of 90°C are obtained with collection efficiencies usually between 15 and 25 per cent: this permits a number of practical applications as discused in Section 10, i.e. heating and cooling, power production and desalination. Realistic pond cost figures indicate thermal energy costs equivalent to US$41 per ton of fuel for a sunny climate (using a conservative 11.7 per cent annual charage on capital): such low-cost calories permit thermodynamic conversion to power: although the conversion efficiency is low, the solar pond power station (SPPS) is viable in many cases. Bus-bar power costs, for a sunny climate, vary from a high of US13.5 cents/kWh-using present technology-to a low 5.3 cents in sizes of 20 GWhr(e) per annum or larger. A 150-kW SPPS has already been built and successfully operated in Israel since December 1979 and a 5000-kW unit is due for completion in the next 2 yr. The ability of a solar pond to store heat even from summer to winter greatly increases its usefulness in almost all applications: for power production, the SPPS can-like a hydro-electric plant, provide peaks of power, on demand-far in excess of the pond mean capacity. The estimate that SPPS costs flatten out at 20-40 MW is of interest to developing countries that could install generating capacity in relatively small steps as demand grows. © 1981.",,"MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR PONDS; SOLAR RADIATION",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019663740

The variation of heat flux during the processes of heat storage and removal was measured by a heat flow meter wrapped around the capsule, as the capsule was subjected to stepwise variations of the surface temperature. Finite difference calculations based on heat conduction were also carried out to compare with the experimental results. For the heat removal process, the experimental results and the calculated heat flux agreed well with each other.

This paper presents the results of a comprehensive computer simulation study of the performance of active solar heating systems with long-term hot water storage. A unique feature of this study is the investigation of systems used to supply backup heat to passive solar and energy-conserving buildings, as well as to meet standard heating and hot water loads. Findings show that system performance increases linearly as storage volume increases, up to the point where the storage tank is large enough to store all heat collected in summer. This point, the point of ""unconstrained operation"", is the likely economic optimum. In contrast to diurnal storage systems, systems with annual storage show only slightly diminishing returns as system size increases. Annual storage systems providing nearly 100% solar space heat may cost the same or less per unit heat delivered as a 50 per cent diurnal solar system. Also in contrast to diurnal systems, annual storage systems perform efficiently in meeting the load of a passive or energy-efficient building. A breakeven cost 4¢-10¢/kWh is estimated for optimal 100 per cent solar heating in the U.S.A. © 1981.",,"COMPUTER SIMULATION; ENERGY STORAGE; SOLAR ENERGY; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019655210

The code is aimed at radiation-shielding applications and in particular at providing a means of accelerating Monte Carlo calculations in situations of awkward geometry. With this aim in mind several methods of solving the multigroup equations have been investigated including factorized inversion, conjugate gradient, Gauss-Seidel and several types of two-grid techniques based upon two compatible linear and quadratic finite element meshes. Results indicate that iterative methods seem to offer more potential for shielding calculations due to their greater speed, smaller storage requirements and ability to give an estimate of the diffusion flux in situations not requiring too exact a solution. Problems involving over 9000 nodes and 5000 quadratic tetrahedral elements have been solved for a single finite element mesh but further work is required to extend the two-grid option to treat problems over approx. 6000 nodes and 3000 quadratic tetrahedral elements. © 1981.",,"COMPUTER AIDED ANALYSIS - Applications; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - Finite Element Method; RADIATION PROTECTION; NEUTRONS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019652932

In the first experiment, 28 crossbred sows received one of two dietary treatments that were initiated on day 100 of gestation. The control group was fed daily 1.82 kg of a corn-soybean meal-based diet plus an additional .18 kg of cornstarch. Their counterparts were fed 1.82 kg of a corn-soybean meal diet containing 8% bleachable fancy tallow. The effect of maternal dietary energy source during late gestation on glucose homeostasis was evaluated by fasting pigs from birth (t0), whereas the gestation-lactation effect was evaluated by fasting pigs after they had nursed the sow for 24 hr (t24). Pigs on the tallow treatment responded differently to the t0 fast, as determined by the patterns of plasma glucose (treatment x time, P less than .05) and free fatty acids (treatment x time, P less than .10). The tallow group maintained a slightly higher glucose concentration during the initial 24 hr, after which no difference was observed. Control pigs reached a peak free fatty acid (FFA) concentration by 12 hr, whereas the tallow group reached a maximum by 24 hr, which corresponded with declining glucose concentration. Pigs on the t24 tallow treatment maintained a slightly higher plasma glucose concentration during the initial 24 hr of fasting (12 hr - 68.3 vs 63.2 mg/100 ml; 24 hr - 67.1 vs 56.3 mg/100 ml); however, no significant treatment effect or treatment x time interaction was observed. Pigs on the tallow treatment maintained a higher, although not significantly different, plasma FFA concentration during the fast (144 mueq/liter) than pigs in the control group (126 mueq/liter). In the second experiment, progeny of 12 sows were sacrificed immediately after birth. The respective carcass lipid (percentage) and liver glycogen (milligrams/gram) concentrations for pigs from sows fed the control and tallow diets were 1.48, 229.1 vs 1.50, 234.9.

In this experimental study, the dynamic mechanical properties of these gels were determined using test‐tube torsion pendulums and an air‐bearing torsion pendulum. The modulus at a fixed concentration of polymer and boric acid increases with increasing sodium ion concentration up to the point where the atom ratio of sodium to boron reaches 1. Higher sodium concentrations do not increase the modulus. The log decrement, on the other hand, decreases with increasing sodium concentration continuously without reaching a plateau at the equal atom ratio. Log decrements as low as 0.02 can be measured.

Lab., Livermore, CA 94550, United States","Currently, storage and retrieval of spent nuclear reactor fuel assemblies in granite are being tested 420 m (1,4000 ft) underground at the U.S. Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site. Eleven Westinghouse PWR spent fuel assemblies from Turkey Point Unit No. 3 (Florida) have been interspersed with six electrical heaters to compare the effects caused by heat alone with those of heat and radiation. Two parallel side drifts, which contain electrical heaters, allow a simulation within the central drift of the thermal field of a large single-level nuclear-waste repository. Instrumentation involved in this Spent Fuel Test includes multi-point rod extensometers, thermocouples, convergence-wire extensometers, three-axis fracture monitoring systems and vibrating wire stressmeters. With emplacement complete, data on nuclear radiation, air and rock temperature, humidity, rock stresses, and displacements are being collected on a continuous basis by a computerized data acquisition system. Preliminary analysis indicates that geotechnical instruments are functioning except for vibrating-wire stressmeters located near the spent fuel canisters and rod extensometers in the canister drift. Stick-slip responses, possibly due to friction within the instruments, have been observed in all displacement instruments. While detailed interpretations of the data are premature, initial indications point to the tendency for deformations and stresses to increases more rapidly where there are shear zones.The basic objective of the spent fuel test described is to determine the feasibility of safe and reliable short-term storage and the subsequent retrieval of spent reactor fuel assemblies at a plausible repository depth in a granitic rock.

The consumer sectors are habitats, transportation and production; the sources are nuclear and solar energy, used in variously processed forms. Habitats permit a relatively continuous growth in power level from small crew sizes of tens of persons (p) at about 2 kWe/p to hundreds and more with selenic agriculture at ∼ 10 kWe/p. Power requirements for transportation are affected, for a given transportation level, by evolution in the direction of minimal gas release into the lunar environment (to protect the industrially valuable high vacuum and for economic reasons) and by demands for suborbital transportation. The propellant ( O2 H2 propulsion) expended for ascent can be captured as steam in enclosed launch tracks and, unless used as water, the hydrogen extracted by electrolysis to minimize costly supply from Earth. For an annual delivery of 10,000 metric ton (t) net payload to circumlunar orbit (60 km) at 35 t during 286 24-hr periods, at least 2.6 t H2 per 24-hr needs to be extracted, requiring a continuous output of at least 5 MWe (laser-powered H2-drive in enclosed launch track would not require extraction of H2, but laser power levels in the order of hundreds of MWe are required, because the energy must be transferred in minutes). Power levels in the production sector depend on product and particular operating conditions. For, 10,000 t of beneficiated raw material or solar cells produced in 286 24-hr production periods/year, the nominally continuous power level may range from at least 2 MWe for the extraction of iron to some 55 MWe for the manufacturing of solar cells from lunar sand. The principal differences influencing the assessment of energy sources on the Moon and in orbit are the long lunar night, mitigating against solar power, and the abundance of natural shielding material. The solar power/mass is reduced significantly, due to the need for large-scale storage provisions, if energy supply is to be assured at night (a situation, not improved by the establishment of large laser power satellites at equidistant libration points to beam solar energy at lunar night). Lunar conditions are particularly favorable for the economic use of nuclear power. For power levels above ≲ 50 kWe and productive operation around the clock, nuclear power (with the exception of radioisotopes from nuclear waste) is superior to all solar alternatives. Less costly, unaffected by a large number of day/night temperature variations, by corpuscular radiation and micrometeorites, readily shielded by lunar topography in the vacuum on the surface, long operating life (≳ 7 yr) and not requiring energy storage, nuclear energy is the optimum power source both for industrial heat and electricity. © 1981.",,"SPACE RESEARCH",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019633678

It was observed that significant mixing of the tank occurred when water was removed unless a diffuser manifold was placed on the makeup water inlet. The numerical model used was one-dimensional (vertical) with some degree of mixing at the inlet and outlet boundaries. The temperatures at the top of the tank were predicted fairly well, but the temperatures at the bottom deviated somewhat from the predictions.

The main advantage of this design is that the total radial force is only 5 ~ 10% that of previous designs resulting in small conduction heat leak through the insulating struts. The external pressure is less than 2 atmospheres which allows surface trench construction in surface rock; the pressures for previous underground bedrock designs were 20 to 100 atmospheres. A new use for diurnal storage is presented in which larger SMES storage units replace intermediate load generation. In the example given an allowance of $60-100 per kWh could be credited to SMES. This new higher value comes from replacing cycling coal or large oil burning intermediate generation. SMES can be used for intermediate load because its storage efficiency is 95%; all other storage systems, only 50 to 80% efficient, could not meet the intermediate use requirement. © 1981 IEEE",,"ELECTRIC UTILITIES; SOLENOIDS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019613829

The theoretical analysis is based upon a one-dimensional relativistic Hamiltonian formulation and is developed in a manner to take advantage of the analogy between the PEL process and radio frequency accelerators. Three promising operational modes arc identified and analyzed. The first may be thought of as an electron decelerator and is thought to have the most promise for single-pass devices. Both oscillator and amplifier configurations are studied. The second is based upon adiabatic trapping and detrapping, intended to reduce the spread in electron energy typically induced by the FEL process. The third is based upon the method of phase area displacement. It has the advantage of wide gain bandwidth and small induced energy spread, and is thought to have the most promise for storage ring applications. Generally speaking, it is found that high peak power is intrinsic to these modes of operation.

Alloys of composition TiCo1-xFex(x = 0.05 - 0.5) were found to have the same cubic structure as TiCo and they reacted readily with hydrogen to form the hydrides TiCo0.95Fe0.05H1.2, TiCo0.7Fe0.3H1.2 and TiCo0.5Fe0.5H1.2 (hydrogen contents, 1.1 wt.%) under a hydrogen pressure of 30 atm at room temperature. The dissociation pressures of these hydrides are dependent on the iron content x (the iron partially substitutes for the cobalt) and the value of log PH2 increases gradually with increasing x. The enthalpy change on hydride formation, determined from the dissociation isotherms for the TiCo0.5Fe0.5-H system, is -10.1 kcal (mol H2)-1; this value is smaller than those (-13.8 kcal (mol H2)-1 and -11.2 kcal (mol H2)-1 respectively) of the TiCo-H and TiCo0.5Mn0.5-H systems. The temperature required to produce a dissociation pressure of 1 atm is 70 °C, which is lower than the temperatures required for TiCo (130 °C) or TiCo0.5Mn0.5 (90 °C). A value of 6.2 kcal mol-1 was obtained for the apparent activation energy of hydrogen desorption. For TiCo0.5Fe0.5, only two cycles under mild conditions are needed for the activation treatment so the alloy can easily be activated.

The system consists of a mass of concrete or concrete insulation, one face of which is blackened/glazed and exposed to solar radiation and ambient air, while the other is in contact with room air at constant temperature. The heat can be extracted by the passage of water through the network of tubes in this block. It is seen that, by increasing the depth of the tubes, the rise in water temperature decreases but the time difference between the maxima of the solair temperature and that of the outlet water temperature increases. At a tube depth of 0·10 m, the maximum temperature rise of the water is 33·5°C. The corresponding efficiency of the system is 28·0% while the flow rate of water is 5·0 litre/h m2; the heat flux entering the room is also reduced considerably. © 1981.",,"SOLAR ENERGY - Applications; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019598065

A nitrogen pπ lone-pair valence band maximum is found. This is due to the planar nitrogen site, which is in turn duo to the repulsions between non-bonded second-neighbour silicon atoms. The conduction minimum is found to have a relatively low effective mass and be formed of Si 3« states. The density of states (DOS) for β-Si3N4 is calculated for two Si-N-Si bond angles, 120° and 107°. The DOS at the former angle, which corresponds to a planar nitrogen, shows an upper pπ valence band which has merged into the lower bonding bands at 107°. The effects of non-bonded silicon-silicon repulsions on the planarity of the nitrogen site and likely structure of amorphous silicon nitride are discussed. Unlike vitreous SiO2, commercial silicon nitride contains an appreciable proportion of impurities which may determine electronic transport and low-energy optical properties. The local electronic structure of ≡Si-Sin, ≡Si-H, ≡N-H and ≡Si-0-Si≡ impurity configurations are calculated, and the first two are found to give rise to states in the pseudogap-unlike in a-Si, hydrogonation will not remove all dangling-bond states from the gap of silicon nitride. The possible structures of coordination defects in silicon nitride are calculated by simple bond-orbital metheds and by use of molecular analogies. The low Lewis basicity of (SiH3)3N shows that over coordination of nitrogen is difficult, and so defects in silicon nitride aro expected to have a positive effective correlation energy.

In Upper Silesia where a number of existing mines work below a critical depth, several indices have been proposed and their numerical values found by experiment in order to classify the potential liability of coal seams to create rock-burst hazards. Three of these indices are most popular, namely the Strain Energy Storage Index (WET), the Bursting Efficiency Ratio (η), and the Rheologic Ratio (θ{symbol}). The first is defined as the proportion of strain energy retained to that dissipated during a single loading-unloading cycle of uniaxial compression. The second is the ratio of the kinetic energy of chips thrown out on failure to the maximum elastic strain energy. The Rheologic Ratio is calculated as a dynamic resistance stress rate (failure velocity) divided by an average stress relaxation rate. WET values may be obtained through laboratory tests or by direct (double-hole method), or indirect (rebound method) in-situ evaluations, while both η and θ{symbol} values are obtainable in laboratory solely. Each of the indices quoted leads to classifications and/or criteria for the bursting liability of coal. When complete predictions of the rock-burst hazard for a specific location in a mine are to be made, data on in-situ stress concentrations must also be collected. Since direct stress measurements in coal are hard to recommend as a routine procedure in mines, a number of indirect methods are currently being practiced, drilling yield and seismic wave velocity methods giving the most reliable results. © 1981.",,"COAL - Strain; ROCK - Absorption; ROCK MECHANICS; STRESSES - Measurements; STRAIN ENERGY; COAL MINES AND MINING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019597292

The maximum reduction in the modulus value and the minimum in the critical amplitude both occur in the region of Tg Shear fatigue of the material has been observed in the glassy state with a frequency‐ and temperature‐dependent fatigue life. It is found that the loss modulus under extensional creep depends upon the values of the deformation and stress whereas the storage modulus depends solely upon the deformation. The ratio of energy expended during static and cyclic deformations is shown to depend only upon the extensional deformation.

The composition of the alloy was varied from pure tin to 86 a/o Li using the coulometric titration technique. Coulometric titration curves showed that six intermediate phases exist, with nominal stoichiometric compositions LiSn, Li7Sn3, Li5Sn2, Li13Sn5, Li7Sn2, and Li22Sn5. At low lithium concentrations, the activity of lithium in molten lithium-tin alloys follows Henry's law behavior. The partial and integral molar thermodynamic properties of the lithium-tin system were evaluated as a function of composition from emf measurements at 415°C. The temperature dependence of the standard Gibbs free energies of formation for the six intermediate phases was also determined. The experimental results were used to map out parts of the phase diagram of the lithium-tin system. The homogeneity ranges of the six solid phases are all quite narrow. The phase LiSn congruently melts at about 488°C and the phase Li7Sn3 peritectically decomposes at 500°C. These two phases form an eutectic mixture of 57 a/o Li at 470°C. The liquidus line on the tin-rich side of the binary phase diagram was found to agree with data reported in literature. © 1981, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

The relatively simple upgrade of adding synchrotron acceleration capability to the storage ring would also allow important energy deposition and materials experiments. The feasibility of this upgrade depends critically on the beam loss rate from charge exchange scattering. A computer program has been written for the purpose of obtaining a better estimate for this lifetime. The code assumes a K-V transverse distribution folded into a Neuffer longitudinal distribution. The emittance ellipse parameters, along with various estimates for the velocity-dependent ion-ion cross sections, are read in and a numerical integration is performed over the distribution, yielding a value for the loss rate -1/N2 dN/dt. Preliminary estimates indicate that this mode of beam loss presents no obstacle to upgrading the ADF.

This beam energy cannot be safely disposed of within the confines of the ISABELLE lattice if damage to the dump or quenching of the superconducting magnets is to be avoided. Therefore the full intensity beam must be extracted from the storage rings under all circumstances of emergency or routine beam disposal. Beam losses in excess of 10–3 of the full beam can jeopardize the extraction components and lead to magnet quenching as well.

Proper choice of an RF structure for such a collider can minimize the total RF power requirement and the effects of longitudinal and transverse single-bunch beam loading.

This confirmed the flexibility of such sources, though experience of matching experimental rigs to them is still somewhat limited. The flexibility arising from the use of wigglers, plus the fact that the radiation flux no longer depends only on the beam current and energy but can be adjusted, at each source point, by choosing the number of wiggler poles and the wiggler field, means that the efficiency of a synchrotron radiation source can be increased. Whereas a conventional x-ray ring may allow extraction of 10% of its radiated power, an ""All-wiggler-Machine” (AWM) with 40 wigglers may allow 50% of its radiated power to enter the beam lines.

Since the main task of the synchrotron is to supply electrons and positrons at the highest possible injection energy for the storage ring PETRA, a reduction of the horizontal antidamping would be very advantageous for the following reasons: - smaller horizontal beam emittance improves injection efficiency in PETRA - injection energy for PETRA could be 8 GeV instead of 7 GeV - the repetition rate of presently 50 Hz could be reduced to 12.5 Hz without affecting the accumulation rate in PETRA. This would have further advantages for the operation of the synchrotron. Using the existing backleg windings of the magnets, the antidamping can be reduced as measurements show. Adding quadrupoles to the synchrotron magnet lattice would allow to introduce horizontal damping. The variation of the horizontal beam size during acceleration is shown.

With a dipole-quadrupole wiggler the radiation damping partition can be changed and with a dipole-octupole wiggler this partition becomes dependent on the phase oscillation amplitude. These wigglers can be operated so that the longitudinal damping is negative for small amplitudes but increases for larger amplitudes. The particle distribution will peak around the amplitude which gives neither damping nor antidamping. This leads to a longitudinal blow-up of the bunch core without affecting very much the tails or the quantum lifetime. The distribution has been calculated analytically with an appropriate Fokker-Planck equation and by computer simulation. The results allow the optimization of the wiggler parameters. Due to the sum rule for the damping partitions this wiggler also affects the distribution in horizontal betatron amplitudes.

To obtain a good heat conduction during bakeout and to reduce the resistive wall instability during beam operation, a 1mm thick copper coating will be electroplated to the outer surface of this 1.5mm thick beam tube. To minimize the beam loss due to beam-gas collision, the pressure inside the beam tube is required to be 1 x 10 Torr (N2 equivalent) or less. To achieve this ultrahigh vacuum, the outgassing rate of the 304 LN stainless steel tubes has been reduced to ~1 x 10 Torr·ℓ/cm2 • sec by vacuum firing at 950° C for one hour. However, during acid-bath electroplating of copper, significant amount of hydrogen will be reintroduced and trapped in stainless steel which will substantially increase the outgassing rate (to ~2 x 10-2 Torr·ℓ/cm2 · sec). The outgassing characteristics of these copper-plated beam tubes are studied and discussed within the scope of diffusion and energy of activation.

In this paper we discuss the interaction of cylindrical bunches and toroidal perfectly conducting bodies. This problem is treated in terms of electromagnetic wave scattering As a matter of fact, when the electromagnetic waves that travels together with the bunch, illuminates the obstacle, a scattered electromagnetic field appears, which modifies the energy of the bunch particles. This scattering problem is treated directly in the time domain, using space-time integral equations and solved by a time stepping approach. From the knowledge of the scattered field on the bunch axis, a transient potential seen by every particle is determined and the total energy loss of the bunch can be deduced. A numerical application for the case of toroidal obstacles with circular cross-section is presented. The transient potential obtained by beam-obstacle interaction is relevant to the determination of the bunch longitudinal equilibrium distribution. Particularly in high energy storage rings this potential (as well as the beam cavity interaction potential) can modify the bunch shape and involve current limitations.

The linac beam is composed of 1.2 µs current pulses containing 240 nC/pulse with a repetition rate of 1 kHz. Each pulse is injected vertically during a single turn into the pulse stretcher ring, a 377.89 m oval with a magnetic radius of 29 m. Excitation of an n/3 betatron resonance in the horizontal plane is used in conjunction with electric and magnetic septa for extraction. Typical extracted beam parameters are: horizontal emittance ≤0.3π mm-mrad, vertical emittance ≤0.1π mm-mrad, and an energy spread ≤0.1%. The extracted beam has a maximum average current of 240 µA, a duty factor >90%, and may be polarized. Beam characteristics, design parameters, and facility layout are discussed.

Presently available monitoring and analysis techniques when applied in the large population surveys required are very costly undertakings especially when information is to be gathered regarding energy profiles of end-use devices. This paper describes an economical and effective system for conducting the required load surveys. The system was developed by Thayer School of Engineering (Dartmouth College) for New England Power Service Company (NEPSCo), and has been successfully tested in prototype form. A key feature of the system is the fact that its load sensors can be installed without the services of a licensed electrician since no house wiring is disturbed. Microprocessor-based equipment, located at each house in the survey, compiles hourly energy-consumption data for each of eight branch circuits and records on low-cost magnetic tape casettes for monthly collection. The tape cassettes are in turn analyzed for the compilation of average usage patterns describing the population sample as a whole. Self-contained equipment provided for this purpose permits survey results to be obtained rapidly without dependence on the availability of large computers and the necessary access and analysis programing and possible long turn-around times.

The possible sustained fast load response of fossil-fueled power plants is described and the major factors which influence such performance are defined. Methods and features which can improve unit sustained fast load response are also discussed. Load increase performance of power plants can be improved by faster unit load control response and/or utilization of their energy storage capacities.

In addition to having a large storage efficiency (1.2-1.5%) at the highest pumping level and a thermal recovery time in the 15-30-min range, they are also scalable to large apertures and allow the propagation of circular polarization. An important additional property is that regardless of the angle of incidence, no birefringence occurs in active mirror amplifiers. Based upon a circular polarization scheme that allows passive switching, we have constructedand operated a double-passed active mirror system. For a 50-J input energy and a pulse width of 700psec (Gaussian FWHM), we have measured a focusable output energy of ≃230 J. Complementary single-pass experiments resulted in an output energy of ≃140 J, therefore, using the double-passed arrangement, we have increased the focusable output energy by ∼64%.

The objective is to control the collector fluid velocity so as to maximize the net energy collected over a fixed time period. Necessary conditions for optimality, given by a set of equations whose solution yields the optimal control, are derived. It is shown that the optimal control is an open-loop, bang-bang control which depends on two terms: a measurable quantity which depends on the state of the collector fluid, and a quantity which depends on a future knowledge of the weather data. It is also shown that for the case in which only two switches occur during the period of operation, the optimal control depends only on the temperature difference across the collector. Thus, one can construct a feedback on/off controller for the system provided that it is known a priori that only two switches will occur during the time interval under consideration. © 1981.","bang-bang control; bilinear control; closed loop systems; control theory; distributed-lumped models; flow control; Optimal control; partial differential equations; solar system control","CONTROL SYSTEMS, BANG BANG; CONTROL SYSTEMS, OPTIMAL; SOLAR RADIATION; nonbiological model; solar energy; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019569008

Specifically, three schemes of integration of SPV to the utility are compared: • SPV with complete utility buy-back and backup, • SPV with utility system storage, and • SPV with residential storage. In the cost comparisons, a buy-back ratio is not assumed. Instead, the credit to SPV is entirely determined by the cost savings to the utility. Also, a range of buy-back ratios are calculated using the savings due to SPV integration.

On the other hand, in the improved converter, the dynamic cross regulation performance is ameliorated along with the increase in the proportional gain. Further, it can be improved more satisfactorily by using the appropriate P-D control.

At low temperature ZnIn2Se4 material will present a high conductivity during and after illumination by light of energy greater than the band gap. This high conductivity state can be quenched in three different ways (i) by heating the sample until it reaches room temperature, (ii) by illumination with monochromatic light of appropriate energy, (iii) by an electric field. In the latter case the material exhibits a negative resistance effect in the transition between the low and high conductivity conditions.

Traditional reliability techniques and trade-offs are discussed and relationships between reliability, maintainability and availability are reviewed using minimum life cycle cost as the parameter to be optimized. A list of available techniques which are useful today is presented, as well as a list which provides a series of techniques that will be useful when more field and test reliability data on photovoltaic systems are available. Three typical solar photovoltaic systems are illustrated in block diagram form and discussed. These are (1) a stand-alone photovoltaic system, (2) a stand-alone system with battery energy storage and (3) a system with a utility back-up. Each system is analyzed to the subsystem level using two reliability analysis techniques: the failure modes and effects analyses (FMEA) and the fault tree approach. The FMEA is an approach which starts at the lowest level of the system being analyzed and considers each subsystem failure one at a time and two at a time, and traces upward through the block diagram to identify the effect these failures have on the total system performance. A summary of these results gives the designer an indication of the critical subsystems. The fault tree analysis is a logic diagram approach which begins with a failure of the system at its highest level to be the primary output of the diagram. Inputs to the analysis are made from those levels which can cause failure at the highest level. Thus, only subsystems which can cause system failure are included in the diagram. If probabilities of failure are available for the various subsystems, fault trees may be used to construct a probability analysis of the system to predict the probability of success or reliability of the photovoltaic system involved. In this paper, this analysis is performed using assumed values of probability of success for the subsystems considered. This discussion presents the view that taking reliability and availability into consideration early in the design at the system level will prevent some major field problems. It will also favorably influence the subsystem design goals, especially the control subsystems. In addition, this approach should encourage the early development of complete photovoltaic systems that satisfy the demanding availability precedent set by the electric utilities. © 1981.",,"SOLAR POWER PLANTS; SOLAR CELLS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019560667

Both emitted and incident electrons were used to measure changes in the electronics properties, i.e. work function. The variations in work function over the surface were obtained in both distribution form as well as topographic presentation using a scanning low energy electron probe (SLEEP). These measurements were correlated with simultaneously occurring compositional changes using Auger, gas desorption and ion scattering techniques. Measurements were made on realistic cathodes in actual vacuum tube ambients. The results showed that oxide-type cathodes poison within a few hours after shut-down by the adsorption of residual gases contained in the vacuum ambient. (The effects of CO2 were specifically demonstrated.) These adsorbates are, however, desorbed upon heating and in combination with other reactivation processes (such as formation of surface Ba layers when using reducing substrates), the cathode can reach full activation again by the time the temperature reaches the normal operating temperature. The poisoning and reactivation phenomena are a combination of a number of simultaneous processes, and studies to separate and identify these is the objective of part II of this paper. © 1981.",,"ELECTRONS - Emission; GASES - Adsorption; CATHODES, THERMIONIC",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019560325

The phenomenon suggests the existence of a phase transition in a resin flow. (2) The inflection point shifts to the lower temperature side with an increase of pressure and water content. (3) The influence of water content on the flowability varies largely according to compatibility between resins and water.

The economic comparison is made by optimizing each configuration with respect to an objective function appropriate for redox battery applications. Only the variable costs are considered. The results of the optimization show that the flowbby configuration is superior. The flow-through configuration not only yields a lower return on investment, but it is impractical due to a requirement of extremely low flow rates (Re < 0.001).

At present, only the main system may be defined from general specifications: electrical power (10 kW), residual acceleration (10-5 g), processing cycle duration (10 hr).

The definition of orbital parameters capable of accommodating the basis specifications, especially the high energy level and the re-entry conditions on the Guiana base, is a major problem. The re-entry vehicle is studied from a pure ballistic trajectory point of view. From the results of orbital performance, the mass of the spacecraft and also the mass of the ascent vehicle are evaluated.

From the behavior of the magnetic ripple structure under applied field and the configuration of the local surface fields observed in these experiments, the existence of magnetic clusters in these films was verified. Based on the Interpretstion of the field dependence of the ripple formation and the hysteretic properties of the film, it is concluded that the formation of the magnetic clusters is a spontaneous process resulting from intercrystalline interactions and local inhomogeneities in the anisotropy. The effects of such cluster formation on longitudinal magnetic recording were investigated. The results show that the reduction of dipole energy, at the transition region between two oppositely magnetized regions can be achieved by a stepwise rotation of the magnetization vector of an individual cluster in the form of a vortex. This type of rotation creates a finite transition length which is limited by the size of the magnetic cluster of the film. Consequently, it is concluded that the maximum packing density for saturation recording in these types of films would be less than that predicted by the phenomenological equation, which was derived based solely on considerations of the demagnetization field and the coercivity of the film.

Candidate air‐breathing, primary‐power systems studied included Diesel, Closed‐Brayton Cycle (CBC), and fuel cells. A number of options for underwater operation were based upon high‐energy reactants replenlshable from Base supplies. Another set of options was considered based upon using JP‐S fuel with “at‐sea” rechargeable secondary power systems, including thermal‐energy storage, advanced lithium‐sulfur batteries, or flywheels.

There exists, however, a class of mechanism which although kinematically unconstrained, can, by incorporation of energy storage elements, function as a power transmitter. An example of such a mechanism is the automatic, variable ratio power transmission invented in the early twenties by G. Constantinesco, which generated a lot of interest among the engineering fraternity at the time. A typical device consists of a crank-driven nine-bar mechanism which possesses two degrees of mobility. The single velocity (or torque) source supplies the input power, which is transmitted to the output shaft by means of unidirectional drives. The characteristics of the energy storage element in conjunction with a single velocity (or torque) input and the external load fully determine the dynamic behavior of the device. During operation, the input energy is distributed between the load and the energy storage depending on the requirements of the load. For a given input power and external load, the device will adjust the velocity of the output shaft to absorb that power; i.e., it will operate as an automatic, variable ratio power transmission. This paper concentrates on the formulation of a general bond graph model for the mechanism. The model possesses mixed causality and non-linear structure.

Additionally, it is very expensive to provide regulation with large fossil plants and government regulations prohibit the use of nuclear plants for regulation. The inability to cycle large plants produces a need for energy storage devices. Currently, several projects are underway to develop batteries to provide energy storage for peak shaving and load leveling. The batteries have a fast rate of response and therefore can potentially be used to provide regulation, thus improving the area control error (ACE). This project utilized the UMC hybrid simulator to study the effects of batteries on power system dispatch. The batteries can be used for either peak shaving or regulation or a combination of peak shaving and regulation. Battery models and rectifier inverter models were developed for the hybrid simulator. These models were added to a power system simulation with a typical generation mix. Dispatching software was designed to allow test runs using a variety of dispatching algorithms. The resulting data illustrates the value of batteries for peak shaving, regulation, and spinning reserve.

In the present study male subjects of good physical condition performed vertical jumps on the force‐platform with and without preliminary counter movement. In the counter movement jump (CMJ) the amplitude of the knee bending, velocity of the prestretch and the force attained at end of prestretch were the primary parameters of interest. In addition the coupling time indicating the transition from the eccentric (prestretch) phase to the concentric phase was recorded from the angular displacement and reaction force curves. In the final calculation the mechanical performance parameters of CMJ were always compared with those of the jumps performed without counter movement. The results indicated in general first that CMJ enhanced the average concentric force and average mechanical power by 423 N (66%) and 1158 W (81%), respectively. This potentiation effect was the higher the higher was the force at end of prestretch (p<0.001). Similarly, the prestretch speed (p<0.001) and short coupling time (p<0.01) were associated with enhanced performance during the concentric phase. The average coupling time was 23 ms. The results are interpreted through changes in the prestretch conditions to modify the acto‐myosin cross‐bridge formation so that the storage and utilization of elastic energy is associated with high prestretch speed, high eccentric force and short coupling time. The role of the reflex potentiation is also suggested as additional enhancement of the final performance. © 1981 Scandinavian Physiological Society","muscle elasticity; Muscle mechanics; prestretch potentiation.; stretch‐shortening cycle","ballism; human cell; movement (physiology); muscle; muscle contraction; muscle elasticity; normal human; Adult; Elasticity; Humans; Male; Movement; Muscle Contraction; Muscles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019514464

In a fasting state FFA are the main energy source and in a fed state the heart uses mainly carbohydrates. The metabolic pattern is largely influenced by myocardial ischemia. Lactate production is the most important marker of the ischemic heart but its venous release in coronary sinus is strongly dependent on the degree of ischemia. During severe ischemia lactate production and release by the ischemic cell are inhibited; during mild ischemia, myocardial lactate production and coronary venous release are enhanced. FFA metabolism is also influenced by the various degrees of myocardial ischemia; their storage in the cell may contribute to arrhytmias, which often complicate myocardial infarction. During hypertrophy, the metabolic pattern does not differ substantially from normal. Hypertrophy is however the first step towards heart failure. Impaired calcium turnover, nucleic acids and protein synthesis, catecholamine deficiency and defects during the phases of the energy cycle, contribute to a progressive reduction in myocardial contractility. Ischemia-dependent heart failure is strongly connected to intracellular acidosis, by specific competition between H+ and Ca++ ions at the troponin level. The metabolic disorder is negatively influenced by digitalis, which enhances myocardial oxygen consumption, lactate production and, consequently, intracellular acidosis. © 1981 The Italian Pharmacological Society.",,"fatty acid; lactic acid; cell metabolism; heart; heart muscle cell; heart muscle ischemia; short survey; Animal; Cardiomegaly; Coronary Disease; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Glucose; Human; Myocardium; Necrosis; Oxygen Consumption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019496912

Initial results of the field studies indicated that the combined system improved the effectiveness of both the heat pump and the solar pond by enabling a larger temperature cycle within the solar pond. To study the operation of such a system, a computer simulation model for the heating system was developed. The results of simulations were used to establish a relationship between the system performance and the present design and for sizing the solar energy collection and storage system. Also, the effect of a polystyrene pellet nighttime insulation for the greenhouse was simulated. Increasing the surface area of the OARDC pond was found to be less effective than changing its depth. Thr results showed that a 5 m deep pond with 1.0 m gradient zone significantly improved the overall performance of the system when used as a heat source for a heat pump.

The primary event in primordial inorganic or organic photoreceptors was charge separation at the expense of light quantum energy. The subsequent improvement of energy storage was attained by separately channeling electrons and ""holes"" to prevent back reactions. The anisotropic arrangement of photoreceptors in the primary membrane caused a coupling of photochemical charge separation to subsequent ion dislocation and was a prerequisite of primary photophosphorylation. The gradual improvement of the molecular organization of photoreceptor units resulted in antenna and reaction center development. The ""hole"" was primary located on a peculiar photoreceptor form and the electron passed by tunneling through the chain of intermediate carriers (chlorophylls and pheophytins); thus long-lived charge separation was achieved. The use of the electrons and the ""holes"" stored in reaction centers for the functioning of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain was realized by cyclic and non-cyclic pathways when the coupling of two photochemical events became the more perfect mechanism to use water molecule as an ultimate electron donor. The appearance of primitive cells inevitably required the coupling of the solar energy conversion mechanism to the reproduction mechanism which used stored solar energy. © 1981.",,"chlorophyll; pheophytin; electron transport; photosynthesis; short survey; Bacteria; Biogenesis; Electron Transport; Energy Metabolism; Evolution; Light; Photochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019445167

As in HIS preservation of normal kidneys, where the total adenine nucleotide content (SAN) paralleled the loss of viability for the first 1–2 days, in ROP were SAN and even the lactate content also correlated to renal viability for 2–3 days. But in contrast to this correlation, which would favor adenine nucleotide determinations for viability testing, in predamaged kidneys no correlation of SAN or lactate with renal viability was found during HIS or ROP.Thus the determination of cellular energy-rich adenine nucleotides and lactate accumulation confirms the superiority of ROP over HIS preservation.

In undifferentiated PC 12 cells, storage of newly synthesized acetylcholine was found in bound and free compartments as evidenced from subcellular fractionation. The free pool had a faster turnover rate. Most of the newly synthesized acetylcholine was rapidly degraded in the absence of a cholinesterase inhibitor while continuous incubation with labeled choline resulted in a slow incorporation of newly labeled acetylcholine into a bound pool. The accumulation of acetylcholine in the bound pool, but not acetylcholine synthesis, was inhibited by each of several agents that are known to interfere with the generation or maintenance of proton electrochemical gradients.

While solutions of LiB(CH3)4-dioxolane appear stable over long periods, contact with TiS2 results in anion oxidation with concomitant formation of LixTiS2 (x &lt; 1). The oxidation products are gases whose apparent rate of generation is proportional to the concentrations of solute and TiS2. The product distribution depends on whether LiB(CH3)4-dioxolane solution contacts TiS2 alone, or in a Li-TiS2 cell.

In view of these findings, we examined the potential usefulness of loss of 111In from labeled platelets as an indicator of platelet damage by compairing the loss of 111In with that of 51Cr and LDH (in some experiments also with platelet factor 3 availability) under different conditions of platelet injury. When washed human platelets labeled with either 51Cr-chromate or 111In-oxine were exposed to increasing concentrations of detergents (Triton X-100, lysolecithin), threshold, rate, and extent of loss of 111In, 51Cr and, LDH were similar. In contrast, when labeled platelets were depleted of metabolic energy by incubation in glucose-free Tyrode albumin solution or glucose-depleted plasma in the presence of antimycin A and 2-deoxy-D-glucose, loss of 51Cr (and PF3a) occurred earlier and progressed at a faster rate than that of 111In or LDH. Similar results were obtained when platelets were exposed to increasing concentrations of PI(A1) antibody, causing complement-mediated immune injury. The findings indicate that with certain agents that cause rapid platelet disruption (lysis), different platelet constituents are lost at similar rates. However, under conditions of more subtle or slowly progressive platelet injury, small molecules such as adenine nucleotides (51Cr) may escape earlier and at faster rates than larger molecules such as LDH or 111In-binding platelet protein. Thus, neither 111In loss nor LDH loss appear to be suitable indicators for sublytic or prelytic platelet injury.",,"8 quinolinol indium in 111; chromium 51; chromium 54; deoxyglucose; hydroxyquinoline; indium 111m; lactate dehydrogenase; lysophosphatidylcholine; radioisotope; triton x 100; unclassified drug; antimycin A1; chromium; deoxyglucose; diagnostic agent; indium; lactate dehydrogenase; lysophosphatidylcholine; macrogol derivative; blood and hemopoietic system; human cell; in vitro study; injury; thrombocyte; thrombocytopathy; article; human; metabolism; pathology; thrombocyte; ultrastructure; Antimycin A; Blood Platelets; Chromium Radioisotopes; Deoxyglucose; Human; Indium; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lysophosphatidylcholines; Polyethylene Glycols; Radioisotopes; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019395248

The secondary circuit of the indirect system transfers energy from the heat exchanger to the storage tanks which are distributed in size and in temperature. This has the effect of a forced stratification which increases the system's capability of collecting and storing solar energy.

More day-time energy is obtainable if the scheme absorbs energy at night for pumping to help restore its water level; and if it is operated to obtain the maximum possible day-time energy output within a specified demand pattern it requires approximately the same energy input at night. The scheme can therefore function as a bulk energy- transfer scheme of at least 100% efficiency, storing surplus energy at night and releasing it during the day. The peak power demand on the rest of the C.E.G.B. system would be reduced and the base load raised, so giving a double reduction in the amount of plant which has to be cycled daily. This will become increasingly valuable as the nuclear component of the C.E.G.B. system increases. This paper describes the performance of such a scheme located in the Severn Estuary and operated to meet both constant and variable day-time power demands. The day-time energy output varies relatively little with the range and time of the tide, but the night-time energy input varies more noticeably. The scheme would also generate more energy if it was not required to meet the very short-term peaks in the day- time demand. The capital cost of the scheme would probably be higher than that of inland high-head pumped storage; but it may be necessary if there are not enough suitable site available for high-head schemes. It also combines into one project the functions of generation and storage which otherwise would required development of several separate sites.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019357248

At the Institute for Desert Research at the Sede Boqer Campus we have been testing this concept with emphasis placed upon the utilization of locally manufactured components. The daily performance of four small module shallow solar ponds has been monitored almost continuously between August 1978 and May 1979. The ponds are each 2 × 1.3 m in size. They all have the same black PVC lower film, but differ either in the type of upper transparent film, glazing material or glazing angle. The daily performance is characterized by three factors, viz. the maximum daily water temperature achieved, the total daily thermal energy collected and the daily efficiency. Monthly average performance factors for the SSP modules have been determined. Based upon the experimental data, we conclude that the SSP system is capable of supplying ~ 3 GJ/m2-yr of thermal energy under climatic conditions similar to those prevailing at Sede Boqer, i.e. semi-arid zones.

Economic production of these would benefit from adding elemental hydrogen. Several million tonnes of hydrogen could be usefully used per year in this way. The hydrogen could be produced electrolytically from off-peak under nuclear energy, but the question is whether this can be done at a price which is competitive with the coal-derived product. The paper discusses this. The cost and efficiency of the electrolyser and the value of the off-peak nuclear electricity are relevant factors. The alternative use of this energy is to store it by pumping water to an uphill reservoir for later on-peak generation. It is shown that hydrogen production does not compete with storage for the use of off-peak nuclear electricity until the price of coal, in real terms, doubles from the 1979 value .",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019354677

If electric road vehicles were to be widely used, based on more intensive use of thermo-electric power stations during the nighttime, this would offer the considerable advantage of doing away with the pollution of internal combustion engines in those very places where the problem of preserving the environment is most acutely felt.",,"AUTOMOBILES - Electric; Energy conservation; Environmental protection; STORAGE BATTERY VEHICLES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019347306

Two interactive application programs are presented: a short-term load forecasting program and a unit commitment optimisation program. For the load prediction within the load forecasting program a four-component weather dependent load model is used, whereby for the weather-dependent load component an econometric model, and for the time-dependent load component a seasonal multiplicative ARIMA-model is applied. The unit commitment is optimized using dynamic programming. With this method the start-up and shut-down costs can easily be taken into consideration. Special features are necessary to allow the optimal scheduling of a large number of generators to minimize storage requirements and execution time of the program. For every cost-optimal unit commitment determined the reliability of the energy supply is then calculated. The success of the application software depends to a large extent on the man-machine interface. Special attention has to be paid to the man-machine dialogue. The dialogue has to be structured in such a way that the user has the facility to control the programs as easily as possible. All input data has to be checked and in case of a false input an error message has to be displayed and a new input requested.

The neutron sources currently used in these instruments are isotopics such as Californium-252, Americium—Lithium etc. It is becoming increasingly more difficult to transport isotopic sources from one measurement location to another. This represents a significant problem for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards inspectors because they must take their safeguards instruments with them to each nuclear installation to make an independent measurement. The purpose of this paper is to review the possibility of replacing isotopic neutron sources now used in IAEA safeguards instruments with electric neutron sources such as deuterium-tritium (D-T, 14-MeV neutrons) or deuterium-deuterium (D-D, 2-MeV neutrons).

Presently five beamlines are instrumented and operational, supporting experiments in atomic and molecular physics, surface science and materials studies, as well as providing optical calibration services. Nearing completion is a large facility for calibrating optical instruments, especially those intended for space flight. The capability of determining the absolute light flux emitted by SURF II has recently been improved and is now operational. The technique employs ultra-linear silicon photodiodes to detect and count individual electrons in the stored beam. Other user conveniences include close access to the machine, flexible scheduling and close interaction with the operations staff.

Lead ion implantation experiments show that such materials should be transformed into ""giant"" nuclear tracks, when the internal fluence of heavy recoils emitted during the α-decay of actinide elements stored in them exceeds a critical value, which corresponds to an equivalent storage period of a few thousand years for the wastes expected from a pressurized water reactor. In contrast, actinide bearing minerals are much more stable against α-recoil damage. As nuclear tracks are extremely chemical reactive, α-recoil damage is expected to shorten the lifetime of storage materials such as glass and ceramics against dissolution in ground waters. Fortunately new nuclear track concepts are already yielding guidelines for predicting and improving the long-term stability of storage materials. The results of the present studies also bear on the physics of ion implantation phenomena an insulator targets exposed to high fluences of low energy ions. © 1981.",,"INDUSTRIAL WASTES - Radioactive Materials; INDUSTRIAL WASTES - Radioactive Materials; DIELECTRIC MATERIALS; Dielectric materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019006031

The fusion program embraces low loss superconductor strand development with integration into cables capable of carrying 50 kA in pulsed mode at high fields. This evolvement has been paralleled with pulsed energy storage coil development and testing from tens of kj at low fields to a 20 MJ prototype tokamak induction coil at 7.5 T. Energy transfer times have ranged from 0.7 ms to several seconds. Electric utility magnetic storage for prospective application is for diurnal load leveling with massive systems to store 10 GWh at 1.8 K in a dewar structure suported on bedrock underground. An immediate utility application is a 30 MJ system to be used to damp power oscillations on the Bonneville Power Administration electric transmission lines. An off-shoot of this last work is a new program for electric utility VAR control with the potential for use to suppress subsynchronous resonance. Pulsed magnetic energy storage is not a widely developed technology. Current work is done almost exclusively in Japan and the United States.

Emission bands were centered at 730 ± 3 nm and excited-state lifetimes were in the range of 30 ± 10µs. Two one-electron oxidations in CH2Cl2 ranged from 0.74 to 0.86 V for the first step and from 1.18 to 1.27 V for the second one. A one-electron reduction process in (CH3)2SO ranged from -1.35 to -1.24 V. Excited-state lifetimes and redox potentials exhibit a weak dependence on the Hammett function. In general, redox potentials increase as the electron-withdrawing power of the substituents increases, whereas excited-state lifetimes decrease. The first oxidation step (0.74-0.86 V) and the reduction step are, respectively, assigned to π-electron removal or acceptance by the porphyrin ring. The second oxidation is assigned to removal of an electron from the ruthenium(II) center. The excited state is shown to be the (π- π*) state of the porphyrin ring and to exhibit photoredox behavior involving both oxidative and reductive quenching. Redox product separation occurred in flash photolysis quenching experiments and back-reactions took place at near-diffusion-controlled rates. The redox potential of the Ru(TPP)(CO)+/* couple was estimated from emission and redox data to be -0.57 ± 0.03 V; it was determined from oxidative quenching studies to be -0.56 ± 0.10 V.

During the latter phase of fermentation when the yeast was not growing but expending energy for maintenance of cellular functions, glycogen reserves were slowly depleted; after a period of prolonged anaerobic storage, the content of glycogen fell well below that which was initially present in the pitching yeast. 1981 The Institute of Brewing & Distilling","glucose; glycogen; lipid; oxygen; Saccharomyces cerevisiαe; transport",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001515393

Individual particles are assigned to the clusters and the vector sum of their momenta generate a cluster axis.

Two isomeric trans adducts often result with unsymmetrical phenanthrenes. The product with cis-stilbene and 9-cyanophenanthrene is the crowded cis, endo isomer. With 9-cyanophenanthrene and trans-stilbene, geometric isomerization occurs but only in a triplet process. With cw-stilbene, geometric isomerization results from the triplet, and both geometric and valence isomerizations can be induced by singlet 9-cyanophenanthrene. The reactivity of the stilbene isomers can be accounted for by an algorithm we have previously derived, as can the 20- to 30-fold enhancement of stilbenes over styrenes as a reactant in cycloadditions to phenanthrene. The possibility of singlet-sensitized valence isomerization as a mechanism for storage of solar energy is discussed. © 1981, American Chemical Society.

Such systems are difficult to analyze theoretically due to the nonlinearities of the moving liquid-solid interface and the presence of natural convection as shown by several recent numerical and experimental investigations. Previous work has been unsuccessful in predicting the performance of phase-change devices in the presence of fins and natural convection. This study presents a simplified numerical model based on a quasi-linear, transient, thin fin equation, which predicts the fraction of melted PCM, and the shape of the liquid-solid interface as a function of time with sufficient accuracy for engineering purposes. Experimental results are compared in dimensionless form with model predictions, and show fairly good agreement. To achieve high heat-transfer rates with a fixed amount of PCM and metal fin material, the model indicates that melting the PCM in a pure conduction mode with closely spaced thin fins is preferable to melting PCM with thicker fins spread further apart, even in the presence of natural convection. © 1981.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001252695

The corrected data resolve orbit-to-orbit variations with uncertainties as small as 0.001 percent. Irradiance fluctuations are typical of a band-limited noise spectrum with high-frequency cutoff near 0.15 day -1; their amplitudes about the mean value of 1368.31 watts per square meter approach ±0.05 percent. Two large decreases in irradiance of up to 0.2 percent lasting about 1 week are highly correlated with the development of sunspot groups.

In addition to structurally homogeneous proteinaceous matrix, protein bodies may contain protein crystalloids, electron–dense globoid crystals, electron–transparent soft globoids, and crystals of calcium oxalate. Protein crystalloids vary in shape, size and number. For example, cotyledon mesophyll cell protein bodies in the Cucurbitaceae generally contain protein crystalloids whereas those of Compositae and Cruciferae do not. Globoid crystals, which are rich in phytin, vary greatly in size and number per protein body. Some species have numerous small globoid crystals per protein body whereas others have one or two large globoid crystals per protein body. Phosphorus and various cations (K, Mg, Ca, Fe, Ba, Mn) located in globoid crystals can be studied with an energy dispersive X–ray (EDX) analysis system mounted on a transmission electron microscope. In some cases, cations such as Ca, Mn and Fe are specifically localized in globoid crystals of certain tissues or embryo regions. Further investigations may allow elemental composition of globoid crystals to be used in studies of systematics. Biref–ringent crystals, sometimes in the form of single large crystals but frequently in the form of druses, are present in protein bodies of some species. At least some endosperm protein bodies of all Umbelliferous species examined contain druse crystals. While seed protein bodies of relatively few species have been studied with electron microscopy, there are indications that protein bodies could be a useful character for studies in plant systematics.

In the limit of the infinitely dilute solution the storage time, 18 ms, is determined by IR spontaneous emission. For concentrations in the range 0.01-1 mole % this radiation tends to be trapped by CO self-absorption and the lifetime of the vibrational excitation lengthens. We apply a simple model to interpret this lifetime behavior. Neat carbon monoxide stores vibrational energy for 1 s.

The relationship between the rate of ciliary transport of these gels and their viscoelastic properties was investigated. The mechanical properties were determined by the magnetic rheometer technique; this gave elasticity G′ and tan δ (ratio of energy loss to storage) at various frequencies. Transportability was determined by comparing the linear velocity of the gel with that of endogenous palatal mucus. Because of aging effects, both G′, and tan δ for a single gel change considerably over the course of several days. It was thus possible to obtain gels where tan δ at constant G′ varied by a factor of 8 and G′ at constant tan δ by more than an order of magnitude. Transport was found to decrease significantly as both G′ and tan δ increased. However, the importance of tan δ on transport was much greater; the rate of decrease of transport with increasing tan δ being approximately 4 × that with increasing G′. The findings confirm those found previously for the transport of whole canine tracheal mucus. © 1980.",,"animal experiment; ciliary motility; mouth; mucus; viscoelasticity; Animal; Anura; Cilia; Elasticity; Gels; In Vitro; Models, Biological; Mucus; Palate; Polysaccharides; Rheology; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019193784

The prevalence of mild and severe forms of anaemia was assessed in children by age, sex and various forms of growth retardation and clinical nutritional status. The study revealed that the prevalence of anaemia was higher in younger age groups than the children of 3-5 yr. The prevalence of anaemia was more or less the same in male and female children. Children with poor grades of growth status assessed in terms of height, weight, arm and calf circumferences, weight/height, weight/height and muscle area were found to have higher prevalence of severe anaemia than in those with better grades of growth status. Prevalence of anaemia varied by the criteria adopted and measurements used. Severe forms of clinical PEM signs were more in anaemic children. Prevalence of severe anaemia was higher in those with chronic or current forms of undernutrition than in others. Haemoglobin levels were correlated with measurements reflective of growth status but coefficients were lower than 0.50. Association of severe forms of anaemia with poor grades of growth status might be due to general dietary inadequacy, poor utilisation of iron from food and unavailability of storage iron caused by infections or infestations.

The pre-exercise muscle glycogen content determines the duration of performance. There is obligate glycogen utilization at the pace of a competitive marathon, approaching 0.5 gram per kg of muscle per km. When muscle glycogen falls below 3 to 5 grams per kg of muscle, pace must decrease, as effort is sustained by fat metabolism. The glycogen burst at the iniatiation of exercise contributes a significant portion (approximately 20 percent) of total glycogen utilization. Dietary manipulation can double muscle glycogen levels. Free fatty acids spare glycogen to that required for the obligate carbohydrate substrate as determined by the ATP to ADP ratio (pace). The rate-limiting step in FFA metabolism is mobilization from adipose tissue. Mobilization lags behind utilization only at the onset of exercise, coincident with the glycogen burst. Otherwise, FFA are available in excess of need. Raising levels of FFA at the onset of exercise can substantially spare glycogen that would otherwise be consumed in the glycogen burst and, hence, enhance performance. In practical terms, the following guidelines should be useful to marathon athletes. Optimal glycogen loading involves the three phases of depletion (exercise), a carbohydrate-poor diet followed by a carbohydrate-rich diet. Depletion exercise must use the same muscles as will be used in the race. A carbohydrate-poor diet for two days will optimize subsequent glycogen storage. A carbohydrate-rich (greater than 70 percent carbohydrate) diet should be consumed for three days before competition, with only light training, to preserve muscle glycogen stores. The runner should maximize caloric intake (as carbohydrates) for the first 10 to 24 hours of carbohydrate loading, and then eat only isocaloric, high-carbohydrate diet for the remaining 2 to 2 1/2 days before competition. This takes advantage of the high specific storage immediately after depletion, and minimizes storage in adipose tissue, with its potentially disadvantageous weight gain. Two meals per day may achieve higher glycogen levels than many small feedings. The last sugar intake should be four to six hours before competition to assure high hepatic glycogen stores while allowing insulin levels to decrease to postabsorptive levels; 100 grams of carbohydrate (two candy bars) is adequate. Caffeine (5 mg per kg of body weight; one NoDoz tablet contains 100 mg of caffeine) taken orally an hour before competition will raise FFA levels and spare glycogen that would otherwise be consumed in the glycogen burst at the beginning of the race. Although these metabolic considerations can benefit runners at any level of ability, it is important to realize that metabolic manipulations can in no way approach the beneficial effects of consistent training on performance.",,"glycogen; ascites; cachexia; endometrium carcinoma; female genital system; heart; heart disease; major clinical study; marathon runner; mesothelium; metabolism; mitral valve stenosis; running; tricuspid valve regurgitation; Blood Glucose; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Glycogen; Human; Muscles; Running; Triglycerides",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019180496

It occurs in progressively severe stages such as prelatent or storage iron deficiency, latent iron deficiency, and, ultimately, iron deficiency anemia. World Health Organization (WHO)-sponsored surveys have demonstrated iron deficiency in 40 to 99 per cent of pregnant women in various parts of the world and anemia in 21 to 80 per cent of pregnant women. Since iron is essential for energy metabolism, its deficiency has the potential for causing serious consequences: impaired immunity and a higher frequency of serious infectious illnesses; diminished vitality; lowered economic productivity; maternal morbidity and mortality; fetal or neonatal mortality; premature births; and iron-deficient neonates of low birth weight. Women sustain substantial iron losses throughout their reproductive years from menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation. The most common cause of iron deficiency, however, is excessive menstrual bleeding. Factors that control menstrual blood loss (MBL) are still unclear, but genetic influences play a part, and volume of flow correlates positively with duration of menstrual periods and possibly with parity and infant birth weights. Factors having no effect include the interval between periods or the interval since the birth of the last child. Age is significant only in that flow is often lighter during menarche than at other times and heavier prior to menopause. Various explanations for the heavy bleeding of menorrhagic women include: excessive prostaglandin activity; coagulation problems; hormonal imbalance; increase in fibrinolysis, heparin-like activity, capillary fragility, or number of endometrial arterioles; and iron deficiency anemia. Some methods of contraception affect the volume of MBL. Combination oral contraceptives and progestogen intrauterine devices (IUDs) decrease MBL by 25 to 60 per cent. By contrast, excessive bleeding is a major reason for discontinuing use of nonhormonal IUDs. Among IUD users with excessive flow, the incidence of anemia is fivefold the preinsertion incidence. Lippes Loop and Dalkon Shield users rank highest and second highest, respectively, in volume of MBL and prevalence of menorrhagia (flow >80 ml), and also in incidence of decreased hemoglobin concentration and of anemia. These two IUDs raise MBL 50 to 100 per cent above preinsertion levels vs. 25 per cent for the Tatum-T intrauterine copper contraceptive (Copper-T) and Copper-7. Progestogen-containing IUDs, although associated with some intermenstrual spotting, generally diminish MBL. The Progestasert intrauterine progesterone contraceptive system (releasing 65 μg progesterone/day) (Progesterone-T) reduces mean menstrual blood loss by 40 to 50 per cent. Progesterone-releasing U-coils also decrease MBL and iron loss values. A T-device, releasing 25 μg d-norgestrel daily, lowers MBL by 40 per cent. Injection or subdermal implanting of synthetic contraceptive progestogens is associated with at least a 10 per cent discontinuation rate within a year because of menstrual disturbances: increased or prolonged bleeding, spotting, irregularities, or amenorrhea. Various oral agents are used to control excessive MBL. These include: antifibrinolytic agents such as aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid (AMCA), and aprotinin; prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors such as mefenamic acid and flufenamic acid; hormones that inhibit ovulation; low molecular weight polypeptides; and danazol. Particular systemic side effects accompany each, as well as a cost that may be prohibitive. Surgical procedures can also decrease MBL. Uterine curettage reduces blood loss, but only temporarily. When milder procedures fail, hysterectomy is an option. When dietary Vitamin A is deficient, its administration reduces menorrhagia. Iron supplementation is useful for offsetting iron deficiency in vulnerable groups and for treating severe cases requiring rapid correction. Iron fortification programs may be more effective for chronic iron deficiency in large proportions of a population; the iron-enriched food must be readily available and acceptable, inexpensive, absorbable, and not subject to altered stability. We conclude that iron deficiency anemia in women is a serious problem that is frequently ignored. It is prevalent even in the most developed countries, often being associated with MBL. Treatment and prevention have included use of a variety of agents (given locally or systemically), surgery, and iron supplementation or fortification. Ideally, foods rich in iron and foods that promote iron absorption should be consumed. In addition, contraceptives should be selected that decrease MBL, thereby reducing the risk of iron deficiency and anemia, as oral contraceptives and some hormonal IUDs now do.",,"aminocaproic acid; anoular; aprotinin; copper; copper intrauterine device; copper j; danazol; estrogen derivative; etamsylate; ethinylestradiol plus levonorgestrel; ethinylestradiol plus lynestrenol; flufenamic acid; iron; lippes loup; mefenamic acid; mestranol plus norethisterone; methandriol; norethisterone; norethisterone t; norgestrel; norgestrel t; placebo t; placebo u; progesterone; progesterone derivative; progesterone u; retinol; saf-t-coil; tolfenamic acid; tranexamic acid; unclassified drug; adverse drug reaction; anemia; female genital system; ferrous salt; intrauterine contraceptive device; iron deficiency; iron deficiency anemia; lactation; lysometra; menstrual cycle; menstruation; oral contraception; oral drug administration; pregnancy; prevention; preventive medicine; review; therapy; Age Factors; Biology; Birth Intervals; Birth Weight; Contraception; Contraceptive Methods; Contraceptive Usage; Diseases; Estrogens; Family Planning; Female Sterilization; Fibrinolysis; Genetics; Health; Hematological Effects; Hemic System; Hemoglobin Level--analysis; Infections; Injectables; Iron; Iud; Iud, Copper Releasing; Iud, Hormone Releasing; Iud, Unmedicated; Literature Review; Maternal Health; Measurement; Menorrhagia--etiology; Menstrual Cycle--changes; Menstruation; Menstruation Disorders; Oral Contraceptives; Parity; Physiology; Prevalence; Prostaglandin Antagonists; Prostaglandins; Reproduction; Research Methodology; Serum Iron Level--analysis; Serum Iron Level--complications; Sterilization, Sexual; Treatment; Tubal Ligation; Tubal Occlusion; Vitamin A; Anemia, Hypochromic; Female; Human; Intrauterine Devices; Menorrhagia; Sterilization, Tubal",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019177984

Values of the contrast amounting to 10-12 and the modulation efficiency of 30-40% were achieved. It was demonstrated that optical data storage was possible with the aid of an He-Ne laser. Optical memory was observed in Al-SiO2-(n-n+-GaAs structures on application of voltage pulses causing carrier accumulation; the effect was due to the capture of electrons at the SiO2-GaAs interface. The absorption edge of epitaxial GaAs films on GaP substrates had an exponential profile in the photon energy range 1.37≤hν≤1.40 eV infields 0≤E 5≤6.5·104 V/cm.

Such discussions have increased with the acknowledgement that proton transfer across cell membranes may play a significant part in energy conversion and storage in biological systems1-4 and that this transfer may involve hydrogen-bonded chains spanning the membrane5,6. However, there is still much uncertainty about the basic mode of proton displacement and the external factors which effect bulk proton transport in ice itself. We present here results of a microwave conductivity pulse radiolysis technique which has been used to determine the mobility of bare protons in ice, and thus reduce some of the uncertainty over proton mobility. © 1980 Nature Publishing Group.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019102490

Compared to other new atmosphere generating systems with nitrogen carrier gas and additions of gaseous carburizing components, the costs of the nitrogen and its storage are saved. Also faster carburizing and improved uniformity are achieved. Recent field experience in both sealed quench units and return-pusher furnaces for carburizing, carbonitriding and neutral hardening has proved to be very satisfactory. Further process refinements, possible processing restrictions and operation at low temperatures, such as at 570 °C for nitrocarburizing, are being studied. © 1980 American Society for Metals.",,"FURNACES, HEAT TREATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019096280

Chemical polishing and too much electropolishing decrease the energy gap and rf breakdown fields. High-temperature vacuum firing in a UHV furnace decrease the residual loss and recovers the energy gap. Annealed cavities are, however, easily degraded not only by a short period of exposure to hydrogen, but also by a long term storage in air. Chemically polished cavities also show a great enhancement of the penetration depth λ0.

Aging effect, or decrease in tunneling resistance during room-temperature storage as long as 300 days, was found to be dominated by a single rate-controlling process of activation energy of 0.78 eV. Based on Auger analysis of tunneling layers, it was concluded that the aging effect can be attributed to the compositional variation in the tunneling oxide layer resulting from the conversion from a Pb- and In-oxide mixture into In oxide.

To reduce the cold structure required to support axial forces, the concept of segmented solenoids was proposed. The authors present a study of various cost parameters regarding the solenoid aspect ratio and the separation distances between tunnels. The amount of axial structure required is calculated by the virtual work method.

It is argued that in some cases these procedures are not equivalent methods for the investigation of IM and that alternate visual processes most likely underlie performance on certain tasks. To support this claim, the widely discrepant evidence concerning the effect of target energy on IM is reanalyzed in light of relative strengths and weaknesses of the various methodologies used. It is shown that the results obtained from a particular procedure, identified as especially sensitive to alternate interpretations, are consistently at odds with those obtained from theoretically purer iconic tasks. The remaining body of evidence presents a relatively integrated picture of an energy-dependent sensory trace following stimulus offset, much as predicted for a retinally based persistence phenomenon.

The stability of this configuration is examined next and it is shown that for the force-free case, the structure is always unstable to kinking for any degree of twist. However, a slight deviation from the force-free configuration, through the presence of a small positive transverse pressure gradient, can stabilize the loops for moderate degrees of twist. The range of wave-numbers for which instability occurs and the maximum growth rates are also presented.

Low temperatures which induced germination had little effect on the diffusivity of the testa although an increase in diffusivity occurred immediately prior to radicle emergence. The O2 concentration surrounding an enclosed embryo was found to be 5-10% that of the solution bathing the seeds at storage temperatures. The respiratory capacity of the embryos was found to be strongly dependent on temperature and, largely as a result of this, at chilling temperatures the O2 concentration surrounding the enclosed embryo approached that in the ambient solution. The apparent Arrhenius activation energy for O2 consumption was considerably greater below 17 °C than above this temperature. Although insufficient evidence in themselves for a relationship between O2 availability and seed germination, the results do provide evidence for a mechanism by which such a relationship may be associated with seeds requiring chilling to induce germination. © 1980 Oxford University Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344259622

The recruitment of muscle fibre types has been investigated in the coalfish (Pollachius virens) using electromyography. Red trunk muscles were active at all swimming speeds examined (0.25-3.6 lengths/s). Interestingly, white fibres were recruited at 0.8-2.0 lengths/s providing evidence that this muscle type is also used during sustained activity. 2. The effect of endurance exercise training on muscle fibre size and enzymes of energy metabolism has also been investigated. Fish were exercised continuously at 2.1 lengths/s for a period of three weeks in an experimental swimming chamber. This swimming speed represents a significant increase in work load relative to non-exercised fish as evidenced by muscle fibre hypertrophy and an increase in creatine kinase activities in both red (184%) and white (260%) muscles. 3. Glycogen storage levels increased to a greater extent in red (+520%) than white (+200%) muscles. Phosphofructokinase activity was eight times higher in the red muscle of exercised fish. In contrast, there was only a small increase in citrate synthetase (+30%) and no change in either hexokinase or cytochrome oxidase activities in the red muscle of trained fish. 4. Increased hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase activities in both muscle types indicate an enhanced capacity for fatty acid catabolism with training. 5. White muscle phosphofructokinase activities were not significantly different in trained and untrained fish. It is likely that the maximum potential of white muscle for anaerobic glycogenolysis is already sufficient to meet all its energy requirements at this swimming speed. 6. The results suggest that the capacity of coalfish red muscle to do aerobic work remains essentially unchanged by endurance exercise training and that any increase in the ability to produce ATP must be met anaerobically. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000703491

However, at the present time, it is not clear which particular modes of control will best exploit the capabilities of DAC. Homeostatic Utility Control is an overall concept which tries to maintain an internal equilibrium between supply and demand. Equilibrating forces are obtained over longer time scales (5 minutes and up) by economic principles through an Energy Marketplace using time-varying spot prices. Faster supply-demand balancing is obtained by employing “governor-type” action on certain types of loads using a Frequency Adaptive Power Energy Rescheduler (FAPER) to assist or even replace conventional turbine-governed systems and spinning reserve. Conventional metering is replaced by a Marketing Interface to Customer (MIC) which, in addition to measuring power usage, multiplies that usage by posted price and records total cost. Customers retain the freedom to select their consumption patterns. Homeostatic control is a new, untried concept. It is discussed in this paper because its great potential makes it a vehicle for interesting discussions of where the future may actually evolve.

The high response diminished pronouncedly when electrodes were made onto surfaces oxidized during storage in air. The presence of a transparent layer on the surface could be established by electron diffraction and ellipsometry as well. The layer structure depended on surface treatment.

Fat storage rate (%fat) was estimated by densitometry. The obese group ranked highest with an average power output of 1,012 W. This value was significantly higher than those of the other two groups, 890 W for lean subjects and 855 W for ordinary subjects. The power output per kilogram of lean body mass of the obese group was the highest also. However, the vertical velocity was the lowest although the difference among the three average values was not statistically significant. To investigate the effect of excess fat, eight non-obese subjects engaged in an added-weight experiment. The value obtained was almost the same as for the obese group. The added weights made the vertical velocity decrease but the power output increase. Consequently, it was obvious that the excess fat of an obese man played a role only as an inert mass in the power output measurement. A significantly higher power output of the obese group might be due to more excess fat, and obesity itself was an advantage in the staircase climb test. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.","Added-weight experiment; Anaerobic power output; Obesity","adipose tissue; anaerobic capacity; human cell; normal human; obesity; stair climbing; Adipose Tissue; Adolescent; Adult; Anaerobiosis; Body Composition; Body Weight; Comparative Study; Energy Metabolism; Human; Male; Metabolism; Obesity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018817821

First, What characteristics of major taxa of algae identify them as predictably high or low quality foods? Second, are marine algae valuable foods for fishes which do not mechanically disrupt cell walls and do not harbor specialized enzymes or microbes capable of lysing cell walls? Energy, ash and nutrient content of 16 species of marine algae were employed to assess food quality of fleshy red, green, brown and calcareous red algae. On the basis of ash, calories, total protein and total lipid content, fleshy algae should be superior to calcareous algae as foods for fishes; in addition, green algae should be superior to brown algae and brown algae superior to red algae. When the probable digestibility of storage and extracellular carbohydrates is considered, green and red algae are predicted superior to brown algae as food. Two species of damselfishes (Pomacentridae) from the Gulf of California, Eupomacentrus rectifraenum and Microspathodon dorsalis, eat red and green algae and ignore brown and calcareous algae. They feed, therefore, in a fashion consistent with predictions based only on algal chemistry. These fishes absorb at least 20-24% of the biomass, 57-67% of the protein, 46-56% of the lipid and 37-44% of the carbohydrate contained in algae eaten in the wild. Since these damselfishes do not masticate their food, it appears that herbivorous fishes can digest major fractions of algal nutrients without mechanical destruction of algal cells. © 1980 Dr. W.

In 1975, because of the deteriorating gas supply situation in the United States and increasing demand for energy, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) established the Eastern Gas Shales Project (EGSP) as part of the Unconventional Gas Recovery (UGR) program to study and characterize and to develop economically feasible technology for further exploitation of Devonian shale gas reservoirs. Devonian shale gas reservoirs typically are characterized by a low storage, high flow-capacity natural fracture system fed by a high storage, low flow-capacity rock matrix. In this study analytical solutions are developed to analyze the basic fractured reservoir parameters that control well productivity. These parameters include fracture system porosity and permeability, matrix porosity and permeability, and matrix size. It is shown that the conventional well test method does not usually work for fractured Devonian shale gas reservoirs. For most cases, the semilog plot of the draw down and buildup data does not show two parallel straight lines with a vertical separation.

Resolution and depth of penetration arguments suggest that conventional acoustic logging systems which record complete waveforms can provide an effective means for sampling rock bulk properties, and may be used to characterize fractures which have been previously identified with the acoustic televiewer. This hypothesis has been tested by analyzing the digitally recorded waveforms from a series of boreholes up to 1000 m deep in the Lac DuBonnet Batholith of southeastern Manitoba, Canada. Analysis of the data from massive unfractured intervals shows remarkably consistent waveforms with compression and shear velocities of 5.85 ± 0.10 and 3.35 ± 0.10 km/s respectively, in close agreement with the mean of core measurements. Synthetic waveforms generated by numerical evaluation of the separation of variables solution confirmed the identity of energy arriving in the 3.35 km/s window as a shear head wave. Test hole geometry here restricts normal modes to a single component, usually referred to as a ""tube wave"". Because careful analysis of the waveforms from unfractured intervals confirmed the uniform nature of the unfractured rock, variations in waveform character could generally be related to propagation across fractured zones. The most diagnostic feature of waveform character in the vicinity of fractures which appear open on the acoustic televiewer and television logs is a 20 to 50 percent reduction in tube wave amplitude, with nearly complete tube wave amplitude reduction adjacent to several intensely fractured zones. The presence of open fractures also strongly affect wave energy arriving at approximately shear velocity. These effects are attributed to shear attenuation across fluid-filled fractures and mode conversion effects when the sonde receiver is located directly adjacent to an open fracture. These initial results suggest that acoustic wave data may contain appreciable information concerning the hydraulic properties of fractures as they extend away from the borehole wall. © SPWLA 21st Annual Logging Symposium 1980.

Two concepts selected for hardware development are a direct contact heat exchanger in which molten salt droplets are injected into a cooler counterflowing stream of liquid metal carrier fluid, and a rotating drum scraper in which molten salt is sprayed onto the circumference of a rotating drum, which contains the fluid heat sink in an internal annulus near the surface. A fixed scraper blade removes the solidified salt from the surface which has been nickel plated to decrease adhesion forces. Suitable phase change material storage media with melting points in the temperature range of interest (250 DEGREE C to 400 DEGREE C) were investigated.

The system consists of a wind turbine in conjunction with purchased utility power and an optional energy storage system and heat engine. The wind is described using actual hourly velocity data, or by a given statistical function and sampling for specified time periods. In the simulation, a WECS process controller determines operating strategy, which is to first use wind-generated energy, followed by the storage system and then the heat energy, if installed. Any remaining energy shortfall is purchased from the utility, while excess WECS energy generated is sold to the utility. The life-cycle economic analysis calculates annual savings after taxes, investment payback time period and return on investment.

Design of the optimum system for a given reliability level can be performed if a time series of wind speed data is available. However, a design based on conventional meteorological records, which sample the wind speed with a ten minute averaging time at three-hourly intervals, will over-estimate the storage by a factor of approximately 2, and if the wind speed is only available on a daily basis the storage will be over-estimated by a factor of 2.5 to 4.0. This is because a propeller can respond to wind speed changes in much less than ten minutes and also because three-hourly sampling does not often pick up the brief high-speed incidents which generate a significant part of the wind energy.

All three models were modified for the effect of streamline curvature. The rotation orginated redistribution terms were added in the transport equation of Reynolds stresses of the second and third models.

Each was asked to register a decision, whether damp or dry, for articles in wool, cotton and poly‐cotton (67% polyester, 33% cotton). These articles were of known moisture contents, measured as percentage moisture regains, following exposure to controlled atmospheres ranging between 0 r.h. and 95% r.h. Considerable variations in dampness perception were recorded between individual testers and results differed with the fibre content; poly‐cotton presented the most difficulties. Nevertheless it was possible to discern for each textile, a moisture content band below which goods could be declared acceptably dry. Implications for the indoor drying and storage of laundered articles were reviewed. Dryness acceptable to the majority (90% of the sample) could be achieved within a normal indoor atmosphere (50% r.h., 20°C) for poly‐cotton but not for wool or cotton. For these, a reduced humidity or an elevated temperature would be required, necessitating the expenditure of energy such as is commonly available in the domestic airing cupboard.

It avoids errors which occurred in previous theories by evaluating separately the work done by each leg instead of deriving net work from mechanical energy fluctuations. It takes particular account of two parameters, the duty factor β (the fraction of the stride for which each foot is on the ground) and a parameter q which defines the time course of the force on each foot. It shows that for any given speed there is an optimum (β,q) which minimizes the energy cost of locomotion. These (β,q) are only a little different for bipeds and quadrupeds except near the critical speed at which the optimum moves abruptly from walking (high β) to running (low β). Walking men use (β, q) close to the theoretical optima, but with slightly higher q. Walking dogs and sheep use q which are lower than the optimum values except at very low speeds. Some of the energy which would otherwise be required for locomotion may be saved by storage of elastic strain energy in tendons etc. This mechanism is more effective in running than in fast walking, which may be why men change from walking to running at lower speeds than the inelastic theory suggests.

Energy used was measured and the cost of preservation was calculated with the packaging and amortized equipment cost included. Reduced ascorbic acid and carotene contents were determined within a week after processing and after 6 months of storage. Sensory quality of the processed vegetables was evaluated in less than a month after processing. The vegetables were cooked with salt added for sensory evaluation. Freezing required the shortest processing time and resulted in products with the highest sensory quality, with ratings well above minimum acceptability, and the most ascorbic acid (assuming the canned liquor is not used) and carotene. More energy (electricity) was required to process and store vegetables by freezing than by canning or dehydrating with a commercially available electric dehydrator; however, the overall cost for freezing preservation was estimated to be as low as or lower than the cost for the other two preservation methods if the freezer could be kept full. With the freezer only half‐full freezing would cost more than canning or dehydration for a long term (> 6 months) storage. Canning used much less electric energy and was slightly cheaper in overall preservation cost than dehydrating with the electric dehydrator, and the canned products retained much more ascorbic acid and carotene than the dehydrated products. Nearly all ascorbic acid was lost during dehydration. The canned and dehydrated products were rated low in sensory quality, with ratings mostly below minimum acceptability.

Box 14,Haren, Groningen, 9750 AA, Netherlands","Abstract A brief survey of the biochemistry of the alternative oxidative pathway (‘cyanide‐resistant respiration’) and its occurrence in vivo is given. Several hypotheses about the physiological significance of the alternative chain are discussed. These include a role in (1) heat production, (2) fruit ripening, (3) respiration of plants that contain high levels of cyanogenic glycosides, producing HCN upon wounding, (4) oxidation of NADH that is produced by various causes in excess of that required for ATP production, (5) ion uptake, and (6) osmoregulation. In intact roots of higher plants, the activity of the alternative pathway is more active when less carbohydrate is required for assimilation of N (NH+4 NO‐3 or N2) and is less active in those when carbohydrates are being stored in a storage organ or when the availability of photosynthate is reduced. An increase in carbohydrate requirement for osmoregulation is also correlated with decreased alternative chain activity. It is concluded that the alternative pathway in roots plays an important role in oxidation of sugars which are not required for carbon skeletons, energy production for growth and maintenance processes, osmoregulation or storage. However, the significance of this role may vary in different tissues and physiological states. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982685102

The dynamic viscoclastic constants were also quantified at 0.05 HZ for mixed gels containing 0.5% agarose and 2.5–20% gelatin. In single component gels, the melting temperature increased with hydrocolloid concentration. The melting temperature of gelatin gels was lower than that of agarose gels (22–31°C vs 69–80°C) and less concentration dependent. The melting temperature of mixed gels was more similar to that of agarose gels at low (2.5–6.25%) gelatin concentrations and more similar to that of gelatin gels at high (7.5–20%) gelatin concentrations. The storage modulus decreased with increasing temperature indicating that the thermal rupturing of the noncovalent crosslinks in the gels was stronger than the entropic behavior of the network. The temperature dependence of the storage modulus and of the dynamic viscosity increased with gelatin concentration. Based on these results and on the determination of the activation energy it is concluded that, in mixed agarose/gelatin gels, the two species form individual networks which interfere with one another at high concentrations.

Recoverable water “losses” (seepage, leakage, and spillage during storage and conveyance, and surface runoff and deep percolation during irrigation) and irrecoverable losses (evaporation from water and soil surfaces and transpiration from plants) are described and illustrated. Some conservation terms are defined, particularly the distinction between on‐farm irrigation efficiency and areawide efficiency. Briefly reviewed are agricultural water conservation technologies and their applicability. The biggest untapped potential for water conservation may be a reduction in irrecoverable losses, especially evapotranspiration. The advantages and disadvantages of reducing recoverable and irrecoverable water losses are described, including possible effects on ground water, energy, salinity, crops, wildlife, and in‐stream uses. Such information may be useful in several policy and management issues, e.g., ground water overdraft and possible constraints on crops and sites to be irrigated. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

The growth rates studied were high (H, 0.8 kg/d), low (L, 0.4 kg/d) and high-maintenance (HM, 0.8 kg/d, followed by a period during which liveweight was held constant). Animals were offered a variable amount of a pelleted concentrate ration, together with a fixed amount (0.9 kg) of oaten straw daily. The DM intakes of both dietary components were related to a number of different indices of animal performance. Differences between treatments were found in DM intake per unit liveweight gain (H < L < HM), empty body weight gain (H < L, HM) and carcass weight gain (H < L, HM). DM utilization was similar in the three treatments, however, when carcass gains were corrected to a common level (18%) of dissectible fat in the carcass. Carcass energy gains were calculated from the results of chemical analyses and related to DM intake. DM was converted to carcass energy more efficiently in the H than in either the L or HM treatments. An analysis of dietary protein utilization showed that the efficiency of carcass protein storage in the three treatments was similar. © 1980, CSIRO.

The agenda of non-proliferation activities: Has been a full one even if its prospects are uncertain. Next month the second review conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) convenes, amidst frustration at the failure to reach conclusions of both the SALT and the Comprehensive Test Ban (CTB) negotiations. There is the general worry that the spread of nuclear technology – for instance, in the reported purchases by Pakistan of a centrifuge enrichment plant – increases the possible proliferators, along with the specific worry that a seventh state exploded a nuclear device over the south Atlantic in September 1979. Last February the International Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE) concluded two years of study. Initiated by the Carter Administration, INFCE produced findings more at odds than in accord with US policy. For instance, while it endorsed American judgments that spent fuel reprocessing for light-water reactors is uneconomical and that spent fuel storage is feasible, there was near unanimous endorsement of reprocessing for plutonium-fuelled fast breeder reactors, at least for states with large nuclear programmes. INFCE also produced estimates of nuclear energy production far more optimistic than those underlying American policies; on INFCE estimates the amount of weapons-grade plutonium in the world’s spent fuel would increase seven-fold by the end of the decade, to 500 tons or enough for 45,000 bombs. INFCE bought time and did produce some narrowing of differences – there is now general agreement among nuclear suppliers, for instance, that sensitive technologies like reprocessing should not be exported – but it did not solve potential conflicts between the United States and: Her nuclear customers, from Europe to India, rooted in differing conceptions of the role of nuclear energy in proliferation and embodied in the American Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978.

Mediterranean weather was recorded for 638 consecutive days, starting on 21 October 1976. The performance of a solar power plant producing heat at a constant temperature level of 325°C was taken as a reference by simulating the operation of the plant under different weather conditions. The size of the storage and the maximum age of the heat required for efficient operation for 70% of the days of a year are obtained with reference to the Mediterranean weather. The analysis is then extended to electrical power generation and integrative as well as total solar electricity systems are analysed. Widespread use of solar power plants to produce electricity as integrative or autonomous generators can be accomplished with various efficiencies. With the present state of knowledge concerning the storage and transmission methods of electricity, the best performances are obtained when dynamic storage is used and direct storage is avoided. © 1980, All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925923841

This radiation from LEP are investigated. This radiation is assumed to be in a parasitic mode without changing any of the operating parameters. At 86 GeV the radiation from the normal bending magnet has a critical energy of 0.4 MeV and a power of ∼500 W/m, and is probably of limited interest. High photon energies (10–20 MeV) of high intensity can be obtained from normal and superconducting wiggler magnets. Undulators can give quasi-monochromatic radiation of high brightness with photon energies of up to 5 MeV. New magnet developments might increase this energy range. Quasi-monochromatic γ-rays of ∼100 MeV can be created with soft Compton back scattering without disturbing the electron bean. This relies on future free electron lasers in the submillimetre range. The natural collimation, the polarization and the time structure make all these photon beams unique tools for research in nuclear physics. The synchrotron rediation can be used to produced photoneutrons with intensities of up to 1014 neutrons/s. It is foreseen that LEP will be equipped with superconducting cavities in later stage and that is energy will be increased to ∼130 GeV. This will approximately double the photon energies obtained from wigglers and undulators. © 1980, All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914286111

The technology of the stabilization of soluble enzymes, through chemical manipulations designed to protect them from deactivation, has made exceedingly rapid progress recently. In contrast, comparatively little has been achieved with membrane-integrated systems, such as those in the photosynthetic membranes of green plants, in spite of their undisputed technological future as solar energy converters. This chapter describes the attempts to stabilize the structure-dependent functions of only the isolated higher plant chloroplasts. Although the very first step of such endeavors is to prepare active chloroplasts, conditions necessary for that are reviewed briefly. Emphasis is placed on chemical manipulations of chloroplast membranes, and in particular on protein covalent cross-linking techniques, and the effects these have on the functions and the functional life of isolated chloroplasts. Factors contributing to the inactivation of isolated chloroplasts are elaborated. Factors whose presence in the isolation and storage media improves the activities of chloroplasts preparations are presented in a table. Cross-linking of chloroplast membrane proteins with bifunctional reagents is described. The properties of isolated spinach chloroplasts after reaction with glutaraldehyde and dimethyl suberimidate are also discussed in the chapter. © 1980, Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956991192

RBE's of thermal neutrons for M1 damages were calculated on the basis of the absorbed dose in the embryo. The RBE's for M1 seedling height and seed set were found to be about 10 and 13, respectively, when seeds containing 13% moisture were exposed to thermal neutrons. These values in rice are much smaller than those previously reported in a number of plant species. This observation is mainly attributable to the fact that prior seed RBE estimates were based on the assumption of neutron capture energy uniformly deposited throughout the entire seeds, whereas the present values were obtained on the basis of the absorbed dose in the embryo, which may be a target influenced directly by ionizations. The RBE's of thermal neutrons obtained in the present experiments are very similar to those of fast neutrons obtained earlier for rice and oats. This suggests that the radiobiological actions of thermal neutrons in plant tissues are the same as those of fast neutrons. Radiobiological effects of thermal neutrons were not affected by moisture content and post-irradiation storage of seeds, whereas the effects of γ-rays were strongly influenced by modifying factors, especially the moisture content of seeds. The RBE's of thermal neutrons relative to γ-rays were decreased to about 3 on M1 seedling height when seeds with 10% moisture were used. It is suggested from the results that the RBE of thermal neutrons for M1 damage can vary greatly depending on various modifying factors. © 1980.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49149149336

The compressor must be built for higher pressures and higher pressure ratios. The drives of heat pump compressors are not only electrical motors but are also diesel or gas-energized motors. This gives a large change in primary energy consumption. For all types of drives there is a tendency towards varying speed for capacity control. Electrical motors can do it by a change of frequency whereas combustion engines can change the speed un to 3 : 1 without any hard change of relative energy consumption. Higher speed ratios are sometimes very critical for the suction- and dischange-valves of the piston compressors. Therefore it is necessary to look for on-and-off control with a short-time heat storage. In several parts of the world investigations are going on into the influence of suction gas cooling on the energy consumption of heat pumps. A wide range of refrigerants and refrigerant mixtures must be considered as suitable for heat pumps. Quite a large field of development is in the area of thermal heat pumps. The absorption refrigerating machine is very well known but for heating purposes, new system designs and especially new working couples are necessary. Even with knowledge of the criteria for the refrigerants and solvents, it will be hard work developing optimal substrates. Beside advances in adsorption machinery there will also be developments in the fields of adsorption and resorption heat pumps. Looking towards total energy systems Rankine-cycle heat pumps are of great interest. The applications of heat pumps lie not only in low temperature heating with air, water or earth as the heat source, but also in a wide range of heat recovery systems for industry. In future the temperature range of industrial heat pumps will be going up to 573 K (300°C) or more. The development of heat pumps and their applications is in its infancy. There will be a lot of work to be done. Let us do it. © 1980.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49149144118

A classification of the flow in rod bundles is made and details of two computer codes are given. The two codes solve essentially identical sets of conservation of mass, momentum and energy, but one of them treats the fully-elliptic set of equations, and the other neglects the axial diffusion of momentum and heat. The neglect of streamwise diffusion mades the flow partially-elliptic, and brings significant reductions in computer storage, and modest savings in required computer time. Results of some validation calculations are presented with applications to reactor geometries. © 1980.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49149143987

Complexes of copper(I) with π-acceptor ligands have been used to sensitize isomerizations of organic molecules, and there is room for considerable further investigation in this area. Electron transfer reactions have been more intensively studied. These reactions fall into three broad categories: ionization, oxidative addition/reductive elimination, and excited state electron transfer. Experiments in the first two categories have generally led to rather poor storage efficiency and have required ultraviolet light. But long-lived excited states of coordination compounds can participate in chemical reactions with high efficiency, and such systems are promising for solar energy storage.

The results of bleaching experiments carried out at 440 nm showed that the presence of the polyelectrolyte causes net separation of the charged products with a quantum yield of 0.91 ± 0.15 and it was found that their disappearance could be described by a composite first- and second-order rate law in the pH range 2-12.2 with a second-order rate constant of 4.0 × 109 M-1 s-1 in the absence of added acid or alkali. This is believed to be possibly the first regeneration of reactants observed following polyelectrolyte-assisted charge separation of products of a photoinitiated electron transfer reaction. The rate of quenching in the presence of polybrene was found to be reduced to about 60% of that measured in the absence of polybrene. The effects of variation of coverage of the polyelectrolyte by ferricyanide were also studied on this system.

Both the creep compliance and the storage modulus decrease by only slightly over one order of magnitude above the main transition region, indicating that the glass transition behavior of PAN is not analogous to that of typical amorphous polymers. Further, both the activation energies for creep and the loss modulus indicate two loss peaks, one at about 100 °C and a higher one at about 125 °C. Finally, heat treatment results in an increase in the modulus, especially above the transition region, and in the elimination of the second, higher-temperature loss peak. These results are discussed in terms of reaction of nitrile groups along the PAN backbone. © 1980, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847085557

Characteristic reaction mechanisms and differences between compounds were found which can be interpreted in terms of the contribution of d-orbitals to the valence band in which photoreactive holes are generated. Evidence is provided that the behaviour of d-band semiconductors is critically influenced by a specific light-induced interaction of the interface with the redox system. This interaction leads to surface states which are apparently charged to an electric potential which is proportional or equivalent to the difference between the valence band edge and the redox potential of the electron donor (ΔE). It is the source of a photoelectrochemical reaction enthalpy which is useful for energy conversion. d-Band semiconductors thus have behaviour which is characteristically different from that of classical semiconducting compounds where hold formation is equivalent to the destruction of existing chemical bonds and the energy difference ΔE is dissipated as heat. The particular photoelectrochemical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides enable a larger variety of new applications to be explored. While the compounds of Mo and W can be used as reasonably stable electrodes for regenerative and fuel producing solar cells, those of Zr and Hf could be developed for the combined conversion and storage of solar energy by means of light-induced intercalation reactions. PtS 2, finally, could be used as a sensitive and highly selective photoelectroanalytical probe for electron-exchanging ions and molecules.

In both experiments the mean age at first oviposition of flown bugs (regardless of duration) was about one week earlier than that of unflown bugs. Duration of tethered flight was highly variable between bugs and between different days for an individual bug, and it was not correlated with preflight food consumption or body weight. Compensation for a presumed increase in energy costs by an increase in food consumption did not occur after flight or starvation, and consequently 6 days of starvation caused about a one‐week delay in the onset of oviposition. The adaptive syndrome of O. fasciatus, a long distance migrant, which minimizes the negative effects of flight on egg production includes: (1) high food consumption and fat storage the first few days posteclosion; (2) continued feeding throughout adult life; (3) independence of flight duration and fecundity from body weight (over a 25% range); (4) temporal separation of migratory flight and reproduction; and (5) possible stimulation of the onset of oviposition by flight.

Equations of energy balance are written to show that the daily quantity of metabolic energy, Q(M), is coupled with an unidentified quantity of unmeasured energy, Q(X), in order to make the equations balance. The equations challenge the assumed equivalence of direct and indirect calorimetry. The analysis takes the form of employing experimental data to calculate values for the arguable quantity, Q(X). Studies employing 24-hr direct calorimetry, 202 complete days, show that when food intake nearly matches Q(M), values for Q(X) are small and probably insignificant, but when there is a large food deficit, large positive values for Q(X) appear. Calculations are also made from studies of nutrient balance during prolonged overeating and undereating, and in nearly all cases there were large negative values for Q(X). In 52 sets of data from studies lasting 3 weeks or longer, where all the terms in the balance equation except Q(X) were either directly measured or could be readily estimated, the average value for Q(X) amounts to 705 kcal/day, or 27% of Q(M). A discussion of the nature of Q(X) considers error and the noninclusion of small quantities like the energy of combustible gases, which are not thought to be sufficient to explain Q(X). It might represent the cost of mobilizing stored fuel, or of storing excess fuel, or it might represent a change in internal energy other than fuel stores, but none of these is thought to be likely. Finally, it is emphasized that entropy exchange in man as an open thermodynamic system is not presently included in the equations of energy balance, and perhaps it must be, even though it is not directly measurable. The significance of unmeasured energy is considered in light of the poor control of obesity, or the inability to predict weight change during prolonged diet restriction or intentional overeating, and of the energetics of tissue gain in growth and loss in cachexia. It is not even well established how much food man requires to maintain constant weight. New studies as they are undertaken should try to account completely for all the possible terms of energy exchange.",,"calorimetry; energy transfer; human cell; normal human; nutrition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019314142

But in seven other 24-hr periods there was disagreement in the range of 8 to 23%, and these were usually days when the subjects ate much less than they spent metabolically. Our direct calorimeter is an insulated, water cooled suit. Continuous measurements of O2 consumption and CO2 production provided data on metabolic expenditure (M) by indirect calorimetry. The 24-hr values for M matched the energy losses within ±60 kcal (±3% of M) in four men who rested all day and lay down to sleep at night. Similar agreement was seen in one of the four who worked on a treadmill for 4 hr and stayed busy all day, but in another energy losses were 342 kcal greater than M (10% of M). When the experiments gave values for M minus the losses greater than ±60 kcal, this is called 'unmeasured energy'. In further experiments, two subjects stayed awake for 24 hr, and their unmeasured energies were 279 and 393 kcal. The same two men, eating sparingly, also worked for 24 hr so as to double their resting metabolic expenditures; the unmeasured energies were even larger, 380 and 958 kcal. When they repeated the 24 hr of mild work, but ate nearly as much as they spent metabolically, one man was near energy balance, while the other showed an unmeasured energy of -363 kcal. Little heat storage was evident in these experiments; therefore, heat balance was present and energy balance should have been present. In the group of 13 experiments, it appeared that the greater the food deficit, the larger was the unmeasured energy (excess of metabolic expenditure over loss of energy).",,"calorimetry; energy transfer; human cell; normal human",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019307416

The contamination zone is estimated to contain 10 5 to 106 curies of strontium-90 (reference radionuclide); a relatively small fraction of the total may have been dispersed as an aerosol. A plausible explanation for the incident is the use of now-obsolete techniques for waste storage and cesium-137 isotope separation. However, the source of the contamination was not unequivocally attributable to a single event, and its exact nature must await release of more information by the Soviet Union. Radioactive contamination appears to have resulted in resettlement of the human population from a significant area (100 to 1000 square kilometers).

The number of upsets observed at low photon fluxes depends on the total number of photons which have been incident on the device but is independent of the dose rate. This behavior is consistent with preliminary calculations which assume that the upsets are caused by alpha particles produced in the silicon chip by the nuclear reaction 28Si(r,a)24Mg.

When a bath is being mixed, if water from the solar tap is now included in the mix instead of cold water, then draw-off of hot tap water is reduced. Total usage of solar water is simultaneously increased, lowering the solar store's average temperature. This results, at the collector, in increased operating time and efficiency, lowering the long term usage of auxiliary energy. The energy saving is analysed and significant parameters are derived. The effect of storage capacity on this saving is discussed. An example of retrospectively adding a solar bath tap is worked out, based on a U.K. home with four occupants. The marginal rate of return on the cost of the modification is in this case shown to be about double the rate of return on the cost of the basic solar system.

The latter are controversial, partly because these CO2 releases may be balanced by accelerated regrowth following clearing of some forests, while others were being converted to agricultural or other nonforest land. A simulation model was used to reconstruct changes since 1860 and project four hypothetical future scenarios of CO2 injection to 2460. Nineteen compartments and their exchanges of carbon were considered. Areal extents of tropical forests, other wooded ecosystems, and nonforests were incorporated into the model. Rapidly and slowly exchanging pools of carbon per unit area were projected by integrating income-loss differential equations numerically. Estimated cumulative releases of CO2 from fossil fuels (plus cement) near 120 Pg of carbon (1 Pg = 1015 g) from 1860 to 1970 were assumed to equal the prompt plus delayed releases due to forest clearing. Limits of exploitable forest area and biomass were evaluated and found to contribute much less future CO2 than usable fossil fuels. Ultimate release from the latter (7500±2500 Pg C) could increase atmospheric CO2 manyfold: doubling the assumed 1860 levels as early as (1) the year 2032 for assumed early fossil-use scenarios and (2) the year 2045 for late fossil-use scenarios. Depending on the poorly known parametes that were programmed to constrain the organic production rates, cumulative storage, and the response of plants and soils to enhanced atmospheric CO2, biospheric storage might reach higher levels for all scenarios than the estimates given here. However, maximizing such storage in real life would require much closer understanding and wiser management of ecosystems than history has shown. © 1980.",,"carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; climate; land use; model; nonbiological model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019257196

In the normal healthy body, the synthesis, storage, and release of triglyceride are essential for balancing the supply of metabolisable substrates. On the other hand, the storage of excessive quantities of triglyceride results in obesity that is generally recognized as a major nutritional disease of many industrially developed countries. Obesity is not the only metabolic disorder in which adipose tissue is important. Its key role in the energy homeostasis of the whole body means that it is important for its metabolism to respond to changes in the concentrations of circulating metabolites and hormones. This means that endocrine disorders such as diabetes are reflected in changes in adipose tissue metabolism. This chapter discusses those aspects of research on adipose tissues, which help in the understanding of its role in health and disease. Much of the research has been carried out on tissue from rats although the detailed pattern of metabolism in adipose tissue of experimental animals is rather different from that of humans. © 1980, Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press.",,"glucose; insulin; lipoprotein lipase; adipose tissue; adult; animal; basal metabolic rate; child; cytology; drug effect; female; human; kinetics; metabolism; mouse; obesity; physiology; rat; review; transport at the cellular level; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Biological Transport; Child; Female; Glucose; Humans; Insulin; Kinetics; Lipoprotein Lipase; Mice; Obesity; Rats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019234129

Results from an engineering analysis of a water heating unit are used to establish the energy savings due to improved cylinder insulation and lower storage temperature. A solar space and water heating system is analysed to determine the fraction of total heating load that can be met by harnessing solar energy. the analyses demonstrate that the potential of conservation measures to reduce energy use can be substantial—by raising the insulation level on the building and on the water heating cylinder, by lowering the water storage temperature, and by installing an optimized solar heating system, the energy requirement can be reduced to 0·37 times what it is today for a typical uninsulated home.

The total food and drink available for human consumption in the United Kingdom would provide approximately 13 MJ (3100 kcal)/person per d, while the energy intake recommended for the population is approximately 9.6 MJ (2300 kcal)/person per d. A proportion of this substantial difference must be due to wastage in the home as well as in catering establishments and during the storage, distribution and processing of food. 2. As part of a general investigation of this problem, a representative sample of 1000 British households was asked to collect all the potentially-edible food wasted in their homes during 1 week, and to keep a record of the food, other than commercial pet food, which they gave to pets and wild birds. A total of 672 households co-operated fully, 338 in summer and 334 in winter. Each food sample received was weighed, and its energy content was determined calorimetrically. 3. Significantly more waste food was collected in summer than in winter, equivalent to 9.3 MJ (2220 kcal)/household per week and 7.1 MJ (1700 kcal)/household per week respectively. In terms of energy, cereals, fat and meat wastage predominated, while in terms of weight, milk was more important and fat less so. 4. Considerable quantities of otherwise edible food were also given to pets and birds, accounting on average for a further 2.4 MJ (570 kcal) and 3.0 MJ (710 kcal)/household per week in summer and winter respectively. The energy content of all food wasted in the home therefore averaged 11.7 MJ (2790 kcal)/household per week in summer and 10.1 MJ (2410 kcal)/household per week in winter, equivalent to 0.6 MJ (150 kcal) and 0.5 MJ (130 kcal)/person per d respectively. This is less than one-quarter of the gap between food supplies and the amount of food thought to be eaten in the UK. 5. Food wastage was significantly influenced by the composition of the family, with adults wasting more in absolute terms than children, and larger households wasting less per person than smaller households. However, with few exceptions, neither income nor geographical region significantly affected the total amount of food wasted in the home. 6. When assessed against the expected usage of food in the home, wastage accounted on average for 6.5% of the energy intake in summer and 5.4% in winter. © 1980, The Nutrition Society.

For all industries, including metal working, the options for disposal of hazardous waste recommended by the EPA, in order of priority, are: minimize waste generation by modifying the industrial process used; transfer of waste to another industry that can utilise it; reprocess the waste to recover energy or materials; separate hazardous waste from nonhazardous waste at the source and concentrate it to reduce handling, transportation and disposal costs; incinerate the waste; disposal by landfill. The cradle to grave control of hazardous waste under the RCRA is based upon the reporting of hazardous waste through a manifest system.

In electron microscopic investigations of human liver needle biopsies, sequestration of hepatocellular cytoplasm was found in healthy probands without liver disease. From this the question arises as to whether and to what an extent these findings are caused by preparation artifacts, or whether they are an expression of apocrine secretion mechanisms occurring in hepatocytes under normal conditions. We tried to answer this question by evaluating electron microscopic results obtained both in the healthy and in the diseased human liver. Material and methods. Liver needle biopsies from 33 healthy volunteers or patients with biochemical serum abnormalities without any clinical or morphologic evidence of liver disease and 13 liver diseased patients were studied by light and electron microscopy. For electron microscopy: fixation for 2 hours in ice cold 1% OsO4 solution (pH 7.2) (18 cases) or for 3-5 hours in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (pH 7.2) with postfixation for 2 hours in 1% OsO4 solution (28 cases). - Dehydration in an ascending acetone series. Embedding in Micropal. Post-contrast with lead nitrate and sodium citrate. Results. Besides microvilli, we found cytoplasmic protrusions in varying size, form, number and localization on the surfaces of the hepatocytes bodering Disse's space and the interparenchymal spaces, as well as the bile canaliculi (Figs. 1-4, 5b, 10). Hepatocellular cytoplasmic portions of this structure and microvilli are also freely located in Disse's (Figs. 6, 7, 10) and the interparenchymal (Figs. 2, 3, 8a) spaces, in the bile canaliculi (Figs. 4, 5a, 9) and in the sinusoids (Figs. 6, 8a). They were also observed partially or completely surrounded by the cytoplasm of the Kupffer cells (Fig. 8b). The cytoplasmic portions and protrusions differ from the hepatocellular cytoplasm only in their contents of cytoplasmic components and organelles or else there is no difference (cp. Figs. 1-12). On the connecting point of the protrusions to the hepatocytes, the cytoplasmic ground substance often is more electron dense (Figs. 4, 5b) or there are membrane-bound, predominantly electron-optically empty vacuoles arranged in rows with small cytoplasmic connecting bridges between them (Figs. 1, 2, 5b). Variously electron-dense - sometimes strongly osmiophilic, partly lamellar - structures are often seen in these extracellular spaces (Figs. 1, 2, 6, 9). The cytoplasmic portions located freely in the extracellular spaces - including those the size of the microvilli - may exhibit features of dissolution and degradation (Figs. 3, 5, 7, 9). Sequestration of cytoplasm was also observed in Kupffer cells and in lymphocytes within the sinusoidal lumen (Figs. 11, 12). - Differently developed and in varying localisations, these findings were present in 19 of 46 liver needle biopsies investigated. They were observed in 12 healthy probands and in patients with biochemical serum abnormalities without any clinical or light microscopic evidence of liver disease, but often with features of metabolic activation of the liver, and in 7 diseased livers (2 liver cirrhosis, 2 prolonged viral hepatitis, 2 persistent hepatitis, 1 cholesterol ester storage disease). The quantitative and qualitative appearance of these findings is stronger in diseased livers, especially in liver cirrhosis, than in healthy livers. In persons without liver disease, these alterations are localized almost exclusively in the periphery of liver lobules. There is no connection of these findings with icterus or cholestasis, and there are no quantitative and qualitative differences in their development relative to the fixation methods employed. Discussion. Shedding peripheral cytoplasm is caused mainly by energy insufficiency in the cell. The intravital development of this process is demonstrated by several observations under pathological conditions and by experimental investigation results as well. But energy insufficiency in cells may also be caused during preparation. Therefore the occurrence of this alteration as a preparation artifact is possible. - On the other hand these findings amount to three known electron microscopic equivalents of the apocrine secretion mechanism (micro- and macroapocrinia and secretion in “quanta”). Together with the observed evidence for dissolution and degradation in the sequestered cytoplasmic portions and the results obtained in pathologically altered livers, these findings militate in favour of the occurrence of apocrine mechanisms in the bile canaliculi, Disse's and the interparenchymal spaces in hepatocytes located at the periphery of liver lobules in normal and metabolically activated liver, as well as the sequestration of peripheral cytoplasm based on these mechanisms as an adaptative reaction of hepatocytes to pathological conditions.

The solar collector-storage system is used to preheat the ventilating air required by animal confinement structures, and thus reduce their demand for fossil fuel energy. In this system, all collected energy is delivered to the heated space in the ventilating air. This air is drawn continuously through the concrete wall on its way to the building. Given hourly or daily total solar insolation on a horizontal surface and hourly or daily average ambient temperature, we first calculate the available energy at the vertical collector, and the amount transmitted through the transparent covers. Then the collection process is simulated, and we predict the total collected energy, the amount supplied to the building, and the portion retained in storage for each day. During the 1977-1978 heating season we analyzed performance data for 7 periods of approximately one month each. We also simulated system performance for these periods, and relative error between measured and simulated performance ranged from 0 to 12 per cent with all but one month within 6 per cent. © 1980.",,"ENERGY CONSERVATION; HEATING - Solar; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; FARM BUILDINGS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019211317

Glycidylmethacrylate was used as a vinylating reagent and the reaction product with enzymes (HRP, GOD, Am, ChT) was copolymerized with different matrices (cellulose, Sepharose, Sephadex, Starch). Various factors affect the final activity of copolymers; these include the redox system, the type of support, and the quantity and type of vinyl monomer added. Using a fixed quantity of enzyme and support (3 mg enzyme, 100 mg support), the coupling efficiency varied from 2 to 50%. The most important characteristics in these immobilized systems were tested (stability in continuous washing, kinetic characteristics, storage, thermal, and lyophilization stability). Immobilized‐enzyme graft copolymers have very similar kinetic behavior to that of the free enzyme. Diffusion is not seriously limited, as shown by kinetic parameters and energy activation values, and this indicates that the immobilization reaction does not alter the enzymatic activity.

In the case of corn, the energy inputs totalled 3,146, 2,986, and 3,902 Btu/2.9 oz serving for canned, frozen, and refrigerated market forms. The corresponding figures (Btu/2.3 oz serving) for snap beans were 2,913, 2,715, and 2,134, respectively. The difference between the magnitudes for the canned and frozen forms is not significant. Further, because of the variability in the energy data for the different stages in the food cycle, magnitudes of energy consumption different than those listed may be obtained. The present and earlier studies on vegetables show that edible yield (number of servings) plays a major role in the energy consumed in the total cycle. Based on the present and previously published studies on energy consumption for vegetables, it appears that raw or refrigerated vegetables with yields more than about 40%will require less energy than other market forms. In this context, while most raw vegetables have yields higher than 40% they have short storage lives. Therefore, a large number of vegetables must be frozen or canned for long term availability.

The analysis reveals for the first time a new and unexpected term in the line to output response of the Cúk converter. The new term contains a right half-plane zero produced by the energy transfer capacitance in combination with the duty-ratio-weighted sum of the on-resistances of the transistor and diode plus a non-dissipative ac resistance term due to transistor storage-time modulation. The conventional circuit model of the converter is modified to include the effects of the new term. The improved model permits an easy physical interpretation of the, new zero, which has been observed only in the Cúk converter. An extended analysis of storage-time modulation in bipolar transistor switches shows that the ac small-signal performance of a switching converter is highly dependent on the nature of the base drive. It is demonstrated that storage-time modulation in conjunction with a proportional base drive can produce instability in switching converters, even open-loop.

The report is intended to assist individuals and organisations concerned with this problem, including: National and local authorities; Compilers of contingency plans; Managers of disposal organisations; Oil spill clean-up supervisors; Industry personnel. The nature of the collected material, its transportation and storage, is outlined. The disposal techniques which are described result (in order of preference) in: recovery of oil for re-use, or stabilisation of the oily waste, or destruction or decomposition of the oil. Recovery techniques include gravity separation, emulsion-breaking and a variety of washing or extraction procedures. Oily waste may be stabilised through use in civil works or by a range of landfill procedures. Destructive techniques include biological degradation or heat treatment (which may permit heat recovery). Some indication of manpower requirements and costs is given, together with a 'desirability rating' for the various methods of disposal, although final choice of disposal method will always depend on local conditions and the legal constraints of each case. Close co-operation is urged between authorities and industry, before, during and after an oil spill, to ensure that collected oil is disposed of in an environmentally acceptable, cost-effective and energy-conserving manner.

However, as with all fuels or energies, heavy penalties are occasionally paid by persons who fail to follow sound basic rules and precautions. It is necessary to keep in perspective the problems and potential hazards involved with LPG, especially when it is compared with other fuels. Commerce and industry have been using LPG for many years. It is a popular product in the catering industry, as a fuel for forklift trucks, taxis, delivery vans and as a convenient portable or mobile source of heat. In refined versions LPG is used as a carrier for aerosols and as cigarette lighter fuel etc. In industry it is very popular for its low pollution properties and from many process viewpoints it is a most satisfactory fuel. In the present paper an overview is presented of the physical and chemical properties of LPG having a bearing on safety and health. Two case studies are discussed.

In the past the gas was seen as a free fuel source and little effort was made to reduce the energy required for digester heating. The small amount of gas available after meeting the digester heating requirements was not worth exploiting and was burned into the atmosphere. Depending on the utilization pattern (engines that drive process blowers, pumps, electric generators or boilers) digester heat requirements and incoming sludge requirements differ. Digester heat losses must be looked at if optimization is to be achieved; tank insulation and insulation of the tank-wall play an important part in minimising heat losses. Proper design of gas storage facilities also is important as is gas safety equipment and selection of standby heating capabilities for digester start up or for periods when the engines are down for servicing or repairs. A final paragraph on engine selection concludes the paper. Spark ignited and dual fuel engines are most commonly used for digester gas. A standby fuel supply ensures continuous engine operation during a period of digest gas production failure.

When the first C-C-2W is deposited in the intimamedia, the primary cause of their retention is the stress-induced polarization of the membrane. C-C-2W possesses a permanent dipole moment which may be reversed by the field produced by the radial expansion/contraction of the arteries. The initial C-C-2W increases the polarization of the aorta walls, favoring accumulation of more oriented material on top of the first. C-C-2W is also ferroelectric and constitutes a polar continuum with the membranes. By the time fatty streaks appear, the entire aorta wall is ferroelectric and energy has been stored in the walls under the form of residual polarization. This storage gradually destroys the wall, leading to aneurism.

Free fatty acids become available to muscle from plasma free fatty acids and triglycerides, and from intracellular triglyceride lipid droplets. Transport of long‐chain fatty acyl groups into the mitochondria requires esterification and de‐esterification with carnitine by the “twin” enzymes carnitine palmityltransferase (CPT) I and II, bound to the outer and inner faces of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Carnitine deficiency occurs in two clinical syndromes. (1) In the myopathic form, there is weakness; muscle biopsy shows excessive accumulation of lipid droplets; and the carnitine concentration is markedly decreased in muscle but normal in plasma. (2) In the systemic form, there are weakness and recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy; muscle biopsy shows lipid storage; and the carnitine concentration is decreased in muscle, liver, and plasma. The etiology of carnitine deficiency is not known in either the myopathic or the systemic form, but administration of carnitine or corticosteroids has been beneficial in some patients. “Secondary” carnitine deficiency may occur in patients with malnutrition, liver disease, chronic hemodialysis, and, possibly, mitochondrial disorders. CPT deficiency causes recurrent myoglobinuria, usually precipitated by prolonged exercise or fasting. Muscle biopsy may be normal or show varying degrees of lipid storage. Genetic transmission is probably autosomal recessive, but the great male predominance (20/21) remains unexplained. In many cases, lipid storage myopathy is not accompanied by carnitine or CPT deficiency, and the biochemical error remains to be identified.

Changes in turbidity and loss of energy transfer between fluorescent probes present in the bilayers were used to estimate membrane integrity. Freezing caused a 30 to 40% destruction of protein-free liposomes, in absence of CPA. CPA at 10 to 20% concentration prevented such losses, but at higher concentrations destabilized liposomes even without freezing. Protein-containing liposomes suffered no loss on freezing in absence or presence of CPA at moderate concentrations. Lowering of the storage temperature of frozen samples within the range of −5 to −27 °C increased the freeze damage. Slower rates of cooling and warming caused a slightly greater loss. The results are interpreted in terms of the liquid mosaic model for lipid bilayers. CPA at higher concentrations destabilize bilayers by dissolving phospholipids. At moderate concentrations, however, they prevent the damaging effect of dehydration of the lipid on freezing. Proteins appear to stabilize bilayers by providing increased hydration at the membrane surface, and by additional hydrophobic binding in the membrane interior. © 1980, All rights reserved.",,"chlorophyll a; cryoprotective agent; glycoprotein; liposome; membrane protein; n,n' di(octadecyl)oxacarbocyanine; phosphatidylcholine; unclassified drug; article; cryopreservation; cryoprotection; freezing; pharmacokinetics; thawing; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019131907

A permeable, energy extracting barrier is introduced and the optimum head/flow ratio is determined for maximum power generation with an ebb/flood operating scheme. Pumped energy storage is introdiced by allowing for a complex head/flow ratio and the maximum available net power at optimum design condition is shown to be very much greater than without pumping. The mouth is shown to be the best location. The energy available under various operating constraints, from estuaries of different lengths, is compared with the original energy dissipation in the estuaries.

The absorption of solar radiation as it passes through the pond water is considered and an evaluation is made of the resulting temperature and heat fluxes at various levels in the pond during its year-round operation by solving the Fourier heat conduction equation, with appropriate boundary conditions, in different zones of the pond. This evaluation, combined with energy balance considerations, enables an expression for the transient rate at which heat can be retrieved—in order to keep the temperature of the convective zone constant—to be derived. Numerical calculations, corresponding to solar heat flux and atmospheric air temperature measurements carried out in New Delhi during 1974, are made and the optimisation of the sizes of the non-convective and convective zones in the pond is investigated. Optimal heat retrieval efficiencies of 42%, 33·5%, 29·5% and 26·5% are predicted at extraction temperatures of 40°C, 60°C, 80°C and 100°C, respectively. However, the load levelling improves as the non-convective zone is oversized. A phase difference of about 30 to 45 days is also noted between the incident solar flux and the heat retrieved when the size of the non-convective zone is near its optimum. The efficiency of the solar-pond system for converting solar energy into mechanical work is also studied. This efficiency is found to increase with collection temperature and to tend to level off at collection temperatures above 90°C. © 1980, All rights reserved.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR RADIATION",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019084161

Intraventricular administration of norepinephrine (NE, 10 μg/rat) stimulated food intake in both rats. Intraventricular administration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG, 3.8 mg/rat) induced hyperphagia and concomitant hyperglycemia in lean rats. However, in fatty rats, the blood glucose was elevated but food intake was unaltered after 2DG administration. Subcutaneous administration of insulin (2 or 8 U/kg) stimulated food intake of both rats. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hypoinsulinemia produced transient reduction of food intake followed by sustained diabetic hyperphagia in lean rats. In fatty rats, the experimental hypoinsulinemia caused transient aphagia but not sustained diabetic hyperphagia. Daily injection of insulin (5 U/rat) restored energy assimilation in both diabetic rats. An increase in food intake due to insulin injection was remarkable only in diabetic fatty rats. From these findings, the regulatory system of food intake in fatty rats appears to be sensitive to changes in the circulating insulin level but insensitive to either glucoprivation or changes in body storage of energy.",,"deoxyglucose; insulin; noradrenalin; streptozocin; deoxyglucose; deoxysugar; insulin; noradrenalin; animal experiment; central nervous system; feeding behavior; hyperphagia; hypoinsulinemia; rat; animal; article; disease model; drug effect; feeding behavior; female; obesity; pathophysiology; psychophysiology; Animal; Deoxy Sugars; Deoxyglucose; Disease Models, Animal; Feeding Behavior; Female; Insulin; Norepinephrine; Obesity; Rats; Satiety Response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019081950

Modularity is obtained through the use of multiple concentrators to achieve the desired power level (up to 10MW);the system is connected to an electric utility grid but is capable of operation in a stand-alone mode. The power conversion subsystem is packaged into a single assembly which includes (1) a cavity receiver, (2) thermal transport hardware, (3) a heat engine and (4) a synchronous a-c generator. In the example presented, the baseline heat engine is a Stirling cycle power plant and the receiver is a high temperature (∼800°C) sodium pool boiler; thermal transport is provided by a short pipe with the dual function of delivering sodium vapor to the engine heater head and returning liquid condensate to the boiler.The optimization procedure is presented through a series of trade studies, which include the results of optical /thermal analyses and individual subsystem trades. The optical/thermal analyses include the effect of concentrator rim angle, surface slope error, pointing error, geometric concentration ratio and pertinent cavity parameters including shape, temperature and inner surface radiation properties. For the concentrator, the effects pf slope error, rim angle and diameter on unit cost (dollars/m2 of aperture) arepresented as part of an overall cost analysis which generates total system lifecycle energy cost as the optimization parameter.

However, in order to overcome the poor heat transfer characteristics associated with the solidification of the PCM on heat transfer surfaces, large surface areas need to be provided. This is often achieved by encapsulation in either large or small containers, which has the effect of increasing the cost and reducing the effective energy density. Furthermore PCMs can only accept and release heat at one particular temperature. In an attempt to overcome these limitations thermal energy storage using saturated salt solutions has been examined. The energy density for a number of promising salts has been calculated and confirmed by experiment. Energy density increases of up to 4 times that of water are possible, depending on the salt used and the temperature swing permitted. The deposition of crystals from the solution on heat exchanger surfaces has been overcome by the use of a novel self-cleaning technique. © 1980, All rights reserved.",,"SALTS - Applications; PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS; SATURATED SOLUTIONS; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; Solutions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019071442

The design of on-line production control systems can be divided in two steps: the design of the information system and the design of the production scheduling system. The information system includes data acquisition concerning the mill operation, sales and overall economy of the mill. These are presented in different specific numbers describing for instance the efficiency and the productivity of the mill. The production scheduling system is, in a way, a part of this information system, including algorithms for resource allocation of production control and energy management. The paper also addresses some general viewpoints on planning the total system. © 1980, All rights reserved.","decentralization; hierarchical systems; Induustrial systems; linear programming; production control; pulp and paper mills; scheduling","DATA PROCESSING - Manufacturing Applications; Paper and pulp mills",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019070486

A given phase progression of the incident wave in the direction of periodicity induces a modal structure in the elastodynamic field and leads to the introduction of the so-called spectral orders. The main tools in the analysis are the elastodynamic Green-type integral relations. They follow from the two-dimensional form of the elastodynamic field reciprocity theorem, where in the latter a Green state adjusted to the periodicity of the structure at hand is used. One of these relations is a vectorial integral equation from which the elastodynamic field quantities can be determined. The consequences of field reciprocity in the structure and of the conservation of energy are developed in view of their serving as a check on numercal results to be obtained from the relevant integral equations. The formalism thus developed applies to profiles, if periodic, of arbitrary shape and size and can without too serious difficulties be implemented on a computer. The major difficulty in this respect is the relevant Green function, the series representation of it being slowly convergent. Its evaluation becomes tractable after an appropriate technique for accelerating the convergence. The only practical limitations are then put by the speed of the computer and its storage capacity. © 1980, North-Holland Publishing Company.

The films had been negatively charged by Townsend breakdown at a voltage of −5 kV at various temperatures ranging from 90 to 130°C. The surface charge densities observed were of the order of 10-8 C cm-2, corresponding to full trap densities of the order of 1014 cm−3. The short-circuit TSC spectra of newly charged samples show a single peak at a temperature between 98 and 102°C. The thermal activation energy associated with this peak was found to be 1.2 eV. An analysis of TSCs indicates that electrons are subject to fast retrapping in PS. The ratio of the mean charge depth to the sample thickness is found to increase from 0.069 to 0.12 with the increase in the temperature of polarization, indicating a higher charge accommodation at higher temperatures of polarization. The trap-modulated mobility values for electrons at the TSC peak temperatures are the order of 10−12 cm2 V−1s−1.

The aspects of CO2 control are discussed, as well as the available CO2 control points (CO2 removal sites). The primary factor affecting the practicability of a CO2 control system is the energy required by the control system. Of the three potential CO2 control points, removal from the stacks of fossil fuel power plants appears to require the least amount of energy. Estimates of the energy required to capture and recover CO2 from coal-fired power plant stacks by various processes are presented. Although capture and recovery of CO2 is an important consideration in the overall scheme of CO2 control, disposal or reuse of recovered CO2 may be the weakest link in the CO2 control chain. Of the several options considered, deep ocean storage appears to be the most promising. Two control scenarios are evaluated, one based on the absorption of CO2 contained in power plant flue gas by seawater; the other, based on absorption of CO2 by monoethanolamine (MEA). Captured CO2 is injected into the deep ocean in both cases. Our analyses indicate that capture and disposal by seawater is not feasible, whereas capture and disposal using MEA is a possibility. However, the economic penalties of CO2 control are significant; for example, at a CO2 removal efficiency of 50%, it is estimated that the power generation efficiency of a conventional coal-fired power plant would be reduced from 34% to about 25%. The cost of power generation would be expected to double. For 90% CO2 removal, power generation efficiency is reduced to between 15 and 6% and the cost of power generation increases by a factor of from 4 to 7. The use of non-fossil energy sources, such as nuclear or solar energy, to control the CO2 emissions resulting from fossil energy usage is not considered in this study. © 1980.",,"AIR POLLUTION - Control; ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION; CARBON DIOXIDE; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; air quality control; prevention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019042690

The parameters considered include: cell geometry, electrode and lead dimensions, water generation and consumption, electrolyte movement, heat generation and dissipation, and active material utilization. The results show that balancing of electrolyte transport processes is essential for stable long term operation.

As predicted on the basis of morphological criteria (large physiological cross‐section and long parallel fibers), the vastus lateralis is of special functional significance in leaping. This relatively large muscle consistently initiates the leap and frequently undergoes a very long period of force enhancement via active stretch. By contrast, the vastus intermedius fails to exhibit increased electrical activity and undergoes little or no active stretch during jumps. The myological details of vastus intermedius (short fibers, no fusion with other components), therefore, cannot be accounted for as adaptations to leaping. Rather, a primary postural role is indicated for the vastus intermedius, because in normal resting postures, with the knee quite flexed, it alone is continuously active. The existence of a fibrocartilaginous superior patella in the tendon of vastus intermedius, however, is most plausibly related to the complex tensile and compressive stresses generated in the tendon during the completely hyperflexed phase of leaping. The phasic patterning of the quadriceps femoris of Lemur fulvus does not point to any special role of the vastus lateralis or vastus intermedius during walking and galloping; it does indicate very different patterns of muscle recruitment in comparison to those in nonprimate mammals and some anthropoid primates. The forward cross walk (diagonal sequence, diagonal couplets) of primates versus the backward cross gait (lateral sequence) of most other mammals probably accounts for some of these differences. Lemur fulvus lacks the degree of elastic storage and release of kinetic energy in the quadriceps femoris that characterizes the gallop of dogs, cats, and Erythrocebus patas.

This paper describes an evaluation of a wide variety of energy conservation approaches. A standard 20‐knot, 300‐hour Destroyer mission is established so that all of the approaches can be compared on a total fuel required basis. The approaches studied include use of aluminum hull construction; light weight machinery; trail‐shaft or cross‐connect operation for twin screw ships; improved performance propulsors; advanced power plant types, such as COGAS or cruise engines; use of energy storage techniques to improve ship service generator performance; electrical load reductions; improved performance ship service generators; hull drag reductions; crew size reductions; design margin reduction; reduced performance requirement (such as top speed); and habitability standard reductions. The overall results can be effected by reductions in range requirements as well. Mission duration was held constant at 45 days throughout the study. The results of the study indicate that the combination of these various possible improvements may reduce the fuel used to be as low as one‐third of the current levels.

Complex elastic modulus and mechanical loss tangent were obtained continuously with time under the conditions of constant ambient temperature as a function of imposed strain amplitude. Brittle failure was observed under the conditions of low ambient temperatures and small strain amplitudes, or forced convection of air, whereas thermal failure was observed under the conditions of high ambient temperatures, or large strain amplitudes and natural convection of air. In the case of brittle failure, the dynamic storage modulus E′ exhibited a maximum and the loss tangent tanδ exhibited a minimum on approaching the point of failure. In the case of thermal failure, E′ decreased and tanδ increased monotonously until the onset of thermal failure. It was found that failure occurs when the effective energy loss reaches a certain magnitude depending on an ambient temperature. The fatigue criterion was represented schematically from a standpoint of self‐heating. When the heat generation rate of the specimen under cyclic staining is larger than that of the heat transfer to the surroundings, thermal failure takes place. In this case, the specimen temperature increases up to a limiting constant temperature corresponding to the α‐absorption temperature. When the heat generation rate is nearly equal to that of the heat transfer to the surroundings, the specimen temperature does not change appreciably and brittle failure takes place.

Thermal storage of energy as pressurised saturated hot water has done this job for years, but only on a small scale because of cost limitation of the steel pressure vessel. This paper shows that steel lined cavities deep underground, using the rock to provide containment, are economical and practical in large capacities for this energy storage. By reducing the cavity pressure, steam is flashed from the hot water and used to drive peaking turbines when needed; at low load periods surplus steam is condensed in the water to recharge the vault. The saturation pressure of the hot water is borne by the overburden pressure of the rock formation in which the storage vault is prepared. At usual steam plant saturation temperatures the effective storage density is in the range of 18-21 electric kWh/m3 of storage volume, which is 20-50 times the capacity of the usual pumped hydro systems. Recovery of stored energy ranges from 75-90 per cent. The cost of a facility to deliver 1000 MW of peaking power for 10 h would fall in the range of $250-350 million, including indirect costs, interest, etc. The underground facilities represent about 40 per cent of the cost: the balance is for conventional generating and steam plant equipment. © 1980.",,"ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018994394

These data demonstrate the suitability of the reaction for storing solar energy, and for pumping heat, either for use in space heating (at a solar coefficient of performance &gt; 1), air conditioning, or both. CaCl2reacts with CH3OH to form CaCl2˙2CH3OH with an enthalpy and entropy of reaction 51.7 kJ (mole CH3OH) -' and 126 J deg-1 (mole CH3OH)-1, respectively. Reaction kinetics close to equilibrium are complex, although the reaction is first order when the temperature of the reacting salt is far from equilibrium. Heat transfer through the salt appears to follow the Russel equation, and reaction rates are not limited by mass transfer in a well-designed system. In the heating mode, a solar coefficient of performance (COP) of about 1.6 should be achievable if the entire heat of CH3OH condensation is used; this could permit a substantial reduction in solar collector area for a given amount of heat delivered to the load. In the cooling mode, the COP should be about 0.6.

The maximum slope of the membrane potential changes produced by 10-fold change in [K]0 plotted on a log scale was 31 mV in the presence of 3 x 10-4 M ATP, and this slope was 45 mV in 10-3 M ATP measured in the range of 5.9 to 23.6 mM. In high [K]0, ATP did not hyperpolarize the membrane. The reversal potential level for ATP was observed in the range of -71 to -75 mV. In low [Ca]0, the duration of the ATP-induced hyperpolarization was markedly reduced. The ATP-induced hyperpolarization was classified into two components; the fast phase being less sensitive to Ca and the subsequent slow Ca sensitive phase which was blocked in the presence of low [Ca]0 or MnCl2. ATP and adenosine relaxed the tissue in the presence of high [K]0 or acetylcholine. These results suggest that ATP mainly increases the K-conductance and in part the Na-conductance of the membrane. Presumably, ATP suppresses the Ca-mobilization from the storage site rather than the Ca-influx.",,"acetylcholine; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; adenylylimidodiphosphate; atropine; calcium; ouabain; propranolol; purine derivative; animal experiment; cardiovascular system; coronary artery; drug comparison; drug response; guinea pig; heart; in vitro study; smooth muscle fiber membrane potential; Acetylcholine; Adenosine; Adenosine Monophosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate; Animal; Calcium; Chlorides; Coronary Vessels; Female; Guinea Pigs; In Vitro; Male; Membrane Potentials; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Osmolar Concentration; Potassium; Sodium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018973380

The model assumes steady-state heat transfer, and the surrounding soil is considered to be homogeneous and isotropic. Changes in soil thermal properties due to moisture migration, whether driven by thermal or hydrostatic gradients, are assumed negligible [2]. The optimal distribution is determined using the method of Lagrange multipliers. It is shown that the marginal cost per unit of energy lost and per unit of tank surface area must be the same at all points on the surface of the tank as the condition for minimum total heat loss with a given total investment in insulation. This condition appears to apply for all axi-symmetric in-ground tank geometries. For a given volume of insulation, the incremental increase in storage efficiency with an optimal redistribution of the insulation is a function of tank geometry. The problem of determining the optimal total investment in insulation for a given marginal cost of fuel is described and a method of solution is outlined. © 1980.",,"ENERGY STORAGE - Mathematical Models; HEAT TRANSFER; SOLAR ENERGY; HEAT STORAGE TANKS; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018971496

There, approximately two‐thirds of the energy produced by the fuel is removed as waste heat. This heat is carried away by the cooling waters, is dispersed into the atmosphere or surface‐water bodies, and is lost for other potential uses. When condenser cooling systems such as towers or ponds are used, there is also a considerable net loss of water through evaporation. Injection and storage of spent cooling waters underground would reduce the evaporative (consumptive) losses to the atmosphere. Later, these waters could be recovered for use in heating and in industrial or agricultural applications. The resulting conservation of energy and water may make such a project economically feasible in the near future as the costs of water and fuel increase. In this paper, we review the use of ground water from a confined aquifer for this application and analyze a simple configuration of one withdrawal and one injection well to determine: (1) the areal extent of temperature changes caused by reinjection of spent cooling waters into the aquifer from which they originated; and (2) how long it would take for the water to become too hot to use for cooling.

Amongst several storage concepts, latent heat storage is quite suitable because of its high storage density and almost constant temperature during charging and discharging. The temperature range between 200 and 300°C is considered to be important for solar total energy systems. In this temperature range, sodium nitrate and its mixed salts with other nitrates including eutectic and off-eutectic salts are candidates. The present paper deals with heat transfer in a latent heat storage unit utilizing these salts. A method of rough estimation of the thermal conductivity of the storage materials is described, and the temperature history of the storage material experimentally obtained is compared with numerical solutions and found to be in reasonably good agreement. It is seen that the temperature of the heat transfer surface quickly drops soon after the appearance of a solid phase due to low thermal conductivity of these salts. Ways to avoid this temperature drop are discussed. © 1980.",,"HEAT TRANSFER; NITRATES; SOLAR ENERGY; NITRATE SALTS; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018959229

Analysis of the two selected conceptual systems included establishing a plant process flow configuration, an operational scenario, a preliminary FBHX/TES design, and parametric analysis. A computer model was developed to determine the effects of the number of stages, gas temperatures, gas flows, bed materials, charge and discharge time, and parasitic power required for operation. The maximum national energy conservation potential of the cement plant application with TES is 15.4 million barrels of oil or 3.9 million tons of coal per year. For the electric arc furnace application the maximum national conservation potential with TES is 4.5 million barrels of oil or 1.1 million tons of coal per year. Present time of day utility rates are near the breakeven point required for the TES system.

Hydrogen is not a primary energy source, however, since its production is dependent upon other energy sources (thermal, electrical, and radiant). To be practicable as a fuel, hydrogen must be produced in bulk quantities with a standardized purity that will satisfy consumer specifications. In addition, improved distribution systems must make hydrogen widely available to military, industrial, and domestic consumers if the successful evolution of a hydrogen economy is to occur. The greatest potential military impact of hydrogen lies in its use as an aviation fuel. Because of its high specific energy (124 kJ/kg--2.7 times greater than conventional aviation fuels), hydrogen has potential use as a fuel for subsonic transports, supersonic aircraft, and helicopters; however, safety measures, logistics, and storage and handling systems must be developed and standardized before this capability can be achieved. Initial experimental use of hydrogen in military aircraft may occur in the 1980s.

Concerning latent heat storage, both material and heat exchanger aspects are considered in detail. The example of a passively operating latent heat store employing a finned heat pipe heat exchanger is used to elaborate upon the heat transfer problems in the generally poorly conducting phase change heat storage materials.

The nickel-hydrogen battery supplied spacecraft power for one 30-day eclipse season during which two eclipse periods occurred daily, lasting no longer than one hour. Its unique cell reversal feature was successfully demonstrated several times when the battery was inadvertently discharged completely because the solar array lost track of the sun. The nickel-hydrogen battery also uses a novel concept in which temperature is used for charge control.

How much the overall power consumption of the system can be decreased by lowering the condensing temperature, by either increasing the external heat transfer at the condenser or by lowering the inlet temperature of the heat exchanging media, is investigated. The latter depends on the relative humidity of the air. The performance of air, water and evaporative-cooled condensers are evaluated as a function of relative humidity of the ambient air. It is shown that the evaporative condenser operates at the lowest condensing temperature and, therefore, the least power consumption of the total system is achieved. Wetting the condenser with water requires only 1% of the overall power consumption but reduces the consumption by 30% as compared with the air-cooled condenser. Precooling the air by a water spray before it enters an air-cooled condenser is of benefit only at relative humidities of 65% or less. At other state conditions of the air, a higher power consumption will result. Lowering the temperature of the surroundings lowers Prev and the second law efficiency must be properly defined so that, for cases of lowest power consumption, highest values of the efficiency will be obtained.

Despite the fact that base lines have been criticized previously, they have been widely used without adequate analysis of the implications involved. Calculations of efficiencies using data available in the literature for isolated muscle preparations revealed that baseline subtractions result in unreasonably high efficiencies. This suggests strongly that the base lines are invalid. To be valid, a base line must continue unchanged under all the conditions in which it is applied. Previously published data indicate clearly that exercise base lines change with increasing work rate and are therefore invalid. The use of base lines is further complicated by elastic energy storage in some types of exercise. Although exercise efficiencies using base line subtractions may be useful, they do not indicate muscle efficiency. Perhaps future studies of exercise metabolism should be directed less at refining base lines and more toward describing and quantifying the determinants of energy expenditure.",,"elasticity; energy expenditure; exercise; human cell; muscle contraction; normal human; work efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018890625

Predicted values of the centralÃ¢â&#130;¬Â&#144;axis percent depth dose and the offÃ¢â&#130;¬Â&#144;centralÃ¢â&#130;¬Â&#144;axis ratios are compared with the measured data for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 20, 35, 45, and 70 MVp xÃ¢â&#130;¬Â&#144;ray beams. For the centralÃ¢â&#130;¬Â&#144;axis percent depth dose, agreement is within 3% for fields of sizes between 5Ã&#131;â&#128;&#148;5 and 20Ã&#131;â&#128;&#148;20 cm2, and 5% for larger fields, for beams of MVp up to 20. For higher energy beams, comparison was made only for the 10Ã&#131;â&#128;&#148;10 cm2 fields and the discrepancies were within 3%. For the offÃ¢â&#130;¬Â&#144;centralÃ¢â&#130;¬Â&#144;axis ratios, agreement between the predicted and measured values is within 5% over the umbra region but worsens in the penumbra region and geometrical shadow.

At 35 degrees C, a frequency of 0.5 Hz and anoxia (""anoxia test"") reduced contractile activity was observed, lasting 6.6 +/- 1.55 hr. Under normoxic conditions at 0.5 Hz and 35 degrees C the contractile work per beat (cwb) amounts to 35% of the maximum reached at 1.5 Hz, according to the force-frequency relationship. The total contractile work per hr only comes up to 5% of the maximum reached at 4.0 Hz. The oxygen consumption at 0.5 Hz only exceeds the value of resting atria by 10%. A positive inotropic peak of short duration observed directly after acute anoxia can be antagonized by beta-receptor blockade. Then contractile activity decreases during the first half hr of anoxia to around 20%-30% of the initial value under oxygen. In the second phase, the reduced contractile activity recovers and is stabilized at a level between 50%-80% of the control value during the first and second hour of anoxia and then decreases slowly during the following hours. The recovery period of anoxic contractile activity coincides with the time-dependent increase of the lactic acid production rate which reaches a maximum after around 1 hr of anoxia. This can also explain why the rapid decrease of ATP (30%) and creatine phosphate (CP) (90%) during the first 20 min is stabilized at this reduced value during the 2 hr of anoxia studied. Related to the measured oxygen consumption during normoxia, the glucose consumption increases during anoxia in resting atria approximately 300% and, in beating atria, approximately 650%, representing an ATP production rate of approximately 20% and approximately 50%, respectively, related to aerobic conditions. G-strophanthin enhances anoxic contractile activity up to 200% of the aerobic initial control value and prolongs the anoxic tolerance from 6.6 +/- 1.55 to 21.2 +/- 3.3 hr without significant additional increase of glycolysis or a further decrease of energy-rich phosphates. Addition of adenine and ribose as precursors of the adenine nucleotide pool during the first and second hours of anoxia increases anoxic contractile activity and avoids loss of ATP, ADP, and CP, without enhancemnt of glycolysis. The importance of these findings for anoxic survival of cardiac tissue is discussed. This ""anoxia test"" can be used to check influence on: 1) force and duration of anoxic contractile activity as well as anoxic arrhythmias (anoxic energy consumption), 2) the rate of anaerobic glycolysis (anoxic energy production), and 3) the concentration of energy-rich phosphates (energy storage).",,"oxygen; strophanthin; animal; anoxia; article; biomechanics; drug effect; guinea pig; heart; heart contraction; heart muscle; metabolism; oxygen consumption; pathophysiology; physiology; stimulation; Animal; Anoxia; Biomechanics; Guinea Pigs; Heart; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardium; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Stimulation, Chemical; Strophanthins; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018884838

Purified chromatin and the complex of DNA with firmly bound proteins possess similar ability. The optimum pH of the reaction is 6.5‐7.0, 2 mM MgCl2 stimulates incorporation, the temperature optimum is 37‐40°C. Chloramphenicol depresses incorporation by 70%, puromycin by 40%, cycloheximide does not affect the chromatin activity. Incorporation does not depend on the presence of ATP or GTP, and is substantially inhibited by deoxyribonuclease but not by ribonuclease treatment of chromatin or of the nuclei. Specific activity of firmly bound chromatin non‐histone proteins is higher than that of labile bound ones; histones are not labelled. After pronase treatment of proteins radioactivity changes to an acid‐soluble state. The molecular weight of isolated labelled polypeptides is about 6000 as shown by gel filtration and the ánalysis of NH2‐terminal amino acids. Labelled polypeptides firmly bound to DNA consist of 7‐10 amino acids. Specific activity of proteins firmly bound to DNA increases linearly with the time of incubation of chromatin with [14C] protein hydrolysate, the activity curve of labile bound non‐histone proteins has a distinct sygmoid character. The polypeptide‐synthesizing activity of rat liver chromatin increases between 9 h and 21 h after partial hepatectomy. Irradiation with 800 rads 30 min before the operation prevents activation of amino acid incorporation. From nine amino acids studied alanine, methionine, lysine, tyrosine and arginine are not incorported in the system described. Glutamic acid is polymerized most effectively. Glutamine, asparagine and glycine are incorporated 7‐8 times less. The data are given indicating that the incorporation is not random when an amino acid mixture is present. Preincubation of chromatin with NAD+ but not with its analogues increases the polypeptide‐synthesizing activity of chromatin. The activation is prevented by thymidine and nicotinamide. Storage (18 h at 2‐4°C) brings about a complete loss of the polypeptide‐synthesizing activity of chromatin. The ability of ‘old’ chromatin to incorporate amino acids can be restored by preincubating it with NAD+. Storage of chromatin in the presence of 5 mM adenosine 3′, 5′‐monophosphate (cAMP) does not result in decrease of the polypeptide‐synthesizing activity. It is assumed that poly‐(ADP‐ribose) is the energy source for amino acid activation in the system described. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

The overall exercise efficiency was calculated during the oxygen deficit period and during steady-state exercise. MR was obtained by indirect calorimetry and Man by solving the heat balance equation: MR + Man - S = (R + C + E) + W, where radiative, convective, and evaporative heat losses (R + C + E) were measured by direct calorimetry, work output (W) by ergometry, and heat storage (S) by thermometry. (MR + Man) during the oxygen deficit period was found to be lower than MR during steady state. In the 1st min of exercise, mean mixed work efficiency (aerobic + anaerobic) was 33%, which was greater than aerobic efficiency (26.6%) during steady state. The mean anaerobic efficiency efficiency was 41%. This difference reflects the fact that the energy released by splitting of preformed high-energy bonds (i.e., creatine phosphate) is less than the energy released when high-energy bonds expended during mechanical work are continuously regenerated through oxidative phosphorylation. The reported measurements of overall energy metabolism in man provide means for estimating in vivo the coupling efficiency of physical work (i.e., 41%) as well as the efficiency with which energy released by substrate oxidations is recovered in the form of high-energy bonds (i.e., phosphorylation efficiency = 64%).",,"aerobic capacity; anaerobic capacity; exercise; human cell; normal human; oxygen consumption; oxygen debt; thermometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018861937

Even more variation occurs in porphyrin structure, with many side group modifications and a limited number of central metal ion substitutions. Despite these variations in structure and function, the evidence suggests that porphyrin biosynthesis is essentially similar in all biological systems. While there is a possible difference in the synthesis of the porphyrin precursor 5-amino levulinic acid in plants from animals and bacteria, the subsequent steps in the formation of protoporphyrin IX are similar in all organisms. The similarity is sufficiently great to support the contention that porphyrins have arisen in the course of evolution from a common origin. The variation in function between the 2 great families, the haems and the chlorophylls, is perhaps the result of the adaptability of the porphyrin structure to changing biochemical requirements.",,"chlorophyll; heme; heredity; review; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018856757

This inhibition was followed by a marked stimulation of 5‐HT efflux. The later phenomenon was reversible when 2,4‐dinitrophenol was used but appeared irreversible with antimycin A or N‐ethylmalemide.

Eleven patients were investigated before and 4 days after total hip replacement. The postoperative results were compared with those seen in major trauma and sepsis. High-energy phosphates were not significantly changed in muscle after total hip replacement or moderate injury; muscle lactate and pyruvate increased. Increased degrees of hypermetabolism such as severe trauma and sepsis were associated with reduction of muscle ATP and PC; AMP, free CR, lactate, and pyruvate rose. Simultaneously determined levels of high-energy phosphates in red blood cells did not reflect muscle changes, confirming the need for continued direct tissue measurements. Alterations in the ATP—ADP—AMP system in the muscle cell suggest a low-energy charge following severe trauma especially if accompanied by sepsis. This would indicate a decreased capacity for biosynthetic reactions and production of storage compounds.

The need to continue the use of the second law in the design of future cryogenic systems is discussed. Techniques of applying the second law to systems analysis developed in the cryogenic field are reviewed. The second law of thermodynamics has been more extensively applied in the cryogenic field than in other engineering areas, primarily due to the low Carnot efficiencies involved with cryogenic temperature systems. Early applications of second law analysis resulted in using staged or cascaded systems and work recovery devices to reduce the power requirements for air and helium liquefaction systems. More recent second law studies, based on minimization of irreversible entropy production and exergy losses, are providing a greater insight into the influence of irreversible losses on the power expended to achieve cryogenic temperature refrigeration. These studies show the significant penalty in power attributed to irreversible system losses, and also indicate some design and operational procedures that can minimize this power penalty. Some future energy systems, such as magnetohydrodynamic power, super conducting magnet energy storage, fusion power, magnetic levitated transportation, LNG, and liquid hydrogen storage and transportation involve cryogenic technology. These systems will benefit from consideration of the second law in their design and performance analysis. © 1980, All rights reserved.",,"THERMODYNAMICS - Theory; ENTROPY GENERATION; EXERGY; SECOND-LAW ANALYSIS; CRYOGENICS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018506334

Consistent acceleration was obtained by increasing temperature, whether by storage or dissipation, the activation energies for thermal ageing of various resistor families lying in the range 0.5 eV-1.5 eV. Acceleration by humidity (RH) was also obtained, corresponding, for example, to a halving of life for a 20% increase of RH, some resistance changes being about an order of magnitude larger than those obtained at elevated temperature. The encapsulations played a dominant role in the degradation of resistors under both stress conditions. According to the theories of conduction, degradation could occur because of reactions at conductive sites, causing corresponding changes in the conductivity and resistance versus temperature (R(T)) characteristics. Progressive degradation certainly did occur, as evidenced by the conformity of the ageing behaviour to a diffusiontype (time)1/2 dependence accompanied by shifts in the R(T) characteristics. Some interpretation of the degradation has been possible by referring to an empirical model of the temperature dependence of resistance, but conflicting changes can be reconciled with the model only by postulating competing degradation mechanisms.

Component development has given rise to the construction and testing of prototype modules of the collectors and to a pilot storage and turbine installation. The test results compare favourably with the theoretical performance: the thermal flux at the ends of the collector is equal to 40 - 50% of the incident solar flux at an operating temperature of 200 °C; the mechanical energy produced by the turbogenerator is greater than 20% of the thermal energy supplied to the heat engine. Two direct spin-offs of this project appear promising: the collector and storage system together form a medium-temperature (100 - 250 °C) heat generator which should find applications in the production of industrial heat, for example for food-processing plants; the heat engine can be employed not only with solar heat but also with heat recovered in factories having excess heat at 100 - 250 °C. © 1980.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012558225

Sucrose is a disaccharide that is most widespread amongst higher plants; its concentration varies from species to species. The metabolism of this disaccharide is well documented. Sucrose is formed as a major product of photosynthesis in higher plants and is generally the main form of translocate from leaves to other organs. It is a major carbohydrate-storage material that provides a ready source of D-glucose and D-fructose for the liberation of energy. Sucrose is also an important precursor for the synthesis of D-glucosyl esters of nucleoside diphosphates, and thus it takes part in the biosynthesis of complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. Combination of D-galactose with the D-glucosyl or D-fructosyl group of the sucrose molecule gives rise to a number of oligosaccharides; these are, generally, α-D-galactosides. The chapter discusses in detail about α- D-galactosides of sucrose. It also describes the α- D-galactosides of polyols and presents an overview of α- D-galactopyranosyl-specific lectins. © 1980, Academic Press Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009048848

This effect was also obtained in cases in which C02‐assimilation was not improved by K+. Experiments with Ricinus communis provided evidence that K+ favoured the flux rate of phloem sap without diluting its content in organic and inorganic solutes. This all over effect results in higher flux rates of all phloem solutes. In this respect the long distance transport of sucrose, amino acids and Mg2+ is of particular interest. The long distance transport of these compounds was shown to be favoured by K+. Potassium is known to activate starch and protein synthezising enzymes involved in the metabolism of storage tissue. There is evidence, that also in cases of a suboptimum K+ supply, the K+ level in the storage tissue probably is still high enough to provide an optimum activation of the K+ requiring enzymes. For this reason it is unlikely that the favourable effect of K+ on phloem transport is related to processes in the physiological sink. It is more likely that K+ favours the phloem loading process. Indirectly K+ could promote the phloem loading process by improving the provision of energy (ATP). It is, however, also feasible that K+ acts more directly by being involved in the ATPase reaction which is supposed to drive the sucrose uptake of sieve tubes. © 1980 Deutsche Botanische Gesellschaft/German Botanical Society","K+; phloem transport; Ricinus; storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003687784

The experiments were performed at the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings with the Split Field Magnet detector using proton and deuteron colliding beams. The general properties of the dissociating vertex in single and double diffractive reactions are essentially identical. Mass spectra and decay angular distributions are compared with the predictions of a dual resonant Deck model. Decay angular correlations and a strong slope-mass correlation are observed also in double diffraction. Detailed tests of factorization indicate its validity over the full range of all kinematical variables and in their correlations. A model-independent analysis gives strong support to the peripheral nature of diffraction dissociation, with double diffraction being concentrated in a narrow gaussian ring at the edge of the proton. Both the exclusive and the inclusive double diffractive cross sections display a marked increase over the ISR energy range. Both mechanisms yield comparable contributions to the peripheral increase of the total pp cross section, with an approximate saturation of the Pumplin bound. © 1980, All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003248767

The vibrational energy distribution in NO A 2∑+ υ = 0,1,2 can be explained by a statistical energy partition between CH3O and NO products provided some restrictions on the activated modes of the CH3O fragment. NO A 2∑+ υ′ = 3 population shows an anomalous behavior which can be indicative of a half-collision effect due to the interaction of NO C 2H and D 2∑+ primary product with CH3O. © 1980 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000820690

In this letter we use these values to determine heights‐integrated Pedersen conductivities in the resonance regions, the quality factors of the resonances, Joule heating in the ionosphere by the pulsations and magnetospheric energy storage in the resonant waves. We have found that the energy stored in a large pulsation is approximately 1% of the energy stored in the ring current. Moreover, the energy dissipated in the ionosphere by such an event can be an appreciable percentage of the equivalent dissipation by a small substorm. Assuming that the pulsation is produced by the Kelvin‐Helmholtz instability on the magnetopause or by a similar solar‐wind driven mechanism, one has a situation in which energy is transported directly from the solar wind to the ionosphere via the medium of a resonant hydromagnetic wave. Lastly, field‐aligned currents associated with this wave may be sufficient to excite topside current instabilities. Hence, we predict that poleward moving bands of auroral precipitation should be observed in association with strong pulsation events.

The extent of radiation enhancement in catalytic activity was inversely related to temperature. The activation energy for the formation of CH4 from 2% CO2 in H2 was reduced in the presence of radiation from 13.8 to 7.7 kcal mole−1 for Ru/alumina and from 7.3 to 4.2 kcal mole−1 for Ru/molecular sieve. The results indicate that γ-irradiation gives rise to energy storage in support materials. It is suggested that the energy released on thermal stimulation weakens the metal-CO2 bonds resulting in an accelerated rate of reduction of CO2 to active carbon and its subsequent methanation. © 1980, All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000477450

Dry body weight increases were best described by second and third order polynomial equations, with maximum values occurring in late autumn. Data on body caloric and lipid contents indicated a period of rapid storage in late summer and early autumn. Declines in average dry body weight, body calories, and body lipids occurred during the winter months. The intensity of the fattening process was greater in age-I fish than in ages 0 and II fish. The highest values of body lipids (30% of dry weight) and calories (6, 909 cal/g ash-free dry weight) were observed in age-I fish on 16 November and 20 November 1973, respectively. Lipid reserves were mobilized during over-wintering and, in age-II fish, during the reproductive cycle. Energy reserves may also be utilized for body maintenance and growth when reductions occur in the availability or quality of the food supply. © by the American Fisheries Society, 1980.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000456190

One such method is to cool the grain bulk by refrigerated aeration to temperatures lethal to the common grain insects over normal storage periods. To be economic, the storage has to be thermally insulated and the cooled air recirculated. The design and application of a system to a 1700 tonne steel cell in north-western Victoria is described. Wheat of 8.8% m.c. was cooled from an average temperature of 34°C to less than 10°C in 7 weeks and held there for a further 7 months. The average energy consumption was 2.7 kWhr per tonne per month of storage. © 1980.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000221916
