Bugnon 7, C., Switzerland","Today, there are still uncertainties about the role of exogenous fat on body fat regulation. Early models of energy utilization (for example, Kleiber's, early 20th century) failed to take into account the nature of substrate oxidized in the control of food intake, whereas more recent models (e.g., Flatt's model, end of 20th century) did. Excess body fat storage is ultimately a problem of chronic positive energy balance mediated by a poor control of energy intake or/and a blunted total energy expenditure. Excess fat storage can stem from exogenous fat and to a more limited extent by nonfat substrates precursors transformed into body fat, mostly from carbohydrates, a process known as de novo lipogenesis. When considered over periods of weeks, months or years, total fat balance is closely related to energy balance. Over periods of days, the net change in fat balance is quantitatively limited as compared to the size of endogenous fat storage. The issues discussed in this article primarily include the stimulation of de novo lipogenesis after acute or prolonged CHO overfeeding and whether de novo lipogenesis is a risk factor for obesity development. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This method combines the calcium co-reduction and the in situ dissolution of the by-product CaO into the molten salt. The binary alloy of 30 mol% Ti-70 mol% V was chosen as an example. When V2O5 and TiO2 were used as the starting materials, the reduction and alloying occurred separately in part, because V2O5 was melted below the reaction temperature and the preferentially reduced metallic V droplets deposited on TiO2 powder, which hindered the reduction of TiO 2. The well-homogenized alloy could be obtained from the mechanical mixture of refractive V2O3 and TiO2. The molten CaCl2 was needed to dissolve CaO for complete reaction.

As a consequence, the simulation of the absorption and fluorescence of Rh and its retinal chromophore in solution allows for a nearly quantitative analysis of the factors determining the properties of the protein environment. More specifically, we demonstrate that the Rh environment is more similar to the ""gas phase"" than to the solution environment and that the so-called ""opsin shift"" originates from the inability of the solvent to effectively ""shield"" the chromophore from its counterion. The same strategy is used to investigate three transient structures involved in the photoisomerization of Rh under the assumption that the protein cavity does not change shape during the reaction. Accordingly, the analysis of the initially relaxed excited-state structure, the conical intersection driving the excited-state decay, and the primary isolable bathorhodopsin intermediate supports a mechanism where the photoisomerization coordinate involves a ""motion"" reminiscent of the so-called bicycle-pedal reaction coordinate. Most importantly, it is shown that the mechanism of the ≈30 kcal·mol-1 photon energy storage observed for Rh is not consistent with a model based exclusively on the change of the electrostatic interaction of the chromophore with the protein/counterion environment.","Molecular mechanics; Photoisomerization; Quantum mechanics; Retinal; Vision","bathorhodopsin; counterion; ion; rhodopsin; solvent; unclassified drug; analytical error; article; chromatophore; computational error; electricity; energy transfer; excited state relaxation; fluorescence; gas; isomerization; light absorption; molecular mechanics; multiconfigurational perturbation theory; photochemistry; photoisomerization; priority journal; protein structure; quantum chemistry; quantum mechanics; simulation; theory; Animals; Biophysics; Cattle; Databases; Light; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Photons; Protein Conformation; Proteins; Retinal Pigments; Retinaldehyde; Rhodopsin; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Spectrophotometry, Infrared; Vision",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144239039

Nine detectors for measuring erythemally weighted solar UV irradiance are distributed over Austria in order to cover the main populated areas as well as different levels of altitude. The detectors are calibrated to indicate the UV-Index, the internationally agreed unit for erythemally weighted solar UV irradiance. Calibration is carried out in the laboratory for determination of spectral sensitivity of each detector, and under the sun for absolute comparison with a well-calibrated, double-monochromator spectroradiometer. For the conversion from detector-weighted units to erythemally weighted units a lookup table is used, which is calculated using a radiative transfer model and which reflects the dependence of the conversion on the solar zenith angle and total ozone content of the atmosphere. The uncertainty of the calibration is about ±7%, dominated by the uncertainty of the calibration lamp for the spectroradiometer (±4%). The long-term stability of this type of detectors has been found to be not satisfactory. Therefore, routinely every year all detectors are completely recalibrated. Variations of the calibration factors up to ±10% are found. Thus, during routine operation, several measures take place for quality control. The measured data are compared to results of model calculations with a radiative transfer model, where clear sky and an aerosol-free atmosphere are assumed. At each site, the UV data are also compared with data from a co-located pyranometer measuring total solar irradiance. These two radiation quantities are well correlated, especially on clear days and when the ozone content is taken into account. If suspicious measurements are found for one detector in the network, a well-calibrated travelling reference detector of the same type is set up side-by-side, allowing the identification of relative differences of ∼3%. If necessary, a recalibration is carried out. As the main aim for the Austrian UV monitoring network is the information of the public about the actual levels of UVB irradiance, the measurement results are published on-line in the Internet (http://www.uibk.ac.at/projects /uv-index). For the previous day and backwards ∼2 years, the distribution of maximal UVB levels over Austria is shown on a regional map. Additionally, near real-time data of most of the measurement stations are presented with a delay of usually less than half-an-hour. Together with these actually measured data there is also shown the diurnal variation of the maximal expected value of the UV-Index under ideal dear conditions. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",,"ozone; article; Austria; calibration; confidence interval; controlled study; environmental monitoring; quality control; radiation detection; radiation dose distribution; radiation monitoring; solar radiation; spectral sensitivity; statistical analysis; statistical significance; ultraviolet B radiation; Algorithms; Austria; Calibration; Equipment Failure Analysis; Geographic Information Systems; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Models, Theoretical; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Quality Control; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Monitoring; Radiometry; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Solar Energy; Topography, Medical; Ultraviolet Rays; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444285387

Binding sites in these MOFs were deduced from inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopy of the rotational transitions of the adsorbed molecular hydrogen. In light of this discovery, it is important to have a fundamental understanding of hydrogen adsorption at different sites in this class of MOF materials. As a first step, here we study the case of H2 adsorbed on benzene as a model of the organic linkers in the microporous crystal. We access the density functional theory results by comparing with correlated ab initio methods, e.g., second-order Møller-Plesset and coupled cluster with noniterative triple excitations. Different approximations for the exchange-correlation potentials were accessed for a set of relevant properties (binding energy, energetically favored configuration, and distance between the adsorbents and adsorbates). In particular, theoretical rotational spectra of the adsorbed H2 were obtained that could be compared to the experimental INS spectra. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.",,"Adsorption; Benzene; Binding energy; Neutron scattering; Phase transitions; Probability density function; Spectroscopic analysis; Hydrogen storage; Inelastic neutron scattering (INS); Rotational transitions; Hydrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22944465089

The Rheology properties in turn are being used to describe emulsion structure, emulsifying effect and emulsion stability. The emulsifying property was also explored through interfacial tension measurement. The homologues series of glucopyranoside possess identical polar head group structure, whereas the alkyl chain length varied from C7 to C 10. The O/W emulsions were prepared by mixing 0.8 volume fractions of oil phase into a much smaller volume fraction of water phase; in this case 0.2 volume fractions of aqueous surfactant solution. Given energy input during emulsification and bulk surfactant concentration kept constant, the given oil to water mixing ratio would give high internal phase ratio concentrated O/W emulsions with dispersed phase volume fraction of ≈0.8, whereas the average size of the droplets was varied with the variation of both the alkyl length and the surfactant concentration. The average droplet size decreased with increasing both the length of the alkyl tail and the bulk concentration of the surfactant, so did interfacial free energy and cmc. As expected the Rheology properties of these emulsion samples depended strongly on average droplet size of the dispersed phase. The steady shear Rheology properties, such as shear viscosity, degree of shear thinning and σy enhanced with the decrease in average droplet size. This implies that not only the size of the emulsion droplets decreased with increasing both the length of the alkyl tail and bulk concentration of the surfactant, but also the emulsion and its storage stability were improved and enhanced with the increase in these two factors. Likewise, in the oscillatory shear mode the degree of viscoelasticity also depended on average droplet size. The fact that the G′≫G″, it is evident that the elastic property is dominant in these emulsions over viscous property. As expected the degree of elasticity enhanced with decreasing average droplet size of the dispersed phase. The G′(ω)≫G″(ω) at all measured ω, but the G′(ω2) function was found to be linear whereas the G″(ω) functions was independent, indicating that the oscillatory shear property of these emulsions can not be adequately described by Maxwell type viscoelastic model. Also, the fact that, δ of these emulsions was much smaller than 45° at all measured oscillatory ω, it is evident that elastic property of these emulsions dominated their viscous property. δ of these emulsions decreased strongly with decreasing droplet size, further implying that the degree of elasticity of these emulsions enhanced and improved with decreasing average droplets size. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

These emulsifiers possess same number of carbon in their alkyl tail (C12 in this case), but differ in their head group structure. The head group structure of these emulsifiers are maltose, sucrose, ethylene oxide and sulphate; providing a homologue series whose head group polarity and therewith HLB values differ significantly from each other. While aqueous emulsifier solutions of varying concentration were used as water phase, paraffin oil was used as oil phase. The oil to water mixing ratio used was 8:2. This naturally gave rise to high internal phase concentrated oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions with dispersed phase volume fractions of ≈0.8, in which the dispersed droplets are organized to give a densely packed polyhedron configuration as described by Princen. Such concentrated emulsions would exhibit interesting Rheology properties including shear-thinning behavior and viscoelastic effects. Given all other factors such as procession conditions (energy input through shearing and shearing time), volume fraction of the dispersed phase and viscosity of the continuous phase kept constant, the given mixing ratio would yield oil-in-water emulsions whose droplet size distribution and polydispersity index depended strongly on HLB value of the emulsifier used for their emulsification. The Rheology properties of such emulsions strongly depended on the average size distribution of the dispersed droplets that could be varied both with the bulk concentration and HLB value of the emulsifier. The interfacial and surface properties of these surfactants suggest that the droplet size distribution of the dispersed phase is strongly related to the HLB value and bulk concentration of the emulsifier used. Hence, it is evident that the Rheology properties of such emulsions vary strongly both with the HLB value and bulk concentration of the emulsifier. That is why the Rheology properties can be employed to describe both the emulsifying effect of the emulsifier and the storage stability of the resulting emulsion. As expected, the emulsifying effect of the emulsifier, the structure of the resulting emulsions and their storage stability depended strongly on HLB value of the emulsifier. As identified by yield stress, shear viscosity and storage modulus, both the degree of emulsification and storage stability enhanced with decreasing droplet size of the dispersed phase, and decreased with decreasing HLB value of the emulsifier used.

The as-prepared films were nonmagnetic. In order to transform the nanoparticle phase from chemically disordered face-centered-cubic to chemically ordered L 10, the films were annealed at 800°C under nitrogen atmosphere for 30 min. The annealed films showed different degrees of sintering depending on the organic coupling layer materials used. At room temperature, sintered films exhibited high coercivity up to 2.4× 104 Oe, while monodispersive films with insignificant sintering showed a low coercivity of 1.1× 102 Oe. Such results can be explained by a large atomic composition distribution among the nanoparticles together with the size effect on ordering. Improvement of the nanoparticle atomic composition homogeneity is essential for applying the nanoparticle films for future ultrahigh-density data storage applications. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.",,"Annealing; Coercive force; Electron beams; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Interferometers; Magnetic couplings; Magnetic field effects; Monolayers; Nanostructured materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); Atomic composition; Field-emission transmission; Nanoparticle films; Organic couplings; Magnetic films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20444446361

At the initial stage of plastic deformation the dependence of des/dwp on εP has a maximum. The present work is devoted to the experimental verification of a hypothesis that the maximum of des/dwp can be related to the internal micro-stresses caused by incompatible slip in grains of different orientation. The verification needed two groups of specimens in which the influence of internal micro-stresses on the energy storage rate is different. This requirement was achieved using specimens pre-strained in different directions.

It is shown that the chemisorption energy ΔE displays a nontrivial dependence on the nanotube radius R, oscillating jump-like with increasing R. We also found that the dependence ΔE on R for semiconducting SWCNTs is significantly different from that for metallic ones: an increase in R leads to a reduction in ΔE for the former and to an enhancement in ΔE for the latter. Such a sharply contrasting behaviour in the chemisorption energy trends is attributed to an additional contribution to ΔE arising from the occupied localized states, which occur in the band gap of semiconducting SWCNTs. The results obtained can provide deeper insight into the mechanism of single-atom chemisorption on SWCNTs and suggest a simple way to improve atomic hydrogen storage cells fabricated on SWCNTs by selecting preferably metallic ones with the smallest radius. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The average nanograin (crystallite) size of Mg2FeH6 is within the range of ∼2-6 nm as estimated by XRD. The highest yield of Mg2FeH 6, close to ∼34 wt.% as determined by XRD and DSC, is observed after 270 h of direct (no pre-milling) CRMA. The formation of MgO during CRMA is identified as the primary factor that greatly hinders the initial formation of Mg2FeH6. Pre-milling of elemental Mg-Fe mixture can accelerate formation of Mg2FeH6 but the pre-milling time has not yet been optimized in the present work. The persistent presence of unreacted Fe even after CRMA for as long as 370 h is observed in all powders synthesized in this work. DSC hydrogen desorption temperatures obtained in the present work are much lower than those reported by other researchers for the Mg-Fe-H system. These desorption temperatures (onset and peak) are close to or substantially lower than 300°C irrespective of whether the desorbing hydride is either β-MgH2 or Mg2FeH6 although it must be noted that the lowest DSC desorption peak temperature is associated with the hydrogen desorption from Mg2FeH6. Hydrogen desorption peak temperatures determined by thermally programmed desorption (TPD) are, on average, at least 50°C lower than those determined by DSC. Within the range of ∼ 1 to ∼ 10 nm nanograin (crystallite) size of β-MgH2 and Mg2FeH6 no systematic correlation is observed between the DSC and TPD desorption peak temperatures of both hydrides and their nanograin sizes. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

With the growing amount of genome sequence data, there is a demand for a flexible and easy-to-maintain structure for storing sequence data and results from bioinformatic analysis. More than 150 sequenced bacterial genomes are now available, and comparisons of properties for taxonomically similar organisms are not readily available to many biologists. In addition to the most basic information, such as AT content, chromosome length, tRNA count and rRNA count, a large number of more complex calculations are needed to perform detailed comparative genomics. DNA structural calculations like curvature and stacking energy, DNA compositions like base skews, oligo skews and repeats at the local and global level are just a few of the analysis that are presented on the CBS Genome Atlas Web page. Complex analysis, changing methods and frequent addition of new models are factors that require a dynamic database layout. Using basic tools like the GNU Make system, csh, Perl and MySQL, we have created a flexible database environment for storing and maintaining such results for a collection of complete microbial genomes.

The quality of the emulsions was evaluated using optical microscopy. Emulsions, prepared using INUTEC®SP1 alone had large droplets, but this could be significantly reduced by addition of a cosurfactant to the oil phase, namely Span 20. The stability of the emulsions was investigated in water, in 0.5, 1.0 and 2 mol dm-3 NaCl as well as 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2 mol dm-3 MgSO4. All emulsions containing NaCl did not show any strong flocculation or coalescence up to 50°C for almost 1 year storage. With MgSO4 they were stable up to 50°C and 1 mol dm-3. The stability of the emulsions against strong flocculation and coalescence could be attributed to the conformation of the polymeric surfactant at the O/W interface (multipoint attachment with several loops) and the strong hydration of the polyfructose chain in such high electrolyte concentrations. This was confirmed using cloud point measurements, which showed absence of any cloudiness up to 100°C and at NaCl concentrations reaching 4 mol dm-3 and MgSO4 reaching 1 mol dm-3. These high cloud points in electrolyte solutions could not be reached with polyethylene glycol. This clearly demonstrated the superiority of INUTEC®SP1 surfactant as an emulsion stabiliser when compared with surfactants based on polyethylene glycol. Viscoelastic measurements showed a gradual increase in the storage modulus G′ with storage time both at room temperature and 50°C. This was indicative of weak flocculation and absence of coalescence. The weak flocculation of the emulsions could be attributed to the presence of an energy minimum, Gmin, in the energy-distance curve. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This picture of genetically-determined metabolic alterations suggests the use of these lines as a nice tool for conducting comparative studies with human populations affected by high incidence of obesity and their sequelae, e.g. type 2 diabetes, arteriosclerosis, and cardiovascular diseases. The animal model offers, in fact, the advantages of low genetic variance, homogeneous feeding regime, and the absence of confounding factors typical of humans, such as smoking, alcohol drinking, etc. The similarity of pathological response to high caloric intakes between the two species supports the use of pig model for identifying genes and their variants associated with energy storage defects through the activation of both hormonal and biochemical pathways. To this purpose, the evaluation of animal welfare constitutes a nice opportunity to deepen the matter, through the evaluation of both ethical and physiological needs.","Animal welfare; Cardiovascular diseases; Diabetes; Genetic selection; Obesity; Oxidative stress; Pig","animal welfare; cardiovascular disease; gene expression; gene mutation; human; inbred strain; metabolic disorder; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; pig farming; review; swine; Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare; Animals; Animals, Inbred Strains; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Metabolic Diseases; Obesity; Swine Diseases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9444259813

Thereby, LPL acts as a metabolic gate-keeper for fatty acids partitioning between adipose tissue for storage and skeletal muscle primarily for energy use. Transgenic mice that markedly over-express LPL exclusively in muscle, show increases not only in LPL activity, but also in oxidative enzyme activities and in number of mitochondria, together with an impaired glucose tolerance. However, the role of LPL in intracellular nutrient pathways remains uncertain. To examine differences in muscle nutrient uptake and fatty acid oxidative pattern, transgenic rabbits harboring a DNA fragment of the human LPL gene (hLPL) and their wild-type littermates were compared for two muscles of different metabolic type, and for perirenal fat. Results: Analyses of skeletal muscles and adipose tissue showed the expression of the hLPL DNA fragment in tissues of the hLPL group only. Unexpectedly, the activity level of LPL in both tissues was similar in the two groups. Nevertheless, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation rate, measured ex vivo using [1-14C]oleate as substrate, was lower in hLPL rabbits than in wild-type rabbits for the two muscles under study. Both insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 and muscle fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) contents were higher in hLPL rabbits than in wild-type littermates for the pure oxidative semimembranosus proprius muscle, but differences between groups did not reach significance when considering the fasttwitch glycolytic longissimus muscle. Variations in both glucose uptake potential, intra-cytoplasmic binding of fatty acids, and lipid oxidation rate observed in hLPL rabbits compared with their wild-type littermates, were not followed by any modifications in tissue lipid content, body fat, and plasma levels in energy-yielding metabolites. Conclusions: Expression of intracellular binding proteins for both fatty acids and glucose, and their following oxidation rates in skeletal muscles of hLPL rabbits were not fully consistent with the physiology rules. The modifications observed in muscle metabolic properties might not be directly associated with any LPL-linked pathways, but resulted likely of transgene random insertion into rabbit organism close to any regulatory genes. Our findings enlighten the risks for undesirable phenotypic modifications in microinjected animals and difficulties of biotechnology in mammals larger than mice. © 2004 Gondret et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"DNA fragment; fatty acid; fatty acid binding protein; glucose transporter 4; lipoprotein lipase; adipose tissue; animal tissue; article; body fat; controlled study; enzyme metabolism; muscle metabolism; muscle mitochondrion; nonhuman; nutrient; nutrient uptake; oxidation; oxidation kinetics; rabbit; skeletal muscle; transgenic animal; Animalia; insertion sequences; Mammalia; Mus musculus; Oryctolagus cuniculus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12344299681

The defect sites on CNTs as adsorption sites of atomic hydrogen are prepared by oxidation pretreatment using a La catalyst. Pd catalysts are then deposited on CNT surfaces for dissociation of H2 into atomic hydrogen, which then spills over to the defect sites. In the best case, 1.0 wt% hydrogen is stored in the defective CNT with Pd particles at 1 atm and 573 K. The hydrogen desorption in temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments started at 700-900 K, which agreed with the annealing temperatures of CNTs prior to hydrogen storage. Also, the amount of hydrogen stored in CNTs decreased with increasing annealing temperature. These results are ascribed to the crystallization of the defective structure of CNT into graphitic structure. The activation energies of 46.6, 87.3, and 129.8 kJ/mol derived from the desorption peaks of hydrogen in the defective CNT with Pd particles vary from 46.6 to 129.8 kJ/mol, depending on the annealing temperatures at 523, 623, and 773 K, respectively. The difference in the activation energies is probably due to the energies required for the recrystallization of the defect sites into the graphite structure.",,"Annealing; Atmospheric pressure; Catalysis; Crystallization; Defects; Energy storage; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Oxidation; Raman spectroscopy; Temperature programmed desorption; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Atomic hydrogen storage; Mechanical milling; Metal catalysis; Physisorption; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10844295739

Young steers (initial liveweight 267 kg) were fed delac at 0, 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75% of liveweight. The steers had ad libitum access to oaten straw and were fed a protein supplement (cottonseed meal) at 1.33 kg/head once daily with the delac. Total intakes increased with increasing levels of delac. During the first half of the experiment, cattle offered delac had higher intakes than those not offered delac, but intake did not differ between delac supplemented groups. Furthermore, liveweight gain did not differ between groups. In the second half of the experiment, intake and liveweight gain increased with increasing level of delac in the diet. Intake of oaten straw over the whole experiment was greater with 0.25% delac than with no delac, but declined at higher levels of delac as animals substituted delac for straw in the diet. A storage study, conducted over 6 weeks, indicated a higher rate of microbial spoilage in delac with a lower solids content, however pH remained low. Calculations, based on the actual liveweight, liveweight gain and feed intake results, indicate that delac has a metabolisable energy content of about 11 MJ/kg DM. These results indicate that delac has potential as an energy supplement for cattle on low quality roughage diets and could be used on commercial farms if composition (especially solids content) is consistent and storage issues are addressed. Further investigations into the use of delac, in combination with low cost nitrogen supplements such as urea, are also recommended.","Feed conversion efficiency","bioenergetics; cattle; food intake; food quality; food supplementation; weight; Animalia; Bos taurus; Micropus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9344240415

We develop a rational procedure for deriving consistent macroscopic models which allow for the computation of nontrivial effective quantities without resolving the fine scales. The method involves the relaxation of variational incremental problems which are derived from an elastic and a plastic potential. We use Young measures to describe the microscopic distribution of the internal variables as well as the quasiconvexification of the elastic stored-energy density with respect to the deformation gradient. The resulting model provides a new rate-independent model in terms of the deformation and the Young measure. The approach is based on a derivative free, energetic formulation using one functional for elastic energy storage and one for the dissipation distance. The latter is derived from a dissipation potential defining the dissipation distance between internal states and hence the Wasserstein distance between Young measures. This approach is strongly linked to an associated time-incremental problem which is a minimization problem of the type used for several years now in the engineering literature. The update algorithm for the incremental problem is discussed in detail, and two simple examples are given. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, the direct thermodynamic formulation is based on the total energy balance extended to account for the contribution of microscopic processes (e.g., hardening) to the storage, flux and dissipation of energy in the material. Extension of standard invariance arguments as based on the Euclidean frame-indifference of the energy balance to this case yield in an analogous fashion the form of the evolution/field relations. In addition, exploitation of the dissipation principle for a class of general rate-dependent inelastic materials with microstructure yields in this extended setting reduced thermodynamic form for the constitutive relations and so for the balance/evolution field relations. The variational formulation of the model is based on the constitutive modeling of the residual dissipation-rate density via dissipation potential. Together with the free energy density and boundary conditions, this potential determines a rate functional from which and corresponding variational formulation of the model is obtained. In the last part of the work, the rate-based variational formulation of the model is extended to incremental form over a finite time-interval, resulting in a pseudo-hyperelastic form of the model.

Thermodynamic properties of seed water determine the reaction kinetics during seed deterioration. The relationship between seed deterioration and dependence of the thermodynamic properties of seed water namely water potential, water activity, differential enthalpy, entropy and free energy were examined in two different seed species (sensitive soya bean, tolerant wheat) differing in their sensitivity to storage under accelerated ageing conditions [high relative humidity (RH) ∼100% and high temperature: 45 and 35°C]. A comparison of seed deterioration based on germination percentage, seed leachate conductivity and the various thermodynamic properties of water indicated that evidently, seed germination decreased faster at 45°C than at 35°C. The thermodynamic properties showed a critical upper limit with tolerant species having higher values than the susceptible species. In general, the values of critical limits of the thermodynamic parameters decreased with increase in temperature. In both the crop seeds the differential enthalpy and entropy increased with increase in period of storage and became asymptotic as the seeds lost their viability. Loss of viability and increase in seed leachate conductivity indicate that the changes in thermodynamic properties of seed water reflect the seed deterioration during storage under accelerated ageing conditions. © 2004 Silsoe Research Institute.

In fact, hydrogen can operate as a storage and carrying medium of these primary sources. The design and operation of the system could change noticeably, depending on the type and availability of the primary source. In this paper, the results obtained considering a model of a stand-alone energy system supplied just with RES and composed by an electrolyzer, a hydrogen tank and a proton exchange membrane fuel cell are exposed. The energy systems have been designed in order to supply the electricity needs of a residential user in a mountain environment in Italy during a complete year. Three different sources have been considered: solar irradiance (transformed by an array of photovoltaic modules), hydraulic energy (transformed by a micro-hydro turbine in open-flume configuration) and wind speed (transformed by a small-size wind generator). It has been checked that, in that specific location, it is absolutely not convenient to use the wind source; the solar irradiance has a nearly constant availability during the year, and therefore the seasonal storage of the RES in form of hydrogen is the lowest; the availability of the micro-hydro source is less constant than in case of solar irradiance, requiring a higher hydrogen seasonal storage, but its advantage is linked to the higher efficiency of the turbine and the fact that the RES is directly sent to the user with high frequency (for these reasons it is the best plant option). © 2004 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Calcutta, 35 Ballygunge C., Calcutta, India","Metals can, when present in excess, or under wrong conditions, and in the wrong places, produce errors in the genetic information system. The present review is limited to three examples of heavy metal genotoxicants, namely arsenic (As), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) on plant systems. Exposure to lead is mainly through atmospheric pollutants, to mercury through soil and to arsenic through drinking water. Toxic metal ions enter cells by means of the same uptake processes as essential micronutrient metal ions. The amounts of metal absorbed by a plant depend on the concentrations and speciation of the metal in the soil solution, its movement successively from the bulk soils to the root surface, then into the root and finally into the shoot. Excessive concentrations of metals result in phytotoxicity through: (i) changes in the permeability of the cell membrane; (ii) reactions of sulphydryl (-SH) groups with cations; (iii) affinity for reacting with phosphate groups and active groups of ADP or ATP; and (iv) replacement of essential ions. Mercuric cations have a high affinity for sulphydryl groups and consequently can disturb almost any function where critical or non-protected proteins are involved. A mercury ion may bind to two sites of a protein molecule without deforming the chain, or it may bind two neighbouring chains together or a sufficiently high concentration of mercury may lead to protein precipitation. With organomercurials, the mercury atom still retains a free valency electron so that salts of such compounds form a monovalent ion. The effect of lead depends on the concentration, type of salts and plant species involved. Though effects are more pronounced at higher concentrations and durations, in some cases, lower concentrations might stimulate metabolic processes. The major processes affected are seed germination, seedling growth, photosynthesis, plant water status, mineral nutrition, and enzymatic activities. The phytotoxicity of arsenic is affected considerably by the chemical form in which it occurs in the soil and concentration of the metalloid. Due to its chemical similarity to phosphorus, arsenic participates in many cell reactions. Specific organo-arsenical compounds have been found in some organisms and arsenic has been reported to replace phosphorus in the phosphate groups of DNA. In view of the variety of reactions in plants that involve sulphydryl groups and phosphorus, arsenites and arsenates may interfere with physiological and biochemical processes which constitute growth in a number of ways. Mercury, lead and arsenic are effective mitotic poisons (turbagens) at particular concentrations, due to their known affinity for thiol groups and induce various types of spindle disturbances. The clastogenic effects are S-dependent. The availability of cations affect the number of aberrations produced quantitatively. Effects of metallic salts are related directly to the dosage and duration of exposure. Plants, following lower exposure, regain normalcy on being allowed to recover. Studies on genotoxicity of metals discussed in this review showed that genotoxic effects could be in part responsible for metal phytotoxicity, deserving further examination to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The most noticeable and consistent effect of mercurials was the induction of c-mitosis resulting in the formation polyploid and aneuploid cells, and c-tumours. Inorganic salts of lead induced numerous c-mitoses together with strong inhibition of root growth and lowering of mitotic activity. As(III) is a weak mutagen but potent comutagen. Genotoxic evaluation of chemical mixtures from soil containing arsenic as component by Tradescantia micronucleus assay showed clastogenic effects, but not related specifically to arsenic. Plants growing on metal-contaminated sites need to develop some degree of tolerance to metal toxicity in order to survive. Since all plants contain at least some metal in their tissues, they clearly are incapable of completely excluding potentially toxic elements, but simply of restricting their uptake and/or translocation. The mechanisms for metal tolerance proposed are: (a) metal sequestration by specially produced organic compounds; (b) compartmentalization in certain cell compartments; (c) metal ion efflux; (d) organic ligand exudation. Inside cells, proteins such as ferritins and metallothioneins, and phytochelatins, participate in excess metal storage and detoxification. When these systems are overloaded, oxidative stress defence mechanisms are activated. Bacterial plasmids encode resistance systems for toxic metal ions including mercury, lead and arsenic. Chromosomal determinants of toxic metal resistance are also known. For mercury and arsenic, the plasmid and chromosomal determinants are basically the same. The largest group of metal resistance systems functions by energy-dependent efflux of toxic ions. Mercury-resistant bacteria have genes for the enzymes mercuric ion reductase and organomercurial lyase, which are often plasmid-encoded, and more rarely by transposons and bacterial chromosome. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The thiol functional group-derived carbon ceramic electrode (CCE) was first constructed using (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxy silane as sol-gel monomer. Then, the stable nano-Au monolayer was obtained through covalent linkage between nano-Au and thiol group on the surface of CCE. The experimental results showed that nano-Au monolayer formed not only could steadily immobilize HRP but also efficiently retain its bioactivity. Hydrogen peroxide was detected with the aid of hydroquinone mediator to transfer electrons between the electrode and HRP. The process parameters for the fabrication of the enzyme electrode and various experimental variables such as the operating potential, mediator concentration and pH of background electrolyte were explored for optimum analytical performance of the enzyme electrode. The biosensor had a fast response of less than 8 s with linear range of 1.22×10 -5 to 1.10×10 -3mol l -1 and a detection limit of 6.1×10 -6mol l -1. The sensitivity of the sensor for H 2O 2 was 0.29 A l mol -1 cm -2. The activation energy for enzyme reaction was calculated to be 10.1 kJ mol -1.

The results indicate that finer, more globular semisolid microstructure was attained in more heavily deformed alloys after heat treatment at 560°C for 20 min. Furthermore, the liquid islands in the grains also become less with the increase in the compression ratio. It is mainly because the microstructural evolution mechanisms are different in alloys with various compression ratios. The heavy predeformation leads to the occurrence of the recrystallization, and the amount of recrystallization increases with the increase of the compression ratio. These recrystallization grains can easily give rise to the small initial grains that evolve towards a globular and small morphology rapidly during isothermal heat treatment at semisolid temperature of 560°C. Moreover, there are also no liquid islands in the final grains after evolution. In addition to the recrystallization evolution mechanism, there are two other microstructural evolution mechanisms - melting and combining of dendritic arms, which are both discussed in this paper. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The maximal apparent quantum yield (∼8%) is obtained at a W/Ti ratio of 0.5, and a film thickness ≥ 10 μm. The capacity is largest at W/Ti = 0.5, and increases with the film thickness.

The PPy film can be grown along one side of the PTFE walls and exhibits morphological anisotropy of the PPy packing density along the thickness direction. A piece bends in a regular direction (the surface in contact with the PTFE wall) and reverts during a redox cycle without the use of any additional processes such as lamination. The actuation properties of the anisotropic PPy actuator strongly depend on the size of the cation in the driving electrolyte, and the bending behavior of this actuator at room temperature becomes slower for larger cations. On investigating the temperature dependence of actuation properties, the arrival time of the actuator (the time required for the tip of the actuator to touch the electrolyte surface upon stepwise potential change) was found to become shorter in all electrolyte solutions with different electrolytes. This result can be understood in terms of the thermally activated microscopic movement of the PPy main chains. Such behavior based on electrochemical stimulus not only provides information related to ionic transfer and storage but also suggests that the anisotropic PPy film can be put to practical use as an electrochemical actuator for artificial muscle which directly converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Actuator; Anisotropy; Conducting polymer; Electrochemomechanical deformation; Polypyrrole","Actuators; Anisotropy; Electrolytes; Heat conduction; Morphology; Muscle; Polymers; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Conducting polymers; Conformational changes; Electrochemomechanical deformation; Ionic transfer; Polypyrroles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7244252830

The influence of characteristics such as the degree of cross-linking (the gel content), glass transition temperature and degree of carboxylation of styrene-butadiene (SB) latex polymers on the mechanical properties and water vapour permeability of the corresponding polymer coating films at room temperature has been investigated. The storage modulus in the rubbery region increased markedly with increasing degree of cross-linking and the blocking (sticking tendency) towards adjacent paper substrates was in general somewhat lower at higher cross-link densities. There was also a tendency for the water vapour permeability to decrease somewhat with higher degrees of cross-linking. The degrees of carboxylation were quite low for the studied SB-dispersions and it had only a minor influence on the mechanical performance and barrier properties of the films. Reducing the glass transition temperature significantly below room temperature had a negative effect with regard to the blocking/sticking tendency of the polymer and on the water vapour permeability. On the other hand, a glass transition temperature significantly above room temperature resulted in a coating film with microcracks that caused a marked deterioration in the physical properties. These films were rather brittle with a low elongation at break. All the polymer films were also characterised using scanning electron microscopy, contact angle measurements and ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis). © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The accomplishment of these targets requires the increase in renewable energy production, namely from wind power generation. However, the intermittent nature of wind creates several problems to the power system operation and new approaches based on the combined use of wind power and energy storage technologies need to be developed. In this paper, the concept of the combined use of wind power production and hydro storage/production is exploited, through the development of an operational optimisation approach applied to a wind generator park with little water storage ability. The optimisation model defines the operational strategy to be followed for the hours ahead by a pump station and an hydraulic generator embedded in a wind/hydro pumping facility, using the Portuguese energy remuneration rules. The proposed methodology leads to considerable yearly profits for the wind generator production. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This process has the following advantages compared to the conventional drying process: the material structure is maintained, moisture is removed at low temperature (reduced transport rates), product stability during the storage is increased, the fast transition of the moisturized product to be dehydrated minimizes several degradation reactions. Freeze drying process has not been studied well enough. In order to put it to practice, a mathematical model based on fundamental mass and energy balance equations has been developed, based on a deterministic mathematical model proposed by Liapis and Sadikoglu [Drying Technol. 15 (3-4) (1997) 791], and used to calculate the amount of removed water and amount of residual water. The proposed model contains the freeze drying equations, which are solved by the orthogonal collocation and polynomial approximation - Jacobi method. The results show that the dynamic mathematical model represents well the process and is especially well suited for real time optimization. As a case study to illustrate the model utilization in a real time optimization procedure, the freeze drying process was optimized by the method of Successive Quadratic Programming (SQP) used for solution of non-linear equations, for skimmed milk and soluble coffee. The optimization procedure showed to be an important tool to improve the process performance since lower energy consumption and hence lower cost has been achieved to obtain the product with the same quality. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

During the storage process, a cold heat transfer liquid flows through the tank to crystallize the PCM inside the nodules. The stored energy is released when a hotter heat transfer liquid flows through the tank to induce the melting of the PCM. As the velocity in the tank is relatively small (a few mm·s-1), natural convection is expected on the coolant when the latent heat is released at the crystallization of the PCM. The present study concerns a single nodule surrounded by a flowing heat transfer liquid at a temperature TC lower than the melting temperature TF. This text presents an enthalpic modelling of the phase change inside the nodule coupled with a CFD simulation of the external flow to describe the mutual influence of the natural convection and the kinetics of crystallization. This study is afterwards extended to the case of two superposed nodules to investigate the influence of the crystallization of the lower nodule on the upper one. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Air pre heater using waste heat recovery system, cogeneration and concept of heat battery are successful techniques to improve the overall thermal efficiency of the system to a certain extent. However, there is still a large pot ential to store and utilise the exit stream energy by the efficient implementation of waste heat recovery system. The major technical constraint that prevents successful implementation of such a system is intermittent and time mismatched demand and availability of energy.

We use the Grid simulator OptorSim, and base our simulations on a world-wide Grid testbed for data intensive high energy physics experiments. Our results show that scheduling algorithms which take into account both the file access cost of jobs and the workload of computing resources are the most effective at optimising computing and storage resources as well as improving the job throughput.

According to the commonly accepted scenario, the imprint is related to the charge injection and charge accumulation in the nearby-electrode passive layer of the ferroelectric film. Recent studies demonstrated that the coercive voltage shift induced by the imprint exhibits a nonlinear time dependence in a logarithmic scale. This result was interpreted as the presence of two different imprint mechanisms characterized by different activation energies. In the present work, an analytical theory of the injection scenario of imprint is developed. The charge accumulation at the interface is shown to provoke a voltage offset and polarization loss which are nonlinearly dependent on the time in logarithmic scale. This result is obtained for different charge injection mechanisms including Schottky, Pool-Frenkel, and tunneling scenarios. Thus, it is shown that a single imprint mechanism can be responsible for a nolinear (in logarithmic scale) time dependence of the voltage offset and polarization loss. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the logarithmic rate of imprint is shown to be nonexponential. The developed model ties together the time and temperature dependences of imprint. For the experimental verification of the model a study of imprint has been performed on (111) Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 film capacitors with temperatures ranging from 25 to 150°C and exposure times up to 1000 h.

Because of the increase in the rates of trains and subways as well as the number of passengers, brakes have become increasingly a major safety component. In urban exploitation, these systems are subjected to multiple braking actions and have operational limits. A new concept based on a liquid-cooled system is suggested to decrease the energy storage in the disc. A numerical model of this new concept was realized and its performances were estimated by comparing temperature evolution at the friction interface with that obtained with the classical brake. The temperatures reached on a single stop with the cooled concept are higher than those of a classical brake. However, an important temperature decrease is observed at the end of braking so that, for successive brakings, the liquid-cooling principle causes an overall decrease in temperature. Moreover, the use of a material with a high thermal effusivity increases the part of the flow generated at the interface transmitted to the pad and thus reduces the surface temperature. © IMechE 2004.","Brake; Disc; Liquid cooling; Surface temperature","Cooling systems; Energy storage; Friction; Railroad transportation; Thermoanalysis; Disc; Friction interface; Liquid-cooled system; Railway brake; Surface temperature; Thermal effusivity; Brakes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27544502208

The assemblies were made of thre-type polymer FLangmuir-Blodgett films. The first layer contains phenanthrene chromophore, the second layer contains anthracene chromophore, and then the third layer having dinitrobenzne unit is assembled. The phenanthrene (Phen) layers play a role of energy donor of the anthracene (An) layers under light excitation (λex = 298 nm), and the dinitrobenzene layer quenches the exited state of anthracene by electron transfer reaction. As the result, weak fluorescence was observed from the nanosheet. However, when the photocycloaddition of the anthracene molecules proceeds by 368 nm irradition the efficiency of energy transfer from phenanthrene to anthracene decrease. As a result the phenanthrene fluorescence was recovered. The phenanthrene emission can be controlled in a tailor manner by 368 nm irradition. This tailor-made control can be applied to luminescence-based optical memory.

At 2-week intervals, activity, infectivity, energy reserves and survival were measured. There was no difference between the three isolates in infectivity, which increased significantly over the first 2 weeks and declined gradually thereafter. IJ became inactive during storage. Out of storage, the highest activity was recorded in week 0: nearly all IJ were active within the first minute of observation and remained active for the 20-min observation period. With increasing storage time, an increasing proportion of IJ were inactive in the first minute, reaching 83-96% by week 6. The time taken by 50% of the IJ to become active (AT50) initially increased with nematode age, reaching a maximum of 3-7 min in week 4 or 6 (depending on isolate) but subsequently declined to 2-4 min in week 10. By the time the IJ were becoming more readily activated in weeks 6-8, 75% of the lipid reserves had been depleted, and IJ had started to die.

Population abundance has declined during the last 30 years because of decreased marine growth rate, survival-rate, and production of multi-sea-winter fish. Mortality appears density-independent, indicating that the marine abundance is beneath the carrying capacity for the species. Correlations between the North Atlantic Oscillation winter index for the post-smolt year and production variables indicate that unfavourable climatic conditions are partly responsible for the decline. Low sea temperature may be the ultimate reason for the poor salmon production, whereas predation is one proximate mortality factor, which is probably both size and temperature dependent. Low growth rate during cold years was associated with low sea age at maturity and small salmon, contrary to the common observation that fast growth leads to young age at maturity. It is suggested that low water temperature may stimulate lipid storage relative to protein production and that the energy density needed to attain sexual maturity is lower in small than in large salmon. Future research should focus on the relationships between smolt age and (or) size and adult age and (or) size, and the association among water temperature, growth rate, growth efficiency, and age at sexual maturity. © 2004 NRC Canada.",,"abundance; climate conditions; growth rate; mortality; population decline; salmonid; Salmo salar",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18544388980

Between several of the sampling periods, changes in the distributions of specific energy were observed corresponding to removal of low-energy individuals. By using energetic modelling we demonstrated that metabolic processes or feeding could not be responsible for the shifts in the shape of the energy distributions and that negative-energy-dependent mortality was the most likely explanation for the observations. No changes in mean size of the fish or in the shape of the size distributions were observed between successive sampling periods, indicating that mortality was linked to levels of storage energy rather than to body size per se.

Sensory acceptability (measured by consumers), off-flavor (measured by a trained panel) and moisture content were linearly related to time. These correlations were used to estimate values at the shelf-life times calculated for 25 and 50% rejection probability. Survival analysis provided the following shelf-life estimation: 74 days at 20C and 33 days at 35C for a 25% of rejection, 87 days at 20C and 39 days at 35C for a 50% of rejection. An alfajor stored at 20C having an acceptability value below 4.9 (1-9 hedonic scale) and off-flavor intensity above 5.3 (0-10 scale) would be rejected by 25% of the consumers.

The two-component slurry is a useful medium combining two functions of both thermal energy storage and heat transportation. Increasing the convective heat-transfer coefficient would permit the use of a smaller volumetric flow rate and reduce pumping power. The primary parameters investigated are the volumetric concentrations and flow rates. The heat transportation, pumping power consumption, viscosity and pressure loss of the flowing slurries were measured in order to determine the most suitable concentration of MCPCM used in the slurry, over the range 5-40%. The effects of repeated use of liquid-solid phase-change particles upon melting and solidifying were studied using a small-scale rig of a closed-loop circuit. Results indicated that the use of a MCPCM slurry can improve the performance of a working fluid by up to 52% as compared with a single-phase fluid. However, increasing the concentration of the MCPCM up to 40% was found to have little effect on improving heat transportation. Slurry of the MCPCM which contained a high concentration of MCPCM had a high apparent viscosity. Use of an ionic surfactant was found to be effective in reducing the viscosity. Results also showed that 20 - 30% concentration was the most suitable concentration for the working fluid due to the associated heat capacity and reasonable pressure drop. The use of such slurry could reduce the power consumption of the pump by 16%. Stratification between the solid particles and a carrier fluid was a major drawback and made it difficult to use a conventional open system. A method to overcome this problem was investigated by combining an open and a closed system into a three-stage operation, open-close-open system.",,"Eicosane; Heat transfer fluid; Heat transportation; Microencapsulated phase change material (MCPCM); Microencapsulation; Pumping power consumption; Two component slurry; Closed loop control systems; Composition effects; Encapsulation; Flow control; Flow measurement; Heat transfer; Melting; Paraffin waxes; Phase composition; Pressure measurement; Solidification; Viscosity measurement; Slurries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15844369399

This type of rechargeable battery is not aged by frequent charging and discharging, and the battery efficiency increases when the charging/discharging period becomes shorter. Moreover, in practical applications a RFB has several advantages, such as operation at ambient temperature, short duration overload capability, small power loss during standby, a long service life, flexibility in layout and ease of power output capacity enhancement. These characteristics make the RFB most suitable for power quality improvement in autonomous power systems. In this paper we propose the application of an RFB for power quality improvement of an isolated wind diesel power system. Suitable control strategies, based on fuzzy logic are used to modulate the exchange of real and reactive powers between the RFB system and the ac bus of the wind diesel power system.

We also observed a sudden change in the size of the processed structure according to the irradiation pulse energy. From a linear theoretical estimation based on the diffraction of the laser beam, we found that the sudden change is primarily due to the diffraction pattern generated by the circular aperture of the objective lens.

The reproduction investment in bivalve molluscs has priority on somatic growth. Thus, genetic sterilization by triploidy induction enables the energy flux to be directed toward somatic growth and glucide storage. Bioaccumulation was examined for Ag (10 μg/L), Cd (10 μg/L), and Cu (30 μg/L) to determine if the response to metals follows similar patterns in diploid (2n) and triploid (3n) groups. The effect of ploidy was also evaluated as a function of dry weight of soft tissue and condition index. Moreover, the reciprocal influence of these metals on their incorporation was studied. The results showed that the major factor governing the degree of metal bioaccumulation by oysters is the nature of the metal introduced in the experimental medium. Thus, the uptake of Cd is proportionally more important than in the case of Ag and even more in Cu. For Cu-treated samples, the influence of ploidy on weight and metal body burden (and Cu concentration) was not significant, whereas for Ag and Cd, significant differences according to genetic type were evidenced by higher tissue weight and lower concentrations in triploid than diploid specimens.

The proposed procedure, called Friex (friction and explosion), is a new variant of the well-known friction-welding process. The feasibility of this new friction-welding process has been studied by means of small-scale experiments. The friction welding is a forge-welding process in which the heat necessary to make the weld is generated as a result of the friction forced between two surfaces rubbing together under pressure. The Friex welding process consists of four distinct phases. The new welding process also offers some interesting environmental advantages, as no welding fumes are emitted during the process.",,"Computer simulation; Energy storage; Environmental protection; Forging; Fume control; Laws and legislation; Pipelines; Standards; Steel pipe; Welds; Automatic-welding method; Environmental regulations; Process parameters; Friction welding",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12844252543

In particular, cortisol replacement if given in supra physiologic doses immediately before the evaluation of insulin sensitivity could influence insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was thus to evaluate the effect of morning cortisol replacement given prior to a euglycaemic clamp combined with infusion of [3-3H]glucose and indirect calorimetry on glucose and lipid metabolism. Methods: Ten GH/ACTH-deficient adults received, in a double-blind manner, either cortisol (A) or placebo (B) before the clamp whereas five GH-deficient-ACTH-sufficient adults participated in a control (C) clamp experiment. All subjects received GH replacement therapy. Results: Serum cortisol levels were significantly higher after cortisol than after placebo (324±156 vs 132±136mmol/l; P = 0.006) and similar to controls (177±104mmol/l). As a measure of the biological effect of cortisol, eosinophil leukocyte counts in peripheral blood decreased (164±91 × 109/l vs 216±94 × 109/l; P = 0.04). Cortisol replacement had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (11.8±1.8 vs 13.2±3.9 μmol/kg min), either on glucose oxidation or on glucose storage. There was also no significant effect of cortisol on fasting endogenous glucose production and no effect was seen on serum free fatty acid concentrations. Conclusion: Administration of cortisol in the morning before a clamp cannot explain the insulin resistance seen with GH replacement therapy. © 2004 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.",,"corticotropin; fatty acid; glucose; growth hormone; human growth hormone; hydrocortisone; insulin; lipid; placebo; adult; article; calorimetry; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; corticotropin deficiency; double blind procedure; eosinophil; fatty acid blood level; female; gluconeogenesis; glucose clamp technique; glucose metabolism; glucose oxidation; glucose transport; growth hormone deficiency; hormone substitution; human; hydrocortisone blood level; insulin resistance; leukocyte count; lipid metabolism; male; priority journal; Adrenocorticotropic Hormone; Adult; Blood Glucose; Calorimetry, Indirect; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Glucose Clamp Technique; Growth Hormone; Hormone Replacement Therapy; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Peroxidation; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Oxidation-Reduction; Pituitary Diseases; Proteins; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11844294015

Corn stover bales had an average initial moisture content of 56% (range of 49 to 66%) and an average dry matter (DM) density of 117 kg/m3 (range of 87 to 144 kg DM/m3). One layer of corn stover bales dried during 40 h with air at 40/C, without recirculation, followed by 12 h with air at 67/C, with 89% recirculation of exhaust air. Airflow direction was alternated every 8 h up to 40 h. The final average moisture content was 19%, with a range of 7 to 30%. Two layers of corn stover bales dried during 90 h with air at 61/C (89% recirculation continuously). The final average moisture content was 18% (range of 8 to 38%). After a one-week period for transport, storage, and handling, six selected bales sampled at 75 locations indicated some re-hydration (4% units in the one-layer batch; 1% unit in the two-layer batch). Drying increased moisture content variation within bales (average SD of 13.2% after drying; 4.3% prior to drying). Estimated energy cost for drying from 55 to 12% moisture content ranged between $56 and $98/t DM depending on the type of dryer and the source of energy. Reducing the energy cost below $10/t DM would require field drying corn stover below 20% moisture prior to baling.

One specific application is the bearing of a flywheel for energy storage. Such, a bearing naturally needs very low frictional losses to yield long energy storage. The approach that has been evaluated in this work is the possibility to apply a low friction coating on a loaded thrust bearing. The experimental setup consists of an axially loaded rotor pressed against a stator. Each test is divided into three different stages: acceleration, constant rotational velocity and deceleration. The two latter stages are used for estimating the friction coefficient of the flywheel bearing. During constant velocity it is assumed that only the friction momentum performs work resulting in a bearing temperature increase from which the friction coefficient is estimated. At about 5-10 MPa contact pressure, the temperature increase after a 20 s run at constant velocity is ranging from ∼12 °C for the ""worst"" coating down to ∼1 °C for the ""best"" coating. During deceleration the friction torque decreases the rotor velocity i.e. decreases the kinetic energy of the rotor. The deceleration yields a second possibility to estimate the friction coefficient. The deceleration time typically ranged from ∼5 s up to ∼25 s. The experiments gave a reproducible ranking of the tested coatings with respect to friction. Both constant velocity and deceleration gave an estimated ""dry"" friction coefficient in ambient air of ∼ 0.5 for the ""worst"" coating and ∼0.05 for the "" best"" coating. Thus, this method provides a good way for a comparative evaluation of low friction coatings in unlubricated thrust bearings.",,"Coatings; Kinetic energy; Stators; Flywheel bearings; Friction coatings; Friction coefficient; Friction; coating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11844257565

The ActiReg® has two pairs of position and motion sensors connected by cables to a battery-operated storage unit fixed to a waist belt. Each pair of sensors was attached by medical tape to the chest and to the front of the right thigh respectively. The collected data were transferred to a personal computer and processed by a dedicated program ActiCalc®. Calculation models for EE with and without HR are presented. The models were based on literature values for the energy costs of different activities and therefore require no calibration experiments. The ActiReg® system was validated against doubly labelled water (DLW) and indirect calorimetry. The DLW validation demonstrated that neither EE calculated from ActiReg® data alone (EEAR) nor from combined ActiReg® and HR data (EEAR-HR) were statistically different from DLW results. The EEAR procedure causes some underestimation of EE &gt; 11 MJ corresponding to a PA level &gt; 2.0. This underestimation is reduced by the EEAR-HR procedure. The objective recording of the time spent in different body positions and at different levels of PA may be useful in studies of PA in different groups and in studies of whether recommendations for PA are being met. The comparative ease of data collection and calculation should make ActiReg® a useful instrument to measure habitual PA level and EE. © The Authors 2004.","Activity pattern; Energy expenditure; Physical activity","adult; article; body movement; body position; calculation; calibration; calorimetry; computer program; controlled study; electric battery; energy cost; energy expenditure; equipment design; female; habit; heart rate; human; human experiment; information processing; intermethod comparison; male; mathematical model; measurement; medical instrumentation; medical literature; microcomputer; physical activity; reference value; sensor; thigh; thorax; time; validation process; Adult; Calorimetry, Indirect; Energy Metabolism; Equipment Design; Ergometry; Exercise Test; Exertion; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Movement; Posture; Software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144286560

Among them, neutrino oscillation experiments can probe 6 neutrino parameters: 2 mass squared differences, 3 mixing angles, and 1 CP phase. The experiments performed so far determined the magnitudes of the two mass squared differences, the sign of the smaller mass squared difference, the magnitudes of two of the three mixing angles, and the upper bound on the third mixing angle. The sign of the larger mass squared difference (the neutrino mass hierarchy pattern), the magnitude of the third mixing angle and the CP violating phase, and a two-fold ambiguity in the mixing angle that dictates the atmospheric neutrino oscillation should be determined by future oscillation experiments. In this talk, I introduce a few ideas of future long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments which make use of the super neutrino beams from J-PARC (Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex) in Tokai village. We examine the potential of HyperKamiokande (HK), the proposed 1 Mega-ton water Čerenkov detector, and then study the fate and possible detection of the off-axis beam from J-PARC in Korea, which is available free throughout the period of the T2K (Tokai-to-SuperKamiokande) and the possible T-to-HK projects. Although the CP violating phase can be measured accurately by studying νμ → νe and ν̄μ → ν̄e oscillations at HK, there appear multiple solution ambiguities which can be solved only by determining the neutrino mass hierarchy and the twofold ambiguity in the mixing angle. We show that very long baseline experiments with higher energy beams from J-PARC and a possible huge Water Čerenkov Calorimeter detector proposed in Beijing can resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy. If such a detector can be built in China, future experiments with a muon storage ring neutrino factory at J-PARC will be able to lift all the degeneracies in the three neutrino model parameters. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The rate/nucleation mechanism of MnO 2 deposition was significantly influenced by the introduction of MWCNTs in the plating baths. The specific capacitance of thick MnO 2-MWCNT composites, measured from cyclic voltammetry (CV) or chronopotentiometry (CP) in a potential window of 1.0 V, is monotonously decreased from ca. 160 to 80 F/g with increasing the oxide loading from 1.5 to 4.5 mg/cm2. The lower specific capacitance of thick MnO2 and MnO2-MWCNTs deposits is reasonably attributed to the relatively poorer utilization of electroactive species as well as the compact structure in comparison with a thin Mn oxide deposit (&lt;1 μm). The capacitive performance of these thick MnO2 deposits in 0.1 M Na 2SO4 is significantly improved by the application of electrochemical activation and the introduction of MWCNTs, revealing the promising improvement in the capacity of electrodes. © 2004 The Electrochemical Society.

The HNBR and the NBR were of very similar acrylonitrile content and Mooney viscosity. The melt miscibility and solid-state properties were investigated by rheological, thermal, and mechanical testing and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The dynamic viscosity of the blends followed the log-additivity rule, while the flow activation energy closely followed the inverse additivity rule. On the other hand, the storage modulus showed synergistic effects at all compositions, suggesting the presence of emulsion morphology at both ends of the composition range. For the 50/50 HNBR/NBR blend, the SEM micrographs suggest a uniform elongated structure. The thermal analysis showed the presence of two glass transitions, representing the pure components, at all blend ratios, suggesting the absence of segmental miscibility of the blends. The small-strain mechanical properties such as tensile modulus and yield stress followed linear additivity. However, HNBR and HNBR-rich blends were observed to strain harden at a rate higher than that of NBR. Induced crystallization of HNBR was suggested to be the reason for the strain hardening. The different rheological, thermal, and mechanical testing techniques agree in suggesting that the structurally similar HNBR and NBR are not thermodynamically miscible but mechanically compatible. © 2004 Society of Plastics Engineers.",,"Crystallization; Hydrogenation; Mechanical properties; Rubber; Scanning electron microscopy; Solubility; Viscosity; Acrylonitrile (ACN); Catalytic reactions; Hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubbers (HNBR); Nitrile butadiene rubbers (NBR); Polymer blends",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10844269814

Of the past studies conducted for Wolf Creek forest environments, precipitation and evapotranspiration rates are similar in magnitude between studies. The recent CRHM water balance was carried out for higher elevation alpine and subalpine environments and yields evapotranspiration rates lower than those in forest environments, due to lower energy levels.

Total body fat and total abdominal fat (TAF) at L1-L4 were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Regional abdominal fat, which consists of sc abdominal fat and visceral abdominal fat, was determined by single-slice computerized tomography of the abdomen at L4-L5 disc space level. Insulin sensitivity was determined by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and expressed as glucose infusion rate (GIR). With comparable body mass index, visceral abdominal fat was most strongly correlated with GIR after adjustment with percent total body fat in both healthy (r = -0.8155; P = 0.007) and glucose-intolerant women (r = -0.7597; P = 0.011), whereas TAF was most strongly correlated with GIR in both healthy (r = -0.8114; P = 0.008) and glucose-intolerant men (r = -0.6194; P = 0.101). By linear regression analysis, visceral abdominal fat accounted for 35.0% (β = -3.53 × 10 -2; P = 0.001) of GIR variance in women, whereas TAF accounted for 39.3% (β = -1.28 × 10-4; P &lt; 0.0001) of GIR variance in men.

Then, feedback linearization scheme and linear H∞ control theory are applied to design a novel SMES nonlinear robust controller in a one-machine infinite bus (OMIB) power system. In order to confirm such positive effects of the proposed control strategy, experiments are carried on a laboratory setup of SMES comparing that with a conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller.

The water solution column, in a cylindrical glass container, was placed in a thermostatic bath ranged 274.15-280.15 K and under atmospheric pressure. The experimental results show that, comparing to that of pure water and HCFC141b system, the properly placed metal rods combined with proper amount of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate- 6 considerably promotes the hydrate formation speed and reduces the nucleation time. The growth rate of HCFC141b hydrate is significantly effected by the surrounding bath temperature and the formation can be finished in 8 h with a short nucleation time when the bath temperature ranged 274.15-279.15 K and the iron rod penetrating the interface between the water solution and liquid HCFC141b.

The use of PCMs is suitable because of the small temperature difference between day indoors and night outdoors. An installation that allows testing the performance of PCMs in such systems was designed and constructed. The main influence parameters like ratio of energy/volume in the encapsulates, load/unload rate of the storage, and cost of the installation were determined, and experiments were performed following the design of experiments strategy. The statistical analysis showed that the effects with significant influence in the solidification process are the thickness of the encapsulation, the inlet temperature of the air, the air flow, and the interaction thickness × temperature. For the melting process the same holds, but the inlet air temperature had a higher influence than the thickness of the encapsulation. With the empirical model developed in this work, a real free-cooling system was designed and economically evaluated. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

The model consists of three interacting sub-models for the prediction of the transient behavior of the processes in the three units, namely, the cool room, the refrigeration system and the gas-handling unit. Several modules representing each of the components in these units were developed based on energy and mass balances. The modules were then arranged to form the sub-models, which were interconnected, in turn, into the global CA cool storage system model. The modules were implemented in an object-oriented computational environment, (EcosimPro) which can handle both continuous and discrete events. The model was validated using experimental data from a pilot plant CA cool storage facility. Model predictions of the most important discrete and continuous processes were found to agree to the experimental data with a maximum difference less than the observed spatial variability or at best with the accuracy level as set by the measurement instruments. As product respiration and quality models are incorporated, it is possible to use the model for optimization of plant performance with respect to the final quality of the stored product. Moreover, the handling of discrete/continuous events enables the implementation of practical operational procedures and to investigate their implication directly on the product quality and plant performance/design.

For both the (8,0) zigzag nanotube-wrapped and the (4,4) armchair nanotube-wrapped Al nanowire models, the nanowire with a monoatomic thickness is stabilized just on the center axis of the carbon nanotube due to a shortage of the tube radius. The microscopic image that electrons in the Al nanowire interact with the electrons in the nanotube on every side is obtained clearly in terms of the quantum energy densities. Band structures of the nanotube-wrapped Al nanowire models represent the conductivity along the wire, where bands originated from the Al atom raise and cross the Fermi level for each model. We have confirmed that reversible hydrogen storage processes are realized in our model.

The charge storage for the metal oxide electrode such as MnO 2 is concluded to involve a fast redox reaction through both potassium ion exchange, MnO2 + δ K+ + δ e - ⇔ MnO2-δ(OK)δ and proton exchange, MnO2 + δ H+ + δ e- ⇔ MnO2-δ(OH)δ dependent upon the availability of cations in the electrolyte.

In particular, wind turbine generators (WTGs) are attractive because of advantages such as absence of pollution, zero fuel cost, and abundant availability. However, the generated power and the bus voltage are always fluctuating, mainly depending on wind speed. Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) units are capable of controlling both the active and reactive power simultaneously and quickly. In this paper, control systems for simultaneous active/reactive power control and voltage control of series and parallel compensators using SMES is proposed.

The analyses utilised data obtained from three contrasting growing seasons (days 120-270 of 2000-2002). The measured latent heat above the canopy (LEe) accounted for the majority of forest net radiation (Rn) from June to mid-August (37.6-42.7%), while sensible heat (He) was the dominant consumer of net radiation (41.3-52.4%) at other times during the growing season. The seasonal sums of LEe were 362, 395 and 418 MJ m-2 for 2000-2002, respectively. The lower LEe in 2000 than in the other years resulted from the low rainfall and high vapour pressure deficit in July-August of that year. Canopy transpiration (LEc) accounted for 82-87% of LE e, and was generally coupled with seasonal patterns of daily mean temperature and net radiation, but was reduced by the low soil water content (&lt;0.25 m3 m-3) and a high vapour pressure deficit (&gt;1.1 kPa) during the summer. The modelled flux components at the forest floor were significant throughout the growing season, with daily-averaged rates ranging between 2 and 50 W m-2 for net radiation, 5 and 30 W m -2 for latent heat, and 5 and 40 W m-2 for sensible heat. The Bowen ratio (He/LEe) was within the range 0.5-3.0 for over 80% of the time during the season, and the ratio between the forest floor sensible and latent heat (Hs/LEs) varied from 1.2 to 4.5. Day-to-day variation in the ratio Hs/LEs was greatly controlled by the soil moisture in summer, but by the mean daily temperature in spring and autumn. Although the canopy heat storage and soil heat flux were important on diurnal and seasonal time scales, their seasonal integrations accounted for only a small portion of net radiation. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Eddy covariance; Pine forest; Resistance/energy model; Sap flow; Water and heat flux","coniferous forest; eddy covariance; energetics; heat flux; sap flow; seasonal variation; water; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444283469

To understand variations of this index, the effects of temperature and phytoplankton concentrations were examined on growth, gametogenesis, and immunocompetence of transplanted (M. trossulus, Gould 1850) and cultivated mussels (M. trossulus and M. edulis, Linnaeus 1758) in Eastern Quebec mussel farm sites. DGI was influenced by the gametogenic cycle and was decreased before spawning with the utilization of the lipids and glycogen reserves stocked in the digestive gland. DGI patterns from all sites showed variations linked to food supply that contributed to the storage of energy reserves. Protein concentrations showed an inverse relationship with DGI, suggesting that structural proteins were not used as an energy source during spawning. Indigenous mussels from the Magdalen Islands site showed a stable DGI, suggesting both the utilization of energy reserves for reproduction and storage of energy reserves due to the abundant food supply in the Magdalen Islands. Transplanted mussels showed a clear seasonal pattern of the condition index closely related to the gametogenic cycle. Differences in soft tissue and shell growths were observed suggesting a nonsynchronous growth. In all sites, phytoplankton cells <2 μm were more abundant than the larger-size classes, and concentrations seemed sufficient for mussel growth. Phagocytosis varied according to gametogenesis and decreased during spawning. Due to the high energetic cost of spawning, which mainly influenced DGI, a direct influence of environmental parameters could not be clearly detected. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

For people who do not like eating oily fish and who are concerned about the risk of CVD, a supplement providing 1g of n3 fatty acids (from fish oils) can be suggested.

The redox cycle of the reduction of Fe3O4 with hydrogen and the subsequent oxidation of iron metal with water vapor can be applied for the storage and supply of pure hydrogen. Addition of Rh to the iron oxide samples improved the reactivity for the redox at a low temperature. The addition of Rh to iron oxide samples decreased apparent activation energy for the oxidation of iron metal with water vapor. However, Rh species added to iron oxides promoted sintering of iron species during the redox. The addition of Mo cations to iron oxides containing Rh prevented the sintering of iron species during the redox. Therefore, iron oxides containing both Rh and Mo species could form hydrogen repeatedly through the redox. The local structures of Mo and Rh species added to the iron oxide samples were investigated by Mo and Rh K-edge XANES and EXAFS. Mo cations added to the iron oxide samples were always stabilized in the ferrites MoxFe3-xO4 during the repeated redox reactions.

A fundamental energetic analysis of membrane phosphorylation has been performed that highlights the merits of the new paradigm. Biological implications for energy transduction have been discussed in detail. The action of uncouplers and inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation has been explained by a fresh and completely different rationale. New experimental data that further supports the torsional mechanism has been presented, and the consistency of proposed mechanisms with the laws of thermodynamics has been assessed. A general kinetic analysis of oxygen exchange has been shown to reveal the absence of site-site cooperativity in F 1-ATPase. Details of the nanomechanics of coupling between F 1 and F 0 in ATP hydrolysis-driven proton pumping have been postulated. The original thinking and power of the theoretical approaches embodied in the torsional mechanism have been shown to prove invaluable to unravel the functioning of other biological machines through a new Molecular Systems Biology. The generality and universality of the principles in the theory have been illustrated by taking specific examples of other molecular motors such as myosin and kinesin, revealing the deep underlying unity in diverse energy transduction processes in biology.

This particle will couple directly with electric currents as well as magnetic fields, and its manipulation using electric currents is of particular interest with regard to the development of high-density magnetic memories. The DW mass sets the ultimate operation speed of these devices, but has yet to be determined experimentally. Here we report the direct observation of the dynamics of a single DW in a ferromagnetic nanowire, which demonstrates that such a topological particle has a very small but finite mass of 6.6 × 10 -23 kg. This measurement was realized by preparing a tunable DW potential in the nanowire, and detecting the resonance motion of the DW induced by an oscillating current. The resonance also allows low-current operation, which is crucial in device applications; a DW displacement of 10 μm was induced by a current density of 1010 A m-2.",,"Composite materials; Current density; Electric currents; Magnetic domains; Magnetic fields; Magnetic storage; Magnetization; Magnets; Nanostructured materials; Composite particles; Ferromagnetic nanowires; High-density magnetic memories; Resonance motion; Ferromagnetic materials; ferromagnetic material; nanoparticle; resonance; article; calculation; density; device; dynamics; electric current; electric potential; energy; magnet; magnetic domain wall; magnetism; mass; measurement; motion; oscillation; parameter; priority journal; technique; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9144255659

Allocation to these functions are constrained by trade-offs as increased investment to one function may happen at the expense of another. Moreover, because fecundity and survival probabilities are affected by both the state of an individual and by its surrounding environment, optimal allocation to reproduction and growth may vary with both individual size/age and with the habitat in which it lives. In this study we aim to describe how flower production varies with individual plant age and leaf production among different patches of the perennial herb Corydalis intermedia. We take advantage of the construction of the underground storage organ to estimate the age of individual plants which allows us tacitly to relate flower and leaf production to individual age and successional status of the patch. We sampled all individuals present in nine patches from the same forest and estimated their age, flower production and total leaf area. The age distributions showed that each patch was most often dominated by a few and consecutive age classes. In patches where individuals had the oldest mean age, very few or no juvenile age classes were found suggesting that recruitment had ceased. Based on the age distribution of the patches we propose that the dynamics may best be described as metapopulational with colonization of newly formed open forest gaps and a successionally determined extinction as the patch gradually becomes too shaded for recruitment. Both mean flower production, leaf area and age varied significantly among patches. Flower production increased with both increasing age and leaf area. We found no indication of a trade off between reproduction and vegetative growth since flower production showed a positive relation with leaf production even after removing the effect of age. Number of flowers produced by plants of the same age but growing in different patches did not vary indicating that the difference among patches mainly was due to a difference in age distribution. No individuals produced flowers before they reached an estimated age of three years. Production of flowers followed a power function with increasing age. Our data suggests that C. intermedia plants change their allocation strategy with age investing a relatively large amount of energy in flower production immediately after the immature growth phase when recruitment in their patch may be high. Production of flowers then reaches a plateau around the age of 11 years after which number of flowers produced stays constant.","Life-history traits; Metapopulations; Perennial plants; Resource allocation; Trade-off","flowering; leaf; life history trait; recruitment; resource allocation; trade-off; Corydalis; Corydalis intermedia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7244234344

Transport and metabolism of LCFA are believed to be regulated by membrane-associated proteins that bind and transport LCFA. Identifying the postulated fatty acid transporters is of considerable interest since altered fatty acid uptake has been implicated in disease such as insulin resistance and obesity. Recently, a family of membrane associated proteins, termed fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs), have been described that enhance uptake of LCFAs. Until today, six members of this family, designated FATP1-6, have been characterized.

Results of model simulation show that the model's level of representativeness is quite satisfactory.

Upon hydrogen loading at 298 K these films undergo a transition from a mirror-like metallic to a semiconducting transparent state. After exposure to a hydrogen pressure of 1 bar, the samples exhibit large variation in optical appearance, ranging from a pale yellowish (Mg rich side) to a brownish shade (Ni rich side). The change in the effective optical band gap Egeff as a function of sample composition and hydrogen concentration was determined; it showed changes from 3.6 eV in the Ni poor domain to 2.4 eV in the Ni rich domain. Composition analysis using the 15N nuclear resonance method showed close to homogeneous hydrogen distribution throughout the film and close to linear increase in the hydrogen uptake with increasing Mg content. The thermal stability of the films is limited; annealing above 393 K results in significant redistribution of the constituents. Mg is enriched at the surface, reacting with Pd and thereby degrading the capping layer through the formation of Mg&amp;Pd and MgO, as determined by x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Rutherford backscat-tering studies.

Then, a two-input two-output (TITO) STR is used for coordinated pitch and diesel governor controls. Finally a case study is made with a superconducting magnetic energy storage unit (SMES), introduced as a damping device. In this case, a three-input three-output STR controls the wind-diesel-SMES system in a co-ordinated manner. The design of the various control schemes ensures that the system performs well under both wind and load disturbances.","Adaptive control; Energy; Isolated autonomous power systems; Wind diesel","Damping; Diesel engines; Mathematical models; Superconducting magnets; Wind power; Wind turbines; Self-tuning regulator (STR); Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Two-input two-output (TITO); Standby power systems; adaptive control; control system; wind engineering; wind power; wind turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6444219975

It was found that the hexagonal structure of the prototype NdNi5 (CaCu5 type; space group P6/mmm) is preserved in all ternary alloys, but the unit cell parameters increase with increasing content of gallium. All alloys were exposed to hydrogen gas and the pressure composition desorption isotherms for the alloy-hydrogen systems were determined. The isotherms for the NdNi 5-hydrogen system exhibit two well-separated plateau regions, whereby the plateau region observed at higher pressure is drastically altered by small amounts of gallium. This results in a final merge of both plateaus so that the alloys with x≥0.1 exhibit only a single plateau pressure. The equilibrium pressure and the hydrogen capacity of all alloy-hydrogen systems decrease with increasing content of gallium. The thermodynamic parameters of hydride formation, i.e. the entropy change, the enthalpy and the Gibbs free energy of formation have also been derived from desorption isotherms. The relevant parameters for the NdNi5-xGax-hydrogen system are compared with the corresponding values for the related NdNi5-xSn x-hydrogen system and briefly discussed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

One to four H atoms per 32 B and 32 N are considered. The results show that H atoms prefer to adsorb on the top sites of adjacent B and N atoms to form an armchair chain along the tube axis. An even-odd oscillation behavior of the adsorption energy of H atoms on the tube is found, and the average adsorption energy of even H atoms is obviously bigger than that of odd H atoms. The results can be understood with the frontier orbital theory. Based on this adsorption behavior, several high-symmetric structures of H adsorbed boron nitride nanotubes with 50% and 100% coverages are studied.

The γ-irradiation of oats yields radical III and other radical species. Although all these species are stable at 77 K, some of them are very unstable at room temperature. A model based on three radical species (designated I, II and III) was used to describe the room temperature spectra of their decay at room and at high temperatures. Annealing studies at six different temperatures were used to determine the kinetic behaviour and activation energies of the radicals induced by radiation. A dose-response curve was also constructed and it was concluded that ground oat is potentially a good dosimetric material. The presence of an ESR signal after a storage time of 90 days was interpreted as providing an opportunity to distinguish irradiated from unirradiated oats.","Dosimetry; Irradiation; Kinetics; Oat; Radiation; Temperature","Dosimetric materials; Food treatment; Room temperature spectra; Dosimetry; Food processing; Gamma rays; Irradiation; Paramagnetic resonance; X rays; Free radicals; Avena; Avena sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9744221932

RESULTS: Examples of the role of the genotype as well as of the dietary macronutrient composition/intake and sedentary/low energy cost of physical activities in obesity prevalence are reported.

For the lossy compression of a very long VMI sequence, automatically maintaining the diagnosis features in reconstructed images is essential. The proposed wavelet-based adaptive vector quantizer incorporates a distortion-constrained codebook replenishment (DCCR) mechanism to meet a user-defined quality demand in peak signal-to-noise ratio. Combining a codebook updating strategy and the well-known set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) technique, the DCCR mechanism provides an excellent coding gain. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is superior to the pure SPIHT and the JPEG2000 algorithms in terms of coding performance. We also propose an iterative fast searching algorithm to find the desired signal quality along an energy-quality curve instead of a traditional rate-distortion curve. The algorithm performs the quality control quickly, smoothly, and reliably.","Adaptive vector quantization; Distortion-constrained codebook replenishment; Quality control; SPIHT; Volumetric medical image","Electrocardiography; Image quality; Image reconstruction; Quality control; Vector quantization; Adaptive vector quatization; Codebook replenishment; Volumetric medical images; Medical imaging; algorithm; article; clinical trial; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; head; health care quality; histology; human; information processing; medical record; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quality control; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; three dimensional imaging; validation study; Algorithms; Data Compression; Diagnostic Imaging; Head; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Quality Control; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9244264937

A total of 120 term newborns were prospectively enrolled and categorized into three groups: 40 were infants of nondiabetic mothers (group N), 42 were infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes on low energy dietary treatment (group D), and 38 were infants born to mothers with preexisting or severe gestational diabetes who required exogenous insulin for stabilization of blood sugar during pregnancy (group I). Plasma ghrelin and resistin were significantly lower in group 1 than in either group N or group D infants (P < 0.048). Plasma ghrelin and subscapular skinfold thickness were significantly higher in female than in male infants [plasma ghrelin: median (interquartile range), 3.8 (3.0-4.8) vs. 3.0 (2.4-4.0) ng/ml in females and males, respectively; P = 0.003; subscapular skinfold thickness: 4.9 (4.2-5.6) vs. 4.6 (3.9-5.2) mm; P = 0.03]. In group N, plasma ghrelin was significantly, but negatively, associated with birth weight (r = -0.31; P = 0.05) and body length (r = -0.33; P = 0.04), whereas in group I, plasma ghrelin was negatively correlated with plasma resistin (r = -0.37; P = 0.02). Plasma ghrelin and resistin are suppressed in infants of insulin-dependent diabetic mothers, suggesting that the metabolic hormonal system is probably operational in fetal and early postnatal life. A low circulating ghrelin concentration may be advantageous to these infants, because a reduction in appetite may prevent excessive weight gain postnatally and counterbalances the in utero anabolic effect of hyperinsulinism in poorly controlled diabetic mothers. The suppressive effect of insulin on resistin may partially explain the excess accumulation of adipose tissue in infants of diabetic mothers by reducing the inhibitory effect of resistin on adipogenesis. Female infants have significantly higher plasma ghrelin levels than male infants, suggesting that sexual dimorphism exists in utero. This study has also shown an association between some of the metabolic hormones in specific groups of infants and thus suggests that these hormones could have interacted in utero to regulate growth and fat storage during this critical period.",,"ghrelin; glucose; insulin; resistin; appetite; article; birth weight; body height; controlled study; female; glucose blood level; hormone blood level; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin treatment; lipid storage; low calory diet; major clinical study; male; maternal diabetes mellitus; metabolic disorder; newborn; prenatal development; priority journal; prospective study; sex difference; skinfold thickness; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Hormones, Ectopic; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Insulin; Leptin; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Peptide Hormones; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Diabetics; Resistin; Sex Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744288713

This method estimates simultaneously the motion induced by camera movement. The problem is formulated as a Bayesian motion-based partitioning problem in the spatiotemporal domain of the image sequence. An energy functional is derived from the Bayesian formulation. The Euler-Lagrange descent equations determine simultaneously an estimate of the image motion field induced by camera motion and an estimate of the spatiotemporal motion boundary surface. The Euler-Lagrange equation corresponding to the surface is expressed as a level-set partial differential equation for topology independence and numerically stable implementation. The method can be initialized simply and can track multiple objects with nonsimultaneous motions. Velocities on motion boundaries can be estimated from geometrical properties of the motion boundary.

To investigate whether changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function could be involved in the development of insulin resistance, we measured the oxidative capacity and energetic efficiency of subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar mitochondria isolated from the skeletal muscle of 60- and 180-day-old rats. Mitochondrial efficiency was tested by measuring the degree of thermodynamic coupling and optimal thermodynamic efficiency, as well as mitochondrial proton leak, which was determined in both the absence (basal) and the presence (fatty acid induced) of palmitate. Serum glucose, insulin, and HOMA index were also measured. The results show that in adult rats, concomitant with increased HOMA index, skeletal muscle mitochondria display higher respiratory capacity and energy efficiency. In fact, thermodynamic coupling and optimal thermodynamic efficiency significantly increased and fatty acid-induced proton leak was significantly lower in the skeletal muscle mitochondria from adult than in younger rats. A deleterious consequence of increased mitochondrial efficiency would be a reduced utilization of energy substrates, especially fatty acids, leading to intracellular triglyceride accumulation and lipotoxicity, thus contributing to the onset of skeletal muscle insulin resistance.",,"glucose; insulin; palmitic acid; triacylglycerol; adolescent; aging; animal tissue; article; energy metabolism; energy transfer; HOMA index; insulin resistance; lipid storage; lipotoxicity; male; measurement; mitochondrial respiration; muscle mitochondrion; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; proton leak; proton transport; rat; skeletal muscle; substrate utilization; thermodynamics; toxicity; Adult; Aged; Aging; Animals; Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Middle Aged; Mitochondria, Muscle; Models, Animal; Muscle, Skeletal; Myofibrils; NAD; Oxygen Consumption; Rats; Risk Factors; Sarcolemma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7044220612

The calculations of H2 locating on top of the hexagon center, middle of C-C bond and a C atom of these compounds using density functional and the second order Møller-Plesset perturbation theories indicate that the bindings of H2 with these compounds are very weak. However, the binding is significantly enhanced when lithium is introduced between the H2 and the aromatic carbon compound. In particular, the binding energy of H2 at Li adsorbed on top of the C13H9 is as large as 2.5 kcal mol-1, one order of magnitude enhanced. Such a stable H2 adsorption and the moderate adsorption energy facilitate good H2 storage. According to the similarity of surface features and chemical reactivities among the various aromatic carbon compounds and carbon nanotubes, we conjecture that the H2 storage in these materials would all be enhanced by introducing Li. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The concept of vertical partitioning has been applied to many research areas, especially databases and distributed systems, in order to improve the performance of query execution and system throughput. However, most previous approaches have focused their attention on generating an optimal partitioning without regard to the number of fragments finally generated, which is called best-fit vertical partitioning in this paper. On the other hand, there are some cases that a certain number of fragments are required to be generated by vertical partitioning, called n-way vertical partitioning in this paper. The n-way vertical partitioning problem has not fully investigated. In this paper, we propose an adaptable vertical partitioning method that can support both best-fit and n-way vertical partitioning.

Since the alloy bed absorbed hydrogen even at 873 K and generated heat, the alloy was considered a suitable material for heat pump or hydrogen storage at higher temperature. Experimental profiles of both hydrogen molar fraction at the bed outlet and temperature inside the bed agreed with analytical solutions to heat and mass transfer equations. The analytical solutions were obtained under the conditions where constant-pattern approximation could be applied to the temperature and concentration profiles propagating in a bed with the same velocity. Properties relating with heat transfer such as a heat capacity, enthalpy change of hydrogen absorption and a heat-transfer coefficient between a wall and particles were correlated to two dimensionless parameters, α and β. © 2004 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Piezoelectric transducers attached to or embedded in structures can convert the mechanical energy of the structure into electrical energy or, conversely, electrical energy into mechanical energy. Conventional methods have focused on how to effectively dissipate the transferred electrical energy. With our new energy-recycling method, the electrical energy is stored in the transducer functioning as a capacitor and is reused to suppress vibration of the structure, instead of simply being dissipated. This paper presents an advanced energy-recycling method to suppress multiple-mode vibration of beam structures with multiple transducers. Several control strategies based on active control theories are derived from formulae on the dynamics of a beam structure with piezoelectric transducers and electricity. We demonstrate the ability to suppress not only transient vibrations but also vibrations excited by sinusoidal and random forces. © 2004 The Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences.","Energy-Recycling; Piezoelectric; Semi-Active; Vibration Suppression","Capacitor storage; Embedded systems; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Piezoelectric transducers; Transients; Beam structures; Energy-recycling method; Multiple-mode vibration; Semi-active vibration suppression; Vibration control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645586031

Furthermore, the effect of both daily downward and daily upward temperature fluctuations has been studied. In the daily downward temperature fluctuation regime the temperatures of each reactor was reduced by 10°C for 10 h while in the daily upward fluctuation regime the temperature of each reactor was increased 10°C for 5 h. The results show that the methane production rate at 60°C is lower than that at 50°C at all experimental conditions of imposed HRT except when downward temperature fluctuations were applied at an HRT of 10 days. It also was found that the free ammonia concentration not only affects the acetate-utilising bacteria but also the hydrolysis and acidification process. The upward temperature fluctuation affects the maximum specific methanogenesis activity more severely as compared to imposed downward temperature fluctuations. The results clearly reveal the possibility of using available solar energy at daytime to heat up the reactor(s) without the need of heat storage during nights, especially at an operational temperature of 50°C and at a 20 days HRT, and without the jeopardising of the overheating. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The textural properties of the fresh and 24 h stored rice flour chapati were determined using a tensile deformation test. The extensibility and energy to rupture decreased whereas the peak force to rupture and tensile deformation modulus increased during storage. Different hydrocolloids like guar gum, xanthan, locust bean gum and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose were added to the rice flour at levels of 0.25% and 0.5% flour basis and it was observed that they improved the texture of chapati by keeping it more extensible during storage. Fungal α-amylase was also incorporated into the rice flour alone and in combination with the hydrocolloid and this resulted in further improvement in the texture. The retrogradation in the chapati after 24 h of storage was also studied using differential scanning calorimetry. Chapaties containing hydrocolloid and/or α-amylase showed lower retrogradation after storage. Rice flour chapaties can be made available to celiac disease patients and the undesirable textural changes, which take place in chapati as a result of starch retrogradation, can be delayed by the incorporation of hydrocolloids and α-amylase. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent findings: Physical activity is associated with enhanced health and reduced risk of all-cause mortality such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, cognitive disorders, and some forms of cancer. Nevertheless, the effects of exercise with respect to potential health consequences are complex. When untrained or previously sedentary persons undertake vigorous exertion suddenly, the undesired side effects of injuries, dehydration or cardiac arrest are amplified. Summary: It is reasonable to conclude that the risk exposure through physical activity is outweighed by its overall benefits, and health authorities strongly encourage participation in moderate intensity physical activity on a daily basis. In the future, the identification and characterization of particularly inactive subgroups of the population may facilitate and optimize the planning of public health interventions. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Cardiac arrest; Cardiovascular disease; Cognitive disorders; Dehydration; Diabetes; Disease; Exercise; Health; Injuries; Obesity; Osteoporosis; Oxidative stress; Physical activity; Risk; Sarcopenia","Alzheimer disease; anxiety disorder; blood storage; cardiovascular disease; cognitive defect; congenital heart malformation; dehydration; depression; energy cost; exercise; health; health hazard; heart arrest; heat stroke; human; hypertension; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; injury; ischemic heart disease; lifestyle; mean arterial pressure; mental disease; mortality; muscle atrophy; musculoskeletal disease; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; osteoporosis; oxidative stress; physical activity; prevalence; review; sitting; wellbeing; Chronic Disease; Exercise; Health Status; Humans; Risk Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14844293541

The consequences of standardized overfeeding on body weight have shown, however, considerable interindividual variability, which suggests that it also leads to adaptative changes in energy expenditure, in some individuals at least. The present review is mainly focused on the recent developments regarding the effects of overfeeding on energy expenditure. Recent findings: Individuals who gain the less body weight during overfeeding are those who experience a greater increase in total energy expenditure. This increase in energy expenditure has been attributed to stimulation of nonexercise physical activity. Recent developments regarding adaptative increases in physical activity are critically reviewed. Overfeeding also alters the pathways used for carbohydrate storage after a glucose load, by increasing de-novo lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue at the expense of glycogen storage. The sympathetic nervous system is a good candidate for energy expenditure increase during overfeeding. The increases in energy expenditure observed during acute stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system were however found to be unaltered by short-term overfeeding. Summary: The mechanisms by which some individuals protect themselves against body weight gain remain poorly understood. Nonvoluntary physical activity may allow one to increase energy expenditure during overfeeding, and may therefore constitute a regulatory factor in body weight control. The biological determinant of spontaneous, nonvoluntary physical activity, however, remains to be investigated. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","De-novo lipogenesis; Orexins; Physical activity; Thermogenesis; Thyroid hormones","carbohydrate metabolism; disorders of carbohydrate metabolism; disorders of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism; energy expenditure; fatty liver; genetic association; glucose tolerance test; glycogen metabolism; human; lipogenesis; metabolic disorder; neuroendocrine system; obesity; overnutrition; physical activity; review; sympathetic tone; weight gain; Adaptation, Physiological; Adipose Tissue; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Liver; Obesity; Sympathetic Nervous System",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14244260944

Glucose utilisation and storage in insulin target tissues in vivo and in vitro after a glucose load (3 g/kg b. wt.) administered intragastrically following overnight fasting was compared in adult male HHTg rats and Wistar normotriglyceridemic controls after short-term (2 wk) high-sucrose (70% calories as sucrose) feeding period. In comparison with normotriglyceridemic controls, in HHTg rats the glucose administration did not stimulate GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue that was associated with decreased glucose utilisation by these tissues in vitro. The acute glucose supply did not result in increased glycogen synthesis in the liver and fatty acid synthesis de novo in adipose tissue. On the contrary, the serum glucose, triglyceride and free fatty acid levels remained elevated. In conclusion, in the tissues of HHTg rats, despite the increased insulinemia, the processes leading toward increased glucose utilisation and processes transforming glucose into storage forms, such as triglycerides in adipose tissue and glycogen in skeletal muscle and liver, did not start within this time interval. The combination of the impaired glucose utilisation and the impaired glucose storage in energy reserves leads to higher glycaemia following glucose load in HHTg rats.","De novo fatty acid synthesis; GLUT4 translocation; Glycogen synthesis; Hereditary hypertriglyceridemic rats; Insulin resistance","carbon 14; carbon dioxide; fatty acid; glucose; glucose transporter 4; glycogen; glycogen synthase; insulin; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; enzyme assay; esterification; fatty acid synthesis; genetic disorder; glucose blood level; glucose utilization; glycogen synthesis; hereditary hypertriglyceridemia; hypertriglyceridemia; insulin resistance; lipogenesis; male; nonhuman; oral glucose tolerance test; pathophysiology; priority journal; rat; skeletal muscle; triacylglycerol blood level; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Blood Glucose; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Glycogen; Glycogen Synthase; Hypertriglyceridemia; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10844255771

It has also been shown that oscillating the air-fuel ratio around X = 1, which effectively oscillates the oxygen concentration, is a useful method of using this oxygen storage capability. This paper describes a detailed mathematical model for oxygen storage, which forms an important part of a complete kinetic model of a three-way automotive catalyst. This model consists of two interdependent submodels: one for the oxidation process and a second for the reduction process. In this study, O2 and NO were used as oxidizing agents and CO, C3H6 and C3H8 were used as reducing agents. The structure and equations of the model are presented and discussed in detail.

The energy storage in the SAW and the direct conversion from physical parameter to a parameter of the wave, such as frequency or phase, enables the construction of a passive sensor that can be interrogated wireless. This paper presents a temperature-measurement system based on passive wireless SAW sensors. The principle of SAW sensors and SAW sensor interrogation is discussed briefly. A new measurement device developed for analyzing the sensor signals is introduced. Compared to former interrogation units that detect resonance frequency of the SAW resonator by comparing amplitudes of sensor response signals related to different stimulating frequencies, the new equipment is able to measure the resonance frequency directly by calculating a Fourier transformation of the resonator response signal. Measurement results of an experimental setup and field tests are presented and discussed.",,"Fourier transforms; Natural frequencies; Parameter estimation; Resonators; Sensors; Signal processing; Electronic devices; Interrogation; Passive sensors; Sensor signals; Acoustic surface wave devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444223020

The dynamic voltage restorer (DVR), a custom power device, has been proposed to protect sensitive loads from the effects of voltage sags on the distribution feeder. One of the main factors which limits capabilities of a particular DVR in compensating long-duration voltage sags is the amount of stored energy within the restorer. This paper proposes a new concept of interline dynamic voltage restoration (IDVR) where two or more DVRs in different feeders are connected to a common dc link. While one of the DVRs compensates for a voltage sag, the other DVRs connected to a common dc Link replenish the dc-link energy storage. A current-mode control strategy is incorporated into the IDVR system in both working modes, voltage sag compensation and power flow control. The reference voltage for power flow control mode is derived from instantaneous active current calculated using the dc-link voltage error signal. Simulation results are presented for a simple system in order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IDVR system. © 2004 IEEE.","Current-mode control; Phase-angle advance; Series compensation; Voltage sag","Computer simulation; Control system analysis; Control system synthesis; Current limiting reactors; Electric current control; Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Voltage regulators; Current mode control; Distribution feeder; Interline dynamic voltage restorer; Phase angle advance; Series compensation; Voltage sag; Voltage control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10244279166

In this study, amorphous arsenic trisulfide (As 2S3) thin film samples whose thickness is 5 μm were prepared on silicon wafers by thermal evaporation, and their thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity were measured by photoacoustic spectroscopy and a 3ω method, respectively. These measurements were repeated after illumination by an Ar+ laser beam whose photon energy Eg is consistent with the energy band gap of As2S 3. The results show that the thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity increase by about 50% and 14-15%, respectively, by the photoinduced darkening, and this can be explained by the rearrangement of atoms and thermal expansion of the film.","Arsenic trisulfide; Photoacoustic method; Photodarkening; Thermal conductivity; Thermal diffusivity; Thin film; Three omega method","Arsenic compounds; Evaporation; Optical data storage; Optoelectronic devices; Photoacoustic spectroscopy; Photochromism; Photoresists; Thermal conductivity; Thermal diffusion; Arsenic trisulfide; Chalcogenides; Photoacoustic method; Three omega method; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10144253753

Both NDMA and NPYR in the fermented sausage were significantly reduced by irradiation. The vacuum packaging showed significantly lower (P < 0.05) N-nitrosamine levels than that of the aerobic ones. After storage, the contents of NDMA and NPYR in the irradiated sausage were lower than those of the non-irradiated control.

Fuel cell tests were performed using carbon supported Pt catalyst, and the effect of temperature, methanol concentration, methanol flow rate, air pressure and Pt loading were investigated. It was found that the cell performance improved drastically with a membrane assembly electrode (MEA) which did not include the gas diffusion layer on the anode, because of lower reactant mass transfer resistance. To give suitable cathode performance, humidification of the air and a subtle balance between the air pressure and water transport is required. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

As one of the most important ancillary services, spinning reserve must be provided effectively in the deregulated market environment. This paper focuses on the design of an integrated market for both electricity and spinning reserve service with particular emphasis on coordinated dispatch of bulk power and spinning reserve services. A new market dispatching mechanism has been developed to minimize the ISO's total payment while ensuring system security. Genetic algorithms are used in the finding of the global optimal solutions for this dispatching problem.

Isomerization is therefore suggested to occur without any molecular rearrangement of the glassy polymer matrix, which would also account for the lack of any shift to shorter wavelengths for the photoisomerization occurring in a glassy polymer in comparison to a chloroform solution. A decrease in the thermal isomerization rate at room temperature caused by the glassy polymer is explained in terms of a model in which only a fraction of the azobenzene is free to isomerize. The cis-azobenzene was found to be an efficient inhibitor of positronium formation, which enabled measurements of thermal isomerization rates and changes in the steady-state concentration of cis-azobenzene for an illuminated sample as a function of temperature.",,"Concentration (process); Isomerization; Lighting; Mathematical models; Optical data storage; Positrons; Reaction kinetics; Temperature measurement; Glassy polymer; Low-energy positron lifetime beam; Thermal isomerization; UV illumination; Copolymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7644222885

The granules in P. purpurea were much smaller (20-110 nm in diameter) than those in C. crispus (around 1 μm, but some larger than 2 μM). Larger granules (290-310 nm) were observed in P. purpurea. They were more uniformly electron-opaque, without the reticulated/globular appearance of typical polyphosphate granules.

The presented picture has evolved from calculations using the density functional theory, reactor measurements and vibrational spectroscopy of surface species during NO2 storage on a BaO/Al2O3 catalyst and BaO powder. The DFT calculations predict nitrite formation on the BaO(1 0 0) surface upon NO2 adsorption. A particular stable adsorption configuration is a nitrate-nitrite pair geometry, with the nitrate bonded to a barium cation and the nitrite involving a surface oxygen anion. This configuration is supported by vibrational spectroscopy. Only nitrite formation is observed for NO2 exposure to BaO powder at low temperatures, whereas signatures at ∼250°C reveal the formation of surface nitrates. Continuous NO2 adsorption at this temperature results in surface Ba(NO3)2, as well as bulk Ba(NO 3)2, formation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

One of these experiments uses the high luminosity of a cooled MeV proton beam in a He COLTRIMS apparatus (COLd supersonic He gas-jet Target for Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy) for measuring correlation effects in transfer ionization. Another class of experiments exploits the cold electron beam available in the CRYRING electron cooler and cooled heavy-ion beams for recombination experiments. A section concerns the still rather open question of the puzzling recombination enhancement over the radiative recombination theory. Dielectronic resonances at meV-eV energy are measured with a resolution in the order of 10 -3-10-2eV with highly charged ions stored at several hundreds of MeV kinetic energy in the ring. These resonances provide a serious challenge to theories for describing correlation, relativistic, QED effects, and isotope shifts in highly ionized ions.

The ordered state of circulating ion beams was observed at several storage rings: NAP-M (Proceedings of the Fourth All Union Conference on Charged Particle Accelerators, Vol. 2, Nauka, Moscow, 1975 (in Russian); Part. Accel. 7 (1976) 197; At. Energy 40 (1976) 49; Preprint CERN/PS/AA 79-41, Geneva, 1979) (Novosibirsk), ESR (Phys. Rev.

New criteria of the beam orderliness are derived and verified with a new program code. Molecular dynamics technique is inserted in BETACOOL program (Proceedings of Beam Cooling and Related Topics, Bad Honnef, Germany, 2001) and used for numerical simulation of crystalline beams. The sudden reduction of momentum spread in the ESR experiment is described with this code. The simulation shows a good agreement with the experimental results. The code has then been used to calculate characteristics of the ordered state of ion beams for the MUSES Ion Ring (IR) (MUSES Conceptual Design Report, RIKEN, Japan, 2001) in collider mode. A new strategy of the cooling process is proposed which permits to increase significantly the linear density of the ordered ion beam and thereby the luminosity of electron-ion colliding experiments. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Crystalline ion beams; Electron cooling","Binary codes; Computer simulation; Cooling; Molecular dynamics; Radioisotopes; Storage rings; Crystalline ion beams; Electron cooling; Linear density; Particle temperature; Ion beams",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644325809

Existing storage rings violate at least one of these conditions. The remarkable exception is the very low-energy ring PALLAS with 'radio frequency focusing', which apparently abides by the full set of conditions, and where 3D-ordering has indeed been realized. However 1D-ordering, - particles lining up in a 'string of non-overtaking links' - has been observed in several storage rings with electron cooling, even though the above conditions on the classical plasma parameter as well as on the lattice periodicity are largely violated. In this paper, we discuss conditions for 1D-ordering, including space-charge limits, instabilities and cooling requirements. We conclude that densities of some 104 ions/m may be possible; about 100 times more than those obtained in present experiments. Such dense strings are of practical interest for precision measurements of ion properties with single and with colliding beams. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

From the possible excitations of such Coulomb ordered chains, we derive criteria for the longitudinal and transverse temperatures and the maximum transverse amplitudes which guarantee their stability.

More recently antiprotons have been cooled in traps, first by electrons and then by positrons in order to produce antihydrogen atoms as simplest form of antimatter for CPT-tests. During these cooling processes the light particles are guided by strong external magnetic fields which imposes a challenge to the theoretical description. Within the binary collision model we treat the Coulomb interaction as second-order perturbation to the helix motion of the light particles and also by numerical simulations. In the complementary dielectric theory we calculate the polarization of the light particles by solving the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson equation as well as linear response. It turns out that the linearization becomes dubious at low ion velocities. In the presence of a strong magnetic field the numerically expensive solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equation is the method of choice, alternatively one may employ the binary collision model. Within this approach simulations must be employed for a repulsive interaction, e.g. antiproton-electron, or for highly charged ions. Drag forces F→ are given as functions of the ion velocity v→i and can be used as input for codes to calculate cooling times. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The interaction becomes dangerous when the frequency of the dipole oscillations for the circulating beam coincides with the coherent frequency of the ion cloud. The theory is applied to the planned antiproton storage ring HESR (High Energy Storage Ring), which is part of the GSI future project.

A separate accumulator ring RESR is provided for stochastic accumulation of antiprotons.

For experiments with antiprotons, a special 50Tm storage ring HESR shall be equipped with internal target and EC up to 15GeV, optionally also with stochastic beam halo cooling.

As a second phase of the project, MUSES was planned which is composed of an accumulator/cooler ring for RI beam and an electron-RI collider. The available luminosity of collider is dependent upon the production cross-section of RI beam through the projectile fragmentation process, cooling time of RI beams and the intensity limit of electron beam in the electron ring. We investigated the feasibility of experiments to determine the charge distribution in the unstable nuclei. On the other hand, internal target experiments at the accumulator ring will open new and precise physics with use of inverse kinematics. A new scheme of internal target experiments is conceived where a quite thick target is installed and high repetition of beam injection is used from the injector cyclotron.

Basically the difficulty stems from the fact that the optimized gain and the cooling rate are inversely proportional to the number of particles 'seen' by the cooling system. Therefore, to maintain fast stacking, the newly injected batch has to be strongly 'protected' from the Schottky noise of the stack. Vice versa the stack has to be efficiently 'shielded' against the high gain cooling system for the injected beam. In the antiproton accumulators with stacking ratios up to 105 the problem is solved by radial separation of the injection and the stack orbits in a region of large dispersion. An array of several tapered cooling systems with a matched gain profile provides a continuous particle flux towards the high-density stack core. Shielding of the different systems from each other is obtained both through the spatial separation and via the revolution frequencies (filters). In the 'old AA', where the antiproton collection and stacking was done in one single ring, the injected beam was further shielded during cooling by means of a movable shutter. The complexity of these systems is very high. For more modest stacking ratios, one might use azimuthal rather than radial separation of stack and injected beam. Schematically half of the circumference would be used to accept and cool new beam and the remainder to house the stack. Fast gating is then required between the high gain cooling of the injected beam and the low gain stack cooling. RF-gymnastics are used to merge the pre-cooled batch with the stack, to re-create free space for the next injection, and to capture the new batch. This scheme is less demanding for the storage ring lattice, but at the expense of some reduction in stacking rate. The talk reviews the 'radial' separation schemes and also gives some considerations to the 'azimuthal' schemes. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The soft solid is taken to represent mammalian skin and silicone rubbers, and is treated as an incompressible, hyperelastic, isotropic solid described by a one-term Ogden strain energy function. Penetration of the soft solid by a flat-bottomed punch is by the formation of a mode-II ring crack that propagates ahead of the penetrator tip. The sharp-tipped punch penetrates by the formation of a planar mode-I crack at the punch tip, followed by wedging open of the crack by the advancing punch. For both modes of punch advance the steady-state penetration load is calculated by equating the work done in advancing the punch to the sum of the fracture work and the strain energy stored in the solid. For the case of a sharp penetrator, this calculation is performed by considering the opening of a plane-strain crack by a wedge using a finite-element approach. Analytical methods suffice for the flat-bottomed punch. In both models the crack dimensions are such that the load on the punch is minimized. For both geometries of punch tip, the predicted penetration pressure increases with diminishing punch radius, and with increasing toughness and strain-hardening capacity of solid. The penetration pressure for a flat-bottomed punch is two to three times greater than that for a sharp-tipped punch (assuming that the mode-I and mode-II toughnesses are equal), in agreement with experimental observations reported in a companion paper. © 2004 The Royal Society.","Deep penetration; Finite-element method; Fracture mechanics; Injection; Soft solids","rubber; silicone; analytic method; animal tissue; article; calculation; controlled study; elasticity; energy; finite element analysis; geometry; human; human tissue; instrumentation; mammal; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; nonhuman; prediction; pressure; radius; skin injury; solid; storage; theoretical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17144364006

For this purpose solid-state nuclear track detector (SSNTD) stacks were used. Each stack consisted of three CR-39 sheets. The first and second sheets were separated by a Ti plate, and the second and third sheets sandwiched a Lexan polycarbonate foil. The neutron and proton responses of each sheet were studied through MC calculations and experimentally, utilising monoenergetic protons. Seven stacks were exposed in 2001 for 249 days at different locations of the Russian segment 'Zvezda'. The total storage time before and after the exposure onboard was estimated to be seven months. Another eight stacks were exposed at the CERF high-energy neutron field for calibration purposes. The CR-39 detectors were evaluated in four steps: after 2, 6, 12 and 20 h etching in 6 N NaOH at 70°C (VB = 1.30 μm h-1). All the individual tracks were investigated and recorded using an image analyser. The stacks provided the averaged neutron ambient dose equivalent (H*) between 200 keV and 20 MeV, and the values varied from 39 to 73 μSv d-1, depending on the location. The Lexan detectors were used to detect the dose originating from high-charge and high-energy (HZE) particles.

PET products present a problem of considerable concern due to the huge amount of solid waste produced. The disposal of this waste, together with its low bio- and photo-degradability represents a serious challenge for industrial countries all over the world. Pyrolysis could provide an alternative and economically viable route for processing PET waste due to the potential uses of different by-products: energy from the pyrolysis gases (58% yield in this work), recovery of terephthalic acid and other subproducts (20%), and a solid residue (22%), which has shown a high textural development after activation. The pyrolysis of PET waste was performed in a quartz reactor (i.d. 35mm) under an inert atmosphere. Further activation was carried out at a temperature of 925°C, with a flow rate of 10mlmin-1 of CO2. A series of carbon materials with different burn-off degrees was obtained. Textural characterisation of the samples was carried out by performing N2 adsorption isotherms at -196°C. Changes in the morphological and structural properties of chars were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The carbons obtained were isotropic and highly microporous materials with apparent BET surface areas of up to 2500m2g -1. The suitability of the samples for hydrogen storage was studied by performing H2 adsorption measurements in the 0-1bar pressure range. Adsorption-desorption experiments showed that reversible physisorption takes place in all the samples. The hydrogen adsorption capacities of the activated PET waste compare favourably well with those attained with high-value carbon materials. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Applications are done for a cone falling on a flat-free surface of an incompressible liquid. Both hydrodynamic and structural models are linearized on the basis of a flat disk approximation. This is justified when the deadrise angle is small. In the hydrodynamic Wagner model, the main task is to evaluate the time-varying expansion of the wetted surface. The coupling with the linear model of elasticity is achieved via a modal-based method. This means that the hydrodynamic variables must project onto the family of eigenfunctions; this is the second main difficulty of the present problem. The coupled problem is solved mainly analytically. Special attention is paid to the energy conservation law. In particular, it is shown that kinetic energy evacuated in the jet plays as significant a role in the distribution of energy as the kinetic energy transmitted to the fluid or the kinetic and potential energies of the elastic shell. The importance of elasticity is discussed by comparing the rigid and elastic behaviours for free drop tests. A parametric study shows the influence of each parameter: thickness, deadrise angle and drop height. Comparisons with available experimental pressure data show a reasonable agreement. On the basis of this work, lines of future research are outlined. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We applied a theoretical framework developed by Shukuya et al., to a dynamic simulation model and did numerical calculations for a room with an exterior wall, with and without a south-facing window, during a heating season in the Netherlands. The exergy analysis allows direct comparison between different energy types (e.g., heat, electricity, fuel) on a common basis, and the concept of exergy consumption is useful for expressing how and where energy is dispersed in the course of energy conversion and heat transfer steps. The results show that exergy consumption in the room (demand side) is relatively small compared to the supply side (fuel burned at the power plant and the sun reaching the ground and facade). The calculations also show that the total amount of exergy consumed during the heating season can be larger than the total amount of exergy supplied during the same period, as a result of heat storage in the building mass, and of changes in the outdoor temperature between the moment of heat storage and heat release. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2004.",,"Ceilings; Computer simulation; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Exergy; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Low temperature effects; Radiant heating; Solar radiation; Walls (structural partitions); Exergy analysis; Exergy consumption; Heating season; Low temperature radiant heating system; Outdoor temperature; Office buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644304504

Asparagine was consumed rapidly in batch cultures where it served as both a nitrogen and carbon source. Glucose consumption was low suggesting that asparagine functions as the major carbon source under these conditions. The effect of nutrient limitation on the accumulation of storage carbohydrate in batch culture revealed an intimate association between nitrogen limitation and the accumulation of carbonaceous reserves. This study revealed that glycogen constituted the major carbohydrate reserve associated with the onset of sporulation. Intracellular trehalose levels were found to be relatively low and may have been affected by the availability of carbon. Continuous culture studies revealed a correlation between glycogen accumulation and increasing growth rate. It was also found that elevated cellular ATP levels correlated with the increase in glycogen, and reduced glycolytic activity. At the higher growth rates cellular ATP levels were elevated and coincided with reduced activity of the key glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase, suggesting that glycogen can act as a convenient energy reservoir when excess carbon flux dictates. © 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Actinomycete; Carbon storage; Chemostat; Glycolysis","6 phosphofructokinase; adenosine triphosphate; asparagine; carbohydrate; carbon; glucose; glycogen; nitrogen; trehalose; carbon; microbiology; article; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; carbohydrate analysis; carbon source; cell energy; cell level; controlled study; correlation analysis; enzyme activity; glucose intake; glycogen metabolism; glycolysis; growth rate; Micromonospora; micromonospora echinospora; modulation; nonhuman; nutrient limitation; priority journal; sporogenesis; storage; Adenosine Triphosphate; Asparagine; Carbon; Glycogen; Kinetics; Micromonospora; Nitrogen; Trehalose; Micromonospora; Micromonospora echinospora; uncultured actinomycete",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744272234

Eleven trained rowers performed two exercise sessions (S1, S2) of 90 min each (70-75% V̇O2peak), separated by a 36-week period of intense endurance training. Leptin, FFA and catecholamine plasma concentrations were measured both at the beginning and at the end of S1 and S2, and after recovery periods of 2 and 24 h. Training modified leptin levels in S2 as opposed to S1 (P &lt; 0.001); in S1 leptin levels remained lower after a 24 h recovery whereas they returned to pre-exercise levels in S2. The respiratory exchange ratio was significantly reduced in S2 compared to S1 (P = .018). The FFA and leptin levels were correlated after a 24-h recovery in S1 (r = 0.87; P = 0.0082), and after a 2-h recovery in S2 (r = 0.66; P = 0.021). All data were expressed as the means and standard errors of the mean. In the two sessions, an immediate exercise effect was observed on the levels of the catecholamines, which did not persist after recovery. This training effect was apparent for all catecholamines in response to exercise, particularly on noradrenaline (P = 0.0006). The noradrenaline and leptin levels were correlated after a 2-h recovery in S2 (r = -0.74; P = 0.0042). We conclude that the effect of training on the response of noradrenaline to exercise seems to be involved in the delay in the normalization of leptin levels. We suggest that the amplitude of the noradrenaline response to exercise induced an increase in fat use and a rapid leptin recovery after exercise. The sensitivity of leptin to changes in the fat stores may be improved after training. Both training effects seemed to be involved in the reduction of the recovery time observed for the leptin levels. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Hormone response; Prolonged exercise; Rowers","adrenalin; catecholamine; dopamine; fat; fatty acid; leptin; noradrenalin; oxygen; adult; analytical error; article; blood sampling; concentration (parameters); controlled study; correlation analysis; endurance; energy balance; exercise; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human experiment; lipid storage; lung gas exchange; male; normal human; oxygen consumption; priority journal; radioimmunoassay; sensitivity analysis; time; training; Adult; Catecholamines; Exercise; Exertion; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Humans; Leptin; Physical Education and Training; Physical Endurance; Recovery of Function; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8444237374

While the proton cross sections fall off rapidly below this energy due to package shielding and Coulomb barrier effects, the neutron cross sections at 14.5 MeV are close to the high energy plateau values. Four of the devices show significant thermal neutron SEU cross sections and in two cases these exceed the high energy plateau values.

The charge-coupled device (CCD) is now used in the X-ray region. A ""notch"" structure inside the CCD is widely employed to make it radiation hard. Using a proton beam, we confirmed that the notch structure improved the charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) by a factor of three. We applied a mesh technique in the proton beam experiment of a CCD. The proton beam energy is 600 keV, which induces greater damage than do the beam of high energy widely reported. The CCD employed has 1024 × 1024 pixels with a notch structure. The mesh technique enables us to confine the proton beam to a circular region of 2 μm diameter within a 24 × 24 μm2 pixel. The CCD was kept at -100°C during the irradiation. Some pixels are damaged in the notch region while others in the out-of-notch region. After the proton irradiation, we measured the CTI using 2×107 X-ray photons from 55Fe, and found that the CTI of pixels damaged in the notch region is larger by a factor of 2.5 than that of pixels damaged in the out-of-notch region.

Molecular mechanisms associated with this independent risk factor are not well established. Through the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) strategy, we have studied the transcriptomic effects of castration and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in retroperitoneal adipose tissue of C57BL6 male mice. Approximately 50 000 SAGE tags were isolated in intact and gonadectomized mice, as well as 3 and 24 h after DHT administration. Transcripts involved in energy metabolism, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme supernatant, fatty acid synthase, lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase and monoglyceride lipase, were upregulated by DHT. Transcripts involved in adipogenesis, and cell cycle and cell shape organization, such as DDX5, C/EBPα, cyclin I, procollagen types I, III, IV, V and VI, SPARC and matrix metalloproteinase 2, were upregulated by DHT. Cell defense, division and signaling, protein expression and many novel transcripts were regulated by castration and DHT. The present results provide global genomic evidence for a stimulation of glycolysis, fatty acids and triacylglycerol production, lipolysis and cell shape reorganization, as well as cell proliferation and differentiation, by DHT. The novel transcripts regulated by DHT may contribute to identify new mechanisms involved in the action of sex hormones and their potential role in obesity. © 2004 Society for Endocrinology.",,"acylglycerol lipase; androstanolone; cycline; fatty acid; fatty acid synthase; gelatinase A; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; hormone sensitive lipase; lipoprotein lipase; malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating); osteonectin; procollagen; sex hormone; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; animal tissue; article; castration; cell cycle; cell differentiation; cell division; cell proliferation; cell shape; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; energy metabolism; genome; glycolysis; gonadectomy; heart disease; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; male; mouse; mouse strain; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; obesity; priority journal; protein expression; retroperitoneum; risk factor; serial analysis of gene expression; signal transduction; unindexed sequence; upregulation; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cell Cycle; Cell Shape; Dihydrotestosterone; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Profiling; Glycolysis; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Orchiectomy; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7244225077

Both males and females showed a dramatic drop in the weight of the gonad in stage 6 (spent) individuals. The mantle weight and nidamental gland weight of females also decreased during the maturation process. Males, however, had a marked increase in both the penis and spermatophoric complex weight in spent individuals, while female oviducal gland weight and nidamental gland length also increased in stage 6 individuals. Residual analysis indicated that testis growth was not developing at the expense of mantle growth, although there was a suggestion of cost to the fins. Females showed that the development of the ovary occurred at a cost to both the mantle and fins. Overall body condition also declined with maturity stage for both males and females, with stage 6 individuals of both sexes in poor condition. Very few females had eggs in the oviducts, suggesting that the oviducts are used as ducts instead of storage organs. Proximal analysis revealed a loss of constituents within the mantle during maturation, with an associated increase in water, indicating the remobilization of energy from the mantle to fuel reproduction. This study suggests that the digestive gland is not used as an energy store in this species. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"cephalopod; egg production; reproductive cost; sexual maturity; spawning; weight; Cephalopoda; Moroteuthis ingens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7044274492

The aim of the model was to predict growth rate and the chemical and anatomical body compositions from the digestible nutrient intake of gilts (20-105 kg live weight). The model represents the partitioning of digestible nutrients from intake through intermediary metabolism to body protein and body fat. State variables of the model were lysine, acetyl-CoA equivalents, glucose, volatile fatty acids and fatty acids as metabolite pools, and protein in muscle, hide-backfat, bone and viscera and body fat as body constituent pools. It was assumed that fluxes of metabolites follow saturation kinetics depending on metabolite concentrations. In the model, protein deposition rate depended on the availability of lysine and of acetyl-CoA. The anatomical body composition in terms of muscle, organs, hide-backfat and bone was predicted from the chemical body composition and accretion using allometric relationships. Partitioning of protein, fat, water and ash in muscle, organs, hide-backfat and bone fractions were driven by the rates of muscle protein and body fat deposition. Model parameters were adjusted to obtain a good fit of the experimental data from literature. Differential equations were solved numerically for a given set of initial conditions and parameter values. In the present paper, the model is presented, including its parameterisation. The evaluation of the model is described in a companion paper. © The Authors 2004.","Anatomical body composition; Chemical body composition; Modelling; Pig","acetyl coenzyme A; amino acid; fat; glucose; lysine; protein; volatile fatty acid; muscle protein; allometry; animal anatomy; article; body composition; body fat; bone; carcass; chemical composition; controlled study; energy metabolism; enzyme kinetics; growth rate; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; metabolite; muscle; nutrient dynamics; parametric test; prediction; protein metabolism; swine; viscera; analytical parameters; animal food; caloric intake; dietary intake; food composition; food quality; meat; nonhuman; protein content; protein degradation; protein synthesis; publishing; sensitivity analysis; slaughterhouse; velocity; Adipose Tissue; Animal Nutrition Physiology; Animals; Body Composition; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Female; Growth; Models, Biological; Muscle Proteins; Proteins; Swine; Sensitivity and Specificity; Weight Gain; Fraxinus; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6444237549

The most efficient way to achieve these objectives is to automate the existing means of communication and to improve transportation management. Since most of the communication channels and technologies for automation in transportation management are Web-based, we want to describe how to improve Web-based transportation management. Talking about Web-based environments means talking about the Internet and services it offers. These Web-based environments build up a good basis for an agent-based approach, because all aspects for communication and information processing are also used in agent systems. In this approach, Web servers build the agents by themselves and an agent-based interaction works with the support of Web services. Thus, we can build an agent-based structure for transportation control that is similar to the structure of the Internet.

Such a system can be modeled as a magnetically coupled system of many permanent magnets and high-Tc superconducting bulks. It is a multi-degree-of-freedom dynamical system coupled by nonlinear interaction between levitated magnets and superconducting bulks. This nonlinearly coupled system, with small damping due to no contact support, can easily show complicated phenomena of nonlinear dynamics. In mechanical design, it is important to evaluate this nonlinear dynamics, though it has not been well studied so far. This research deals with forced vibration of a coupled superconducting levitation system. As a simple modeling of a coupled system, a permanent magnet levitated above a superconducting bulk is placed between two fixed permanent magnets without contact. Frequency response of the levitated magnet under excitation of one of the fixed magnets was examined theoretically. The results show typical nonlinear vibration, such as jump, hysteresis, and parametric resonance, which were confirmed in our numerical analyses and experiments. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It is characterized by a single solenoid coil made of aluminum stabilized NbTi CIC.

The metabolic consequences hereof are not known but might have long-lasting health effects. In fact, knowledge of lipid metabolism in premature infants is very limited. We have quantified de novo lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis on d 3 of life in seven premature infants (birth weight, 1319 ± 417 g; gestational age, 30 ± 2 wk). For comparison, five healthy adult subjects were also studied. All subjects received a 12-h [1- 13C] acetate infusion, followed by mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) on lipoprotein-palmitate and plasma unesterified cholesterol. The fraction of lipoprotein-palmitate synthesized at the end of the infusion period was 5.4 ± 3.9% in infants, which was in the same range as found in adult subjects on a normal diet, suggesting that hepatic de novo lipogenesis is not a major contributor to fat accumulation in these premature neonates. The fractional contribution of newly synthesized cholesterol to plasma unesterified cholesterol was 7.4 ± 1.3% after a 12-h infusion. The calculated rate of endogenous cholesterol synthesis was 31 ± 7 mg/kg/d, a value approximately three times higher than that found in adult subjects (10 ± 6 mg/kg/d). These results indicate that the cholesterol-synthesizing machinery is well developed in premature infants.",,"acetic acid; cholesterol; lipid emulsion; lipofundin; lipoprotein; palmitic acid; analytic method; article; cholesterol synthesis; clinical article; controlled study; enteric feeding; female; food composition; gestational age; human; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; liver metabolism; male; mass isotopomer distribution analysis; mass spectrometry; newborn; parenteral nutrition; placental transfer; prematurity; priority journal; Acetates; Adult; Carbon Isotopes; Cholesterol; Energy Metabolism; Female; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Male; Phospholipids; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644250769

In the previous work, it was confirmed that a switching phenomenon between high and low resistance range took place at a threshold current or a transfer current value in the V-I curves of YBCO contact. In this paper we found that the transfer current exceeded 30 A and the contact resistance were decreased to 40 μΩ at 77 K in the mechanical contact when the sample surfaces were carefully polished. Moreover we succeed in decreasing the contact resistance to 6 μΩ with depositing the metal on the contact surface. The present results suggest that a pair of superconducting blocks might be applicable to the mechanical persistent current switch for superconducting magnetic energy storage and other superconducting systems running in a persistent current mode. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The Pulses Plus™ battery can deliver very high energy at very high-power pulses (above 15A at RT). Under low temperature conditions, its power capabilities are also very good, as 2A, 1s pulses above 2.5V at -40°C can be obtained. The stability of performance after elevated temperature storage and its low self-discharge rate make this a battery to operate under high pulse power over 20 years. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Other hybrid systems combine a double-layer electrochemical capacitor device with a fuel-cell or a separate rechargeable battery. Following a discussion of dependence of cell voltage of regular, two-electrode, non-faradaic electrochemical capacitors on state-of-charge (SOC), comparisons are made with recently conceived hybrid combinations of a battery-type rechargeable electrode with a double-layer capacitor-type electrode. Advantages, disadvantages and requirements of such hybrid systems over regular electrochemical supercapacitors or batteries are discussed and critically examined in regard to available energy- and power-densities, energy and coulombic efficiency, cycle-life, voltage profiles on discharge, and self-discharge behaviour. Emphasis is given to importance of using a third electrode, as reference, especially in evaluations of discharge/recharge behaviour of each electrode of an hybrid pair having very different electrochemical characteristics, one faradaic, the other non-faradaic. Use of a reference electrode also provides the opportunity of following self-discharge behaviour of the individual electrodes independently. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In late gestation glycogen-laden type II cells shift their metabolic program toward the synthesis of surfactant, of which phosphatidylcholine (PC) is by far the most abundant lipid. To investigate the cellular site of surfactant PC synthesis in these cells we determined the subcellular localization of two key enzymes for PC biosynthesis, fatty acid synthase (FAS) and CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-α (CCT-α), and compared their localization with that of surfactant storage organelles, the lamellar bodies (LBS), and surfactant proteins (SPs) in fetal mouse lung. Ultrastructural analysis showed that immature and mature LBs were present within the glycogen pools of fetal type II cells. Multivesicular bodies were noted only in the cytoplasm. Immunogold electron microscopy (EM) revealed that the glycogen pools were the prominent cellular sites for FAS and CCT-α. Energy-filtering EM demonstrated that CCT-α bound to phosphorus-rich (phospholipid) structures in the glycogen. SP-B and SP-C, but not SP-A, localized predominantly to the glycogen stores. Collectively, these data suggest that the glycogen stores in fetal type II cells are a cellular site for surfactant PC synthesis and LB formation/maturation consistent with the idea that the glycogen is a unique substrate for surfactant lipids.","CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase; Fatty acid synthase; Immunogold; Pulmonary surfactant","choline phosphate cytidylyltransferase; fatty acid synthase; glycogen; lung surfactant; phosphatidylcholine; surfactant associated protein; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell maturation; cell type; cell ultrastructure; controlled study; cytoplasm; data analysis; female; fetus; filtration; immunogold electron microscopy; lamellar body; lipogenesis; lung; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein localization; Animals; Antibody Specificity; Epithelial Cells; Glycogen; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Organelles; Pulmonary Surfactants; Respiratory Mucosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544239607

In this study, the decomposed subproblems are solved by a simulated annealing algorithm combined with dynamic programming. By decomposing the problem into single machine subproblems, the changeover cost can easily be incorporated in the objective function. In order to reduce the computation time, a heuristic algorithm for calculating the starting times of operations is also proposed. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the simulated annealing method by which the schedule of the entire machine is successively improved.

Experiments were carefully performed under the initial hydrogen pressure ranging from 0.275 to 1.203 MPa and isothermal condition. The obtained hydrogen absorption kinetic curves were fitted using various rate equations to reveal the mechanism of the hydriding process. It was found that the three-dimensional diffusion process dominated the hydrogen absorption. The experimental investigation suggested that increase of the initial hydrogen pressure resulted in an acceleration of hydriding transformed fraction and the kinetic characteristics of Mg2Ni alloy was improved by substituting Al for Mg due to difference in hydride structure, particle size. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

The stratified unit was modeled by using three partial differential equations governing the time and space dependence of hot gas, liquid storage medium and pipes wall material, respectively. For the study of fully mixed units a standard approach based on the number of thermal units concept was slightly generalized to take into account the time dependence of the heat transfer coefficients. The performance indicator adopted here is the minimum exergy destruction. All relevant irreversibility sources were considered. Every operation regime has an optimum charging time, which increases by decreasing the hot gas inlet temperature. Also, there is an optimum gas mass flow rate that makes the exergy destruction number a minimum minimorum. The stratified units are normally more effective than the fully mixed units from the point of view of exergy conservation. The standard approach based on the number of thermal units concept tends to overestimate the performance of thermal energy storage systems. Its accuracy is better in case of fully mixed units. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Several options are being considered to achieve this target. For deep reductions within the next decade or two, CO2 sequestration is the only option if fossil fuel power plants, in particular coal based plants, are to remain in operation. In the case of Ontario, the only sequestration option is geological sequestration in saline aquifers, where CO2 is expected to be stored for long geological periods, from one hundred to several thousand years depending on the size, properties and location of the reservoir. The preferred concept is to inject CO2 into a porous and permeable reservoir covered with a cap rock located at least 800 m beneath the earth's surface where CO2 can be stored under supercritical conditions. The injection pressure and temperature should be above the critical temperature and pressure of CO2 (31.1 °C and 7.38 MPa). This is the first study of its kind in Ontario. Two different major reservoirs with approximate storage capacities of 289 million and 442 million tonnes are identified in southwestern Ontario for CO2 sequestration, one located in the southern part of Lake Huron and the other located inside Lake Erie. These reservoirs might contain approximately 14-21 years of CO 2 emissions from a nearby coal-fired power generation unit having a total generation capacity of about 4000 MW. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Such an autonomous system comprises a number of photovoltaic panels, properly connected, and a battery storage device, along with the corresponding electronic equipment. Considering the high solar potential of most Greek territories, an integrated study is conducted based on long term solar potential experimental measurements in order to determine the optimum configuration of a stand alone photovoltaic system at representative locations all over Greece. The proposed solution ""guarantees"" zero load rejections for all the areas and time periods examined. For this purpose, a fast and reliable numerical code ""PHOTOV-III"" has been used. The algorithm provides analytical results concerning the energy autonomy and the operational status of the autonomous system components. Besides, the optimum panel tilt angle, minimizing the first installation cost of a small photovoltaic system, is predicted. Finally, by introducing available financial aspects, it is possible to determine the optimum system dimensions on a minimum first installation cost basis. According to the results obtained, an autonomous photovoltaic system can definitely contribute to solution of the urgent electrification problem of remote consumers spread throughout Greece, also improving their life quality level. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The general objective of the system is to use the groundwater from the aquifer to cool down the condenser of the HVAC system and at the same time storing this waste heat in the aquifer. Cooling with groundwater at around 18 °C instead of utilizing outside summer air at 30-35 °C decreases consumption of electrical energy significantly. In addition, stored heat can be recovered when it is needed in winter.

In situ determination of these properties can be done by installing a vertical borehole heat exchanger (BHE) and performing the so-called thermal response test (TRT). The present paper describes the results of a cooperative work between research groups of Chile and Argentina, which led to the first thermal response test performed in Latin America. A setup for implementing the TRT was prepared at the ""Solar Energy Laboratory"" of the Technical University Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile. The test was realized over 9 days (24 June to 3 July 2003) while inlet and outlet fluid temperatures of the BHE and the ambient temperature were measured every minute. A comparison between conventional slope determination method, Geothermal Properties Measurement (GPM) data evaluation software based on numerical solutions to the differential equations governing the heat transfer processes and two variable-parameter fitting was performed in order to calculate the thermal conductivity and borehole thermal resistance.

Radiation spectra, mask technology and process conditions are optimized for patterning resist thicknesses of several hundred micrometers with lateral dimensions of a few microns. This article provides first results as to how far these technologies can be extended to form structures with sub-micrometer lateral dimensions in resist layers of a few micrometers thickness. Available equipment and processes of the 2.5 GeV electron storage ring ANKA and the process technology of the Institut für Mikrostrukturtechnik (IMT) in Karlsruhe, Germany, have been applied. An X-ray mask with a 2.7 μm Ti-membrane and 20 μm thick Au-absorbers is used to expose 1.6 μm PMMA resist on silicon wafers. As the smallest features on the mask are 2 μm, a double exposure with an intermediate deliberate relative movement between mask and resist generated sub-micron resist test structures. Smallest feature sizes are between 300 and 400 nm. They are not yet limited by diffraction, but by different process conditions that lead to adhesion loss, resist cracking and surface rounding. It has been shown that an intermediate layer of 1.2 μm thick polyimide between resist and substrate significantly enhances adhesion and reduces resist cracking. Reducing the beam power impinging onto the sample from typically 21 to 0.4 W leads to a 50% reduction of the surface rounding at the top of the microstructures. To demonstrate the capability to pattern thicker resist layers, first samples with an increased resist thickness of 4.1 μm and an aspect ratio of up to 8 were processed.

PFL catalyzes the reversible conversion of pyruvate and coenzyme A (CoA) into formate and acetylated CoA. Large models are employed, based on a recent X-ray crystal structure of PFL in complex with the pyruvate substrate. The rate-limiting step is shown to be the homolytic C1-C2 bond cleavage of pyruvate, which occurs after the attack of the Cys418 radical on the carbonyl carbon of pyruvate. For the acetylation of CoA, we propose a new mechanism, in which the released formyl radical anion abstracts a hydrogen atom directly from CoA. This way, the acetyl group transfer from Cys418 becomes facile.

T. ferrooxidans is an obligatory acidophilic, autotrophic bacterium and derives its energy by the oxidation of ferrous ion, elemental sulfur, and reduced sulfur compounds including metal sulfides. The assay is based on the monitoring of a current increase by addition of toxicoids, which is caused by the inhibition of bacterial respiration and decrease in oxygen consumption. Optimum cell number on the membrane was 5.0 × 108 cells. The steady-state current was obtained when concentration of FeSO 4 was above 3.6 mM at pH 3. The sensor response of T. ferrooxidans immobilized membrane for 5.0 μM KCN was within an error of 10% for 30 membranes. A linear relationship was obtained at KCN concentration in the range of 0.5-3.0 μM in a flow-type monitoring system. Minimum detectable concentrations of KCN, Na2S, and NaN3 were 0.5, 1.2, and 0.07 μM, respectively. The monitoring system contained two biosensors and these sensors were cleaned with sulfuric acid (pH 1.5) twice a day. This treatment could remove fouling on microbial immobilized membrane by natural water and ferrous precipitation in the flow cell. This flow-type monitoring sensor was operated continuously for 5 months. Also, T. ferrooxidans immobilized membrane can be stored for one month at 4°C when preserved with wet absorbent cotton under argon gas. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Biosensor; Cyanide sensor; Flow monitoring system; Thiobacillus ferrooxidans; Water toxicity","Bacteria; Biosensors; Concentration (process); Cyanides; Electrodes; Membranes; Precipitation (chemical); Water filtration; Bacterial respiration; Natural waters; Water toxicity; Toxicity; cyanide; ferrous sulfate; potassium cyanide; sulfuric acid; water; Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans; article; biosensor; dry weight; immobilized biomass; membrane filter; nonhuman; online monitoring; oxygen consumption; oxygen electrode; pH; storage temperature; toxicity testing; Biosensing Techniques; Cells, Immobilized; Cyanides; Electrochemistry; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Flow Injection Analysis; Oxygen; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thiobacillus; Toxicity Tests; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification; Water Supply; Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gossypium hirsutum; Thiobacillus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644280137

For both these applications, the defect chemistry of the perovskites is of utmost importance as this largely determines both the electrical and magnetic properties of the material. We model the Gibbs energy of the perovskite using the compound energy formalism under the assumption that Mn2+ or Mn3+ form antisite defects on the La-sublattice and that no antisite defects are formed. We find that only if antisite defects are included, can the experimental data on oxygen nonstoichiometry of cation nonstoichiometric perovskites from literature be reproduced. However, the question whether the antisite Mn assumes the valency Mn2+ or Mn3+ cannot be answered with this modeling method, as both versions reproduce the defect chemistry equally well. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The climatic impact of capturing 30% of the anthropogenic carbon emission and its storage in the ocean or in geological reservoir are evaluated for different stabilization scenarios using a reduced-form carbon cycle-climate model. The accumulated Global Warming Avoided (GWA) remains, after a ramp-up during the first ∼50 years, in the range of 15 to 30% over the next millennium for deep ocean injection and for geological storage with annual leakage rates of up to about 0.001. For longer time scales, the GWA may approach zero or become negative for storage in a reservoir with even small leakage rates, accounting for the CO2 associated with the energy penalty for carbon capture. For an annual leakage rate of 0.01, surface air temperature becomes higher than in the absence of storage after three centuries only.

In fact, when electrically moved, they are zero emission vehicles with very low noise emissions as well. These positive characteristics could be even improved by coupling a PAB with a fuel cell based power generation system, so increasing the vehicle autonomy without influencing their emissions and consumption performances. In this paper a conceptual Fuel Cell Pedal Assisted Bicycle (FC-PAB) design with compact metal hydride hydrogen storage is analysed by means of a mixed experimental and numerical approach. Even though the power source integration for such a vehicle is simpler than that for a car, it still represents a challenging effort maximizing PAB vehicle autonomy and minimizing, at the same time, its weight. The performances of the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) FC based energy production systems for these applications are analysed by means of a simulation model able to describe the performance of all the system components from the on board energy storage to the road load. To increase the significance of the results, comparisons are made with respect to a reference driving cycle, in order to simulate a city trip comprehensive both of flat and hilly parts. Model predictions have proved to be able to simulate system behaviour and could be used to design system characteristics as well as to define its control system. Results show that FC-PAB reaches the pursued targets in terms of weight (comparable with the weight of the same bicycle powered by an electric motor fed by batteries) and autonomy (about 200 km under the conditions defined by reference driving cycle), still being zero local emissions and noiseless. © 2004 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc.",,"Bicycles; Conceptual design; Energy utilization; Engines; Environmental impact; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Polyelectrolytes; Design and modeling; Energy production systems; Low energy consumption; Numerical approaches; On-board energy storage; Polymer electrolyte membranes; Power generation systems; Zero emission vehicles; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028721670

It has previously been shown that bone mineral density (BMD) during the first year after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in children with osteodystrophy increases remarkably and according to height. The effect of posttransplant factors possibly influencing bone mass in the long-term after a successful OLT in children is unknown. Methods. Eighteen patients (9 male), median age 13.3 (range 4.7-23.7) years, median time after OLT 8.3 (1.1-17.3) years were enrolled. Indications for OLT were biliary atresia (8), Alagille (3), hepatoblastoma (2), NonA-NonG acute liver failure (2), intrahepatic cholestasis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and cholesteryl-ester disease (1 each). At OLT, all were prepubertal and 12 were severely cholestatic. We recorded anthropometric data, immunosuppression, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), biochemical markers of bone metabolism, and liver function. Results. Six children were on steroid therapy, eight were on cyclosporine, nine on tacrolimus. Median L1 to L4 spinal BMD was 0.720 (range 0.524-1.127) g/cm 2 , Z score -0.70 (-2.2-1+2.1), height Z score -0.31 (-1.83-+1.96). Median bone mineral apparent density was 0.112 (0.084-0.142) (normal value 0.10-0.14) g/cm3. Median alanine aminotransferase level was 22 (range 11-79) IU/L, urinary free deoxypyridinolines 20.6 (7.1-62) nmol/mmol creatinine, osteocalcin 14 (2.3-45) μg/L, parathyroid hormone 51 (2-87) ng/L, Vitamin D3 67 (17-102) nmol/L. Conclusion. BMD after the first year from a successful pediatric liver transplantation is normal.

The phase coupling induced ultraslow light propagation was observed with a group velocity as low as 0.05 m/s in a photorefractive Bi12SiO20 crystal at room temperature. The ultraslow light was amplified in the crystal because of the unidirectional energy transfer from a coupling beam to the ultraslow light. The results show that this technique to produce ultraslow light propagation was valid for all nonlinear wave mixing processes with a dispersive phase coupling effect.",,"Bandwidth; Crystals; Data processing; Diffraction gratings; Electromagnetism; Four wave mixing; Interferometers; Optical data storage; Photorefractive materials; Quantum theory; Refractive index; Direct current voltage; Phase coupling; Signal beams; Two wave mixing (TWM); Light transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19644377163

To understand this particular behavior, changes on helianthinin association-dissociation state induced by modifications in pH and ionic strength were analyzed. The influence of these different medium conditions on its thermal stability and tendency to form aggregates was also studied. Helianthinin behavior at different pH values and ionic strengths is similar to other 11S globulins except that it remains in a trimeric form at pH 11. Helianthinin thermal stability is higher than other 11S globulins but is lower than oat 11S globulin. Alkaline pH produces a 10 °C decrease of its denaturation temperature and also of the cooperativity of denaturation process, but it does not affect the denaturation activation energy. The decrease in thermal stability with the pH increase is also manifested by its tendency to form aggregates by SH/SS interchange reactions. When thermal treatments at alkaline pH are performed, all helianthinin subunits form aggregates, characterized by a higher proportion of β-polypeptides than α-polypeptides, which is an indication that aggregation is accompanied by dissociation. Treatments at 80 °C are sufficient to induce aggregation but not to produce denaturation, and in these conditions hexameric forms remain after the treatment.","Globulin; Helianthus; Ionic strength effect; pH effect; Thermal stability","globulin; vegetable protein; article; ionic strength; pH; protein denaturation; protein stability; sunflower; thermostability; Drug Stability; Heat; Helianthus; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Osmolar Concentration; Plant Proteins; Protein Denaturation; Helianthus; Helianthus annuus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644251002

The I-V measurements indicate, for all the systems, a perfect ohmic behaviour, reproducible electrical properties and high stability. The intrinsic electrical behaviour of the SWCN can be modulated by controlling the arrangement and the overall organization of the nanotube bundles. In particular, improved currents are measured for SWCN bundles aligned by a dielectrophoresis process.

A laboratory model of an impact oat dehuller, similar to a commercial device, was used to study the effects of rotation speed and grain moisture content on groat breakage and the storage life of oat groats. Grain of oat cultivar Salo [from official variety trials, MTT Agrifood Research Finland, Jokioinen (60°49'N), 1996-2000] was dehulled with an impact oat dehuller using rotation speeds of 200 to 500 r min-1 at 50 r min -1 intervals. In an additional experiment, grains were moistened resulting in moisture content ranging from 10% to 18%. Proportion of broken groats and size distribution of groat particles were measured. Storability was determined through analysing the evolution of pentanal, hexanal and free fatty acid content after storing groats at 10, 20 and 30°C for two and five months. At higher rotation speeds more broken groats resulted, but dehulling did not cause any marked rancidification of the groats. Thus, impact dehulling is a practical method to increase the energy content of oat grains on-farm without such problems as groat breakage induced oxidation of fatty acids.","Avena sativa; Fat; Fatty acids; Grain; Groat; Hulls; Oat; Rancidification; Rotational speed; Volatile compounds","Avena; Avena sativa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142758716

It remains an under-utilised crop and it contributes less than 0.1% to the total oat area in Finland. In general, limited interest in growing naked oat more extensively is attributed to its weaknesses, which ironically result from nakedness that improves the quality of the crop. This paper reviews the available literature and assesses the balance of the arguments for and against naked oats. Results from the study were transformed into quantitative variables and analysed for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) using an analytical hierarchical process. As the importance of different SWOT-factors depends largely on targeted end-use of yield, separate analyses were done for use of naked oats as on-farm feed and as an input for the feed and food industry. If we aim at increasing area under naked oat in Finland, the most feasible starting point would be on-farm feed. In this case, strengths (high nutritional quality and energy content) outweighed weaknesses (sensitivity to grain damage) and threats (problems in germination). Increasing naked oat production in this respect is likely to encourage solving the remaining problems that deter industry. Threats (availability) regarding the feed industry and weaknesses (incomplete expression of nakedness) in the food industry out-weighed strengths (high nutritional quality and storability) and opportunities (potential niches).","Breeding; Cultivation; Feeds; Food; Grain; Harvesting; Oats; Quality; Storage; Yields","Avena; Avena nuda; Avena sativa; Nuda",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142711662

Tablets were produced of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), spray-dried lactose, pregelatinized starch, and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) with an instrumented single punch tableting machine. The temperature pattern at the surface of the tablets was measured starting directly after tableting with an infrared thermoviewer and an infrared sensor. Powder and tablets were analyzed by FT-Raman spectroscopy, the tablets were analyzed directly after tableting and after one month of storage. The crushing force of the resulting tablets was determined. For all materials a temperature increase (TI) induced by tableting was determined with both methods used. The order of the temperature increase was the same for both methods used: TI (MCC)>TI (spray-dried lactose)>TI (pregelatinized starch)>TI (DCPD). The order was also identical for the crushing force of the tablets. The extent of differences in the spectra followed the same ranking. In conclusion, the temperature increase contributed to the changes in material structure and thus temperature increase is one factor which determined crushing force and thus tablet properties.","Crushing force; Excipients; FT-Raman spectroscopy; Tableting; Temperature","Crushing force; FT-Raman spectroscopy; Pregelatinized starch; Tableting; Activation energy; Crushing; Infrared spectroscopy; Quality control; Raman spectroscopy; Sensors; Starch; Temperature control; Thermodynamic stability; Crystalline materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344700610

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to investigate solid-state modifications of the drug induced by co-grinding with the selected carriers in a high energy vibrational micro-mill. X-ray powder diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy were employed as additional techniques to support DSC data. Equimolar drug: cyclodextrin physical mixtures were co-ground for different times (up to 60 min) at constant vibration frequency (24 Hz). A progressive drug amorphization with increasing grinding time was observed in all binary systems, but, interestingly, different degrees of sensitivity to the mechanical-chemical activation were evident. In fact, blends with natural cyclodextrins, despite the initial higher crystallinity than those with the amorphous derivatives, required the same or shorter co-grinding times (60 min) to achieve complete drug amorphization. Stability studies indicated no appreciable drug recrystallization in co-ground products after 4 months storage in sealed containers at 25°C or 1 month at 25°C and 75% RH. No stability differences were detected between products with natural or derivative cyclodextrins. The results accounted for the suitability of cyclodextrin co-grinding technique to obtain and stabilize glyburide in the activated amorphous form.","Co-grinding; Cyclodextrin; DSC; Glyburide","Co-grinding; Cyclodextrins; Glyburide; Sulfonylureas; Amorphization; Aromatic compounds; Crystalline materials; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dissolution; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Recrystallization (metallurgy); X ray powder diffraction; Drug products",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344617772

Its electrochemical capacitor behavior was studied by cyclic voltammetry in various electrolytes. Specific capacitance up to 390 F g(RuO2)-1 at a scan rate of 50 mV s-1, which is a ten-fold increase compared to conventional anhydrous RuO2, was obtained using layered ruthenic acid hydrate in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Slightly lower values were obtained for 1 M HClO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes. The difference in the specific capacitance of anhydrous ruthenium oxide, hydrous ruthenium oxide, hydrous ruthenic acid, and restacked ruthenic acid nanosheets in the various electrolytes is discussed. © 2004 The Electrochemical Society.

The detection and identification of slow protons and deuterons emerging from a deuterium cluster-jet target thus becomes feasible. A good measurement of the energy and angle of such a spectator proton (psp) allows one to identify a reaction as having taken place on the neutron in the target and then to determine the kinematical variables of the ion-neutron system on an event-by-event basis over a range of c.m. energies. The system has been successfully tested under laboratory conditions. By measuring the spectator proton in the pd→pspdπ0 reaction in coincidence with a fast deuteron in the ANKE Forward Detector, values of the pn→dπ0 total cross-section have been deduced. Further applications of the telescope include the determination of the luminosity and beam polarisation which are required for several experiments. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that the dehydrogenated wet-chemically Ti(OBu″)4 doped NaAlH4 consists of a crystalline Al and an amorphous NaH phase. The striking result of EDX analyses is that in each case the Ti-dopant is found to be present only in the Al phase. On the other hand, dehydrogenated NaAlH4 doped with Ti* or TiCl3 via ball milling is an amorphous material, with diffuse boundaries between Al and NaH phases and a highly uniform distribution of titanium in the Al-phase. Both the use of the ball milling doping method and of Ti* nanoparticles as dopants, are probable reasons for the outstanding kinetics of the Ti* doped material (B. Bogdanović, M. Felderhoff, S. Kaskel, A. Pommerin, K. Schlichte and F. Schüth, Adv. Mater., 2003, 15, 1012; M. Fichtner, O. Fuhr, O, Kircher and J, Röthe, Nanotechnology, 2003, 14, 778). The course of hydrogen dis- and recharging reactions is discussed in light of the present TEM-EDX and the preceding XRD investigations of storage materials. Ti-EXAFS and XANES spectra of Ti-doped NaAlH4 after the doping, after several, and after 100 de- and rehydrogenation cycles are very close to each other. Apparently, after the Ti-doping, a zerovalent Ti species is formed which remains almost unchanged in the course of the cycle test. The XAFS spectra indicate that Ti is largely atomically dispersed in the Al phase, i.e. forms an Al-Ti alloy, thus confirming the earlier hypothesis (V. P. Balema, J. W. Wiench, K. W. M. Dennis, M.

While unirradiated SS presented no ESR signal, irradiated SS exhibited an ESR spectrum with many resonance peaks. Variations of the spectrum pattern and of the intensities of resonance peaks with microwave power, applied radiation dose, storage time and temperature were followed. A radical with unpaired electron localised on the carbon atom of five membered ring directly attached to two CH3 groups and SO 2- ionic radical called as species A and B, respectively, were found to be produced after gamma radiolysis of SS. The characteristic spectral and kinetic features of these species were determined by spectrum simulation calculation and by curve fitting techniques using experimental signal intensity data as input. Although, species A was fairly unstable at room and especially at high temperatures, species B were observed to be relatively stable even at high temperatures having activation energies of EA= 46(±4) kJ/mol and EB=82(±3) kJ/mol, respectively, at room temperature. Four different mathematical functions were tried to explore the dosimetric features of SS and a linear function of applied dose described best the dose-response data obtained for stable species, that is, radical B, in the dose range of 0-10 kGy. An accuracy of 4% in the dose measurements was concluded to be achievable through back-projection dose calculations if SS were used as a dosimetric material. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The motor domain of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) includes an ATP binding region with ATPase activity and an actin-binding region. Motor function is achieved by conformational changes, at hydrolysis, of ATP causing a shift in the angle between the actin binding head and the rod region of the molecule. The elongated alpha-helical coiled-coil rod region of MyHC molecules constitutes the major part of the thick filaments of the sarcomere. Three major MyHC isoforms are expressed in human skeletal muscle (type I, MYH7, expressed in type 1 fibres; IIa, MYH2, expressed in 2A fibres; IIx, MYH1, expressed in 2B fibres). While mutations in slow/beta cardiac MyHC (MYH7) are a common cause of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, no skeletal myopathies have, until recently, been associated with mutations in MyHC. A heterozygous mutation, Glu706Lys, in the core of the head of MyHC IIa is associated with a familial congenital myopathy, which, in most instances, has shown mild phenotypic expression in children but progressive course in some adults. There is a relationship between the level of expression of mutated MyHC IIa and muscle pathology. Some adults with a progressive course show muscle fibres with rimmed vacuoles and filaments of the type seen in inclusion body myositis/myopathy (IBM). Endurance training in a group of affected patients caused a shift in the expression of myosin from fast (IIx) to slow (I) isoforms but no reduction in the expression of MyHC IIa. A heterozygous mutation, Arg1845Trp, in the distal rod region of slow myosin (type I, MYH7) is associated with familial congenital myopathy, with large deposits of MyHC I in the subsarcolemmal region of type 1 muscle fibres, ""Myosin storage myopathy"". These patients showed slowly progressive muscle weakness but no overt cardiomyopathy. These two muscle diseases, which are caused by mutations in MyHC, form the basis of a novel entity: ""Myosin myopathies"".",,"actin; adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphate; alpha actinin; connectin; creatine kinase; cytochrome c oxidase; desmin; myomesin; myosin binding protein C; myosin heavy chain; alpha helix; article; autosomal dominant disorder; autosomal dominant myopathy; cell vacuole; clinical feature; familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; fast muscle fiber; gene expression; gene mutation; histopathology; human; inclusion body myositis; muscle function; muscle weakness; myopathy; myosin storage myopathy; sarcomere; skeletal muscle; slow muscle fiber; Animals; Exercise; Humans; Muscular Diseases; Mutation; Myosin Heavy Chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9344223966

Even an instantaneous voltage drop may give rise to serious problems in computer systems or electronic equipments. The uninterruptible power system (UPS) has been used to compensate for the power service interruptions. And also, the instantaneous voltage drop compensator using the electrolytic capacitor has developed for the instantaneous voltage drop. Recently, the double-layer capacitor is paid attention as a new energy storage element. This capacitor has a lot of advantages such as no maintenance, long lifetime and quick charge/discharge characteristics with large current and it has higher energy density than the electrolytic capacitor. Therefore, we developed the uninterruptible power system using the double-layer capacitor. In this paper, the performance of the uninterruptible power system using the double-layer capacitor is shown by the simulated and experimental results. Furthermore, the discharge characteristics of the double-layer capacitors are investigated on the basis of the equivalent circuit including the capacitors and a voltage booster. Finally, the maximum load capacity to compensate is clarified for the system. © 2004, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

For the HMW glutenin subunits, all cultivars carried the null allele Glu-A1c, and four variants were observed at Glu-B1: Glu-B1b (encoding subunits 7+8), Glu-B1d (subunits 6+8), Glu-B1e (subunits 20+20y) and Glu-B1z (subunits 7+15). For the Glu-3 encoded B-LMW glutenin subunits, alleles Glu-A3a (subunit 6), Glu-A3b (subunit 5), Glu-B3a (subunits 2+4+15+19), Glu-B3b (8+9+13+16) and Glu-B3c (2+4+14+15+19) were observed, and for the Glu-B2 encoded B-LMW glutenin subunits, Glu-B2a (subunit 12) and Glu-B2b (null allele). A B-LMW glutenin subunit not previously reported was observed in the cultivar Buck Cristal and provisionally designated subunit 6.1. A wide range of values for the characters gluten index, SDS-sedimentation volume and the Farinograph parameters energy level and tolerance was obtained from grain harvested from field trials sown in Argentina. There were strong correlations between these characters, and less strong correlations with grain protein and gluten content. While some cultivars varied for quality performance between years, others were relatively consistent for both extremes of performance. The analyses suggested that the gene pool represented by the cultivars investigated comprises useful variation for future breeding programmes, and provides pointers for directions that such programmes could take. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The solid wall material was selected as platinum, which has well established interaction potential. We consider the intermolecular force not only among the liquid argon molecules, but also between the liquid argon atoms and the solid wall particles, therefore three regions, i.e. the liquid argon computation domain, the top and bottom solid wall regions are included for the force interaction. The present MD (Molecular Dynamics) simulation was performed without any assumptions at the wall surface. The objective of the study is to find how the flow and the slip boundaries at the wall surface are affected by the applied gravity force, or the shear rate. The MD simulations are performed in a non-dimensional unit system, with the periodic boundary conditions applied except in the channel height direction. Once the steady state is reached, the macroscopic parameters are evaluated using the statistical mechanics approach. For all the cases tested numerically in the present paper, slip boundaries occur, and such slip velocity at the stationary wall surface increases with increasing the applied gravity force, or the shear rate. The slip length, which is defined as the distance that the liquid particles shall travel beyond the wall surfaces to reach the same velocity as the wall surface, sharply decreases at small shear rate, then slightly decreases with increasing the applied shear rate. We observe that the liquid viscosity remains nearly constant at small shear rates, and the Newtonian flow occurs. However, with increasing the shear rate, the viscosity increases and the non-Newtonian flow appears.","Molecular dynamics simulation; Poiseuille flow; Slip length; Velocity profile; Viscosity","Acceleration; Argon; Computer simulation; Electric energy storage; Navier Stokes equations; Platinum; Velocity measurement; Viscosity; Boltzaman constant; Chemical interactions; Liquid temperature; Platinum surfaces; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7044229807

It is found that the crystal ice formed on the vertical plate is removed from the plate surface due to buoyancy force acting on the crystal ice. It is shown that the crystal ice formed on the vertical plate slides along the plate surface due to buoyancy force and the crystal ice grows in a shape of sheet by joining with the neighbor ice. The number of the removed ice per unit of time is, therefore, decreased as compared to that for the horizontal plate. It is found that the onset of ice removal condition is related to the heat fluxes from the plate surface to the plate and from the plate surface to the solution.

These various protein signals have been given the collective name 'adipocytokines' or 'adipokines'. However, since most are neither 'cytokines' nor 'cytokine-like', it is recommended that the term 'adipokine' be universally adopted to describe a protein that is secreted from (and synthesised by) adipocytes. It is suggested that the term is restricted to proteins secreted from adipocytes, excluding signals released only by the other cell types (such as macrophages) in adipose tissue. The adipokinome (which together with lipid moieties released, such as fatty acids and prostaglandins, constitute the secretome of fat cells) includes proteins involved in lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, the alternative complement system, vascular haemostasis, blood pressure regulation and angiogenesis, as well as the regulation of energy balance. In addition, there is a growing list of adipokines involved in inflammation (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, transforming growth factor-β, nerve growth factor) and the acute-phase response (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A). Production of these proteins by adipose tissue is increased in obesity, and raised circulating levels of several acute-phase proteins and inflammatory cytokines has led to the view that the obese are characterised by a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, and that this links causally to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. It is, however, unclear as to the extent to which adipose tissue contributes quantitatively to the elevated circulating levels of these factors in obesity and whether there is a generalised or local state of inflammation. The parsimonious view is that the increased production of inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins by adipose tissue in obesity relates primarily to localised events within the expanding fat depots. It is suggested that these events reflect hypoxia in parts of the growing adipose tissue mass in advance of angiogenesis, and involve the key controller of the cellular response to hypoxia, the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1. © The Authors 2004.","Acute phase proteins; Adipokines; Cytokines; Hypoxia; Inflammation; Obesity; White adipose tissue","acute phase protein; adipocytokine; adiponectin; amyloid A protein; cell protein; cytokine; fatty acid; haptoglobin; hypoxia inducible factor 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; leptin; lipid; nerve growth factor; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; prostaglandin; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; acute phase protein; cytokine; protein; acute phase response; adipocyte; angiogenesis; article; blood pressure regulation; cell type; complement system; cytokine production; endocrine function; energy balance; hemostasis; hormone release; hypoxia; inflammation; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; macrophage; metabolic syndrome X; obesity; parsimony analysis; protein secretion; protein synthesis; signal transduction; white adipose tissue; adipose tissue; anoxia; human; metabolism; nomenclature; obesity; review; Acute-Phase Proteins; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Anoxia; Cytokines; Humans; Inflammation; Obesity; Proteins; Terminology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6944237757

A diet containing caprylic, capric, lauric, and myristic acid was used as a reference diet and a diet with 4% conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) was used as a positive control as it is known to effectively lower body fat in mice. The diets were fed for 35 d. Body fat was significantly lower in the CLA group than in the other groups but was not significantly different among the non-CLA groups. Among the non-CLA groups, the linoleic acid group tended to have the highest and the α-linolenic acid group the lowest proportion of body fat. In energy-balance studies, the percentage of energy intake that was stored in the body was significantly lower in the CLA group compared with the other dietary groups. The percentage of energy intake eliminated in excreta was highest in the stearic acid group followed by the γ-linolenic acid group. These results were reflected in apparent fat digestibility, which was lowest in the stearic acid group. The percentage of energy intake expended as heat was highest in the CLA-fed mice.

Such variation is important as it generates spatial variation in selection for traits related to plant-herbivore interaction. Littoral macroalgae are known to respond plastically to environmental variation by modifying their chemistry or morphology. We studied geographic variation in phlorotannin, nitrogen, protein, and sugar (fucose, mannitol, and melibiose) concentrations of the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus at 12 sites separated by 0.5 to 40 km in the naturally fragmented Archipelago Sea in the northern Baltic Sea. By this regional variation in algal chemistry we attempted to explain among-population variation in size and fecundity of the crustacean herbivore Idotea baltica. We observed high spatial variation in all the measured chemical characteristics of F. vesiculosus, as well as in female size and the number of eggs produced by the herbivores. Spatial variation in nitrogen or protein contents of the alga did not explain the variation of herbivore traits. However, egg size positively covaried with spatial variation in the concentration of mannitol, the major storage carbohydrate of the alga. Such a positive relationship may arise if I. baltica can utilize the nutritive value of a mannitol-rich diet thereby being better able to provision the developing eggs with energy-rich metabolites. Unexpectedly, the concentration of phlorotannins, secondary metabolites having a putative role in defense against herbivory, positively covaried with the size of the herbivore. Among-population variation in host plant chemistry and covariation of that with herbivore growth and reproduction imply that herbivores respond to the local quality of their host plants, and that geographical structuring of populations has to be taken into account in studies of plant-herbivore interactions. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"alga; fecundity; growth; host quality; plant-herbivore interaction; spatial variation; Archipelago Sea; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; algae; Crustacea; Fucus; Fucus vesiculosus; Idotea; Idotea baltica; Isopoda; Phaeophyceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6344243619

We have combined physiological, behavioural and genetic approaches to test whether elastic energy storage makes a major contribution to jumping in Drosophila. We describe a sensitive strain gauge setup, which measures the forces produced by tethered flies through their mesothoracic legs. The peak force produced by the main jumping muscle of female flies from a wild-type (Canton-S) strain is 101±4.4 μN [and this is indistinguishable from a second wild-type (Texas) strain]. The force takes 8.2 ms to reach its peak. The peak force is not affected significantly by altering the leg angle (femur-tibia joint angle) in the range of 75-120°, but the peak force declines as the leg is extended further. Measurements of jumping ability (distance jumped) showed that female Drosophila (with their wings removed) of two wild-type strains, Canton-S and Texas, produced jumps of 28.6±0.7 and 30.2±1.0 mm (mean ± S.E.M.). For a female wild-type Drosophila, a jump of 30 mm corresponds to a kinetic energy of 200 nJ on take-off (allowing 20% of the energy to overcome air resistance). We develop equations of motion for a linear force-time model of take-off and calculate that the time to take-off is 5.0 ms and the peak force should be 274 μN (137 μN leg-1). We predicted, from the role of octopamine in enhancing muscle tension in several locust muscles, that if stored elastic energy plays no part in force development, then genetic manipulation of the octopaminergic system would directly affect force production and jumping in Drosophila. Using two mutants deficient in the octopaminergic system, TbhnM18 (M18) and TyrRhono (hono), we found significantly reduced jumping distances (20.7±0.7 and 20.7±0.4 mm, respectively) and force production (52% and 55%, respectively) compared with wild type. From the reduced distance and force production in M18, a mutant deficient in octopamine synthesis, and in hono, a tyramine/octopamine receptor mutant, we conclude that in Drosophila, as in locusts, octopamine modulates escape jumping. We conclude that the fly does not need to store large quantities of elastic energy in order to make its jump because (1) the measured and calculated forces agree to within 40% and (2) the reduction in distances jumped by the mutants correlates well with their reduction in measured peak force.","Biomechanics; Drosophila; hono; Jumping; M18; Octopamine; Tergal depressor of trochanter; Tergotrochanteral muscle; Tyramine","octopamine; animal; article; biological model; biomechanics; comparative study; Drosophila melanogaster; electrostimulation; female; genetics; locomotion; metabolism; physiology; skeletal muscle; Animals; Biomechanics; Drosophila melanogaster; Electric Stimulation; Female; Locomotion; Models, Biological; Muscle, Skeletal; Octopamine; Drosophila melanogaster; Hexapoda; Insecta; Melanogaster; Orthoptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6344237381

We define an order parameter and we show the existence of a critical density. This model is the closed version of the deterministic BTW model and belongs to the ""Fixed Energy Sandpiles"" class. An algorithm identifying the periodic states of the system permits us to have a good estimation of the order parameter, which is free from transient effects. The universality of the model with respect to two different forms of oriented flows is studied and compared with that of the isotropic now. We find two universality classes characterized by different critical exponents. The Manhattan flow appears to belong to the same universality class as the isotropic flow. However, the directed flow gives a completely different critical behavior. The complexity of the model for densities larger than the critical is also studied. It is observed that, both the Manhattan model and the isotropic model have an interesting structure characterized by several plateaus. The right edges of these plateaus are characterized by a sudden increase of the order parameter, giving rise to new critical points. The directed flow model has a simple structure without plateaus.","Critical Phenomena; Self-organization; Universality","Algorithms; Boundary conditions; Mathematical models; Problem solving; Critical phenomena; Deterministic dynamics (BTW); Self-organization; Universality; Self organizing storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4944223161

Efforts have been made to convert the oil sludge into available resources such as lower molecular weight organic compounds and carbonaceous residues. In this study, the oil sludge from the oil storage tank of a typical petroleum refinery plant located in northern Taiwan is used as the raw material of thermal treatment using oxygen-containing gas. The treatment of oil sludge is conducted by the use of carrier gas with different concentrations of oxygen (4.83, 8.62, 12.35, and 20.95 vol % O2) in the temperature range of 380-1123 K and at various constant heating rates of 5.2, 12.8, and 21.8 K/min. The significant reactions occur in the range 415-931 K. Below a temperature of 613 K, pyrolysis reactions are predominant. Including the pyrolysis reactions, the overall oxidative thermal decomposition of oil sludge can be adequately described by a five-parallel-reaction model. The activation energies (E), reaction orders (n for residual solid and m for oxygen) and frequency factors (A) of corresponding five-parallel-reaction model for oil sludge are 69.93, 93.79, 123.22, 208.67, and 120.87 kJ/mol of E, 2.94, 2.42, 1.24, 2.91, and 1.36 of n, 0, 0, 0, 2, and 0.32 of m, and 7.69 × 105, 9.09 × 106, 2.95 × 108, 1.66 × 1017, and 9.45 × 107 1/min of A, respectively.

The abstraction level aimed for, however, may be too high to yield meaningful results. Many of the experiments on which evidence in favour or otherwise are based are artificial and do not support the bold generalisations to other spatial and temporal scales that are often made. Future investigations should utilise co-evolved communities, be structured to investigate the distinct roles of clearly defined functional groups, separate the effects of between- and within-group diversity and be conducted over a range of stress and disturbance situations. An integral part of agricultural intensification at the plot level is the deliberate reduction of diversity. This does not necessarily result in impairment of ecosystem services of direct relevance to the land user unless the hypothesised diversity-function threshold is breached by elimination of a key functional group or species. Key functions may also be substituted with petro-chemical energy in order to achieve perceived efficiencies in the production of specific goods. This can result in the maintenance of ecosystem services of importance to agricultural production at levels of biodiversity below the assumed 'functional threshold'. However, it can also result in impairment of other services and under some conditions the de-linking of the diversity-function relationship. Avoidance of these effects or attempts to restore non-essential ecosystem services are only likely to be made by land users at the plot scale if direct economic benefit can be thereby achieved. At the plot and farm scales biodiversity is unlikely to be maintained for purposes other than those of direct use or 'utilitarian' benefits and often at levels lower than those necessary for maintenance of many ecosystem services. The exceptions may be traditional systems where intrinsic values (social customs) continue to provide reasons for diversity maintenance. High levels of biodiversity in managed landscapes are more likely to be maintained for reasons of intrinsic, serependic ('option' or 'bequest') values or utilitarian ('direct use') than for functional or ecosystem service values. The major opportunity for both maintaining ecosystem services and biodiversity outside conservation areas lies in promoting diversity of land-use at the landscape and farm rather than field scale. This requires, however, an economic and policy climate that favours diversification in land uses and diversity among land users. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural landscapes; Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Functional groups; Resilience","agricultural land; biodiversity; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; strategic approach",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4744341462

This paper describes a transformer design that uses the coaxial screen as primary winding and the inner conductor as secondary. An advantage of transmission line transformers is that the insulation problem is solved and the construction can be kept simple; the coupling between the primary and secondary coils is high even though the transformer uses an air core. The air core brings another advantage: the capacity to store large quantities of magnetic energy. The combination of a high coupling factor and large energy storage capacity makes this transformer ideal for charging high-voltage capacitors fast. The winding type for the transformer is alternating Archimedean spirals. Here, we present a magnetic field analysis of the transformer's primary, secondary, and mutual inductance using a finite-element solver. We compare the measured magnetic flux density versus the calculated value. The step-up winding ratio of the transformer influences the coupling factor marginally if the construction has an even number of spiral layers for each set of windings. However, the result from the finite-element solver predicts a drop in coupling factor if the step-up transformer construction has an odd number of spiral layers. The copper conductors used in the transformer resemble isotropic copper pipes.","Air core; Coupling factor; Finite-element method (FEM); Transformer; Transmission line","Capacitors; Coaxial cables; Coupled circuits; Electric coils; Electric lines; Electric potential; Finite element method; Inductance; Winding; Air core; Coupling factor; Spiral layers; Step-up transformer; Electric transformers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644264954

The partitioning is analysed together with long-term data to evaluate the magnitude of the urban flux density modification, and to document characteristic values in their diurnal and yearly course. Simple empirical relations between flux densities and surface characteristics are presented. The energy balance partitioning is addressed separately for daytime and nocturnal situations. All four components of the surface radiation budget are analysed. Moreover, the vertical flux density divergences within the urban canopy layer are discussed. © 2004 Royal Meteorological Society.","Albedo, urban-rural differences; Eddy correlation; Storage heat flux; Turbulent flux densities; Urban energy balance; Urban radiation balance; Vertical flux density divergence","Data acquisition; Fluxes; Radiation; Rural areas; Surface properties; Turbulent flow; Urban planning; Micrometeorlogical stations; Surface radiations; Urban surfaces; Energy resources; albedo; boundary layer; diurnal variation; energy balance; radiation balance; urban area; Basel-Stadt; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544344425

We present a 2D lossy seismic data compression algorithm, based on sub-band coding, and we focus on adaptation and optimization of the method for common-offset gathers. The sub-band coding algorithm consists of five stages: first, a preprocessing phase using an automatic gain control to decrease the non-stationary behaviour of seismic data; second, a decorrelation stage using a uniform analysis filter bank to concentrate the energy of seismic data into a minimum number of sub-bands; third, an iterative classification algorithm, based on an estimation of variances of blocks of sub-band samples, to classify the sub-band samples into a fixed number of classes with approximately the same statistics; fourth, a quantization step using a uniform scalar quantizer, which gives an approximation of the sub-band samples to allow for high compression ratios; and fifth, an entropy coding stage using a fixed number of arithmetic encoders matched to the corresponding statistics of the classified and quantized sub-band samples to achieve compression. Decompression basically performs the opposite operations in reverse order. We compare the proposed algorithm with three other seismic data compression algorithms. The high performance of our optimized sub-band coding method is supported by objective and subjective results. © 2004 European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.",,"Data sets; Decompression; Seismic data; Storage media; Algorithms; Approximation theory; Data acquisition; Encoding (symbols); Optimization; Parameter estimation; Data compression; data processing; optimization; seismic data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444339913

TES is considered to be one of the most preferred demand side management technologies for shifting cooling electrical demand from peak daytime hours to off peak night hours. TES is incorporated into the conventional HVAC system to store cooling capacity by chilling ethylene glycol, which is used as a storage medium. The thermodynamic performance is assessed using exergy and energy analyses. The effects of various parameters such as ambient temperature, cooling load, and mass of storage are studied on the performance of the TES. A full storage cycle, with charging, storing and discharging stages, is considered. In addition, energy and exergy analysis of the TES is carried out for system design and optimization. The temperature in the storage is found to be as low as 6.4°C after 1 day of charging without load for a mass of 250 000 kg. It is found that COP of the HVAC system increases with the decrease of storage temperature. Energy efficiency of the TES is found to be 80% for all the mass flow rate of the discharging fluid, whereas exergy efficiency varies from 14 to 0.5%. This is in fact due to the irreversibilities in a TES process destroy a significant amount of the input exergy, and the TES exergy efficiencies therefore become always lower than the corresponding energy efficiencies. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Air-conditioning system; Energy and exergy efficiency; Performance evaluation; Thermal energy storage","Discharging fluids; Management technologies; Thermal energy transfer (TES); Air conditioning; Energy efficiency; Fluid dynamics; Heating; Temperature; Ventilation; Energy storage; air conditioning; energy efficiency; feasibility study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444312096

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low carbohydrate diet on glucose and lipid metabolism, especially on visceral fat accumulation, and comparing that of a high carbohydrate diet. Obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to take a low calorie and low carbohydrate diet (n=11, 1000 kcal per day, protein:carbohydrate:fat=25:40:35) or a low calorie and high carbohydrate diet (n=11, 1000 kcal per day, protein:carbohydrate:fat= 25:65:10) for 4 weeks. Similar decreases in body weight and serum glucose levels were observed in both groups. Fasting serum insulin levels were reduced in the low carbohydrate diet group compared to the high carbohydrate diet group (-30% versus -10%, P&lt;0.05). Total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels decreased in both groups, but were not significantly different from each other. High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) increased in the low carbohydrate diet group but not in the high carbohydrate diet group (+15% versus 0%, P&lt;0.01). There was a larger decrease in visceral fat area measured by computed tomography in the low carbohydrate diet group compared to the high carbohydrate diet group (-40 cm2 versus -10 cm2, P&lt;0.05). The ratio of visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area did not change in the high carbohydrate diet group (from 0.70 to 0.68), but it decreased significantly in the low carbohydrate diet group (from 0.69 to 0.47, P&lt;0.05). These results suggest that, when restrict diet was made isocaloric, a low calorie/low carbohydrate diet might be more effective treatment for a reduction of visceral fat, improved insulin sensitivity and increased in HDL-C levels than low calorie/high carbohydrate diet in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This paper presents results on the effects of two well-known and widely used dopants in gold ball-bonding wire, Ca and Pd, the objective being to move towards a better understanding of the solid-state mechanisms by which these dopants affect wire properties. Ternary micro-alloys of high purity 4N gold with Ca and Pd were drawn into 25-μm-diameter wires without annealing in order to examine the effects of the dopants on the mechanical properties and stored mechanical energy in the wires. The stored energy of the wires increased with Ca content but Pd had a negligible effect. The break load and percentage elongation of the wires increased with Ca but Pd had no significant effect. Various mechanisms, including grain boundary segregation and dislocation loop generation are postulated to account for the change in wire properties due to Ca. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, they have a few drawbacks which limit their performance. In this paper, we identify some of these problems and propose efficient solutions to get around them. The widely-used gradient magnitude-based energy is parameter dependent; its use will negatively affect the parametrization of the curve and, consequently, its stiffness. Hence, we introduce a new edge-based energy that is independent of the parameterization. It is also more robust since it takes into account the gradient direction as well. We express this energy term as a surface integral, thus unifying it naturally with the region-based schemes. The unified framework enables the user to tune the image energy to the application at hand. We show that parametric snakes can guarantee low curvature curves, but only if they are described in the curvilinear abscissa. Since normal curve evolution do not ensure constant arc-length, we propose a new internal energy term that will force this configuration. The curve evolution can sometimes give rise to closed loops in the contour, which will adversely interfere with the optimization algorithm. We propose a curve evolution scheme that prevents this condition. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Computational complexity; Edge detection; Fourier transforms; Gradient methods; Integral equations; Mathematical models; Optimization; Partial differential equations; Probability distributions; Problem solving; Vectors; Active contour; Image energy; Parametric active contour models; Surface integral; Image segmentation; algorithm; article; automated pattern recognition; cluster analysis; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; corpus callosum; evaluation; histology; human; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; statistical model; validation study; Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Computer Simulation; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344607611

Chem. and Pathobiochem., Central Laboratory, University Hospital Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Background: Recent studies point to the adipose tissue as a highly active endocrine organ secreting a range of hormones. Leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, and resistin are considered to take part in the regulation of energy metabolism. Approach: This review summarizes recent knowledge on leptin and its receptor and on ghrelin, adiponectin, and resistin, and emphasizes their roles in pathobiochemistry and clinical chemistry. Content: Leptin, adiponectin, and resistin are produced by the adipose tissue. The protein leptin, a satiety hormone, regulates appetite and energy balance of the body. Adiponectin could suppress the development of atherosclerosis and liver fibrosis and might play a role as an antiinflammatory hormone. Increased resistin concentrations might cause insulin resistance and thus could link obesity with type II diabetes. Ghrelin is produced in the stomach. In addition to its role in long-term regulation of energy metabolism, it is involved in the short-term regulation of feeding. These hormones have important roles in energy homeostasis, glucose and lipid metabolism, reproduction, cardiovascular function, and immunity.

Rodent SB was flushed vascularly with UW solution and flushed luminally as follows: Group 1 (control) - no luminal flush, stored in UW; Group 2 - luminal UW solution, stored in PFC; Group 3 - luminal amino-acid (AA) solution, stored in PFC; and Group 4 - luminal AA solution, stored in AA solution. Energetics, histology and mucosal function/electrophysiology were assessed over 24 h at 4 °C. ATP was consistently greater in Groups 2-4 than in the Control Group. Groups 3 and 4 exhibited significantly greater ATP, ATP/ADP ratios and energy charge levels after 12-h storage than in the other Groups. Histologic injury was generally lower in the AA-treated tissues (Groups 3 and 4); after 24 h, only minor epithelial clefting (Park's median grade 2) was present in Group 4; and consistent transmural infarction (grade 8) was evident in Groups 1 and 2. Combined treatment with luminal amino acid solution and oxygenated storage solution (PFC or AA solution) significantly improves energetics and mucosal function. This strategy may have implications for successful SB preservation in the clinic.","Cavitary two-layer method; Intestinal transplantation; Nutrient-rich solution; Perfluorocarbon; Small bowel preservation; University of Wisconsin solution","adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; amino acid; fluorocarbon; University of Wisconsin solution; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; cryopreservation; electrophysiology; energy transfer; graft preservation; histology; intestine infarction; intestine injury; intestine mucosa; intestine transplantation; male; nonhuman; nutrient solution; priority journal; rat; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Monophosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Ileum; Intestinal Mucosa; Intestine, Small; Male; Membrane Potentials; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344602704

The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style ""push-relabel"" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style ""augmenting paths."" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible.

In the terminal small-frequency zone the storage modulus scale as G′ ∼ ω2, and the loss modulus as G″ ∼ ω, typical of viscous fluids. Comparisons between steady and oscillatory Poiseuille flow shows that the Cox-Merz rule is not obeyed, but that as expected the steady and complex viscosities in the terminal zone are identical.

As fruit browned, membrane permeability increased gradually, while ATP content and energy charge decreased rapidly. Exposure to pure O2 significantly prevented peel browning, maintained high levels of ATP, ADP and energy charge, and reduced increase in membrane permeability of peel tissue of litchi fruit after 4 days of storage.

For physical systems a natural candidate storage function is the difference between the stored and the supplied energies - leading to the so-called energy-balancing control, whose underlying stabilization mechanism is particularly appealing. Unfortunately, energy-balancing stabilization is stymied by the existence of pervasive dissipation, that appears in many engineering applications. To overcome the dissipation obstacle the method of Interconnection and Damping Assignment, that endows the closed-loop system with a special - port-controlled Hamiltonian - structure, has been proposed. If, as in most practical examples, the open-loop system already has this structure, and the damping is not pervasive, both methods are equivalent. In this brief note we show that the methods are also equivalent, with an alternative definition of the supplied energy, when the damping is pervasive.

The effects of relative humidity, storage time, PCL content, and type and content of added plasticizer (e.g. glycerol, urea, or ammonium chloride) on moisture and water absorption, mechanical properties, and enzymatic degradability of the as-prepared foams were investigated. In all the conditions investigated, the ultimate tensile strength was a maximum when the relative humidity was 42% RH (for a fixed storage time of 7 days) and when the storage time was 2 days (for a fixed relative humidity of 42% RH). Addition of PCL helped improve the ultimate tensile strength and the percentage of elongation at break of the hybrid foams. Resistance to water absorption of the starch/PCL hybrid foams was superior to that of pure starch foams. Lastly, enzymatic degradation tests in an α-amylase solution showed that addition of PCL improved enzymatic degradability of the hybrid foams. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, those merits also raise critical problems on data retention and disturbance problems. Both problems are related to the sensitivity of the tunnel barrier on the applied field. When the field-sensitivity of the tunnel barrier becomes larger, both problems can be solved. One method is to increase the field-sensitivity of the tunnel barrier without increasing the operation voltage, which is profiling the band structure of the tunnel barrier. For example, barrier structure with a high bandgap sandwiched by two small bandgap dielectrics is a feasible one. We tried Si 3N4/SiO2/Si3N4 barrier structure and observed the enhancement of the field sensitivity. In the experiment on the discharging kinetics, we could confirm the model of deep level charge storage. Moreover, it is related to the material that interfaces Si nanocrystals. The depth of energy level is higher when it is Si 3N4 or amorphous carbon than when it is SiO2. Therefore, the choice of interface material on the dot surface should be considered based on the deep level formation for retention improvement. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The contact resistance at the active material-graphite interface is much lower than that at the active material-stainless steel (SS) mesh interface. Thin films of gold plus RuO x·nH2O deposited on SS meshes (RuO x/Au/SS) are found to greatly improve the poor contact between SS meshes and electrode materials. The maximum specific capacitance (C S,RuOx) of RuOx·nH2O, 1580Fg-1 (measured at 1mVs-1), very close to the theoretic value, was obtained from an AC-RuOx/RuOx/Au/SS electrode with 10wt.% sol-gel-derived RuOx·nH2O annealed in air at 200°C for 2h. The highly electrochemical reversibility, high-power characteristics, good stability, and improved frequency response of this AC-RuOx/RuOx/Au/SS electrode demonstrate its promising application potential in supercapacitors.

X-ray diffraction analysis shows that partial substitution of Zr by Y or La induces an increase in the unit-cell parameters of the alloy, while Nb has the opposite effect. X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements show no variation in the energy and occupation of the 3d electronic levels of the Ni atoms, a decrease in the empty 3d density of states for Mn, and an increase for V, compared to the corresponding pure elements. In all cases, replacement of Zr resulted in a decrease of the maximum electrochemical charge storage capacity, but for Y and La the alloy activation time and the hydrogen equilibrium pressure are reduced. It is also seen that, within the experimental error, the activation energy of the charge transfer step of the hydriding/dehydriding process is independent of the alloy composition, meaning that the reaction kinetics is not substantially affected by Zr substitution. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

It has been suggested that the increase in the unit cell volume results in increase of interstitial hole sizes. This induces higher number of interstitials in unit cell of the material MmNi4.6Fe0.4 to be occupied by hydrogen atoms resulting in increase of hydrogen storage capacity from its value of ∼1.5 wt% obtained in the as-synthesized material to ∼2.04 wt% for ball-milled materials which embody strained particles. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of mononuclear aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, p-xylene, mesitylene and the polynuclear aromatics naphthalene, anthracene and fullerene C60, chemisorbed on silica-supported platinum have been investigated by infrared spectroscopy. The complexes of these compounds with platinum can be easily both hydrogenated under relatively low hydrogen pressures, less than 1 bar, and dehydrogenated by evacuation even at ambient temperatures. The complexes of these compounds with Pt are rather stable and can gain and lose hydrogen many times. The complexes of the methyl-substituted benzenes, polyaromatic compounds, and fullerene C 60 with Pt are more thermostable and are retained at higher temperatures, at least at 323-373 K. Such complexes can be hydrogenated and dehydrogenated many times at these temperatures. Evidence in the literature suggests that chemisorbed complexes of long-chain alkenes or alkynes with metals show similar properties on hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Batteries specified especially for use in PV systems have to be distinguished with standing of very deep discharge rate and high cycling stability. Ordinary batteries being marketed world wide for use in automobile, are mostly not appropriate for PV power systems. The most important characteristics of lead-acid batteries are presented and discussed in this paper. Moreover, the paper illustrates an experimental procedure for developing an algorithm for determining the ampere-hour capacity of batteries operating in PV systems.

There are several (long-recognised) possibilities ahead including compressed air, pumped storage, further developments in batteries, regenerable fuel cells, 'super-capacitors' and so forth. But one that is being revisited extensively by industry and research establishments is the production and storage of hydrogen from electricity at off-peak times, and in times when there would be a surplus of renewable energy, for reuse in the electricity, gas and transport markets; short-term and even seasonal and longer-term storage is technically feasible with this option. This paper looks at the costs of the option both in the near-term and the long-term relative to the current costs of electricity and natural gas supplies. While the costs of hydrogen would necessarily be greater than those of natural gas (though not disruptively so), when used in conjunction with emerging technologies for decentralised generation and combined heat and power there is scope for appreciable economies in electricity supply. A lot will depend on innovation at the systems level, and on how we operate our electricity and gas grids and regulate our electricity and gas industries. We have also suggested that we now need to experiment more, at the commercial level, and in the laboratories, with the hydrogen option. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Ionizing radiation effects can be broadly divided in two classes: total ionizing dose (progressive buildup of defects) and single event effects (macroscopic result of a single microscopic event). In both cases, ionizing radiation can lead to severe degradation of device performance, possibly resulting in device failure. This work is a review of literature results concerning both classes of ionizing radiation-related phenomena on floating gate memories. Regardless of its nature, ionizing radiation impacts two aspects of the performance and reliability of floating gate memories: the functionality and the adherence to specifications of the control circuitry, and the degradation of stored information in the array itself.","MOS memory integrated circuits; Radiation effects; Semiconductor device reliability","Data storage equipment; Electron energy levels; Integrated circuits; MOS devices; Photons; Radiation effects; Reliability; Semiconductor devices; Silica; Floating gate memories; Ionizing radiation effects; MOS memory integrated circuits; Semiconductor device reliability; Ionizing radiation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144228941

The yttrium-doping with long needle-like nanocrystallites observed by TEM promoted the formation of the spherical nickel hydroxide with the larger diameter of about 5μm. The discharge capacity of the yttrium-doped spherical nickel hydroxide was measured to be slightly lower than that of the regular spherical nickel hydroxide at room temperature. At temperatures of above 50°C, however, the discharge capacity of the yttrium-doped nickel hydroxide is much higher than that of the regular spherical nickel hydroxide. The improvement of discharge capacity at elevated temperatures was contributed to the increase of the charge acceptance of yttrium-doped nickel hydroxide. The formation of an yttrium-rich surface layer on nickel hydroxide particles raised the oxygen evolution over-potential, leading to performance improvements of the nickel hydroxide electrode. The improvement of high temperature charge acceptance of yttrium-doped nickel hydroxide remarkably contributed to the high temperature charge-discharge efficiency of the nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries with a commercial AAA size. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Rev. Lett. 79 2811) of longitudinal solitary structures superimposed on coasting beams, as has been seen recently in experiments, is evaluated in the zero-resistance limit to get new insight into the (de)focusing properties of wall impedances. It is found that the standard picture on (de)focusing, according to which a space-charge-dominated impedance is defocusing if the beam is below transition energy, as an example, does not always hold. Namely, this property (and picture), which can already be obtained by a simple waterbag model, remains true only when L &lt; Lc, where L is the wall inductance per unit length and Lc is given by L c = μ0/4πβ2γ2. For L &gt; Lc, however, just the opposite (de)focusing property holds. Responsible for this new feature for coasting beams are wake-fields which are taken into account in a next-order self-consistent perturbation theory.

Thirty-one mice were used in this study. Twenty-four mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HF: 40% of calories from fat) for 4 weeks and then classified as the DIO (n=8) or DR (n=8) mice according to the highest and lowest body weight (BW) gainers. Seven mice were placed on a low-fat diet (LF: 10% of calories from fat) and were used as controls. After 20 weeks of feeding, the visceral fat accumulation was 620±42 mg in the DIO group versus 198±89 mg in the DR and 84±18 mg in the LF groups. Using quantitative in situ hybridization techniques, levels of 2A and 2C serotonin (5-HT) receptor mRNAs were measured in multiple brain sections of mice from the three groups. Most regions did not differ between groups but, importantly, the DIO mice had a significantly higher level of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA expression in the olfactory nucleus (Olf) compared to the DR and LF mice (+30% and +37%, respectively). The levels of Olf 5-HT2A receptor mRNA expression were related to body fat mass. The level of 5-HT 2C mRNA receptor expression in the ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) nucleus was 40% higher in the DIO mice than in the LF mice. Furthermore, the 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expression in the posterodorsal part of the medial amygdaloid (MePD) nucleus was 25% higher in the DIO mice than in the DR mice. The level of VMH 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expression was correlated with body fat mass. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated differentially regulated levels of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expressions in the specific brain regions of the DIO and DR mice. It provides neural anatomical bases that the 5-HT2C receptors positively influence satiety center (VMH) while the 5-HT2A receptor regulates olfactory sensory effects. The findings also assist us to understand the role of these receptors in mice susceptible or resistant to diet-induced obesity. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The authors found that the SrBPO5:Ce3+ phosphor shows photostimulated luminescence (PSL) by illumination with 635 nm laser light after neutron irradiation. The PSL yields of SrBPO5:Ce3+ phosphor were increased by adding SrF2. The red laser seemed to be efficient to produce PSL signal from the results of PSL excitation spectrum measurement. The PSL yields, per unit neutron fluence, of SrBPO5:Ce3+ + SrF2 sample were proportional to E-0.5, where E is neutron energy. The S γ/Sn ratio of the phosphor was one order of magnitude lower compared to that of a commercially available imaging plate, where Sγ and Sn are the gamma and neutron sensitivities, respectively. The low Sγ/Sn ratio indicates that the phosphor has good gamma-ray rejection characteristics as a neutron detector. The phosphor might be a candidate for a new neutron imaging plate having less gamma-ray sensitivity. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) measurements testify to the good stoichiometric homogeneity of Ce and Zr cations in the as-obtained Ce1-xZrxO2 products. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra exhibit that both surface and bulk ratios of Ce3+ to Ce4+ for the as-prepared Ce1-xZrxO2 nanocrystals increased with the zirconium content x. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns and Raman spectra demonstrate that the present Ce1-xZr xO2 samples were single-phase solid solutions with good structural homogeneity and high thermal stability up to 1273 K, and those with x = 0.4-0.6 retained a pseudocubic structure (t″ phase) due to the small crystallite size effect. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs reveal that the as-prepared CeO2-ZrO2 nanocrystals were highly crystallized with narrow size distribution. Nitrogen adsorption measurements show that the BET specific surface areas of the Ce 1-xZrxO2 powders were improved by the incorporation of ZrO2. The PXRD data and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images illuminate that the as-prepared and as-calcined Ce1-xZr xO2 (x = 0.4-0.6) powders kept a rather high strain level in the crystal lattice. The lattice strains in our Ce1-xZr xO2 catalysts show a linear relationship with their oxygen storage capacity (OSC) values. This linear correlation is explained on the basis of qualitative structural and defective analysis, and might find use in the screening and design of better-performing three-way catalysts (TWCs).

Glycogen is a very large branched glucose homopolymer containing about 90% α-1,4-glucosidic linkages and 10% α-1,6 linkages. Its synthesis and degradation constitute central pathways in the metabolism of living cells regulating a global carbon/energy buffer compartment. Glycogen biosynthesis involves the action of several enzymes among which glycogen synthase catalyzes the synthesis of the α-1,4-glucose backbone. We now report the first crystal structure of glycogen synthase in the presence and absence of adenosine diphosphate. The overall fold and the active site architecture of the protein are remarkably similar to those of glycogen phosphorylase, indicating a common catalytic mechanism and comparable substrate-binding properties. In contrast to glycogen phosphorylase, glycogen synthase has a much wider catalytic cleft, which is predicted to undergo an important interdomain 'closure' movement during the catalytic cycle. The structures also provide useful hints to shed light on the allosteric regulation mechanisms of yeast/mammalian glycogen synthases.","Glycogen; Glycosyltransferase; Starch 3D structure; X-ray crystallography","adenosine phosphate; glucan 1,4 alpha glucosidase; glycogen synthase; starch; article; catalysis; cell compartmentalization; crystal structure; enzyme active site; enzyme degradation; enzyme substrate; glucose transport; glucose utilization; glycogen metabolism; glycogen synthesis; priority journal; protein analysis; protein binding; protein folding; Adenosine Diphosphate; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Binding Sites; Catalysis; Crystallography, X-Ray; Glycogen; Glycogen Phosphorylase; Glycogen Synthase; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Rhizobium radiobacter; Sequence Alignment; Structural Homology, Protein; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444373841

Eighteen thermocouple wires are placed in the wax to provide a detailed measurement for the temperature field during energy storage and release. Measurements are made as a function of the flow direction, flow rate, and inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid. Results indicate that natural convection dominates the melting process for upward flow of the heat transfer fluid. On the other hand, the solidification process is dominated by conduction. During melting and upward flow of the HTF, the density difference of hotter and cooler molten wax layers initiates natural convection cells.

The climate conditioning system tested is composed of exchangers buried into a greenhouse and others suspended in its internal air. Water circulates in these exchangers in a hydraulic closed circuit. During the day, the suspended exchangers recover the energy in excess for the plant comfort. This recovered energy is stored into the greenhouse ground through the buried exchangers. During the night, thermal energy already stored is brought back by the suspended exchangers to heat the air in the greenhouse. A theoretical approach was elaborated to size thermal energy storage and restore system. The necessary exchange surfaces for the greenhouse conditioning depend on the required values of diurnal and nocturnal temperatures. The autonomous greenhouse conditioning was possible only for low temperatures. Temperatures of 20°C in the day and 12°C at night were reached in winter. More favorable temperatures for the plant growth of 25°C during the day and 18°C at night were reached during the other months. This conditioning system allowed a heat quantity extraction of 150 W.m-2/d. This energy quantity is sufficient to provide the needs of the tunnel greenhouse with polyethylene covers that is very common in Tunisia. The system cost is appropriate for agricultural applications.

The cost of distillate produced by evaporation is influenced both by capital investment and by the running costs of the plant. There is a trade-off between capital investment and operational cost whereby the higher the specific power consumption. SWS has developed an accurate optimization program which finds the most convenient balance between plant efficiency directly proportional to capital investment and running costs. The program operates for any required return on an investment from 1 to 7 years. The optimal point is, of course, influenced by market factors such as the price of energy (electrical, steam, fuel) and by applicable interest for the amortization of the investments. Therefore, the optimization is to be suited for the specific conditions for each project. The findings, however, are the significant savings can be achieved at any site or conditions through the proper identification and specification of the most convenient plant. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Such a coupling allows reducing the energy constraint linked to the production, defining an optimal storage capacity and cancelling the resource to complex classic systems of storage that increase the cost of m3 of water produced. This study allows the evaluation of the performances of the prototype and optimises its functioning in terms of energy availability.

In this study, β/β mice lived longer and had higher energy expenditure than their control littermates due to increased WAT energy oxidation. The WAT of β/β mice was enriched with metabolically active, thermogenic mitochondria known for energy burning. The β/β allele exerted its effect through the elevated expression of the G protein α stimulatory subunit (Gαs) in WAT.

Washington Luís, Km 235, CEP 13565-905, Sao Carlos, Sao Paulo, Brazil","The utilization of Mg in hydrogen storage applications has been hindered by its high sorption temperature and slow kinetics. Both nanocrystallization and addition of transition metal catalysts demonstrated to improve the hydrogen sorption kinetics of Mg. In this scenario, high energy ball milling has shown to be a suitable way for processing Mg based nanostructured material, especially when milling is carried out under a hydrogen atmosphere (reactive milling, RM), which provides a nanostructured and hydrogenated final product. In the present work, we investigated the structural evolution of Mg, Nb and a mixture of Mg-5at.%Nb processed by reactive milling by using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The dehydrogenation behavior was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the hydrogen content measured using a Leco determinator. It was found that Nb rapidly absorbs hydrogen, forming the NbH0.9 phase. On the other hand, Mg was only partially transformed into β-MgH2 and γ-MgH2 phases. The amount of non-reacted Mg apparently does not vary when the milling time increases from 25 to 48h. When Mg-5at.%Nb mixture was milled for 48h, almost all Mg and Nb were transformed into hydrides. Only a small amount of non-reacted Mg still remained in the sample. This result clearly shows the catalytic effect of Nb on the hydrogen sorption of Mg. Another remarkable feature observed is that Mg also contributed for the Nb hydrogenation as the NbH2 phase was detected in the composite, which does not happen when pure Nb was milled in the same conditions. The structural evolution of the Mg-Nb composite is discussed based on the results obtained when the milling time is increased and comparing these results with those obtained for the pure elements. The DSC thermograms revealed that both Mg and Mg-Nb samples presented lower dehydrogenation temperatures when compared with the polycrystalline Mg. The Mg-Nb nanocomposite showed the lowest desorption temperature (270°C) and fastest kinetics of hydrogen sorption. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The crosslinked polymers were prepared using two different techniques, i.e., peroxide crosslinking and silane-water crosslinking. In the former, the crosslinking reaction was conducted in a twin-screw extruder, in the presence of dicumylperoxide. In the latter, the polymer was first grafted with vinyl trimethoxysilane in the extruder and subsequently crosslinked with water. The paper aims at investigation of the differences between these two techniques, in terms of processing and product mechanical and thermal properties. The results showed that the silane-crosslinked polymers could be prepared with much higher gel contents than the peroxide-crosslinked samples. The silane-crosslinked polymers also retained the elastomeric characteristics of the pure polymer and showed remarkably higher extensibility, better thermal stability, and energy storage capacity.

If computer simulations enable the estimation of material properties prior to experiments, they will provide us with very effective tools for the development of new materials. We use molecular dynamics calculations to predict the melting points and latent heats of fusion, which are crucial thermal properties for evaluating the suitability of heat-storage materials. As the object of calculation, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was chosen, because polymer materials are effective in that they can be made to cover all temperature ranges by changing the molecular weight. The melting points were determined from the volume change, and the latent heats of fusion were determined from the internal energy. As for these calculations, it was ascertained that these thermal properties were suitable values in comparison with the results of actual calorimetry. From the comparative calculation of the polymer consistent force field (PCFF) and optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS) force field, it was shown that the intermolecular potential could be simplified. Moreover, the stability of the structural isomer of PVA and the state of the hydrogen bond were evaluated, because a strong intermolecular bond leads to structural stability and a high melting temperature.","Heat storage material; Hydrogen bond; Latent heat; Melting point; Molecular dynamics; Poly(vinyl alcohol); Structural isomer","Computer simulation; Hydrogen bonds; Isomers; Melting; Molecular dynamics; Molecular weight; Optimization; Thermodynamic properties; Heat storage materials; Heat storage technology; Latent heat; Melting point; Structural isomers; Polyvinyl alcohols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6344287627

The 1.54GeV S-band linac of the ATF was designed to accelerate a multi-bunch beam that consists of 20 bunches with 2.8 ns spacing. The multi-bunch beam with 2.0 ± 10 10 electrons/bunch has an energy deviation of about 8.5% at the end of the linac due to transient beam loading without ECS. The ATF linac is the injector of the ATF damping ring (DR), whose energy acceptance is ±0.5%. The beam loading compensation system is necessary in the ATF linac for the successful injection of multi-bunch into DR. The rf system of the linac consists of 8 regular rf units with the SLED system and 2 ECS rf units without the SLED system. The accelerating structures of the regular units are driven at 2856 MHz and the 2 ECS structures are operated with slightly different rf frequencies of 2856±4.327 MHz.

In this paper, first, considering the relative position of the photonic band gap (PBG) and two atomic levels split from the upper level of the atom used for the optical memory, we demonstrate that one of the split levels must be outside the PBG for quantum-information detection. In this case, the quantum state of the atom can be changed by moving the other split level, where the quantum information is maintained or emitted for the cases in which the split level is inside or outside the PBG, respectively. The emitted quantum information can be measured as spontaneous emissions by a photon detector. Next, we propose two methods of moving the split level: one is realized by applying a direct current (DC) field to the atom and the other is realized by changing the intensity of the control laser field. Furthermore, by evaluating the intensities of the DC and the control laser fields, we find that the quantum information can be measured using the fields on the millielectronvolt order. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Optical memory; Photonic band gap; Photonic crystal; Quantum information; Quantum optics","Atomic levels; Laser fields; Photonic band gap; Photonic crystals; Quantum computing; Quantum information detection; Three level atom; Atomic physics; Calculations; Crystal structure; Electric field effects; Energy gap; Information theory; Optical data storage; Photodetectors; Pumping (laser); Spontaneous emission; Quantum optics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444366341

As a consequence, end users have to master programming, understand complex frameworks and data storage details before achieving the physics goals. This reduces significantly the efficiency of the analysis process. In order to tackle this problem in analysis, we propose to introduce a new abstraction layer between the end users and the current interfaces. We go further in our approach by introducing Pheasant QL, the first proposal for a declarative domain-specific visual query language into this domain. Through our solution, we can express complex decay queries by means of visual operators with reduced programming efforts, abstracting the storage and optimization details, and reducing the need to deal with the normal analysis framework and physical storage intricacies.

In animals such as the sheep and pig in which fat is deposited before birth, leptin is synthesised in fetal adipose tissue and is present in the fetal circulation throughout late gestation. In the sheep a moderate increase or decrease in the level of maternal nutrition does not alter fetal plasma leptin concentrations, but there is evidence that chronic fetal hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia increase fetal fat mass and leptin synthesis within fetal fat depots. Importantly, there is a positive relationship between the relative mass of the 'unilocular' component of fetal perirenal and interscapular adipose tissue and circulating fetal leptin concentrations in the sheep. Thus, as in the neonate and adult, circulating leptin concentrations may be a signal of fat mass in fetal life. There is also evidence that leptin can act to regulate the lipid storage, leptin synthetic capacity and potential thermogenic functions of fat before birth. Thus, leptin may act as a signal of energy supply and have a 'lipostatic' role before birth. Future studies are clearly required to determine whether the intrauterine and early postnatal nutrient environment programme the endocrine feedback loop between adipose tissue and the central and peripheral neuroendocrine systems that regulate energy balance, resulting in an enhanced risk of obesity in adult life.","Adiposity; Fetal Nutrition; Fetus; Leptin; Obesity","leptin; adipose tissue; adult; body fat; chronic disease; conference paper; energy balance; exposure; feedback system; fetus; human; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; lipid storage; maternal nutrition; neuroendocrine system; newborn; nonhuman; nutrition; obesity; perinatal period; prenatal period; protein blood level; protein secretion; protein synthesis; regulatory mechanism; risk assessment; sheep; swine; thermogenesis; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Birth Weight; Embryonic and Fetal Development; Energy Metabolism; Female; Fetus; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Leptin; Male; Maternal Nutrition Physiology; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Pregnancy; Prenatal Nutrition Physiology; Sheep; Swine; Animalia; Ovis aries; Sus scrofa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344650450

Experiments, especially with ATR 4, which produces a molar hydrogen stream equivalent to an electrical power in the fuel cell of 3 kWel, showed that the process should be preferably run in the temperature range between 700°C and 850°C This ensures complete hydrocarbon conversion and avoids the formation of considerable amounts of methane and organic compounds in the product water. Experiments with commercial diesel showed promising results but insufficient long-term stability. Experiments concerning the ignition of the catalytic reaction inside the reformer proved that within 60 s after the addition of water and hydrocarbons the reformer reached 95% of its maximum molar hydrogen flow. Measurements, with respect to reformer start-up, showed that it takes approximately 7 min. to heat up the monolith to a temperature of 340°C using an external heating device.

The aim of this intervention study was to explore the extent to which the fat mass status and the macronutrient composition of an acute dietary intake influence substrate oxidation rates. Methods: Fuel utilisation in 26 women, 14 obese (BMI=37.1±1.1/m2) and 12 lean (BMI=20.6±0.5kg/m2) was measured over 6 h to compare the metabolic effect of a single balanced protein (HC) meal and a high protein (HP) single meal, which were designed to supply similar energy contents (1672 kJ). The macronutrient composition as a percentage of energy of the HC meal was 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein and 30% fat, while the HP meal contained 40% carbohydrate, 30% protein and 30% fat. Nutrient oxidation rates and energy expenditure were calculated by indirect calorimetry (hood system), whereas exogenous amino acid oxidation was estimated from the 13C isotopic enrichment of breath after oral administration of l[1-13C]leucine. Results: Fasting lipid oxidation was higher in the obese than in the lean women (P&lt;0.05), and it was significantly correlated with body fatness (P&lt;0.01). A single HP meal consumption produced higher postprandial fat oxidation as compared with HC meal intake (P&lt;0.02), in both obese and lean subjects, with no apparent changes in glucose oxidation rates. Furthermore, postprandial fat utilisation after the test meal intake was higher in obese than in the lean women (P&lt;0.01). The time course of 13CO2 in breath followed a similar pattern in both dietary groups, although a non-statistically significant higher trend in protein and 13C-leucine oxidation was found in the HP group. Conclusions: Net lipid oxidation depends on both short-term dietary composition intake and fat body mass, being significantly higher after a relatively high protein meal as compared to a balanced diet intake and in obese women as compared to lean controls. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

These registrations can be automatic, or based on the interpolation of a set of user-defined landmarks, but in both cases, quantifying the normal and abnormal structural variation across the group of imaged structures implies analysis of the set of deformation fields. We contend that the choice of representation of the deformation fields is an integral part of this analysis. This paper presents methods for constructing a general class of multi-dimensional diffeomorphic representations of deformations. We demonstrate, for the particular case of the polyharmonic clamped-plate splines, that these representations are suitable for the description of deformations of medical images in both two and three dimensions, using a set of two-dimensional annotated MRI brain slices and a set of three-dimensional segmented hippocampi with optimized correspondences. The class of diffeomorphic representations also defines a non-Euclidean metric on the space of patterns, and, for the case of compactly supported deformations, on the corresponding diffeomorphism group. In an experimental study, we show that this non-Euclidean metric is superior to the usual ad hoc Euclidean metrics in that it enables more accurate classification of legal and illegal variations.","Diffeomorphisms; Geodesic interpolating splines; Interpolating splines; Nonrigid registration","Algorithms; Calculations; Deformation; Energy management; Interpolation; Optimization; Vector quantization; Diffeomorphisms; Geodesic interpolating splines; Interpolating splines; Nonrigid registration; Medical imaging; algorithm; article; automated pattern recognition; biological model; brain; cluster analysis; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; evaluation; histology; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; three dimensional imaging; validation study; Algorithms; Brain; Cluster Analysis; Computer Simulation; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Biological; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Subtraction Technique",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043088381

Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is expressed in pancreatic β-cells and could potentially regulate insulin secretion via mobilization of stored triglycerides. Here, we examined the impact of HSL, deficiency on fuel metabolism and insulin secretion in mouse islets. Lack of HSL resulted in abrogation of neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activity, whereas diglyceride lipase activity remained intact. Although glucose stimulates lipolysis in rat islets, elevation of glucose with or without addition of cAMP failed to increase lipolysis in mouse islets regardless of genotype, as indicated by release of glycerol from islets. Storage of lipids, assayed as total acylglycerides, was unaltered in HSL null islets, and oxidation of fatty acids or glucose was not different. The intracellular rise in Ca2+ triggered by glucose and its subsequent oscillations was unaffected in HSL null islets. Accordingly, insulin secretion in static incubations of islets, in response to fuel- and nonfuel secretagogues, was in no instance significantly different between wild-type and HSL null mice. The lacking impact of HSL deficiency on insulin secretion may be attributed to the failure of insulin secretagogues to stimulate lipolysis. Consequently, a regulatory function of lipid mobilization in insulin secretion in the mouse appears unlikely.",,"acylglycerol; calcium ion; cholesterol esterase; cyclic AMP; glucose; glycerol; hormone sensitive lipase; insulin; lipoprotein lipase; animal model; animal tissue; article; calcium cell level; cell secretion; controlled study; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; enzyme deficiency; fatty acid oxidation; glucose oxidation; insulin release; lipid hydrolysis; lipid storage; lipolysis; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas islet; priority journal; Animals; Calcium; Cholesterol Esterase; Fats; Female; Glucose; Glycerides; Insulin; Islets of Langerhans; Lipolysis; Mice; Oxidation-Reduction; Palmitates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843052408

Therefore, management of body weight and obesity are increasingly considered as an important approach to maintaining healthy cholesterol profiles and reducing cardiovascular risk. The present review addresses the effects of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on fat deposition, body weight and composition, safety, as well as mechanisms involved in animals and humans. Animal studies have shown promising effects of CLA on body weight and fat deposition. The majority of the animal studies have been conducted using CLA mixtures that contained approximately equal amounts of trans-10, cis-12 (t10c12) and cis-9, trans-11 (c9t11) isomers. Results of a few studies in mice fed CLA mixtures with different ratios of c9t11 and t10c12 isomers have indicated that the t10c12 isomer CLA may be the active form of CLA affecting weight gain and fat deposition. Inductions of leptin reduction and insulin resistance are the adverse effects of CLA observed in only mice. In pigs, the effects of CLA on weight gain and fat deposition are inconsistent, and no adverse effects of CLA have been reported. A number of human studies suggest that CLA supplementation has no effect on body weight and insulin sensitivity. Although it is suggested that the t10c12 CLA is the antiadipogenic isomer of CLA in humans, the effects of CLA on fat deposition are marginal and more equivocal as compared to results observed in animal studies. Mechanisms through which CLA reduces body weight and fat deposition remain to be fully understood. Proposed antiobesity mechanisms of CLA include decreased energy/food intake and increased energy expenditure, decreased preadipocyte differentiation and proliferation, decreased lipogenesis, and increased lipolysis and fat oxidation. In summary, CLA reduces weight gain and fat deposition in rodents, while produces less significant and inconsistent effects on body weight and composition in pigs and humans. New studies are required to examine isomer-specific effects and mechanisms of CLA in animals and humans using purified individual CLA isomers.","Animals; Body weight; Conjugated linoleic acid; Fat deposition; Humans; Mechanisms","antiobesity agent; conjugated linoleic acid; leptin; apoptosis; body composition; caloric intake; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell size; cis trans isomerism; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug safety; energy expenditure; food intake; glucose blood level; hormone blood level; human; human versus animal comparison; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; isomerism; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; proadipocyte; review; supplementation; weight gain; weight reduction; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Composition; Body Weight; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Linoleic Acids; Liver; Obesity; Animalia; Rodentia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242884783

Nine individuals (31 ± 3 yr, 8.1 ± 2.5 yr postinjury; means ± SE) with incomplete spinal cord injury trained three times weekly for a total of 6 mo. Training session duration and intensity (velocity) increased by 54 ± 10% (P &lt; 0.01) and 135 ± 20%, respectively. Muscle biopsies and a modified glucose tolerance test (100 g glucose with [U-13C] glucose) were performed before (Pre) and after training (Post). Training resulted in a reduction in area under the curve of glucose × time (-15 ± 4%) and insulin × time (-33 ± 8%; both P &lt; 0.05). Oxidation of exogenous (ingested) glucose increased as a result of training (Pre = 4.4 ± 0.7 g/h, Post = 7.4 ± 0.6 g/h; P &lt; 0.05), as did oxidation of endogenous (liver) glucose (Pre = 3.8 ± 0.3 g/h, Post = 5.2 ± 0.3 g/h; P &lt; 0.05).

Six months of thrice-weekly body-weight-supported treadmill training in persons with an incomplete spinal cord injury improved blood glucose regulation by increasing oxidation and storage of an oral glucose load. Increases in the capacity for transport and phosphorylation glucose in skeletal muscle likely play a role in these adaptations.","Glucose control; GLUT-4; Insulin action; Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus","carbon 13; carbon dioxide; glucose; glucose transporter 4; hexokinase; adult; article; body weight; cervical spinal cord injury; clinical article; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; enzyme activity; exercise; female; glucose blood level; glucose oxidation; human; isotope labeling; lipid oxidation; male; mass spectrometry; muscle biopsy; muscle metabolism; oral glucose tolerance test; paraplegia; priority journal; quadriplegia; spinal cord injury; thoracic spinal cord; training; treadmill exercise; Western blotting; Adult; Blood Glucose; Body Composition; Breath Tests; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Exercise Test; Exercise Therapy; Glucose Transporter Type 4; Hexokinase; Humans; Insulin; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins; Muscle Proteins; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxidation-Reduction; Phosphorylation; Spinal Cord Injuries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242719449

To study HSL-independent lipolysis, we placed HSL-deficient mice in conditions of increased fatty acid flux: β-adrenergic stimulation, fasting, and dietary fat loading. Intraperitoneal administration of the β3-adrenergic agonist CL-316243 caused a greater increase in nonesterified fatty acid level in controls (0.33 ± 0.05 mmol/l) than in HSL-/- mice (0.12 ± 0.01 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.01). Similarly, in isolated adipocytes, lipolytic response to CL-316243 was greatly reduced in HSL-/- mice compared with controls. Fasting for ≤48 h produced normal mobilization and oxidation of fatty acids in HSL -/- mice, as judged by similar values of respiratory quotient and oxygen consumption as in HSL+/+ controls. In isolated adipocytes, lipolysis in the absence of β-adrenergic stimulation was 1.9-fold greater in HSL-/- than in HSL+/+ cells (P &lt; 0.05), increasing to 6.5-fold after fasting (P &lt; 0.01). After 6 wk of a fat-rich diet containing 31.5% of energy as lipid, weight gain of HSL-/- mice was 4.4-fold less than in HSL+/+ mice (P &lt; 0.01), and total abdominal fat mass was 5.2-fold lower in HSL-/- than in HSL+/+ mice (P &lt; 0.01). In white adipose tissue, HSL is essential for normal acute β-adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis and permits normal triglyceride storage capacity in response to dietary fat loading. However, HSL-independent lipolysis can markedly increase during fasting, both in isolated adipocytes and in intact mice, and can mediate a normal flux of fatty acids during fasting.","Lipid energy metabolism","5 [2 [[2 (3 chlorophenyl) 2 hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl] 1,3 benzodioxole 2,2 dicarboxylic acid; fatty acid; hormone; oxygen; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; beta adrenergic stimulation; calorimetry; controlled study; diet restriction; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; energy metabolism; fat intake; lipid metabolism; lipolysis; male; mouse; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; priority journal; respiratory quotient; Adipocytes; Adrenergic beta-Agonists; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Cholesterol Esterase; Dietary Fats; Dioxoles; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Fatty Acids; Female; Homeostasis; Lipolysis; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Motor Activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242686231

These rocks are bedded, their density is about 2.4, and they contain an average of 30% carbonates and 25% quartz. Thick (5 mm) sections from cores were put through a non-conventional device called CGI testcell (CGI: Centre de Géologie de l'Ingénieur, i.e. Engineering Geology Centre). The aim of this versatile device is to achieve plane deformation tests under compressive uniaxial loading together with controlled temperature and humidity conditions, and to make, simultaneously, visual inspection of the sample's fabric. We also used X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). Our methodology was applied to samples from two horizons with contrasted lithology: one from near the roof of the formation (445 m deep), occurring in a black shale and nodular micritic limestone unit, and the other from the middle of the formation (480 m deep), occurring in a silty calcareous shale unit with abundant pyritic burrows. These tests have shown the major role of texture, structure and iron sulphides content in the deformation and the rupture of these argillites. The thick slides are brittle and in the conditions of the test, the finite axial strain before the rupture is less than 1%. The clay content controls the deformability. The bedding is responsible for weakness surfaces in the sample. The strength of the carbonate and pyrite aggregates is higher than that of the matrix, and these heterogeneities in the texture control the opening of fissures. Two types of cracks are distinguished: tension fractures parallel to the direction of the compression and oblique shear fractures, guided by the bedding. The principal mechanism at work for the evolution of the sample's texture is the weathering of pyrite glomerocrysts, which results in limonite and gypsum neogenesis. This in turn induces swelling and increasing porosity. The coupled action of weathering and mechanical stress leads to the rupture. In order to take into consideration the respective contribution of mechanical stress and weathering, we used numerical modelling with a finite difference code. We were then able to: (1) reproduce the essential observations on the deformation of a thick section of argillite modelled with a softening elasto-plastic behaviour; (2) quantify the influence of a local heterogeneity; and (3) explain the differences between the real test and the numerical test by the role of the rock structure and texture during its deformation. The image given by the studied samples is representative of the horizons from which they were extracted: the content in pyrite is 1-2% in the Callovo-Oxfordian argillite layer of interest. Consequently, we are brought to consider that, in the purpose of evaluating the area of the possibly damaged zones around a gallery, one should not only take into account the damage from mechanical origin and the damage due to drying effects. Indeed, our results lead us to regard the weathering of pyrite as a supplementary cause of damage that will develop around the facility along with time. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Argillite; Crack; Pyrite; Rupture; Structure; Texture; Weathering","Deformation; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Radioactive waste storage; Scanning electron microscopy; Strain measurement; X ray diffraction analysis; Argillites; Heterogeneous shale samples; Uniaxial loading; Shale; argillite; deformation; radioactive waste; repository; rupture; shale; waste disposal; weathering; Eurasia; Europe; France; Paris Basin; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242676361

Our method succeeds where standard isophote curvature estimation methods fail. There is neither a segmentation of the surface needed nor a parametric model assumed. Our estimator works on the orientation field of the surface. This orientation field and a description of local structure is obtained by the Gradient Structure Tensor. The estimated orientation field has discontinuities mod π. It is mapped via the Knutsson mapping to a continuous representation. The principal curvatures of the surface, a coordinate invariant property, are computed in this mapped representation. From these curvatures, locally the bending energy is computed to describe the surface shape. An extensive evaluation shows that our curvature estimation is robust even in the presence of noise, independent of the scale of the object and furthermore the relative error stays small. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Edge detection; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Estimation; Gradient methods; Integration; Spurious signal noise; Tensors; Gradient structure tensor; Knutsson mapping; Local surface measures; Principal curvatures; Three dimensional gray value images; Image analysis; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; cluster analysis; color; colorimetry; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer graphics; computer interface; evaluation; image enhancement; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; three dimensional imaging; validation study; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Color; Colorimetry; Computer Graphics; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242676269

The behaviour of PCMs is modelled using ESP-r's special materials facility. The effect of phase transition is added to the energy balance equation as a latent heat generation term according to the so-called effective heat capacity method. Numerical simulations were conducted for a multi-zone, highly glazed and naturally ventilated passive solar building. PCM-impregnated gypsum plasterboard was used as an internal room lining. The air, surface and resultant temperatures were compared with the no-PCM case and the diurnal latent heat storage effect was analysed. While this effect did not cause a considerable reduction in the diurnal temperature fluctuation, the PCMs did effectively store solar energy in the transitions periods. Additionally, the energy requirement at the beginning and end of the heating season was estimated and compared with ordinary gypsum wallboard. Within this comparison, the PCM composite solidification temperature was 22°C (i.e. 2K higher than the heating set-point for the room). The results show that solar energy stored in the PCM-gypsum panels can reduce the heating energy demand by up to 90% at times during the heating season. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Dispersion has a consequence that the dynamic modulus is frequency dependent, and absorption is exhibited by the fact that these materials have the ability to absorb energy under vibratory motion. The phenomenon of dispersion in conjunction with the powerful notion of complex Modulus of Elasticity (MOE), permits to establish the relation between the real and the imaginary components of the MOE, that is, respectively the Storage and loss moduli. The loss factor is simply determined through taking the Ratio of these two MOE components. The theoretical background for the interrelations between the Storage modulus and the loss modulus is found in the Kramers-Kronig relations. However, due to the mathematical difficulties encountered in using the exact expressions of these relations, approximations are necessary for applications in practical situations. On the other hand, several simple models have been proposed to explain the viscoelastic behavior of materials, but all fail in giving a full account of the phenomenon. Among these models, the standard viscoelastic model, better known as the Zener model, is perhaps the most attractive. To improve the performance of this model, the concept of fractional derivates has been incorporated into it, which results in a four-parameter model. Applications have also shown the superiority of this model when theoretical predictions are compared to experimental data of different polymeric materials. The aim of this article is to present the results of applying this model to rubber, both natural and filled, and to some other selected more general polymer.","Dispersion; Dynamical MOE; Fractional derivates; Kramers-Kronig relations; Loss factor; Polyisobutylene; Polymers; Rubber","Dynamical MOE; Fractional derivatives; Kramers-Kronig relations; Loss factor; Characterization; Dispersions; Elastic moduli; Energy absorption; Mathematical models; Viscoelasticity; Organic polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28344434327

In such a composite, the paraffin (P) serves as a latent heat storage material and the HDPE acts as a supporting material, which prevents leakage of the melted paraffin because of providing structural strength. Therefore, it is named form-stable composite PCM. In this study, two kinds of paraffins with melting temperatures of 42-44 °C (type P1) and 56-58 °C (type P2) and latent heats of 192.8 and 212.4 Jg-1 were used. The maximum weight percentage for both paraffin types in the PCM composites without any seepage of the paraffin in the melted state were found as high as 77%. It is observed that the paraffin is dispersed into the network of the solid HDPE by investigation of the structure of the composite PCMs using a scanning electronic microscope (SEM). The melting temperatures and latent heats of the form-stable P1/HDPE and P2/HDPE composite PCMs were determined as 37.8 and 55.7 °C, and 147.6 and 162.2 Jg-1, respectively, by the technique of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Furthermore, to improve the thermal conductivity of the form-stable P/HDPE composite PCMs, expanded and exfoliated graphite (EG) by heat treatment was added to the samples in the ratio of 3 wt.%. Thereby, the thermal conductivity was increased about 14% for the form-stable P1/HDPE and about 24% for the P2/HDPE composite PCMs. Based on the results, it is concluded that the prepared form-stable P/HDPE blends as composite type PCM have great potential for thermal energy storage applications in terms of their satisfactory thermal properties and improved thermal conductivity. Furthermore, these composite PCMs added with EG can be considered cost effective latent heat storage materials since they do not require encapsulation and extra cost to enhance heat transfer in the paraffin. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Doughs were also tested in small angle sinusoidal oscillation. In accordance with previously published results the linear region was found to be very small. The rheological properties at small deformations hardly depended on the cultivar. A higher water content of the dough resulted in a lower value for the storage modulus and a slightly higher value for tan δ. For both uniaxial and biaxial extension a more than proportional increase in stress was found with increasing strain, a phenomenon called strain hardening. In uniaxial extension (i) stresses at a certain strain were higher and (ii) the stress was less dependent on the strain rate than in biaxial extension. This indicates that in elongational flow orientational effects are of large importance for the mechanical properties of flour dough. This conclusion is consistent with published data on birefringence of stretched gluten. Fracture stress and strain increased with increasing deformation rate. The observed time-dependency of fracture properties can best be explained by inefficient transport of energy to the crack tip. Presumably, this is caused by energy dissipation due to inhomogeneous deformation because of friction between structural elements, e.g. between dispersed particles and the network. Differences in the rheological properties at large deformations between the cultivars were observed with respect to (i) stress, (ii) strain hardening, (iii) strain rate dependency of the stress, (iv) fracture properties and (v) the stress difference between uniaxial and biaxial extension. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Biaxial extension; Dough rheology; Fracture properties; Strain hardening; Uniaxial extension",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642343664

State of the art building simulation software, ESP-r, was used to generate a database covering the years 1997-2001. The software was used to calculate hourly cooling loads for three office buildings using climate records in Kuwait. The cooling load data for 1997-2000 was used for training and testing the neural networks (NN), while robustness of the trained NN was tested by applying them to a ""production"" data set (2001 data) that the networks have never ""seen"" before. Three buildings of various densities of occupancy and orientational characteristics were investigated. Parametric studies were performed to determine optimum GRNN design parameters that best predict cooling load profiles for each building. External hourly temperature readings for a 24 h period were used as network inputs, and the hourly cooling load for the next day is the output. The performance of the NN analysis was evaluated using a statistical indicator (the coefficient of multiple determination) and by statistical analysis of the error patterns, including confidence intervals of regression lines, as well as by examination of the error patterns. The results show that a properly designed NN is a powerful instrument for optimizing thermal energy storage in buildings based only on external temperature records. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Supercapacitors are new and powerful components for energy storage. Compared with batteries, the amount of energy supercapacitors can store is low and does not allow large vehicle autonomy. Because supercapacitors have the property to be re-loadable in a few seconds, a sequential supply system has been developed, considering repetitive feeding at the stops. To solve the problem of the high power amount needed to reach short refill times, a solution is proposed, which consists of using an intermediary supercapacitive tank placed at fixed stations, which is refilled between the bus arrivals with a much lower power. In addition to the description of the needed power electronic converters, theoretical and experimental results are presented, defining the controlled profile of the instantaneous power level, in order to achieve a fast energy transfer between two supercapacitive tanks. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","Energy storage; Energy transfer; Power converter; Power feeders; Supercapacitors; Transportation","Capacitors; Electric converters; Electric energy storage; Electric network analysis; Electric power distribution; Energy transfer; Voltage control; Electrical transportation systems; Power feeders; Refill station; Supercapacitors; Electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14644417841

We analyzed the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and the NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), involved in the carboxylation/decarboxylation of malate. Our results show that CO2 treatment, which improves tolerance to prolonged storage at chilling temperature, was closely linked to considerably greater NADP-ME activity. These results, combined with lower PEPC activity, may explain the significantly lower amount of malic acid and titratable acidity quantified in CO2-treated fruit. Moreover, the high cytoplasmic MDH enzyme activity and the strong stimulation of NADP-ME activity exhibited by CO2-treated fruit could be contributing factors in the maintenance of fruit energy metabolism, pH stability, and the promotion of synthesis of defense compounds that prevent or repair damage caused by chilling temperature.","Carbon dioxide; Cherimoya; Chilling temperature; Malate; Malate dehydrogenase; Malic enzyme; Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; Titratable acidity","carbon dioxide; carboxylic acid; malate dehydrogenase; malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating); malic acid; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; acidity; adaptation; Annona; annona cherimola; article; cooling; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; food storage; fruit; nonhuman; temperature; Annona; Carbon Dioxide; Citric Acid; Cold; Decarboxylation; Fruit; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Malate Dehydrogenase; Malates; Annona; Annona cherimola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242779198

On the basis of their ability to generate NO in vivo, S-nitrosothiols can be used as therapeutic drugs. In this study, we have developed an innovative method for sequence- and base-specific delivery of NO to a specific site of DNA followed by specific deamination. We designed a NO transfer reaction from S-nitroso thioguanine to an imino tautomer of cytosine. Nitrosation of the thioguanosine-containing ODN 1 was carried out with S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) to produce ODN 2. An interstrand NO transfer reaction was performed using ODN 2 and its complementary ODN 3 having dC or dmC at the target site, and a rapid NO transfer reaction was observed. In contrast, a transfer reaction was not observed either with ODN 3 having dT, dA, or dG at the target site or with ODN 5-7 having dC at a nontarget site. In the analysis of deaminated products of the NO-transferred ODN 4, it was found that the transformation ratio from dmC to dT was as high as 42% together with the dmC-diazoate (13%). In conclusion, we have demonstrated the innovative method of sequence- and base-specific delivery of nitric oxide to cytidine and 5-methylcytidine. The selectivity and efficiency of NO transfer followed by deamination exhibited in this study are extremely high compared to those of the conventional methods.

With increasing milling time and/or rotation speed, the average particle and crystallite sizes of Mg and TiFe0.92Mn 0.08 reduced and the TiFe0.92Mn0.08 phase was uniformly distributed in the Mg matrix. After activation, all composites absorbed hydrogen at 25°C, and the hydrogen absorption-desorption properties were improved with increasing the degree of dispersion of the TiFe 0.92Mn0.08 phase in the as-milled composite. A composite milled at 600rpm for 80h absorbed hydrogen of nearly 3.5wt.% at 25°C and started to desorb hydrogen around 300°C under hydrogen pressure of 0.1MPa. These good hydrogen absorption-desorption properties are due to the high degree of dispersion of TiFe0.92Mn0.08 phase, the introduction of micro-cracks and the formation of TiFe0.92-xMn0.08 and α-Fe phases.

To investigate the HSL substrate specificity more closely, we systematically assessed the lipolytic activity of recombinant human HSL on solutions and emulsions of various vinyl esters and TAG substrates, using the pH-stat assay technique. Recombinant human HSL activity on solutions of partly soluble vinyl esters or TAG was found to range from 35 to 90% of the maximum activity measured with the same substrates in the emulsified state. The possible existence of a lipid-water interface due to the formation of small aggregates of vinyl esters or TAG in solution may account for the HSL activity observed below the solubility limit of the substrate. Recombinant human HSL also hydrolyzes insoluble medium- and long-chain acylglycerols such as trioctanoylglycerol, dioleoylglycerol, and olive oil, and can therefore be classified as a true lipase. Preincubation of the recombinant HSL with a serine esterase inhibitor such as diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1: 100 molar excess leads to complete HSL inhibition within 15 min.

Physisorption of H2 outside the CNT with a vertical orientation to the tube axis above the center of a hexagon surface is the most stable state of physisorption and its binding energy is very weak, -0.792 kcal/mol. In the chemisorption of two hydrogen atoms the most stable state is above two adjacent carbon atoms of a hexagon with a C-H bond length of 1.10 Å and one C-H bond energy of -45.761 kcal/mol. Based on these results, we have also investigated the transition state and the reaction pathway from physisorption to chemisorption of hydrogen on the CNT. The energy barrier of the reaction from physisorption to chemisorption is about 78.837 kcal/mol and the reaction is not spontaneous at 0 K. Through the calculations of the Gibbs free energy change from physisorption to chemisorption with temperatures, we learned that it is not easy for the reaction to occur, which is a major obstacle for the practical use of the CNT as a hydrogen storage medium. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The consequences have been comprehensive, measured by lost lives, injuries, and material and environmental damage. ESReDA wanted in 2000 - by setting up a special expert group on accident investigation - to clarify the state of art of accident investigation practices and to map the use of thoroughly accident investigation in order to learn lessons from past disasters and prevent new ones. The scope was to cover three sectors in the society: transport, production processes and storage of hazardous materials, and energy production. The main method used was a questionnaire, which was sent in 2001 to about 150 organisations. About 50 replies were analysed. The replies showed great variations but also similarities, among others in definition of accident and incident, the objectives of the investigation team, criteria used to start an investigation, the status of the investigation organisation, the flow of information, the composition of the investigation team, and the use of internal or international procedures or rules. Several methods (in total 14 different methods were mentioned) were used for carrying out accident /incident investigations. Most of the respondents were willing to co-operate in one or another way with ESReDA. Although there are important biases in the material, the results from questionnaire are important inputs to the future work of ESReDA Expert group in this field. 3 safety approaches have been identified. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Accident; Disaster; ESReDA; European survey; Incident; Investigation","Accident investigation practices; Injuries; Disasters; Environmental impact; Safety factor; Social aspects; Accident prevention; accident; safety; accident; conference paper; dangerous goods; disaster; energy yield; Europe; incidence; questionnaire; safety; Accidents; Europe; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Industry; Safety Management; Transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042693542

The work covers technical aspects of severe accidents and thus primarily reflects an engineering perspective on the energy-related risk issues, though some social implications are also touched upon. The assessment concerns fossil energy sources (coal, oil and gas), nuclear power and hydro power. The scope is not limited to the power production (conversion) step of these energy chains but, whenever applicable, also includes exploration, extraction, transports, processing, storage and waste disposal. With the exception of the nuclear chain the focus of the work has been on the evaluation of the historical experience of accidents. The basis used for this evaluation is a comprehensive database ENSAD (Energy-related Severe Accident Database), established by the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI). For hypothetical nuclear accidents the probabilistic technique has also been employed and extended to cover the assessment of economic consequences of such accidents. The broader picture obtained by coverage of full energy chains leads on the world-wide basis to aggregated immediate fatality rates being much higher for the fossil chains than what one would expect if only power plants were considered. Generally, the immediate fatality rates are for all considered energy carriers significantly higher for the non-OECD countries than for OECD countries. In the case of hydro and nuclear the difference is in fact dramatic. The presentation of results is not limited to the aggregated values specific for each energy chain. Also frequency-consequence curves are provided. They reflect implicitly the ranking based on the aggregated values but include also such information as the observed or predicted chain-specific maximum extents of damages. This perspective on severe accidents may lead to different system rankings, depending on the individual risk aversion. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The rate of neutral particles emitted in collisions started to increase from definite threshold energies, which increased regularly with ion charges in steps of about 10 eV. These threshold energies were almost independent of the length and sequence of DNA, but depended strongly on the ion charges. Neutral particles came from breaks of DNAs, rather than electron detachment. The step of the threshold energy increase approximately agreed with the plasmon excitation energy.

The novel series of LCB EP copolymers were synthesized with a constrained geometry catalyst (CGC), [C5Me 4(SiMe2NtBu)]TiMe2, and had various propylene molar fractions of 0.01-0.11 and long-chain branch frequencies (LCBF) of 0.05-0.22. The linear EP copolymers were synthesized with an ansa-zirconocene catalyst, rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 (EBI), and contained similar levels of propylene incorporation as the CGC copolymers, but no LCB. In dynamic mechanical analysis, the dynamic storage moduli (G′) and loss moduli (G″) of the copolymers decreased with an increase of propylene molar fraction. The α- and β-transitions of the CGC copolymers were overlaid with each other. High damping (tanδ) values were found with the CGC copolymers at temperatures below 0°C. In oscillatory rheological analysis, compared to the linear EBI counterparts, the LCB CGC copolymer melts showed higher zero shear activation energies, broader plateaus of δ and larger elastic contributions, which are essential characteristics of LCB polymers. It was found that the long chain branching was the determining factor in controlling rheological properties of the polymer melts while the short chain branching from propylene incorporation played a decisive role in affecting dynamic mechanical properties. This work represents the first rheological evidence of LCB in EP copolymers synthesized with CGC. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The temperature dependences of the conductivity and magnetoresistance (MR) have been studied. We found that the room temperature conductivity increases by two orders of magnitude with increasing carbon nanotube weight percentage. The temperature dependence of the conductivity follows a charge-energy-limited tunnelling model (In σ (T) α T -1/2) and indicates clearly that the CNT weight percentages of 9.1 and 13.04 wt% are below the percolation threshold and 23.1 wt% is beyond the percolation threshold. At low temperatures the 23.1 wt% composite shows a negative MR whereas the pure PPy shows a positive one.

At the new Stern-Gerlach Center of Frankfurt University a small machine for ion energies up to 50keV will be build up. It will serve as a tool to analyze the structure and dynamics of many particle systems from atoms to complex organic biomolecules. It will be possible to prepare the particle beams of interest in novel and unique ways. In direct comparison to traditional setups, the luminosity of the measurements will be improved by many orders of magnitude. In combination with the newest reaction microscopes, the Frankfurt Ion stoRage Experiments (FIRE) will allow analysis of many particle fragmentation processes of atoms and molecules with unrivaled resolution and completeness. In contrast to experiments with traps, an electrostatic storage ring has the advantage of being able to record the momenta of all neutral fragments.

It is found that in ZrV2H x hydrogen forms stronger covalent bonds with vanadium than with zirconium if Zr atoms are in the neighborhood of V. A detailed analysis of how the densities of states change with the hydrogen count x in ZrV 2Hx shows the changes in the bonding and anti-bonding interactions of H with V and Zr. However, the covalent anti-bonding interactions between H and V seem to be mainly responsible for the variation in the formation energy of ZrV2Hx with x. The value of projected density of states of V 3d at the Fermi level can be used as a rough comparative measure for these anti-bonding interactions and therefore allows us to predict the changes in stability of ZrV2Hx with x. © 2004 Acta Materialia Inc.

The two alkanols display the same polymorphic behaviour. At low temperatures, they crystallize into the same ordered form γ (C2/c, Z = 8). On heating, γ transforms into the rotationally disordered form R′IV (C2/m, Z = 4), at a few degrees below the melting point of the latter. However, in most mixed samples of this system a β form (P21/c, Z = 8), metastable in the two pure components, has also been observed at low temperatures. At high temperatures, the β form transforms into the R′II form (R3m, Z = 3). This R′II form is also metastable in the two pure components. The β form presents conformational defects, and molecules with all-trans conformation co-exist with molecules with CO-gt-conformation, in contrast, all the molecules in the γ form present all-trans conformation. In the R′II form the rotational disorder is more accentuated than in the R′IV form. The disorder of composition (molecular alloys) stabilizes over wide ranges of compositions the β (disorder of conformation) and R′II (disorder of rotation) forms. Five solid-solid domains ([γ + β], [β + R′II], [γ + R′II], [γ + R′IV] and [R′II + R′IV]) related by two peritectoid and eutectoid invariants, and two solid-liquid domains ([R′IV + L] and [R′II + L]) related by a eutectic and a peritectic invariant, are present. The [β + R′II] domain has a minimum. All these domains are observed for compositions rich in the two pure components. The experimental phase diagram data are fully supported by the thermodynamically calculated phase diagram. The R′II + liquid domain has a width of less than 1 K; therefore, and due to the large heat effect, the system's alloys are good candidates for the storage of thermal energy.",,"alkanol; article; conformational transition; crystallization; heating; high temperature; liquid; low temperature; physical phase; solid; temperature dependence; thermodynamics; trans isomer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043142090

R., SAS Nagar, Mohali 160062, Punjab, India","In biological system, hydrolysis of phytic acid (the principle storage form of phosphorus in legumes, cereals, oil seeds and nuts) to myo-inositol and inorganic phosphate is an important reaction for energy metabolism, metabolic regulation and signal transduction pathways. The reaction was primarily catalysed by phytases (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate phosphohydrolase). Phytases are histidine acid phosphatases (HAPs), a subclass of phosphatases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphate moieties from phytic acid, thereby, resulting in the loss of ability of phytic acid to chelate metal ions. The supplementation of animal feed with phytase increases the bioavailability of phosphorus in monogastric animals besides reducing the phosphorus pollution in the areas of intensive livestock units. Phytases can be derived from a host of sources including plants, animals and microorganisms, however, microbial sources are more promising for the production of phytases on a commercial scale. Of the various organisms reported, phytase production by Aspergillus sp., have been most commonly employed using either solid-state fermentation (SSF) or submerged fermentation (SmF) processes. The physicochemical characteristics and catalytic properties of phytases from various sources indicated it to be ester-hydrolyzing enzyme with an estimated molecular weight of 35-700 kDa depending upon the source of origin and are usually active within a pH range of 4.5-6.0 at 45-60°C. Generally, the phytases from bacteria have optimum pH in neutral to alkaline range while in fungi optimum pH range is 2.5-6.0. Phytases are fairly specific for phytic acid under the assay condition and it is possible to distinguish phytase from acid phosphatase that is incapable of degrading phytate. In this review, recent trends on the production and properties of phytases from various sources are summarized. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The experimental investigation simulates the heating effect of one current component of the natural lightning flashes that may strike in-light or landed aircraft and rockets; munitions and nuclear weapons; and storage/collection tanks and pipelines of the petroleum/gas industries. In the case of a lightning strike the rear-face temperature rise must be less than certain limits to avoid catastrophic damage/accidents. A sophisticated high-speed infrared camera, having an image frequency of 50 Hz and a temperature range up to 1200°C, is used to measure the rear-face temperature profiles as a function of the coordinates and time. The results are interpreted in light of the optical observation of the arc motion, physical measurement of the spot diameter, and study of the energy balance at the cathode and anode spots. The results reveal that for constant charge transfer, lightning long-duration currents having higher amplitudes give a higher rear-face temperature rise and hence a higher risk of accidents. Both the maximum rear-face core temperature and the front-face spot diameter exponentially increase with the mean current amplitude. Moreover, the maximum rear-face core temperature varies exponentially with the charge and linearly with the action integral. Current injection with positive polarity of the test electrode gives a lower rear-face temperature for all metals used except for aluminium where the trend is reversed.

As simulation studies show, the high optical excitation energy and small optical focus size characteristic of blue laser data storage formats lead to significant hot carrier diffusion prior to the energy transfer to the crystal lattice. As a consequence, the optical energy is deposited in an area larger than the laser spot size, leading to enhanced intertrack cross-talk and thermal cross-erase that reduces the quality of high-density optical storage. Therefore, the fundamental limit of resolution for re-writable optical storage systems is no longer determined by the laser focus size alone, but also by additional nonequilibrium HCD effects.","Femtosecond phenomena; Hot carrier diffusion; Optical data storage; Phase change media","Compact disks; Computer simulation; Crystallization; Hot carriers; Laser applications; Phase transitions; Television; Thermal diffusion; Videodisks; Femtosecond phenomena; Hot carrier diffusion; Phase change media; Optical data storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5144230827

This model shows that a peak power consumption of 1 W and an average power consumption of less than 50 mW are feasible for specific applications, provided that dedicated low-power electronics is used. Therefore, a low-power laser driver was developed, which, moreover, is sufficiently flexible to allow the use of low-power write strategies. The low power consumption of the laser driver is achieved by minimising the amount of circuitry used, the supply voltages and the clock frequencies.

The equations are designed to incorporate a wide class of spot price models that can exhibit the same time-dependent, mean-reverting dynamics and price spikes as those observed in most electricity markets. Particular attention is paid to the operational characteristics of real power generators. For thermal power plants, these characteristics include variable start-up times and costs, control response time lags, minimum generating levels, nonlinear output functions, and structural limitations on ramp rates. For hydroelectric units, head effects and environmental constraints are addressed. We illustrate the models with numerical examples of a pump storage facility and a thermal power plant. This PIDE framework can achieve high levels of computational speed and accuracy while incorporating a wide range of spot price dynamics and operational characteristics.","Dynamic programming/optimal control: application; Finance/asset pricing: pricing power plants as real options; Natural resources/energy: deregulated electricity markets","Algorithms; Dynamic programming; Hydroelectric power plants; Marketing; Optimal control systems; Project management; Deregulated electricity markets; Finance/asset pricing; Pricing power plants as real options; Ramp rates; Electric utilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544313969

The average thicknesses of the FDTS layers varied from 0.5 to 1.4 nm and the film thickness of the mobile PFPEs was about 1.2 nm. We find that a sharp ""spike"" on the spreading profile occurs and the height of the spike decreases with the spreading time. After partial dip-coating, the initial film boundary of the PFPE on the FDTS islands having a low surface energy cannot spread and the moving film boundary on the bare carbon surface is obstructed by the FDTS island obstacles, which results in the spike formation (i.e., the lubricant buildup) and the retardation of molecular migration. This tendency is remarkable with the increasing average film thickness of the FDTS layer. The spreading is observed at the leading edge of the lubricant front originating from the migration of the lubricant molecules between the FDTS islands by diffusive processes.","FDTS islands; Mobile perfluoropolyethers; Spreading; Thin films","Mobile perfluoropolyethers; Perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS) islands; Scanning ellipsometers; Spreading; Carbon; Chemical bonds; Ellipsometry; Interfacial energy; Lubricants; Monolayers; Photolithography; Polyethers; Thin films; Magnetic disk storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444376830

Three approaches to measuring Co or Ni hydroxide corrosion products on hard disk media surfaces have been proposed and the detection limit of each method is discussed. The first method is to measure the ion counts of Co + or Ni +. The detection limit can be as low as ppm level. The second method is to measure the ion counts of CoOH + or NiOH +. The detection limit is around 0.1% (100 ppm), and the third method is to measure the ion counts of CoF + or NiF +.

The level of internal energy stored by a polymer during its deformation is estimated on the basis of the analysis of experimental data on the structure of deformed glassy polymers. It is assumed that this energy storage is related to the development of interfacial surfaces in the polymer during its inelastic deformation. The formation of interfacial surfaces is provided by the nucleation and growth of shear bands that are filled with an oriented fibrillar material. It is found that the level of surface energy stored by a highly dispersed structure of shear bands quantitatively corresponds to the experimentally estimated excess of internal energy stored by the polymer during its deformation. This evidence allows one to suggest a mechanism of deformation and temperature-induced shrinkage of glassy polymers. This mechanism takes into account the two-component structure of the deformed glassy polymer: a polymer fraction localized in the shear bands (the surface component) and a polymer fraction localized between them (the volume component).",,"polymer; analytic method; article; chemical analysis; chemical reaction; elasticity; energy transfer; glass transition temperature; molecular mechanics; phase transition; polymerization; reaction analysis; shear strength; structure analysis; temperature dependence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444228524

In the EU, agricultural and environmental policies are seeking to converge progressively toward mutually compatible objectives and, in this context, the recently reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the EU Water Framework Directive constitute the policy framework in which irrigated agriculture and hence water use will evolve. In fact, one of the measures of the European Water Directive is to establish a water pricing policy for improving water use and attaining a more efficient water allocation. The aim of this research is to investigate the irrigators' responses to these changing policy developments in a self-managed irrigation district in southern Spain. A stochastic programming model has been developed to estimate farmers' response to the application of water pricing policies in different agricultural policy scenarios when water availability is subject to varying climate conditions and water storage capacity in the district's reservoir. Results show that irrigators are price-responsive, but a similar water-pricing policy in different agricultural policy options could have distinct effects on water use, farmers' income, and collected revenue by the water authority. Water availability is a critical factor, and pricing policies are less effective for reducing water consumption in drought years. Thus there is a need to integrate the objectives of water policies within the objectives of the CAP programs to avoid distortion effects and to seek synergy between these two policies.","Agricultural policies; Stochastic programming; Water policies; Water pricing","Agriculture; Energy management; Irrigation; Laws and legislation; Public policy; Storage (materials); Common Agricultural Policy (CAP); Water resource management; Water resources; policy making; pricing policy; resource management; water availability; water economics; water resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143135290

This study determined the effects of naturally occurring variations in birth weight in pigs on postnatal growth patterns, body fat depth and plasma leptin and other hormone concentrations. Low (< 1.47 kg) and high (> 1.53 kg) birth weight piglets were studied at 3 months (juvenile; n = 47) and 12 months of age (young adult; n = 17). At each age, arterial and venous catheters were inserted under general anaesthesia. Plasma leptin, cortisol, glucose, insulin and catecholamine concentrations were determined in basal blood samples. Body fat depth was measured by ultrasound at 12 months of age. Overall, adult fat depth was greater in low compared to high birth weight pigs and increased fat depth was associated with thinness at birth and poor early growth rates. These effects were strongest in females. Fat depth was related to current weight only in males. Compared to high birth weight pigs, plasma leptin concentrations were reduced in low birth weight females at 3 months and in low birth weight males at 12 months of age.

The non-ventilated vault is characterized by an annual temperature variation of about 1.2 °C peak to peak, compatible with thermal diffusion in the surrounding tuff rock, and by a long-term temperature increase of about 0.1 °C per year, possibly due to a local or global climate change. Owing to a careful relative calibration of the 10 thermistors used in this experiment, these data establish that the ceiling temperature is higher than the floor temperature by 0.04 to 0.28 °C. Transient temperature variations are observed in association with human presence or with typhoons, with a characteristic spatial pattern revealing structural heterogeneity. Variations with periods ranging from 1 day to 1 week, with an amplitude two time larger and a phase advance on the floor with respect to the ceiling, are observed from November to May. Variations with periods larger than 1 week, with an amplitude two times smaller and a phase lag on the floor with respect to the ceiling, are observed from June to October. These cycles are linked to the sign of the seasonal heat flux. We propose an interpretation in which heat transfer in the cavity is dominated by diffusion of water vapour from June to October (heat flux downwards, summer regime) and by convective water transport from November to May (heat flux upwards, winter regime). The water flow inferred from this model can be used to predict the water saturation of the rock as a function of time. Because of a permanent radiative heat flux from top to bottom, the upward water flow in the winter regime is larger than the downward water flow in the summer regime, resulting in a slow depletion of water from the rock below the cavity.

Testicular maturation was investigated by comparing samples from bluefin tuna caught on their eastward reproductive migration off Barbate (Strait of Gibraltar area) with samples of bluefin tuna fished in spawning grounds around the Balearic Islands. Histological evaluations of cross sections showed that the testis consists of two structurally different regions, an outer proliferative region where germ cells develop synchronously in cysts, and a central region made up of a well-developed system of ducts that convey the spermatozoa produced in the proliferative region to the main sperm duct. Ultrastructural features of the different stages of the male germ cell line are very similar to those described in other teleost species. The bluefin tuna testis is of the unrestricted spermatogonial testicular type, where primary spermatogonia are present all along the germinative portion of the lobules. All stages of spermatogenesis were present in the gonad tissue of migrant and spawning bluefin tuna, although spermatids were more abundant in spawning fish. The testis size was found to increase by a factor of four (on average) during migration to the Mediterranean spawning grounds, whereas the fat bodies (mesenteric lipid stores associated with the gonads) became reduced to half their weight, and the liver mass did not change significantly with sexual maturation. Linear regression analysis of the pooled data of migrant and spawning bluefin tuna revealed a significant negative correlation between the gonad index (IG) and the fat tissue index (IF), and a weaker positive correlation between the gonad index (IG) and the liver index (IL). Our analyses indicate that the liver does not play a significant role in the storage of lipids and that mesenteric lipid reserves constitute an important energy source for gametogenesis in bluefin tuna.",,"histology; Scombridae gen. sp.; Teleostei; Thunnus; Thunnus thynnus; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543138377

It was necessary also to study the effects of differences of calibration of different models of DXA scanner. DESIGN: A total of 175 women with eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa, and 43 age-matched controls were measured for soft-tissue composition with a pencil-beam Hologic QDR 1000W scanner and results converted to be equivalent to those from a fan-beam Hologic QDR 4500A, using previously determined crosscalibration factors. Some measurements were repeated at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: The baseline body composition of the patients covered a continuous range of fat proportions. Implausibly low fat proportions in some of the AN subjects were corrected by conversion to 4500 equivalents. The relationship between total lean mass and fat mass could be fitted equally well by a linear or linear/log regression. The relationship between leg and trunk fat was best fitted by a polynomial regression. There were weight changes in either direction in some of the subjects. The fat proportion in the total changed mass was a mean of 55%, higher in the legs and lower in the trunk, but not different between weight gainers and losers or clinical groups. The proportion was dependent on the initial fat proportion. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively small differences in fat/lean calibration of DXA scanners may lead to anomalous results in very anorexic subjects and corrections are necessary in comparing results from different instruments. Concerns expressed about preferential trunk fat accumulation during weight recovery are not well founded. Previous claims of a relationship between fat proportion in regained weight and the amount of the weight gain are not justified.","Body composition; Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; Eating disorders","adult; anorexia nervosa; article; body composition; body distribution; body fat; body weight; bulimia; calibration; comparative study; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; eating disorder; female; human; lean body weight; leg muscle; linear regression analysis; lipid storage; major clinical study; medical assessment; priority journal; sample size; skeletal muscle; weight gain; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Anorexia Nervosa; Anthropometry; Body Composition; Bulimia; Densitometry, X-Ray; Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Weight Gain; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3442885483

Chmelnicky Ul. 15, 01601, Kiev, Ukraine","In Auchenorrhyncha, jumping is achieved by metathoracic muscles which are inserted into the trochanter of the hind leg. The synchronisation of movements of the hind legs is a difficult problem, as the leg extension that produces the jump occurs in less than 1 ms. Even slight asynchrony could potentially result in failure of a jump. Both the synchronisation of the movements of a pair of jumping legs, and their stabilisation during a jump, seem to be important problems for small jumping insects. The present study was performed in order to clarify some questions of the functional morphology of the leafhopper jumping mechanism. It is based on skeleton-muscle reconstruction, high-speed video recordings, transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) investigations of the cuticle, together with 3D inverse-kinematic modelling of angles and working zones of hind leg joints of cicada Cercopis vulnerata (Cercopidae). The complete extension of the hind leg takes less than 1 ms, which suggests that the jump is powered not only by the muscle system, but also by an elastic spring. Histological staining and fluorescence microscopy showed resilin-bearing structures, responsible for elastic energy storage, in the pleural area of the metathorax. Synchronisation of hind leg movements may be aided by microtrichia fields that are located on the medial surface of each hind coxa. In Auchenorrhyncha, hind coxae are rounded in their anterior and lateral parts, whereas medial parts are planar, and contact each other over a rather large area. The inverse-kinematic model of propulsive leg movements was used to draw the surface outlined by the medial surface of the coxa, during the jump movement. This is a cone surface, faced with its bulged-in side, medially. Surfaces outlined by the movements of both right and left coxae overlap in their anterior and posterior positions. In both extreme positions, coxae are presumably connected to each other by coupled microtrichia fields. Thus, in extreme positions, both coxae can be moved synchronously. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Engineering, University of Waterloo, IEEE, Waterloo, Ont. N2L 3G1, Canada","The control methodology of the active power-line filter is the key element for its successful performance in mitigating the line current harmonics. The control system processes the distorted line current signal and forces the converter to inject the proper compensating current. At the same time, it regulates the dc term, i.e., the dc current in the current source converter topology and the dc voltage in the voltage source converter topology. In this paper, a new intelligent control scheme for a modular single-phase active power filter based on the current source converter (CSC) topology is proposed. The intelligent controller utilizes two adaptive linear neurons (ADALINEs) to process the signals obtained from the power-line. The first ADALINE (the Current ADALINE) extracts the harmonic components of the distorted line current signal and the second ADALINE (the Voltage ADALINE) estimates the fundamental component of the line voltage signal. The outputs of the two ADALINEs are used to construct the modulating signals of a number of CSC modules, each dedicated to eliminate a specific harmonic. The proposed controller is also responsible for activating selected CSC filter module(s) to the electric grid. The automated activation of the corresponding filter module(s) is based on the decision-making rules in accordance with the current total harmonic distortion (THDi) and the harmonic factor (HF) levels set by the IEEE 519-1992 standard. A special 3-level PWM switching strategy is proposed for the filter modules which results in a 50% reduction in the overall switching losses compared with the 2-level method. The proposed controller adjusts the Idc in each CSC module based on the present magnitude of the corresponding harmonic current which results in optimum dc-side current value and minimal converter losses. The high speed, accuracy, efficiency and flexibility offered by the proposed controller, combined with the fast response and low dc energy storage requirement of CSC topology, are the main advantages of the proposed active filter system. The analytical expectations are verified by digital simulation using EMTDC simulation package. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Electric converters; Electric currents; Electric energy storage; Electric lines; Electric losses; Electric network topology; Electric potential; Electric power systems; Harmonic distortion; Intelligent control; Pulse width modulation; Active power filters; Adaptive linear neurons; Current source converter topology; Harmonic factor level; Harmonic mitigation; Line current harmonics; Three level pulse width modulation technique; Voltage source converter topology; Active filters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242790923

With the advances of power electronics and digital signal processing technology, such a system can also be utilized to improve the power quality of the power system. A novel control methodology is proposed to regulate the SMES discharge to extend the support time to criticai loads during a short-term disturbance in the distribution network. Using a P-Q diagram, the analysis of the power flow from the energy storage system to the power system is presented. The proposed hysteresis controller with SMES increases the operating area in P-Q plane as compared to the conventional d-q controlled scheme used in the literature. This allows the system capability to be utilized to its maximum thermal limits. The scheme also has the capability to control the real and reactive power flow through the converter using the proposed hysteresis current control scheme. This provides the capability to optimize the available energy storage by using load priority scheduling. The detailed three-phase system simulation is carried out using realistic models of the power electronics components used in the converters.

Methods included cine and stereocine recording with further frame by frame analysis, stereogrammetry, inverse kinematic reconstruction of joint angles, stroboscopic photography, recording of electromyograms, 3D measurements of the articulations, etc. The basic mode consists of a search phase, ending up with grasping the substrate, and a righting, overturning phase. Leg coordination within the search cycle differs from the walking cycle with respect to phasing of certain muscle groups. Search movements of all legs appear chaotic, but the tendency to move in antiphase is still present in adjacent ipsilateral and contralateral leg pairs. The system of leg coordination might be split: legs of one side might search, while contralateral legs walk, or fore and middle legs walk while hind legs search. Elaborated types of righting include somersaults with the aid of contralateral or diagonal legs, pitch on elytra, jumps with previous energy storage with the aid of unbending between thoracic segments (well-known for Elateridae), or quick folding of elytra (originally described in Histeridae).

Differentiation is evident on structural and morphological levels and is reflected by the spatial distribution of metabolites. In Vicia embryos, glucose is spatially correlated to mitotic activity whereas elongating and starch accumulating cells contain high levels of sucrose. Seed development is also regulated by phytohormones. In pea seeds, GA-deficiency stops seed growth before maturation. In Arabidopsis seeds, ABA regulates differentiation and inhibits cell division activity. The ABA pathway, in turn, is linked to sugar responses. In young Vicia embryos, invertases in maternal tissues control both concentration and composition of sugars. Embryonic and endospermal transfer cell formation represents an early differentiation step. Establishing an epidermis-localised sucrose uptake system renders the embryo independent from maternal control. cDNA array analysis in barley seeds revealed a massive transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression during the transition stage, when gene clusters related to transport and energy metabolism are highly transcribed. Sucrose represents a signal for differentiation and up-regulates storage-associated gene expression. Sucrose signalling involves protein phosphorylation. Sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases are apparently induced in response to high cellular sucrose, and could act as mediators of sucrose-specific signals. Energy metabolism changes during seed development. In Vicia embryos metabolic responses upon hypoxia and low energy charge levels are characteristic for young undifferentiated stages when energy demand and respiration are high. During the transition stage, the embryo becomes adapted to low energy availability and metabolism becomes energetically more economic and tightly controlled. These adaptations are embedded in the embryo's differentiation program and coupled with photoheterotrophic metabolism. In Vicia cotyledons, ATP content increases in a development-dependent pattern and is associated with the greening process. The main role of seed photosynthesis is to increase internal O2 contents and to control biosynthetic fluxes by improving energy supply.","Cell differentiation; Energy metabolism; Legume and barley seed development; Metabolic gradients; Metabolite imaging; Sugar transport; Transfer cells","beta fructofuranosidase; carrier protein; sucrose; sucrose transport protein, plant; vegetable protein; gene expression; legume; metabolism; metabolite; seed; seed production; spatial distribution; barley; biological model; carbohydrate metabolism; energy metabolism; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; photosynthesis; plant seed; review; signal transduction; Vicia faba; beta-Fructofuranosidase; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Hordeum; Membrane Transport Proteins; Models, Biological; Photosynthesis; Plant Proteins; Seeds; Signal Transduction; Sucrose; Vicia faba; Arabidopsis; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Pisum sativum; Vicia; Vicia faba",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242725152

The aim of our study was therefore to analyze the effects of GH on the morphology and ultrastructure of the cells of bovine preimplantation embryos produced by in vitro fertilization (IVF). In order to determine the physiologically optimal morphology of blastocysts, ex vivo embryos obtained by uterine flushing were also included in the study. As shown by transmission electron microscopy, treatment with GH induced the elimination of glycogen storage in cells of the inner cell mass of 7-day-old embryos. GH also stimulated the exocytosis of lipid vesicles in the inner cell mass and trophectoderm cells of these embryos. Quantitative analysis of micrographs demonstrated a higher volume density of embryonic mitochondria in 7-day-old embryos cultured with GH than in control embryos. Treatment with GH regularly resulted in an improvement of the ultrastructural features of embryos produced in vitro, thus resembling the morphology of ex vivo embryos. Scanning electron-microscopy studies demonstrated that GH altered the structure and the pore size of the zona pellucida of blastocysts. Our studies imply that GH can modulate carbohydrate, lipid, and energy metabolism and influence transportation processes in the early IVF embryo. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Bovine (Deutsches Fleckvieh); Growth hormone; Mechanisms of hormone action; Preimplantation embryo; Scanning electron microscopy; Transmission electron microscopy","glycogen; growth hormone; animal cell; article; blastocyst; cell density; controlled study; ectoderm; embryo; embryo culture; ex vivo study; exocytosis; fertilization in vitro; inner cell mass; lipid vesicle; mitochondrion; nonhuman; porosity; preimplantation embryo; priority journal; quantitative analysis; scanning electron microscopy; transmission electron microscopy; ultrastructure; zona pellucida; Animals; Blastocyst; Cattle; Fertilization in Vitro; Glycogen; Growth Hormone; Lipid Metabolism; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Mitochondria; Bovinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242712974

Subcutaneous and visceral (omental, epiploic) adipose tissue biopsies were obtained during abdominal hysterectomies. Body composition and adipose tissue distribution were measured before the surgery by dual x-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography, respectively. Ovarian hormone-deficient women tended to be older (P = 0.08) and were characterized by increased visceral adipose tissue area (P < 0.05). Subcutaneous adipocyte size, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, and basal lipolysis were not significantly different between groups. On the other hand, omental fat cell size was significantly higher in ovarian hormone-deficient women, compared with premenopausal women (P < 0.05). The omental/sc LPL activity ratio and omental adipocyte basal lipolysis were also significantly higher in ovarian hormone-deficient women (P < 0.05 for both comparisons). Significant positive correlations were found between visceral adipose tissue area and omental LPL activity (r = 0.54, P < 0.003), omental adipocyte basal lipolysis (r = 0.66, P < 0.0001), and omental fat cell size (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001). In multivariate analyses, ovarian status was no longer a significant predictor of adipose cell metabolism variables after visceral adipose tissue area was entered into the model, with the exception of the omental/sc LPL activity ratio, which remained independently associated with ovarian status. In conclusion, although the size of the visceral adipose tissue compartment was an important determinant of adipocyte metabolism in this depot, the increased omental/sc LPL activity ratio in ovarian hormone-deficient women supports the notion of a predominant visceral fat storage in these women.",,"hormone; lipoprotein lipase; abdomen; abdominal hysterectomy; adipocyte; adipose tissue; adult; age distribution; article; biopsy; body composition; cell metabolism; cell size; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; correlation analysis; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; enzyme activity; female; health status; hormone deficiency; hormone metabolism; human; lipolysis; menopause; menstrual cycle; multivariate analysis; omentum; ovary function; prediction; premenopause; preoperative period; priority journal; sampling; statistical significance; tissue distribution; Abdomen; Adipose Tissue; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Female; Hormones; Humans; Lipoprotein Lipase; Menopause; Middle Aged; Omentum; Ovary; Premenopause; Regression Analysis; Subcutaneous Tissue; Viscera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242668578

M5S 2S2, Canada","We have determined the underlying sites of H2O2 generation by isolated rat brain mitochondria and how these can shift depending on the presence of respiratory substrates, electron transport chain modulators and exposure to stressors. H2O2 production was determined using the fluorogenic Amplex red and peroxidase system. H2O 2 production was higher when succinate was used as a respiratory substrate than with another FAD-dependent substrate, α-glycerophosphate, or with the NAD-dependent substrates, glutamate/malate. Depolarization by the uncoupler p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone decreased H2O2 production stimulated by all respiratory substrates. H2O2 production supported by succinate during reverse transfer of electrons was decreased by inhibitors of complex I (rotenone and diphenyleneiodonium) whereas in glutamate/malate-oxidizing mitochondria diphenyleneiodonium decreased while rotenone increased H2O2 generation. The complex III inhibitors antimycin and myxothiazol decreased succinate-induced H 2O2 production but stimulated H2O2 production in glutamate/malate-oxidizing mitochondria. Antimycin and myxothiazol also increased H2O2 production in mitochondria using α-glycerophosphate as a respiratory substrate. In substrate/inhibitor experiments maximal stimulation of H2O2 production by complex I was observed with the α-glycerophosphate/antimycin combination. In addition, three forms of in vitro mitochondrial stress were studied: Ca 2+ overload, cold storage for more than 24 h and cytochrome c depletion. In each case we observed (i) a decrease in succinate-supported H 2O2 production by complex I and an increase in succinate-supported H2O2 production by complex III, (ii) increased glutamate/malate-induced H2O2 generation by complex I and (iii) increased α-glycerophosphate-supported H 2O2 generation by complex III. Our results suggest that all three forms of mitochondrial stress resulted in similar shifts in the localization of sites of H2O2 generation and that, in both normal and stressed states, the level and location of H2O 2 production depend on the predominant energetic substrate.","Brain mitochondria; Ca2+; Cytochrome c depletion; Hydrogen peroxide; Inhibitors of complexes I and III; Mitochondrial energetic substrates","amplex red; calcium ion; carbonyl cyanide 4 (trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; citrinin; cytochrome c; diphenyliodonium salt; flavine adenine nucleotide; fluorescent dye; glutamic acid; glycerophosphate; hydrogen peroxide; malic acid; myxothiazol; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; peroxidase; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; rotenone; succinic acid; ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; brain injury; brain mitochondrion; calcium homeostasis; cold stress; controlled study; degenerative disease; depolarization; electron transport; fluorescence; membrane potential; mitochondrial energy transfer; mitochondrial membrane; mitochondrial respiration; neurologic disease; nonhuman; oxidative stress; oxygen consumption; priority journal; rat; stroke; Animals; Brain; Brain Chemistry; Calcium; Cold; Cytochromes c; Electron Transport Complex I; Electron Transport Complex II; Electron Transport Complex III; Enzyme Inhibitors; Fluorescent Dyes; Hydrogen Peroxide; Ionophores; Mitochondria; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Reactive Oxygen Species; Uncoupling Agents; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142777700

It is estimated that 731 thermoelectric units, larger than 100 MWe, are operating nowadays, and their total installed capacity equals to 200.7 GWe. Coal contribution to the total electricity generation with reference to other fuel sources, is by far more intensive in the non-EU part (EU member candidate states , compared to the EU member states. It is expected that even after the enlargement, the European Union will strongly being related to coal. Enlargement will bring additional factors into play in order to meet the requirements of rising consumption, growing demand for conventional fuels and increasing dependence on imports. Besides the technology, boiler size, efficiency, age and environmental performance will determine the necessities of the coal-fired power sector in each country. Depending on the case, lifetime extension measures in operating coal-fired power plants or clean coal technologies can play an important role towards the energy sector restructuring. Low efficiency values in the non-EU coal-fired units and heavily aged power plants in EU countries will certainly affect decisions in favour of upgrading or reconstruction. The overall increase of efficiency, the reduction of harmful emissions from generating processes and the co-combustion of coal with biomass and wastes for generating purposes indicate that coal can be cleaner and more efficient. Additionally, plenty of rehabilitation projects based on CCT applications, have already been carried out or are under progress in the EU energy sector. The proclamations of the countries' energy policies in the coming decades, includes integrated renovation concepts of the coal-fired power sector. Further to the natural gas penetration in the electricity generation and CO2 sequestration and underground storage, the implementation of CCT projects will strongly contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions in the European Union, according to the targets set in the Kyoto protocol. In consequence, clean coal technologies can open up new markets not only in the EU member candidate states, but also in other parts of the world. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Clean coal technologies; CO2 reduction; Electricity generation; Rehabilitation","Coal; Electric power plants; Performance; Strategic planning; Energy production; Thermoelectric units; Electric power generation; cleaner production; coal-fired power plant; electricity generation; European Union; regionalization; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142714568

In the electron-ion collision energy range 0-207 eV resonances due to 2s → 2p (ΔN = 0) and 2s → 3l (ΔN = 1) core excitations were detected. At low energies below 0.15 eV the recombination rate coefficient is dominated by strong 1s2 (2s 2p 3P) 7l resonances with the strongest one occuring at an energy of only 21 meV. These resonances decisively influence the Mg IX recombination rate coefficient in a low temperature plasma. The experimentally derived Mg IX dielectronic recombination rate coefficient (± 15% systematical uncertainty) is compared with the recommendation by Mazzotta et al. (1998, A&amp;AS, 133, 403) and the recent calculations by Gu (2003, ApJ, 590, 1131) and by Colgan et al. (2003, A&amp;A, 412, 597). These results deviate from the experimental rate coefficient by 130%, 82% and 25%, respectively, at the temperature where the fractional abundance of Mg IX is expected to peak in a photoionized plasma. At this temperature a theoretical uncertainty in the 1s2 (2s 2p 3P) 7l resonance positions of only 100 meV would translate into an uncertainty of the plasma rate coefficient of almost a factor 3. This finding emphasizes that an accurate theoretical calculation of the Mg IX recombination rate coefficient from first principles is challenging.","Atomic data; Atomic processes; Line: formation; Plasmas; Radiation mechanisms: general","Electrons; Ions; Optical resolving power; Photoionization; Plasmas; Radiation; Resonance; Storage rings; Atomic data; Atomic processes; Photorecombination; Radiation mechanisms; Astrophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142681772

The isothermal kinetics reaction was described using a phenomenological equation based on the Malkin and Kulichikhin model, which was predicated originally for the isothermal curing kinetics of thermosetting polymers followed by differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) and was found to be applicable for rheokinetic reactions as well. An excellent representation of the data was obtained using this model; the rate of the reaction was found to be second order regardless of the temperature, which is in good agreement with literature data. The temperature dependence of the cross-linking rate constant was described by an Arrhenius plot with an apparent activation energy equal to 60-62 kJ mol-1, in reasonable agreement with the value obtained previously from the temperature dependence of gel time, tgel.

The apparent activation energy obtained nonisothermally was found to be frequency independent and equal to 72 kJ mol-1, in very good agreement with the value obtained isothermally from the temperature dependence of tgel in part II.","Dynamic viscosity; Isothermal and nonisothermal reaction; Rate of reaction; Reaction order","Activation energy; Aromatic polymers; Crosslinking; Differential scanning calorimetry; Reaction kinetics; Rheology; Thermal effects; Viscoelasticity; Viscosity; Dynamic viscosity; Isothermal reactions; Nonisothermal reactions; Reaction order; Macromolecules",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042843619

Since there have been no studies of iron status in elderly Danes after the abolishment of iron fortification, there is a need to assess actual iron status in the elderly population. The objective was to evaluate iron status and the relationship with food composition and dietary and supplemental iron intake in an elderly population in Copenhagen County. Participants in this health examination survey were 358 subjects (171 men, 187 women) 80 years of age from a 1914 cohort study. Blood samples included serum ferritin and hemoglobin (Hb). A dietary survey was performed in 232 subjects (120 men, 112 women) using a dietary history method. Median serum ferritin was 100 μg/l in men and 78 μg/l in women (p<0.001). Ferritin concentrations <16 μg/l (i.e., depleted iron stores) were found in three men (2%) and in ten women (5%). Median Hb was 140 g/l in men and 131 g/l in women (p< 0.001). Three subjects (0.84%) had iron deficiency anemia (i.e., ferritin <13 μg/l and Hb <5th percentile for iron-replete subjects (121 g/l in men, 114 g/l in women). Ferritin concentrations >300 μg/l (i.e., iron overload) were found in 15 (9%) men and in 5 (3%) women. Median dietary iron intake was higher in men (8.7 mg/day) than in women (7.3 mg/day) (p<0.001). Serum ferritin was positively correlated to dietary intake of iron, meat, and alcohol and to body mass index in men. Serum ferritin displayed a negative correlation to the consumption of tea. The use of vitamin-mineral supplements containing iron had no influence on iron status. Dietary intake of iron and/or the bioavailability of dietary iron were adequate to maintain a favorable iron status in 80-year-old subjects displaying a low prevalence of iron deficiency and a moderate prevalence of iron overload. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Aged; Body mass index; Diet surveys; Ferritin; Hemoglobins; Iron deficiency; Iron metabolism; Iron overload; Men; Women","C reactive protein; ferritin; hemoglobin; iron; aged; alcohol consumption; article; blood sampling; body mass; caloric intake; cohort analysis; concentration (parameters); controlled study; correlation analysis; Denmark; dietary intake; female; ferritin blood level; food composition; food intake; health status; human; iron deficiency anemia; iron intake; iron overload; iron storage; iron therapy; major clinical study; male; population research; priority journal; sex difference; statistical analysis; statistical significance; vitamin supplementation; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alcohol Drinking; Body Mass Index; Calcium, Dietary; Coffee; Cohort Studies; Denmark; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Energy Intake; Female; Ferritins; Food Analysis; Humans; Iron; Iron Overload; Male; Meat; Minerals; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Tea; Vitamins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042816934

This paper focuses on the dependence of the complex modulus of aged natural rubber vulcanizates on the filler network and polymer structure. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) at 30°C, 50°C, and 70°C on the aged rubbers with/without prestrain showed the Payne effect, i.e., a storage modulus drop with increasing amplitude, and the appearance of a loss tangent maximum at strain of about a few percent. The storage modulus increased with the aging time at 70°C, 24 < 72 < 240 hr, in the case of nonprestrain. When the prestrain was applied, strain-induced crystallization was generated that enhanced the storage modulus. As time passed, the prestrain relaxed and the crystalline structures began to disappear. After 72 hr, the crystalline structures had almost disappeared, and they had only a weak effect. Consequently, there existed a higher modulus for an aging time of 24 hr than 72 hr at testing temperatures of 30°C and 50°C. It was concluded that the storage modulus was determined by the postvulcanization, strain-induced crystallization, aging, and relaxing time.","Aging; Dynamic properties; Filler network; Natural rubber; Vulcanizate","Adsorption; Aging of materials; Crystalline materials; Desorption; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Energy dissipation; Microstructure; Vulcanization; Filled rubbers; Filler networks; Macromolecular structures; Storage modulus; Rubber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042803270

It investigates the impact of supply voltage, input dc level, transistor sizing, and temperature on the input offset voltage. The input dc level turns out to be most significant. Also, an analytical expression for the sensing delay is derived which shows low sensitivity on the input dc bias voltage. A figure of merit indicates that an input dc level of 0.7 VDD is optimal regarding speed and yield. Experimental results in 130-nm CMOS technology confirm that the yield can be significantly improved by lowering the input dc voltage to about 70% of the supply voltage. Thereby, the offset standard deviation decreases from 19 to 8.5 mV without affecting the delay.","Current sensing; Latch delay; Latch-type sense amplifier; Sense amplifier; SRAM circuits; SRAM yield; Yield optimization","Electric potential; Energy utilization; Optimization; Static random access storage; Transistors; VLSI circuits; Current sensing; Latch delay; Latch-type sense amplifiers; Sense amplifiers; SRAM circuits; SRAM yield; Yield optimization; Amplifiers (electronic)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042778488

Changes in the environment with increasing availability of food and decreasing physical activity are responsible for the substantial increase in prevalence of obesity. Reducing fat intake as part of dietary treatment is an effective means of reducing energy intake and reducing the risk of associated chronic diseases. Physical activity plays a critical role in the prevention of weight gain, the maintenance of reduced weight, and associated risk reduction. A behavioural approach to helping patients change their eating and activity behaviour is important in encouraging longer term changes in diet and physical activity. A better understanding of mechanisms regulating appetite provides an opportunity to identify potential targets for future drug treatments. Current drug therapies are useful adjuncts in those patients at risk from overweight and obesity where primary intervention with lifestyle modification has not resulted in weight loss sufficient to reduce medical risk.

In this study, we examined whether soy isoflavone, one of the phytoestrogens, and moderate exercise interventions exhibit cooperative effects on body composition and bone mass in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. Eight-week-old female mice were assigned to 6 groups: (1) sham-operated (sham); (2) OVX; (3) OVX with received a soy isoflavone diet (OVX+ISO); (4) OVX with exercised on a treadmill (OVX+EX); (5) OVX with given both isoflavone and exercise (OVX+ISO&EX); and (6) OVX with treated with 17 β-estradiol subcutaneously (OVX+E2). Body composition and bone mineral density (BMD) were estimated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). After the 6-week intervention, whole body fat (%) in the OVX group showed significantly higher than that in the sham group. Intervention of exercise and isoflavone alone partially inhibited OVX-induced body fat gain, and the combined intervention as well as E2 treatment completely restored fat mass to the sham level. Lean body mass in the whole body was not different in OVX group compared with that in OVX+ISO, OVX+EX, and OVX+E2 groups, but it was significantly higher in OVX+ISO&EX than in other groups. BMD of the whole body, lumbar spine, or femur showed significantly reduced by OVX, and the bone loss was partially inhibited by intervention of exercise or isoflavone alone. However, the combined intervention completely restored the bone mass to the level of sham, as did E2. Serum total cholesterol was significantly increased by OVX, which was normalized by the combined intervention or E2 treatment. These results demonstrate that combined intervention of soybean isoflavone and exercise prevented body fat accumulation in the whole body with an increase in lean body mass and restoration of bone mass, and reduced high serum cholesterol in OVX mice. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Other studies have concluded that the average zone cooling coil load of an air-conditioning system can be taken to comprise the sum of the average external load, internal loads, and terms representing the storage effects of the exterior wall and internal masses of the building components in that zone. This conceptual relationship is used as the basis for postulating an equation that linearly relates the cooling coil load of a building zone over a period to its external factor represented by the OTTV and its internal factors represented by all internal loads over the same period. It is also used to postulate an equation that relates the energy use by the building to the cooling coil load and the direct loads. This study utilizes DOE-2 simulation program in a series of parametric runs to develop an OTTV formulation each for four types of commercial buildings. The resulting OTTV formulations were used in further parametric runs to develop a formulation each for the cooling coil load and for energy use in the form postulated.

The mechanisms can, in principle, support the full sequence of write-read-erase-rewrite operations, and thus a next-generation data storage technology. Bit size ranges from 10 to 50 nm; read-write speeds are currently limited by single probe AFM operation. Electrically conducting diamond-like (DLC) films can be synthesised by an ion-beam assisted CVD route. Such films can be nano-machined with a probe by an ECM method. Present evidence suggests that local heating causes oxidation and prompt conversion to CO2. The process may be useful for fabricating stamps for nano-scale templating. Local deposition of thermal energy may also cause formation of a metastable low-density carbon phase. The phase is stable in vacuum, but will 'collapse' when oxygen is available, at a slow kinetic rate. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 is a potential regulator of energy expenditure and ATP production. We investigated the role of UCP-2 and the effects of a metalloprotease inhibitor, Y-39083, on hepatocellular injury in fatty liver allografts in rats. Materials and methods Rats were treated for 6 weeks with high-ethanol or isocalic dextrose-containing liquid diets that caused characteristic pericentral lipid accumulation. Alcoholic or nonalcoholic fatty livers from ACI (RT1a) rats were transplanted into LEW (RT1l) rats orthotopically. Hepatic necrosis was determined histologically following liver transplantation. UCP-2 mRNA levels in the hepatic allograft and in primary cultured hepatocytes from fatty liver stimulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined. Y-39083 was administered to recipient rats continuously at 5 mg/kg/day using an osmotic infusion mini-pump. Results The acute rejection index on day 5 posttransplant in alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty donor livers was higher than in lean grafts. Massive hepatocyte necrosis was more prominent in alcoholic than nonalcoholic fatty liver allografts and was not seen in lean allografts. UCP-2 transcripts in both alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver allografts were higher than in lean allografts. Serum TNF-α concentrations in recipient rats with either fatty liver allograft were greater than in animals with lean allografts. In vitro UCP-2 mRNA levels in primary cultured hepatocytes from both alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty livers increased more after stimulation with TNF-α than those from lean livers. In vitro TNF-α production by Kupffer cells isolated from alcohol-induced fatty liver allografts on day 3 posttransplant was greater than those from lean allografts. Y-39083 significantly reduced serum concentrations of TNF-α and prevented massive hepatocellular necrosis in rats with both alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver allografts. Conclusion Liver grafts with steatosis up-regulated UCP-2. TNF-α further enhanced UCP-2 transcripts, inducing massive hepatocellular necrosis during acute rejection. Posttransplantation necrosis may be prevented by metalloprotease inhibitors. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

A Peak high-speed camera was synchronized with a Kistler force plate (600Hz) to collect the biomechanics parameters. Differences between mean values were analyzed by a t-test for independent samples. The present research showed that during down ward countermovement, the 18-year-old group produced a larger displacement of ankle, knee, and CG in crouch phase (p < .05) and higher vertical ground reaction forces, whereas the CG was lowest (p <. 05), and that the group produced greater leg and joint stiffness (p <. 05) to create larger elastic energy generation and storage. For the 6-year-old group, the lower extremity could not be extended completely during push phase. Thus, the lack of prestretch, lower stiffness, and incomplete extension in the 6-year-old group is thought to influence jumping performance.

We compare heat, power, and CO2 balances of systems with alternative configurations of the CHP and CO2-capture systems. Because the captured CO2 comes from renewable biomass, the studied systems yield negative CO2 emissions. It is shown that pulp mills and integrated pulp and paper mills have the potential to become net exporters of biomass-based electricity while at the same time removing CO2 from the atmosphere on a net basis. The study shows that that the overall best CO2 abatement is achieved when CO2 capture is carried out within a biomass integrated gasifier with combined cycle where the syngas undergoes a CO-shift reaction. This configuration combines efficient energy conversion with a high CO2 capture efficiency. Furthermore, cost curves are constructed, which show how the cost of CO2 capture and storage in pulp and paper mills depends on system configuration and the CO2 transportation distance. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this system, the collector and storage were installed in one unit. All parts of the system have been fabricated from fiberglass reinforced polyester (GFRP) using a special resin composition that provides good thermal conductivity and absorptivity. The storage tank has a capacity of 329 l. The design of the storage system was sandwich construction, with the core material made out of polyurethane foam, which combines stiffness and lightness of structure with very good thermal insulation. The width and length of the absorber plat were 1.4 and 1.8 m, respectively. The performance of the system has been investigated by two methods. In the first method, the storage tank was filled up with water the night before the test. The tank was then drained during the night, refilled and made ready for the next day's test. The tests were repeated under varied environmental conditions for several days. The maximum water temperature in the storage tank of 63 °C has been achieved for a clear day operation at an average solar radiation level of 700 W m-2 and ambient temperature of 30 °C. The decrease of water temperature with and without the thermal diode is 10 and 20 °C, respectively. In the second method, the testing was of the same way, but in this case without draw-off or draining of the hot water from the storage tank. All data readings were recorded from sunrise to sunset over the same period. The temperature was recorded for several days and ranges of 60-63 °C were obtained in the storage tank.

However, the mechanisms that link increased fat mass with hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and coronary heart disease have not been fully elucidated. Unravelling the diverse neuroendocrine systems, which regulate energy balance and body fat has been a long-standing challenge in biology, with obesity as an increasingly important public health focus. Until recently, the adipocyte has been considered only a passive tissue for the storage of excess energy in the form of fat. However, there is now compelling evidence that adipocytes act as endocrine, secretory cells. It has been shown that several hormones, growth factors and cytokines are actually expressed in white adipose tissue. In a dynamic view of the adipocyte a wide range of signals emanates from white adipose tissue such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and their respective soluble receptors. White adipose tissue also secretes important regulators of lipoprotein metabolism like lipoprotein lipase (LPL), apolipoprotein E (apoE) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). The increasing number of products secreted by adipocytes also includes leptin, estrogen, angiotensinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue factor and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) has been also reported to be expressed in white adipose tissue. Acylation stimulating protein (ASP), adipophilin, adipoQ, adipsin, monobutyrin, agouti protein and factors related to pro-inflammatory and immune processes have also been shown to be released by white adipocytes.

The hydrogen storage capacity (1.37 wt%) at 298 K, discharge capacity (320 mA h/g) and cycling stability (where 88% of the initial capacity remained after 300 charge/discharge cycles) of the alloy are as good as those of the commercial MmNi3.55Co0.75Mn0.4Al0.3 alloy.

This type of plant is applied to a commercially available cold store, generally adopted for preservation of foodstuff. Its working is regulated by on/off cycles of the compressor, operating at the nominal frequency of 50 Hz, imposed by the classical thermostatic control. The problems related to the replacement of the fully halogenated chlorofluorcarbons (CFCs) and of the partially halogenated (HCFCs) have been only partially solved. As for R22, there is no unanimous solution for its substitution. In this paper, the refrigerant fluid experimentally tested as a substitute for R22 is the non-azeotropic mixture R417A. R417A is a non-ozone depleting long term replacement for R22, which can be used in new and existing direct expansion systems using traditional R22 lubricants. R417A provides an easy solution to the legislation requirement, since it presents an ozone depletion potential equal to zero, and it does not require a change of lubricant type, equipment redesign or significant modifications. The experimental analysis has allowed the determination of the best energetic performances of R22 in comparison with those of R417A in terms of the coefficient of performance, exergetic efficiency, exergy destroyed in the plant components and other variables characterizing the refrigeration plant performance. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

G9A 5H7, Canada","The Hydrogen Research Institute (HRI) has developed a stand-alone renewable energy (RE) system based on energy storage in the form of hydrogen. When the input devices (wind generator and photovoltaic array) produce more energy than is required by the load, the excess energy is converted by an electrolyzer to electrolytic hydrogen, which is then stored after stages of compression, purification and filtration. Conversely, during a time of input energy deficit, this process is reversed and the hydrogen produced earlier is reconverted to electrical energy through a fuel cell. The oxygen which has been produced by the electrolyzer during the hydrogen production is also stored at high pressure, after having gone through a purification and drying process. This stored oxygen can be re-utilized as oxidant in place of compressed air in the fuel cell. The modifications of the electrolyzer for oxygen storage and re-utilization of it as oxidant for the fuel cell are presented. Furthermore, the HRI has designed and developed the control system with power conditioning devices for effective energy management and automatic operation of the RE system. The experimental results show that a reliable autonomous RE system can be realized for such seasonal energy sources, using stored hydrogen as the long-term energy buffer, and that utilizing the electrolyzer oxygen by-product as oxidant in the fuel cell increases system performance significantly. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In the powders reactively alloyed directly under hydrogen some quantity of nanocrystalline β-MgH2 hydride was formed during the first 10-15h of milling. However, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks due to β-MgH2 disappeared after further milling up to 59h. In addition, the XRD peaks corresponding to the nanocrystalline Mg completely disappeared after 20-24h of CRMA under hydrogen in both batches of powders while strong but broadened peaks from Fe were still visible. The absorption of hydrogen from the milling vial occurred continuously up to 20-24h of milling. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis clearly showed that Mg was still present in the microstructure of powder particles after milling up to 59h for both batches of 2Mg-Fe powder. These results clearly indicate that amorphous Mg and amorphous hydrides are being formed after prolonged CRMA under shearing mode. It has been shown for the first time that β-MgH2 undergoes hydrolysis into Mg(OH) 2 when it is exposed for several months to the moisture in the environment. This is associated with abnormally high weight losses (∼10wt.%) measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the appearance of two endothermic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) peaks related to the desorption of hydrogen from β-MgH2 and release of water from Mg(OH)2. Other powders after prolonged milling showed TGA weight losses on the order of 2-4wt.% and only a single DSC peak, which provides additional strong evidence that amorphous hydrides were formed during CRMA. During DSC tests up to 500°C the amorphous Mg crystallized into the nanocrystalline Mg phase. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The specific granulometric surface area and the structural disorder sphalerite were also analyzed by X-ray diffraction laser particle size analyzer and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis, respectively. A new method to measure the mechanically activated storage energy of minerals was proposed by designing a thermochemical cycle that made mechanically activated and non-activated mineral reaching the same final state while leaching in FeCl3 solution. The results indicate that the mechanically activated storage energy of sphalerite rises with the increased grinding time and is closely related to the lattice distortions and crystallite sizes. The calorimetric results of the products from sieved in water or ethanol medium and the products from 2 h treatment of mechanically activated sphalerite under pure argon (99.99 vol.%) at different temperatures indicate that the mechanically activated storage energy of sphalerite is caused mainly by changes of the crystal structure, and the reactivity of mechanically activated sphalerite is difficult to lose. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Calorimetric method; Leaching; Mechanical activation; Sphalerite; Structural disorder","alcohol; argon; ferric chloride; water; zinc sulfide; calorimetry; conference paper; crystal structure; leaching; particle size; X ray diffraction; X ray powder diffraction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542502484

These variations, and the wide range of environments, require great adaptability and strong protective systems. The complete genome sequencing of this bacterium has revealed an enormous number and variety of ORFs associated with alternative pathways for energy generation, transport-related proteins, signal transduction, cell motility, secretion, and secondary metabolism. Additionally, the limited availability of iron in most environments can be overcome by iron-chelating compounds, iron-storage proteins, and by several proteins related to iron metabolism in the C. violaceum genome. Osmotically inducible proteins, transmembrane water-channel, and other membrane porins may be regulating the movement of water and maintaining the cell turgor, activities which play an important role in the adaptation to variations in osmotic pressure. Several proteins related to tolerance against antimicrobial compounds, heavy metals, temperature, acid and UV light stresses, others that promote survival under starvation conditions, and enzymes capable of detoxifying reactive oxygen species were also detected in C. violaceum. All these features together help explain its remarkable competitiveness and ability to survive under different types of environmental stresse.","Adaptability; Chromobacterium; Secondary metabolism; Stress tolerance","antiinfective agent; aquaporin; bacterial enzyme; chelating agent; heavy metal; iron; porin; reactive oxygen metabolite; toxic substance; water; bacterial genome; bacterial metabolism; bacterial survival; cell motility; cell protection; cell secretion; cell turgor; Chromobacterium; chromobacterium violaceum; conference paper; environmental temperature; evolutionary adaptation; gene sequence; iron chelation; iron metabolism; iron storage; iron transport; membrane potential; nonhuman; open reading frame; osmotic pressure; oxidative stress; pH; signal transduction; starvation; stress; ultraviolet radiation; water flow; adaptation; article; ecosystem; genetics; metabolism; oxidative stress; physiology; temperature; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chromobacterium; Chromobacterium violaceum; Negibacteria; Adaptation, Physiological; Chromobacterium; Ecosystem; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Open Reading Frames; Oxidative Stress; Temperature; Ultraviolet Rays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542486360

We utilize scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to characterize the surface structure of annealed GTF electrodes. Electrochemical measurements commonly used to probe the reactivity of carbon electrodes are also employed to characterize the annealed GTF electrodes. Our findings indicate substantial structural changes in which the annealed films undergo extensive graphitization at treatment temperatures above 900°C.

Methods: The pancreas grafts subjected to 30-120 min warm ischemia were preserved by the UW solution cold storage method for 24 h. The tissue concentrations of adenine nucleotides (AN) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and total adenine nucleotides (TAN) were determined by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the viability of the pancreas graft was tested in the canine model of segmental pancreas autotransplantation. Results: The functional success rates of pancreas grafts of groups after 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min of warm ischemia were 100%, 100%, 67.7%, 0%, respectively. There was an excellent correlation between the posttransplant viability and tissue concentration of ATP and TAN at the end of preservation. Conclusion: The UW solution cold storage method was effective for functional recovery of the pancreas suffering 60-min warm ischemia. The tissue concentration of ATP and TAN at the end of 24 h preservation by the UW solution cold storage method would predict the posttransplant outcome of pancreas graft subjected to significant warm ischemia.

At the initial stage of plastic deformation the dependence of d e s/dwp on the plastic strain εp has a maximum.It has been suggested that the maximum of d e s/dwp is connected with long-range stresses caused by the polycrystalline nature of the material. A polycrystalline specimen deforms plastically, non-uniformly on a micro-scale, each grain in a polycrystal deforms by a different amount depending on its orientation and the constraints imposed thereon by its neighbours.In order to verify the hypothesis, two groups of specimens were prepared in which the impact of long-range internal micro-stresses on the energy storage rate differs. This requirement was achieved using specimens pre-strained in different directions.The dependence of the energy storage rate on the plastic strain for the pre-strained specimens was experimentally found. The results obtained seem to confirm the hypothesis. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This is highly appealing since the 'switching' of such interactions is a principal difficulty in creating real devices. It has been established that one can employ 'always-on' interactions in a one-dimensional Heisenberg chain, provided that one can tune the Zeeman energies of the individual (pseudo-)spins. It is important to generalize this scheme to higher-dimensional networks, since a real device would probably be of that kind. Such generalizations have been proposed, but only at the severe cost that the efficiency of qubit storage must fall. Here we propose the use of multi-qubit gates within such higher-dimensional arrays, finding a novel threequbit gate that can in fact increase the efficiency beyond the linear model. Thus, we are able to propose higher-dimensional networks that can constitute a better embodiment of the 'always-on' concept-a substantial step towards bringing this novel idea to full fruition.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544276952

In order to understand the interplay between their structural order, chemical order and magnetic properties, the corresponding bulk alloys in various hypothetically ordered phases were also calculated. In the bulk alloys and in most of the clusters there is an induced magnetic moment on the Rh atoms with increasing Co concentration which results in an increase in the average magnetic moment per atom. This effect, when present, may be twice as large in the clusters than in the corresponding macroscopic alloys. For low-symmetry clusters structures, the substitution of Rh by Co atoms results in a remarkable enhancement of the local magnetic moment at the Rh neighbours even at low Co concentration. On the other hand, the Co doping effect can be masked in cluster geometries of higher symmetry in which pure Rh clusters already show a high magnetic moment. In addition it is shown that local coordination and magnetic energy are the leading parameters for the determination of the stability and magnetic enhancement, whereas chemical order seems less important.",,"Correlation methods; Deformation; Doping (additives); Isomers; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic moments; Magnetic recording; Probability density function; Signal to noise ratio; Substitution reactions; Density functional theory; Magnetic energy; Size reduction effects; Storage capacity; Transition metal alloys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042585760

We used natural graphite (NG) and activated carbon fibers (ACF) and compared them with activated carbon (AC) powders. The XRD patterns of NG and ACF milled for over 20h and SEM images of these samples milled for 80h were almost the same as those of AC. The hydrogen storage capacities of NG and ACF estimated by the inert gas fusion-thermal conductivity method increased with the mechanical milling time up to 10h and showed little milling time dependence thereafter. The capacities of NG and ACF reached about 3.0wt.% and were similar to that of AC. However, it should be noted that the hydrogen storage mechanism of NG and ACF mechanically milled in an H2 atmosphere might be different because the changes in their specific surface areas with milling time were opposite. Thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS) revealed that the desorption spectra of the hydrogen molecules (mass number=2) of NG and ACF milled for 10h in the same way as AC contained two peaks at about 500 and 800°C. The desorption activation energies of hydrogenated NG and ACF at these peaks calculated from a Kissinger plot were almost with the same as those of hydrogenated AC. This suggests that the state of the hydrogen trapped in the structural defects in NG introduced by the mechanical milling may be almost the same as that of AC. In addition, we assumed the possibility that the state of the hydrogen in ACF hydrogenated by mechanical milling could be almost the same as that in hydrogenated AC. We considered that the nanocarbon materials hydrogenated under our milling conditions had very similar physical shapes and hydrogen storage capacities, independent of their host structures. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In a previous paper, recently focused, hydrogen storage alloy of ternary Mg-Ni-Cu system was successfully produced based on this method, to improve the property of a typical hydrogen storage alloy, Mg 2Ni. However, since there are still many operating parameters for that production, relationship between operating conditions and the product property is not still well explained. Therefore, the effect of synthesis temperature, as important operating condition, on the hydrogen storage capacity and hydriding rate of the product was mainly examined in this study. Products synthesized at extremely different temperatures of 753, 773, 798 and 823K and hydrogen pressure of 4.0MPa were analyzed, identified and characterized by means of the hydriding curve at 573K, the patterns of X-ray diffraction and the images of scanning electron microscope. The results revealed that the synthesis temperature in a ternary system of hydrogen storage alloys by HCS is more sensitive and more significant than in a binary system to balance two aspects; the product activity for hydriding reaction and the reaction completion of combustion synthesis. The results also indicated that the HCS process was very attractive to produce the ternary Mg-Ni-Cu system of hydrogen storage alloy from the viewpoints of saving energy, saving time and controlling the specific composition of the products. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The forward acquisition problem is modelled by a Gaussian distribution of the position of interaction on a detector head, centred at the measured position. The a posteriori probability that an event originates from a certain point in the field of view (FOV) is calculated by integrating all the possible lines of response (LORs) through this point, weighted with the Gaussian detection likelihood at the LOR's end points. We have calculated these a posteriori probabilities both for perpendicular and oblique coincidences. For the oblique coincidence case it was necessary to incorporate the effect of the crystal thickness in the calculations. We found in the perpendicular incidence case as well as in the oblique incidence case that the probability density function cannot be analytically expressed in a closed form, and it was thus calculated by means of numerical integration. A Gaussian was fit to the transversal profiles of this function for a given distance to the detectors. From these fits, we can conclude that the profiles can be accurately approximated by a Gaussian, both for perpendicular and oblique coincidences. The FWHM reaches a maximum at the detector heads, and decreases towards the centre of the FOV, as was expected. Afterwards we extended this two-dimensional model to three dimensions, thus incorporating the spatial uncertainty in both transversal directions. This theoretical model was then evaluated and a very good agreement was found with theoretical calculations and with geometric Monte Carlo simulations. Possible improvements for the above-described incorporation of crystal thickness are discussed. Therefore a detailed Monte Carlo study has been performed in order to investigate the interaction probability of photons of different energies along their path in several detector materials dedicated to PET. Finally two approaches for the incorporation of this theoretical model in reconstruction algorithms are outlined. © 2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Algorithms; Image reconstruction; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Positron emission tomography; Probability; Probability density function; Crystal thickness; Gaussian distribution; Positron emission tomography (PET); Biomedical engineering; accuracy; algorithm; article; calculation; camera; crystal; density; energy; image reconstruction; molecular interaction; Monte Carlo method; normal distribution; photon; positron emission tomography; priority journal; probability; theoretical model; thickness; Algorithms; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Positron-Emission Tomography; Reproducibility of Results; Scattering, Radiation; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042780402

The rise in fracture energy with SEBS introduction appears in the whiteness of the SEM microphotographs, first as white crests and in PS-HI + SEBS blend with higher SEBS content as globular structures.",,"Butenes; Ethylene; Extruders; Glass transition; Natural frequencies; Polystyrenes; Rheology; Scanning electron microscopy; Strain; Styrene; Thermoplastics; Viscosity; Creep relaxation; Storage modulus; Temperature superposition principle (TTS); Thermooxidative degradation; Block copolymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942752406

Dithienylenephenylene (TBT) produced was complexed with copper acetate to give di-TBT copper complex [Cu(TBT) 2]. This was complexed once more with a metal salt to give the 12-ring tri-metal oligomer M[Cu(TBT)2]2, where M is Co, Ni, or Cu. The presence of different transition metal ions allowed the comparison of the chemical and physical properties of the mixed metal complexes. The 12-ring mixed metal complexes were characterized through a comparative study of FTIR, electronic spectra and thermal analyses (TGA and DSC) in addition to the elemental analyses and metal content. A comparative study of the dc electrical conductivity in its intrinsic and 5% I2-doped states with temperature variation in the range 300-500K allowed tracing the action of the three different transition metals on the dc electrical conductivity of the mixed metal complexes. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The system proposed in this report was composed of a (10, 10) carbon nanotube, three C60'S and two copper electrodes encapsulated in (10, 10) carbon nanotube. Since the lowest energy configurations were found in the both ends terminated by C60'S attached at copper electrodes, the interactions between C60'S stabilized the shuttle fullerene at the both ends of the proposed system. Therefore, the bit flops could be classified with both the position of the shuttle media and the potential energy of the system. Molecular simulation results showed that the switching speed, the applied force field, and the active region should be considered to design the proposed system.

Moving against the electrons kinetic energy gradient, these structures enable the anomalous transport of matter and energy from the plasma to the surrounding.

Ten types of composite weaning diets (namely, maize-rojo beans-peanut, maize-peanut-sardines, maize-peanut-sardine-rojo beans, maize-peanut-soaked rojo beans, maize-peanut-germinated rojo beans, sorghum-rojo beans-peanut, sorghum-peanut-sardines, sorghum-peanut-sardine-rojo beans, sorghum-peanut-soaked rojo beans, and sorghum-peanut-germinated rojo beans) were formulated and assayed for proximate composition, energy, mineral density, tannin content and residual urease activity. The diets were also evaluated for storage stability under ambient conditions, sensory quality and overall acceptability. Results of the study indicated that, concentrations of protein, fat, ash, calcium, iron, zinc and copper were significantly (P < 0.05) increased when plain maize and sorghum gruels were enriched with rojo beans, peanut paste and/or ground sardines. Soaking and germinating the rojo beans and dehulling the sorghum reduced the concentration of tannins in the gruels significantly (P < 0.05). Residual urease activity ranged between 0.00 and 0.07 units, about 10-fold lower than the maximum level (0.8 units) allowed in weaning foods. Both maize and sorghum-based composite gruels had a short shelf-life under ambient conditions (26.4°C) ranging between 4 and 6 h, with gruels containing ground sardines showing a tendency to spoil faster. All composite gruels except those containing germinated rojo beans were highly liked and accepted by consumers (P < 0.05), similar to the plain maize and sorghum gruels. The maize and sorghum-based composite products therefore have a potential for use as weaning and/or supplementary foods for older infants and young children. Further investigations are suggested to extend the shelf-life of the composite products and improve the organoleptic quality of the diets containing germinated rojo beans. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"calcium; copper; fatty acid; iron; protein; tannin; urease; zinc; article; ash; bean; caloric intake; child; child nutrition; consumer; cooking; diet supplementation; dietary intake; enzyme activity; flour; food composition; food industry; food intake; food processing; food quality; food spoilage; food storage; human; infant; maize; malnutrition; mineral intake; nutrient content; nutritional value; organoleptic property; peanut; shelf life; sorghum; weaning; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Arachis hypogaea; Female; Fishes; Humans; Infant; Infant Food; Mothers; Nutritive Value; Phaseolus; Sorghum; Weaning; Zea mays; Arachis hypogaea; Clupeidae; Fraxinus; Phaseolus (angiosperm); Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644346532

A FEM (Finite Element Method) simulation model was developed to display the nonlinear mechanical deformation of a modified D-shaped elemental coil with a Rutherford type conductor in a 1 kWh/1 MW practical SMES. The model uses nonlinear mechanical characteristics of a conductor measured by bending test. The conductor's nonlinear mechanical characteristics are roughly explained by the frictional slip between two layers in the conductor. This paper describes two types of slip models between the conductor and the coil spacer, taking into account FEM simulation models, and examines the detailed mechanical behaviors of the coil.

Together with the Euratom Safeguards Office, as Germany does not have a domestic safeguards authority, a series of actions was initiated and carried out to enable German operators to understand and accomplish their new duties under the AP. Now, with the AP entering into force on April 30, 2004, it is time to look ahead to shape the prospective integrated safeguards system. As we hope and expect, the new integrated safeguards system will be a thoroughly revised and optimized system that grants the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) the necessary scope and flexibility to focus on areas of real concern and to respond to alarming events in an adequate manner, such as significant unresolved questions and inconsistencies, significant anomalies, and safeguards implementation problems. Our expectations with regard to the general structure of integrated safeguards aim more at an event driven and less at a procedure driven system like the present system. Though Germany is phasing out of nuclear energy use for electricity production, the related safeguards tasks are not phasing out in the foreseeable future. About one-half of German nuclear power plants have a license to use MOX fuel. Most of the power plants build or intend to build on-site interim dry-storage facilities for spent fuel. Therefore, a lot of work will have to be done towards the implementation of concrete approaches and measures under integrated safeguards in the German facilities.",,"Additional Protocol; Dry storage facilities; International safeguards system; International cooperation; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Public policy; Radioactive waste storage; Spent fuels; Nuclear materials safeguards",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344685367

The loss is evaluated analytically by a newly developed electromagnetic analysis program. This proposed magnetic rail construction suppresses inhomogeneous magnetic fields generated by the existence of such spaces as temperature change countermeasures.

The assembling process will be performed in 2003. The 3MJ SMES will be operated at 1000 amps in the cryogenic environment of 4.2 K. So, it is essential to minimize the heat load from room temperature and to optimize its ohmic heating. A bundle of brass sheets with optimized length/area ratio was used for the metal part of the current lead and it is connected to HTS current lead in series. Two GM cryocooler sinks out the heat load and also the ohmic heating of the current lead which is located in vacuum chamber of the cryostat. Cold head of the cryocooler which is extended to the HTS lead with layered OFHC sheets keeps the temperature under the critical temperature of the HTS lead.

The most important feature of superconducting coil system for the UPS-SMES is easy handling and maintenance-free operation. We have selected Low Temperature Superconducting (LTS) coils instead of High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) coils from the viewpoint of cost and performance. However, it is difficult for the conventional LTS coils to fulfill maintenance-free operation since the cooling methods are either pool boiling with liquid helium or forced flow of supercritical helium. Thus, a conduction cooled LTS pulse coil has been designed as a key component of the UPS-SMES.

Force-Balanced Coil (FBC) which is a helically wound toroidal coil can control the distribution of working stresses and minimize the structure requirements by selecting an optimal number of poloidal turns. The winding current density of a superconducting coil is estimated from the relationship between ampere-meters of conductor and structure requirements based on the virial theorem. In this case, the FBC can obtain the stored energy for the same winding current density 20 times larger than that in the toroidal field coils case and about 120 times larger than that in the solenoid case. By applying the FBC concept, superconducting magnets will be realized in smaller size.","Electromagnetic force; Helical coil; High field magnets; SMES; The virial theorem; Winding current densities","Electromagnetic forces; Helical coils; High field magnets; The virial theorem; Winding current densities; Current density; Electric conductors; Electric current measurement; Energy storage; Parameter estimation; Refrigeration; Solenoids; Stress analysis; Superconducting magnets; Tensile stress; Thermodynamic stability; Electromagnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344630962

Commercially available capacitors are normally designed for long storage time and long lifetime. The performance of capacitors in terms of energy density capability can be improved by overstress or overcharge, that is, charging to a significantly higher energy density than specified. This paper explores the limits of overstressing commercially available capacitors for short time spans. The selected capacitors have a nominal dc voltage in the range of 2.5-10 kV and a capacitance in the range of 0.015-0.12 μF. Two different storage times have been considered: 2 μs and 20 ms. A high-voltage test setup was constructed.

With the signing and ratification of the Additional Protocol, Canada embarked on a new safeguards path - a path that ultimately will lead to integrated safeguards once the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is able to provide credible assurance on the non-diversion of declared nuclear material and on the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities. The path we are on included preparations prior to signing the Additional Protocol, preparations for and the conclusion of the initial declaration, implementation of the Additional Protocol, updating declarations, and providing clarifications. These are all part of the steps necessary for the IAEA to reach a conclusion that all nuclear material has been placed under safeguards and remains in peaceful nuclear activities or is otherwise accounted for. Canada has also been preparing for the implementation of integrated safeguards in Canada by participating in the conceptualization of IS, providing technical expertise to aid in determining efficient and effective implementation and performing trials of safeguards concepts.

To cope with this problem, It has been studied to install the superconducting magnetic energy storage system (SMES) in railway substations. However, the scale of installation becomes too large because of low space factor of SMES, and hampers its realization. Then, it is considered to use SMES only for suppression of the high frequency component of load fluctuation, and to combine with a large capacity battery storage (BEMS), which can not follow fast fluctuation and covers its low frequency component. A novel control scheme of this combined energy storage system is proposed. The fluctuation of power demand caused by high speed train operations in a railway substation is measured separately in the frequency range and used to regulate both SMES and BEMS to suppress fluctuation. With simulation studies based on the load model of high speed train operation at a certain substation, this hybrid approach and its control scheme are verified effective. The system configuration is compact enough to be installed at a substation.","Flow battery; High speed transportation; Hybrid energy storage system; Load leveling; SMES","Electric batteries; Electric frequency measurement; Electric power systems; Electric transformers; Fourier transforms; Low pass filters; Superconducting cables; Superconducting magnets; Flow battery; High speed transportation; Hybrid energy storage system; Load leveling; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344595003

Recently, we had developed the FBC concept using the virial theorem, and derived the winding pitch of helical coils as a function of the coil aspect ratio, where the distribution of stress is nearly uniform and working stress is minimized. Coils with the winding pitch were named as FBC's with the virial-limit condition or simply virial-limit coils (VLC), and their excellent characters of stress were confirmed by experiments of a two-layered helical coil which can simulate arbitrary winding pitch numbers. Measurements of distributions of stress on the winding form of the coil proved that a minimum working stress and uniform stress were achieved under the VLC condition. In this paper, stress distributions in FBC's with a monolithic winding form were investigated by FEM, and the results by FEM were compared with the experiments and the analytic solutions of a two-dimensional ideal shell model. Although the shell model could not explain the experimental results, qualitative agreements between FEM and the experiment were obtained.","Coil; Energy; FEM; Magnetic field; SMES; Stress; Superconductivity; Tensor; Virial theorem","Coils; Energy; Stress; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Virial theorem; Astrophysics; Finite element method; Kinetic energy; Mathematical models; Stress analysis; Superconductivity; Tensors; Electric coils",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344584479

The shape dependences were evaluated by using the ratios of the length and the cross section (L/A) both for the copper and thermoelectric (TE) semiconductor parts. The calculation results indicate that the L/A of the TE semiconductor is much smaller than that of the copper lead. This is due to the fact that the thermal and electric conductivities of the bismuth telluride alloy, which is used as the TE semiconductor, are much smaller than that of copper. Moreover, the heat leakage of the PCL is not sensitive to the L/A of the copper like the conventional current lead (CCL)s'. The characteristics of the PCL were evaluated and compared with that of the CCL experimentally. The heat leakages of both the PCL and the CCL increased with the increase of the current.

The developed Bi-2212 wire for SMES coils achieves high-performance conductive characteristics that do not deteriorate in high magnetic fields beyond 10 T, which enable compactly arranged SMES coils to be operated in a high magnetic field, and SMES coils of the Bi-2212 wire can be adequately insulated due to a high temperature margin. Therefore it is possible for the SMES coils to enhance dielectric strength and output power. The insulating, cooling and conductive characteristics of 4 unit coils (Outer Diameter: 700 mm, Height: 127 mm, Stored Energy: 90 kJ) were checked under a variety of conditions. Moreover, fundamental performance tests were done on bridging instantaneous voltage dips, using a 125 kW resistance and 50 kW motor as imitation loads. Testing showed that the HTS SMES operated reliably.

In these applications, the use of low-loss type conductors as strand cables are necessary to reduce ac losses accompanied with rapid changes of magnetic fields; however, it brings some difficulties of high cost and low mechanical strength of the superconducting coil. To solve the above problems, the shielding coil system, which is composed of a main superconducting coil and a normal shielding coil connected in parallel, were proposed. In the shielding coil system, the fluctuated current at energy input and output is diverted to the shielding coil and only the constant current flows in the main superconducting coil. In this paper, we propose a new shielding coil system of toroidal arrangement, which has low stray magnetic fields in ambient areas. Results of the optimization of coil configurations in the toroidal shielding system are presented. Besides the toroidal systems of the circular elementary coil, those of D-shaped elementary coils, which have lower electromagnetic stress than circular one, are also studied.","Modified D-shaped coil; Shielding coil; SMES; Toroidal coil","Boundary conditions; Electric coils; Electric potential; Electromagnetic shielding; Magnetic fields; Optimization; Power control; Problem solving; Modified D-shaped coils; Shielding coils; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Toroidal coils; Superconducting magnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344565069

Algorithms are presented which link carbon and nitrogen turnover in a dynamic prediction of CH4 and N2O emissions during handling and use of liquid manure (slurry). A sub-model for CH4 emissions during storage relates CH4 emissions to VS, temperature and storage time, and estimates the reduction in VS. A second sub-model estimates N2O emissions from field-applied slurry as a function of VS, slurry N and soil water potential, but emissions are estimated using emission factors. The model indicated that daily flushing of slurry from cattle houses would reduce total annual CH4 + N2O emissions by 35% (CO2 eq.), and that cooling of pig slurry in-house would reduce total annual CH4 + N2O emissions by 21% (CO2 eq.). Anaerobic digestion of slurry and organic waste produces CH4 at the expense of VS. Accordingly, the model predicted a 90% reduction of CH4 emissions from outside stores with digested slurry, and a &gt; 50% reduction of N 2O emissions after spring application of digested as opposed to untreated slurry. The sensitivity of the model towards storage temperature and soil water potential was examined. This study indicates that simple algorithms to account for ambient climatic conditions may significantly improve the prediction of CH4 and N2O emissions from animal manure.","Animal manure; Denitrification; Digestion; Methane; Nitrification; Nitrous oxide","algorithm; manure; methane; nitrification; nitrous oxide; soil emission; Animalia; Bos taurus; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3442900298

The new, third generation storage ring-based X-ray sources, like the ESRF, are optimized for SR emission. These new machines can produce X-rays with unprecedented features like extremely high brilliance, very small divergence of the beam and wide energy spectrum.

While this approach provides a unified software framework for event selection, it poses strict requirements on offline components critical for the Level-2 trigger. A Level-2 decision in ATLAS must typically be accomplished within 10 ms and with multiple event processing in concurrent threads.To address these constraints, prototypes have been developed that incorporate elements of the ATLAS data flow, high level trigger, and offline framework software. To realize a homogeneous software environment for offline components in the HLT, the Level-2 Steering Controller was developed. With electron/gamma-and muon-selection slices it has been shown that the required performance can be reached, if the offline components used are carefully designed and optimized for the application in the HLT.","Programming environments; Software reusability; Triggering","Event filter (EF); Large hadron collider (LHC); Programming environments; Triggering; Algorithms; Buffer storage; Calorimeters; Detectors; Electromagnetism; High energy physics; Information analysis; Magnetic fields; Software prototyping; Solenoids; Spectrometers; Superconducting materials; Computer software",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3342937704

Diurnal and seasonal variations of fluxes are simulated reasonably with general stomatal parameters at all sites. In the grassland site, the Bowen ratio is 0.2 in midsummer; it is smaller than that in forest sites (about 1). Sensitivity tests indicate that leaf area should be given accurately along with total plant area index including stem and branch areas. If both plant and leaf areas are given, the outline of seasonal heat balance can be simulated using the same stomatal parameters for forests and grassland sites with the model. In the larch site on the left bank of the Lena River, although input precipitation varies widely from 82 to 236 mm year to year from 1998 through 2000, calculated total evapotranspiration varies only within a range of 50 mm around 238 mm the larch site. Understory evapotranspiration contributes 37%-44% to total evapotranspiration; interception is 15%-21% of precipitation. Evapotranspiration normalized by potential evaporation is 0.37 for larch sites almost independent of year; for grassland it is 0.52. At some sites, evapotranspiration in the warm season exceeds precipitation, thereby implying either a warm-season depletion of water storage in the soil column (most likely melted water from the thawing of the soil) or a horizontal transport of subsurface melt water from neighboring areas, or both. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Bowen ratio; energy flux; evapotranspiration; grassland; land surface; numerical model; understory; water exchange; Eurasia; Lena River; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242807397

Here we sought to determine to what extent the GHS effects to increase food intake and increase fat accumulation are glucocorticoid-dependent. Design: The effects of twice-daily s.c. injections of GH-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6) (250 μg/kg) for 2 weeks on body weight, food intake and fat pad weight were determined in both adrenalectomised (ADX) rats (with or without basal corticosterone replacement) and adrenal-intact rats. Results: All GHS-injected rats had a significantly increased body weight at the end of 2 weeks of treatment compared with saline controls. However, increased fat accumulation was only seen in adrenal-intact rats, with a 15% increase in s.c. inguinal (P < 0.05 vs saline controls) and 20% increase in visceral mesenteric (P < 0.05) fat pad weights following GHS treatment. The increased body weight observed in ADX rats following GHS treatment was not due to increased fat mass or increased weight of other organs measured. Food intake was increased for up to 7 h following a single injection of GHRP-6 in both the adrenal-intact (P < 0.01) and corticosterone-replacement groups (P < 0.05). This stimulating effect on food intake was not observed at any time point in the ADX rats without corticosterone replacement. Conclusion: These data suggest that GHS-induced body weight gain is glucocorticoid-independent. However, basal levels of glucocorticoids are permissive for the GHS-induced increase in food intake whilst activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis appears to contribute to the GHS-induced accumulation of fat mass. © 2004 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.",,"corticosterone; ghrelin; glucocorticoid; growth hormone secretagogue; histidyl dextro tryptophylalanyltryptophyl dextro phenylalanyllysinamide; sodium chloride; corticosterone; ghrelin; glucocorticoid; growth hormone releasing hexapeptide; oligopeptide; peptide hormone; adipose tissue; adrenalectomy; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; appetite; article; body weight; controlled study; female; food intake; hormonal regulation; hormone action; hormone substitution; hypophysis adrenal system; lipid storage; mesentery; nonhuman; obesity; organ weight; priority journal; rat; steroid blood level; weight gain; adipose tissue; animal; body composition; drug effect; drug potentiation; eating; kinetics; physiology; Wistar rat; Adipose Tissue; Adrenalectomy; Animals; Appetite; Body Composition; Body Weight; Corticosterone; Eating; Female; Glucocorticoids; Kinetics; Oligopeptides; Peptide Hormones; Rats; Rats, Wistar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242735063

Gas hydrates have drawn much attention because it is not only a new natural energy resource but also a new means for natural gas storage and transport. However, industrial applications of hydrate storage processes have been hindered by some problems, e.g., slow formation rates, unreacted interstitial water as a large percentage of the hydrate mass, the reliability of hydrate storage capacity, and the economy of process scale up. The cmc of SDS and APG water solutions were 300 × 10-6s and 500 × 10-6 in hydrate formation system, respectively. Surfactants SDS and APG reduced the hydrate induction time, improved the hydrate formation rate, and gas storage capacity. The effect of APG on hydrate formation was less pronounced compared to SDS. CP could also increase hydrate formation rate and reduce hydrate formation induction time, but could not improve methane storage in the hydrates.

Box 609, 751 25 Uppsala, Sweden","Background: Insulin sensitivity is a key function in human metabolism because it has a crucial role in the development of disease that are increasingly common in modern society. Impaired insulin sensitivity is an important determinant of type 2 diabetes; moreover, it has been proposed as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Thus, reduced insulin sensitivity is strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome, which represents a cluster of metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular risk factor. Insulin sensitivity can be modulated by different environmental factors, including dietary habits. Obesity, especially if associated with abdominal adiposity, impairs insulin-sensitivity while physical activity can improve it; however, the composition of the habitual diet is clearly an important regulator of this function. Aim: To evaluate methodologies and markers that can be used to substantiate existing and potential claims of beneficial effects of foods on relevant functions connected with body fat deposition, insulin sensitivity and blood glucose regulation. Results: We have reviewed the scientific basis for existing and potential claims, based not only on modifications of the target functions (body fat deposition, insulin sensitivity and blood glucose regulation) but also on modifications of other relevant associated functions (energy intake, energy expenditure, fat storage and oxidation, lipotoxicity, body fat composition, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular function, glucose production and utilization). In this context we have identified a number of markers and evaluated appropriate method to measure and validate them. Conclusions: Relevant functions contributing to overweight, the metabolic syndrome and diabetes have been identified. The evidence reviewed indicates that in this field the link between nutrition, biological responses and diseases is clearly established. Therefore, there is a stromg potential to develop functional food science. The major gap in the evidence continues to be the lack of diet based intervention trials of sufficient duration to be relevant for affecting the natural history of these conditions.","Diet; Functional foods; Insulin resistance; Insulin sensitivity; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity; Type 2 diabetes","calcium; catecholamine; chromium; copper; glucagon; glucocorticoid; glucose; growth hormone; hormone; insulin; leptin; magnesium; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; sex hormone; trace element; vanadium; zinc; body fat; body weight; caloric intake; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cardiovascular system; diabetes mellitus; diet; disease marker; energy expenditure; environmental factor; evidence based medicine; gluconeogenesis; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; glucose utilization; inflammation; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid composition; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipotoxicity; metabolic disorder; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; methodology; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nutrition; nutritional science; obesity; oxidative stress; physical activity; regulatory mechanism; review; risk factor; Adipose Tissue; Blood Glucose; Body Composition; Body Weight; Densitometry, X-Ray; Diabetes Mellitus; Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures; Diet; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Food; Health Food; Health Promotion; Hormones; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Metabolic Syndrome X; Neurotransmitter Agents; Obesity; Risk Factors; Trace Elements",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242702033

It was predicted that the efficiency penalty for CO2 capture for PC plant with flue gas scrubbing using an amine solvent can be reduced to 20 per cent (from 28 per cent) with improved thermodynamic integration and lower-energy solvent, giving a 10 per cent reduction in electricity costs, from $63.5/MW h to $57.4/MW h, and a 25 per cent reduction in the cost of CO2 avoided, from $45/t to $34/t. These values are both lower than predictions for the gasifier-based coal power plant in the original IEA GHG study. Reductions in the average cost of electricity of 6-7 per cent were estimated using solvent storage, giving a cost of electricity of $56.73/MW h and $33/t CO2 avoided for an integrated plant with monoethanolamine (MEA) as the solvent. Also, CO2 venting would allow an additional 20-25 per cent increase in output to be maintained indefinitely when $/MW h electricity prices were 2-3 times greater than the $/t penalty for CO2 discharges. © IMechE 2004.","Amine; Capture; Carbon; CO2; Coal; Power plant","Carbon dioxide; Flue gases; Power plants; Solvents; Regeneration energy; Solvent storage; Mechanical engineering; amine; carbon dioxide; flue gas; gas separation; power plant; solvent",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242689932

The performance of the 2.5-GeV storage ring may be limited by the longitudinal coupled-bunch instability as the beam current is increased. If the performance of the PLS is to be improved, the longitudinal coupled-bunch instabilities that may be generated by higher-order modes in the five rf cavities have to be cured. A longitudinal multibunch simulation code was developed to investigate the longitudinal coupled-bunch instabilities for the cases of various bunch filling patterns. It is shown in this paper that the beam energy spread due to the longitudinal coupled-bunch instabilities at higher beam currents for the five rf cavities can be suppressed by using a proper bunch filling-pattern.

The theory includes the nonlinear dependence of the base resistance and barrier capacitance on the current passing through the diodes. Simple relationships are obtained for the diode parameters (the thickness and doping level of the base, the charge of nonequilibrium holes extracted from the base for the time TB of high-reverse-conductivity phase, and the surface area and number m of series-connected diodes) and parameters of the loop (the capacitance and inductance of the energy storage and the initial voltage UC0 across the capacitance) that provide the generation of a voltage pulse with a desired rise time tB and amplitude Um on the load. For a given diode efficiency k, the maximal values of the overvoltage factor Um/UC0 and pulse sharpening coefficient TB/tB are shown to depend on a factor proportional to kω(1 - k)EB/Es, where ω = 0.27 (for Um/UC0) or -0.3 (for T B/tB); EB is the breakdown field; Es = vs/μ; and vs and μ are, respectively, the saturated drift velocity and mobility of holes in weak fields.

However, these processes must be accommodated within overriding physical and chemical constraints acting on cells and organisms. These constraints have shaped human metabolism and include the conservation of solvent capacity, the maintenance of constant osmotic pressure, and the avoidance of unwanted reactions and unnecessary increases in body mass. Unwanted reactions are minimized by means of very low intracellular concentrations of metabolic intermediates as well as avoidance of highly reactive intermediates, such as aldehydes. This may have favoured the selection of glucose as the principal monosaccharide in humans as it has the lowest proportion of straight-chain structure (free aldehyde) of all the aldohexoses. The principal storage form of carbohydrate, glycogen, has advantages in terms of lack of free aldehydes due to alpha-1-4 linkages, and, due to its polymeric nature, exertion of almost no osmotic pressure. Conservation of solvent capacity is facilitated by the use of activated intermediates that drive reactions at low concentrations of reactants. The caloric density of fat and the fact that, in contrast to glycogen, it can be stored anhydrously, dictated its selection as the principal caloric store. These chemical and physical constraints have determined the overall shape of human metabolism.","Aldehyde; Carbohydrate; Enzyme; Fat; Glucose; Glycogen; Metabolism; Oxidation","aldehyde; carbohydrate; carbon dioxide; fat; glucose; glycogen; hexose; methane; solvent; biochemistry; biosynthesis; body mass; cell composition; cell metabolism; chemical bond; chemical reaction; concentration response; detoxification; energy expenditure; energy yield; human; osmotic pressure; reaction analysis; review; structure analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042830028

First of all, we replaced the old and expensive four SUN/SOLARIS servers running AFS (Andrew File System) fusione.it cell with three SuperServer Supermicro SC-742. Secondly Linux 2.4 OS has been installed on our new cell servers and OpenAFS 1.2.8 open source distributed file system has replaced the commercial IBM/Transarc AFS. A pioneering solution - SGI's XFS file system for Linux - has been adopted to format one terabyte of FTU storage system on which the AFS volumes are based. Benchmark tests have shown the good performances of XFS compared to the classical ext3 Linux file system. Third, the data access software has been ported to Linux, together with the interfaces to Matlab and IDL, as well as the locally developed data display utility, SHOX. Finally a new Object-Oriented Data Model (OODM) has been developed for FTU shots data to build and maintain a FTU data warehouse (DW). FTU OODM has been developed using ROOT, an object oriented data analysis framework well-known in high energy physics. Since large volumes of data are involved, a parallel data extraction process, developed in the ROOT framework, has been implemented taking advantage of the AFS distributed environment of FTU computing system. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. Generally, anti-obesity pharmacotherapy targets both reduction of energy intake and increase of energy expenditure. Due to several associated abnormalities, it is now considered that an anti-obesity agent which not only reduce weight, but also improve metabolic and cardiovascular functions will have better therapeutic potential. Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs), are lipid activated transcription factors that control carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis. The PPAR subfamily of nuclear receptors comprises three isoforms - PPARα, PPARγ and PPARδ. PPARα is predomionantly involved in fatty acid catabolism, whereas PPARγ promotes lipid storage and triggers cellular differentiation and insulin sensitization. Dual activation of PPARα and γ controls glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitization and lipid metabolism, In addition, PPARα and γ activation is also known to exert anti-inflammatory action, exert direct actions for modulating the vascular endothelial functions and thereby showing anti-hypertensive activity. Here we have reviewed the diverse pieces of evidence linking obesity with PPARs and how selective manipulation of PPAR isoforms, by agonists or antagonists can potentially lead to the discovery of new drugs to treat weight gain and the related complications. © 2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",,"2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; anorexigenic agent; antiobesity agent; carbohydrate; cell nucleus receptor; drf 2655; fatty acid; fenofibrate; fibric acid derivative; glucose; gw 0072; lg 100641; lipid; mifobate; new drug; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor antagonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pioglitazone; ragaglitazar; sibutramine; tetrahydrolipstatin; transcription factor; unclassified drug; antihypertensive activity; antiinflammatory activity; arteriosclerosis; atherosclerosis; caloric intake; carbohydrate metabolism; cardiovascular response; cardiovascular risk; catabolism; cell differentiation; chronic disease; clinical trial; drug mechanism; energy expenditure; evidence based medicine; fatty acid metabolism; glucose homeostasis; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; ischemic heart disease; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; review; risk assessment; vascular endothelium; weight gain; weight reduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042739624

We have prepared magnetic nanoparticles (∼7.5 nm) by x-ray irradiation of electroless solutions and furthermore have investigated their structural and magnetic properties. Interestingly, we find that the formation of these Ni nanoparticles occurs spontaneously, during the room temperature process, dominantly at electrolyte pH of 8.2. The hydrated electrons produced during the irradiation of electroless solution seem to play a decisive role in the spontaneous formation and growth of nanoparticles. The possible surface alloying and/or coating over these pure Ni cores occurs only upon longer irradiation of high-P-content solutions. This suggests a possible catalytic behaviour of these nano-Ni surfaces in relation to P counter-ions in the irradiated solutions. The magnetic properties of these 'as-received' particles have been studied using a vibrating sample magnetometer. The saturation magnetic moment per gram for the Ni particles is 9.38 emu g-1, which is 17% of the saturation moment of bulk ferromagnetic Ni at room temperature; this can be attributed due to the size effect of these magnetic domains. The symmetric hysteresis loop about the zero-field axis showing negligible loop shift (ΔHc ∼ 3-10 Oe) suggests that Ni particles are free from oxide layers.",,"Charge coupled devices; Electrolytes; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Ferromagnetic materials; High resolution electron microscopy; Magnetic fields; Nickel alloys; Phosphors; Surface properties; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction analysis; Electroless solution; Hydrated electrons; Nanostructured films; X ray irradiation; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042688336

The results showed that Mn(CH3COO)2·H2O is a more promising precursor because of its high deposition rate at much lower potentials in comparison with MnSO4·5H2O, MnCl 2·4H2O, and Mn(NO3)2· 4H2O. The capacitive characteristics of a-MnOx· nH2O were found to be independent of precursors, probably due to the fact that the mean oxidation state of Mn is not significantly affected by changing the anions of manganese precursors (from the XPS results). The capacity of oxide deposits was found to be proportional to the charge density of deposition (i.e., loading) of a-MnOx·nH2O when it was equal to or less than a critical value (ca. 3.5 C cm-2), while poorer capacitive behavior with a lower capacity was clearly found beyond this critical value. The a-MnOx·nH2O deposit with 3.5 C cm-2, exhibiting an acceptable capacitive performance, showed the highest capacity of energy storage for supercapacitors. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Hydrous manganese oxide; Precursors; Pseudocapacitance; Supercapacitor; Thickness","anion; manganese oxide; oxide; article; density; electrochemical analysis; energy; oxidation; statistical significance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042660052

A low-power half-delay-line fast skew-compensation circuit (HDSC) is proposed in this work. The HDSC circuit features several new design techniques. The first is a new measure-and-compensate architecture, with which the HDSC circuit gains advantages including an enlarged operation frequency range, more robust operation, more accurate phase alignment, higher scalability for using advanced technologies, and lower power consumption, as compared to the conventional fast skew-compensation circuits. The second is a frequency-independent phase adjuster, with which the delay line can be shortened by half and the maximal power consumption is reduced accordingly if the clock signal has a 50% duty cycle. The third is a fine delay cell, which is used to accompany the half-delay-line, comprising of minimum-sized coarse delay cells, to effectively reduce the static phase error.

Standby currents in distributed storage elements can be cut off by using ferroelectric-based nonvolatile storage elements, and the standby power dissipation can be greatly reduced. Since the nonvolatile storage and the switching functions are merged into ferroelectric capacitors by the capacitive coupling effect, reduction of active device counts can be achieved. The use of complementary stored data in coupled ferroelectric capacitors makes it possible to perform a switching operation with small degradation of the nonvolatile charge at a low supply voltage. The restore operation can be performed by only applying the small bias across the ferroelectric capacitor, which reduces the dynamic power dissipation. Applying the proposed circuitry in a fully parallel 32-bit content-addressable memory results in about 2/3 dynamic power reduction and 1/7700 static power reduction with chip size of 1/3, compared to a CMOS implementation using 0.6-μm ferroelectric/CMOS.","Content-addressable memory (CAM); Dynamic logic; Ferroelectric capacitor; Nonvolatile storage; Pass-transistor logic; Pseudo non-destructive read operation","Capacitors; CMOS integrated circuits; Electric potential; Energy dissipation; Ferroelectricity; Logic gates; Power electronics; Transistors; Ferroelectric capacitors; Nonvolatile storages; Pass-transistor logic; Static power reductions; VLSI circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942657270

We assume that two main competing processes control the magnetic field evolution at the solar surface (1) the magnetic field is locally enhanced by the flux emergence and/or the coalescence of emerged magnetic flux and (2) it is diminished by flux cancellation or diffusion. The flux emergence follows a basic percolation rule; it is more probable at the points were magnetic flux already exists. The magnetic field is also enhanced when magnetic fields of the same polarity collide. The flux cancellation is due either to the gradual diffusion of the magnetic field, when it is isolated, or to the partial release of energy when opposite magnetic field lines collide. The percolation model proposed in this article is capable of reproducing the statistical properties of the evolving active regions. The evolving simulated magnetograms, derived from our model, are used to estimate the 3-D magnetic fields above the photosphere using constant α force-free extrapolation techniques. Based on the above analysis we are able to estimate a variety of observed statistical characteristics, e.g. the size and flux distribution of the magnetic fields at the solar surface, the fractal dimension of the magnetic structures formed at the photosphere, the energy release frequency distribution, the waiting time distribution of the sporadic energy releases and the statistical properties of the steep horizontal magnetic field gradients in the extrapolated coronal magnetic field. Our main conclusion is that the photospheric driver plays a crucial role in the observed flare statistics, and the solar magnetograms, when interpreted properly, carry important statistical information for the solar coronal activity (coronal heating, flares, CME etc.).","Plasmas; Sun: activity; Sun: flares; Sun: magnetic fields; Sun: photosphere","Diffusion; Hydrodynamics; Magnetic fields; Magnetic flux; Plasmas; Solar system; Spectrum analysis; Statistical methods; X rays; Cellular automation; Magnetic energy storage; Solar active regions; Sun flares; Sun photosphere; Astrophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942548220

The proposed solution of these problems combines an extensive spatial filtering with classical methods of computer vision and newly developed algorithms. Step edges are computed by extracting local maxima from the energy summed over a large bank of directional odd filters with a different scale. Thin roof edges are computed by considering maxima of the energy summed over narrow odd and even filters along the direction providing maximal response. Junctions are precisely detected and recovered using the output of directional filters. The proposed algorithm has a threshold for the minimum contrast of detected edges: for the large number of tested images this threshold was fixed equal to three times the standard deviation of the noise present in usual acquisition system (estimated to be between 1 and 1.3 gray levels out of 256), therefore, the proposed scheme is in fact parameter free. This scheme for edge detection performs better than the classical Canny edge detector in two quantitative comparisons: the recovery of the original image from the edge map and the structure from motion task. As the Canny detector in previous comparisons was shown to be the best or among the best detectors, the proposed scheme represents a significant improvement over previous approaches.","Edge detection; Junction detection; Performance evaluation","Algorithms; Evaluation; Image quality; Performance; Junction detection; Performance evaluation; Edge detection; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; cluster analysis; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer graphics; computer simulation; evaluation; image enhancement; image subtraction; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; validation study; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Computer Graphics; Computer Simulation; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Subtraction Technique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942545895

Metabolic profiling, bioluminescence-based in situ imaging of ATP, and oxygen-sensitive microsensors were combined here to investigate barley seed development. For the first time temporal and spatial maps of O2 and ATP distribution in cereal grains were determined and related to the differentiation pattern. Steep O2 gradients were demonstrated and strongly hypoxic regions were detected within the caryopsis (&lt;0.1% of atmospheric saturation). Growing lateral and peripheral regions of endosperm remained well-supplied with O2 due to pericarp photosynthesis. ATP distribution in the developing grain was coupled to endosperm differentiation. High ATP concentrations were associated with the local onset of starch storage within endosperm, while low ATP overlapped with the hypoxic regions. Temporally, the building of steep gradients in ATP coincided with overall elevating metabolite levels, specific changes in the metabolite profiles (glycolysis and citrate cycle), and channelling of metabolic fluxes towards storage (increase of starch accumulation rate). These findings implicate an inhomogenous spatial arrangement of metabolic activity within the caryopsis. It is suggested that the local onset of starch storage is coupled with the accumulation of ATP and elevated metabolic activity. Thus, the ATP level reflects the metabolic state of storage tissue. On the basis of these findings, a hypothetical model for the regulation of starch storage in barley seeds is proposed.","Adenylate energy charge; ATP; Barley seed; Hypoxia; LC-MS; Metabolite imaging; Metabolite profiling; Microsensor; Tissue differentiation","Adenosinetriphosphate; Bioluminescence; Grain (agricultural product); Metabolism; Oxygen; Photosynthesis; Seed; Starch; Caryopsis; Endosperms; Plants (botany); adenosine triphosphate; chlorophyll; oxygen; starch; article; barley; energy metabolism; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant seed; Adenosine Triphosphate; Chlorophyll; Energy Metabolism; Hordeum; Oxygen; Seeds; Starch; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Spermatophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942536059

In this article we will provide an integrative view on the interrelation between decreased oxidative capacity, lipotoxicity, and mitochondrial aberrations in type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by disturbances in fatty acid metabolism and is accompanied by accumulation of fatty acids in nonadipose tissues. In metabolically active tissues, such as skeletal muscle, fatty acids are prone to so-called oxidative damage. In addition to producing energy, mitochondria are also a major source of reactive oxygen species, which can lead to lipid peroxidation. In particular, the mitochondrial matrix, which contains DNA, RNA, and numerous enzymes necessary for substrate oxidation, is sensitive to peroxide-induced oxidative damage and needs to be protected against the formation and accumulation of lipids and lipid peroxides. Recent evidence reports that mitochondrial uncoupling is involved in the protection of the mitochondrial matrix against lipid-induced mitochondrial damage. Disturbances in this protection mechanism can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.",,"lipid peroxide; mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial RNA; reactive oxygen metabolite; disorders of mitochondrial functions; energy resource; fatty acid metabolism; human; insulin resistance; lipid peroxidation; lipid storage; mitochondrion; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; oxidation; priority journal; review; skeletal muscle; Carrier Proteins; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Ion Channels; Lipid Peroxidation; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Proteins; Oxidation-Reduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542593338

It then accumulates in skeletal muscle as creatine phosphoric acid. The aim of this study was to understand the dehydration behavior of untreated and pulverized creatine monohydrate at various temperatures. The removal of crystal water was investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The X-ray diffraction pattern of untreated and pulverized creatine monohydrate agreed with reported data for creatine monohydrate. However, the diffraction peaks of the (1 0 0), (2 0 0) and (3 0 0) planes of pulverized creatine monohydrate were much stronger than those of untreated creatine monohydrate. On the other hand, the diffraction peaks of the (0 1 2) and (0 1 3) planes of untreated creatine monohydrate were much stronger than those of pulverized creatine monohydrate. The dehydration of untreated and pulverized creatine monohydrate was investigated at various storage temperatures, and the results indicated that untreated and pulverized creatine monohydrate were transformed into the anhydrate at more than 30°C. After dehydration, the particles of untreated and pulverized creatine anhydrate had many cracks. The dehydration kinetics of untreated and pulverized creatine monohydrate were analyzed by the Hancock-Sharp equation on the basis of the isothermal DSC data. The dehydrations of untreated and pulverized creatine monohydrate both followed a zero-order mechanism (Polany-Winger equation). However, the transition rate constant, calculated from the slope of the straight line, was about 2.2-7.7 times higher for pulverized creatine monohydrate than for untreated creatine monohydrate. The Arrhenius plots (natural logarithm of the dehydration rate constant versus the reciprocal of absolute temperature) of the isothermal DSC data for untreated and pulverized creatine monohydrate were linear. The activation energies of dehydration in the 40-60°C range for untreated and pulverized creatine monohydrate were 15.02 and 10.1 kJ/mol, respectively. Dehydration of untreated creatine monohydrate had a pronounced effect on the particle size of the powder. Compared with pulverized creatine monohydrate, the particle size of untreated creatine monohydrate was significantly decreased by dehydration. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Today, the molecular bases of the functional links between glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism, under the important but non-exclusive control of PPARα and PPARγ, are starting to be uncovered. In addition, in the last couple of years evidence has been provided for an important role of PPARβ (δ) in lipid metabolism.

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a representative sample of 478 African school girls, ages 10 to 15 y, in the North West Province, South Africa. Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses, and waist and mid upper arm circumferences were measured by trained biokineticists using standard methods. Trained fieldworkers measured dietary intakes by 24-h recall, and physical activity was measured by using the physical activity recall of the previous day. Body mass index and physical activity category were calculated. Results Stunted girls had significantly lower weight and skinfold thicknesses than did non-stunted ones. After including the covariates: age, years since menarche, school, type of housing, dietary energy and fat intakes, physical activity category, body weight, and stratum of urbanization in analysis of variance, the mean sum of triceps skinfold and subscapular skinfold thicknesses of stunted girls was greater than that of the non-stunted girls (P < 0.002). Stunted subjects were less active than non-stunted ones.

The LF-ASD operates as an asynchronous brain switch (ABS) which is activated only when a user intends control and maintains an inactive state output when the user is not meaning to control the device (i.e., they may be idle, thinking about a problem, or performing some other action). Results from LF-ASD evaluations have shown promise, although the reported error rates are too high for most practical applications. This paper presents the evaluation of four new LF-ASD designs with data collected from individuals with high-level spinal cord injuries and able-bodied subjects. These new designs incorporated electroencephalographic energy normalization and feature space dimensionality reduction. The error characteristics of the new ABS designs were significantly better than the LF-ASD design with true positive rate increases of approximately 33% for false positive rates in the range of 1%-2%. The results demonstrate that the dimensionality of the LF-ASD feature space can be reduced without performance degradation. The results also confirm previous findings that spinal cord-injured subjects can operate ABS designs to the same ability as able-bodied subjects.","Assistive technology; Asynchronous control; Brain-computer interface (BCI); Intermittent control; Neuroprosthesis; Pattern recognition; Statistical signal processing","Computer aided analysis; Degradation; Error analysis; Structural design; Switching; Asynchronous; Brain-computer interface; Control application; Switch design; Brain models; adult; article; brain computer interface; clinical article; computer aided design; computer interface; controlled study; electroencephalogram; evaluation; female; human; male; pattern recognition; signal processing; spinal cord injury; Adult; Algorithms; Brain; Communication Aids for Disabled; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Feedback; Female; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Cortex; Online Systems; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442711557

The cell performance is seriously decreased upon heat treatments, despite the fact that leakage of the electrolyte liquid is effectively prevented. Even when cells are stored in the dark at elevated temperatures, apparently side reactions occur, resulting in cell degradation.Since elevated temperatures are hard to exclude under normal operation conditions, this is the most critical criterion regarding long-term stability. The nc-DSC should be modified in such a way that it is not sensitive to elevated temperatures, representative for outdoor conditions. The emphasis of this paper is on the long-term stability of nc-DSCs at high temperature. nc-DSCs have been subjected to various aging tests. A cyclic test comprising thermal stress in the dark (85 °C) alternated by full sun illumination under milder conditions reveals a recovery process occurring in degraded cells. A combination of 85 °C and full sun illumination leads to a significant decrease of the cell performance. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Inclusion of histidine resulted in a >3-fold increase in buffering capacity over the pH range 7.4-6.8. Positive effects of histidine on ATP and energy charge were apparent after 4-10h storage.

The Kyoto Protocol requires that Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects result in long-term benefits related to the mitigation of climate change. This long-term requirement to keep carbon in storage may conflict with the short-term needs of the poor. The objective of this paper is to examine the potential implications of the Land use change and forestry (LUCF) projects to the rural livelihoods in India. For this purpose the paper uses a linearised version of the almost ideal demand system (LA-AIDS) to analyse data collected from 69206 rural households in India. Based on the analysis, the paper concludes that for CDM to be sustainable and result in sustainable development of the local people, three important criteria should be satisfied: (1) Integrating the energy substitution possibilities in the objectives of carbon sequestration; (2) Management of the CPR lands by the rural poor through proper design of the rules for sustenance of user groups; and (3) Ensuring that the maximum revenue from carbon sequestration is channelled to the rural poor. Otherwise CDM would just result in either leakage of carbon benefits or have negative welfare implications for the poor. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Present data indicate that sperm storage at 4 °C in the presence of different energetic substrates leads to time dependent ATP depletion. Among the substrates studied (i.e. glycine, glucose, or lactate plus pyruvate), the lactate plus pyruvate seems to be the most favourable substrate to maintain ATP concentration. ATP depletion is associated with increase of the AMP content, while ADP concentration is changing only slightly. Moreover, significant increase in hypoxanthine content both in the sperm and a storage medium was found. Adenine nucleotide energy charge (AEC) decreased significantly during the first 24 h when sperm was stored in the presence of glycine. During the same period, only slight decrease in AEC was observed in spermatozoa stored in the presence of glucose and no significant changes were found in the presence of lactate plus pyruvate. A further decrease in AEC was observed until 120 h of storage in the medium containing glycine, lactate plus pyruvate or glucose. However, the changes were relatively small when spermatozoa were stored in the presence of lactate plus pyruvate. Important finding is that in contrast to the results reported recently, AEC value in fresh milt (at 0 time of storage) was in the normal range. The present study shows that African catfish spermatozoa are able to maintain physiological level of ATP and AEC when they are stored in the presence of favourable energetic substrates. In conclusion, the results of this investigation suggest that successful short-term storage of African catfish milt depends on energetic substrates supply. © Springer 2005.","Adenylate nucleotides; African catfish spermatozoa; Energetic substrates; Motility; Sperm storage","adenine nucleotide; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; glucose; glycine; hypoxanthine; lactic acid; pyruvic acid; animal cell; article; catfish; cell activation; cell metabolism; energy metabolism; male; nonhuman; normal value; nucleotide metabolism; protein content; protein degradation; protein depletion; protein determination; sperm preservation; spermatozoon motility; statistical significance; Clarias gariepinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23644437798

The TSDC spectra of MgAl2O4 doped with Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Cr3+ and Mn2+ show four bands at 130 K, 160 K, 250 K and 320 K, and the spectra of Al2O3 doped with Mg2+, Cr 3+ and Fe3+ show bands between 230 K and 260 K. It has been observed that the bands at 130 K, 160 K and 250 K in MgAl2O 4 spinel and that the 230 K and 240 K bands in Al2O 3 are related to dipole defects. The other bands are possibly related to different types of charge storage mechanisms (space-charge and interfacial polarisation) or deal with distributions in activation energies and/or in relaxation times. A thermal decrease of the TSDC bands for heat treatments above 1000 K has been observed. In MgAl2O4 spinel, the 250 K band could be recovered after γ-irradiation and the two dipole peaks in Al2O3 were partially recovered. Thermal treatments affect the dipole aggregation processes in both oxides. Optical absorption (AO) results indicate that the presence of bands of water molecules in the infrared region obstructs the appearance of the TSDC bands in both Al2O3 and MgAl2O4. The 250 K peak in MgAl2O 4 was correlated to V-type centres and the 250 K peak in Al 2O3 to a substitutional Mg2+ ion near a trapped hole localised on an adjacent oxygen ion. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Gas bremsstrahlung is generated in the vacuum chamber of an electron storage ring by interactions of the circulating electrons with the atoms of the residual gas. The emitted photons with sufficiently high energies can further produce neutrons by means of photonuclear interactions. Photoneutrons produced in a lead target struck by gas bremsstrahlung were measured as a function of target thickness by using high-efficiency neutron detectors in a well-defined configuration. A Monte Carlo simulation of the whole process including generation of gas bremsstrahlung, production of photoneutrons and subsequent neutron transport has been performed in an integrated manner and the results were directly compared with the measurements on an absolute basis. The agreement between them is very satisfactory and hence validates the evaluation of the characteristics of gas bremsstrahlung and induced photoneutrons in NSRRC. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

There should be some form of relationship between them, especially in the case of the use of a short or mid-length die. The viscoelastic behavior and mechanisms in capillary extrusion flow of rubber compounds were investigated in the present paper. Under the operation conditions with temperature of 90 °C and apparent shear rate range of 10-103 s-1, the rheological properties of two tyre compounds, cavity stock and buffer stock, were measured. It was found that the shear flow of both the tyre compounds obeyed the power law, and the non-Newtonian index values were close to each other. The entry pressure drop (ΔP0), entry elastic stored energy (e) and die-swell ratio (B) increased roughly linearly with increasing shear stress at the channel wall. The B value for cavity stock was greater than that for buffer stock, whereas it was the reverse for ΔPen. Also, the correlation between the die-swell ratio and entry elastic stored energy is discussed. The results showed that B was a linear function of e. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The system allows use of renewable energy sources for the heating and cooling of office and industrial buildings. The design for the new ceiling panel exploits the properties of the phase change material (PCM) paraffin. Its high thermal storage capacity during phase change - up to 300Wh/(m2day) - enables the overall panel thickness to be limited to a mere 5cm. Active control of the thermal storage is achieved by means of an integrated water capillary tube system. The research project also included the development of a numerical model for computation of the thermal behavior of wall and ceiling systems incorporating PCMs. Simulation calculations were performed to determine the necessary thermal properties of the ceiling panels and specify requirements for the materials to be used. Laboratory tests were performed to verify the system's performance and a pilot application is soon to be tried out in practice. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

At the first step, thermal energy storage aggregates (TESAs) were made from porous aggregates absorbing phase changing materials (PCMs). At the second step, TESC was produced with a normal mixing method and using TESAs. An adequate amount of PCM can be incorporated into concrete by the two-step procedure. It can be seen experimentally that the energy storage capacity of the TESC was comparable with that of a commercially available PCM. The experimental results showed that the geometrical features of the porous structure of the aggregates had significant effect on their absorbing ability of the PCM. Aggregates with large pore connectivity factor and transport tunnel in boundary part can absorb more PCM. It was also found that the phase changing behavior was affected by the volume fraction of PCM in concrete. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The flow properties of grease were measured using continuous shear rheometry, while the viscoelastic properties were measured using oscillatory shear measurements. The flow properties show that grease is a shear-thinning fluid with a yield stress that increases with thickener concentration. At concentrations of lithium hydroxystearate greater than 5% by volume, the storage modulus, G′, was found to be greater than the loss modulus, G″, with both moduli increasing with increasing thickener concentration, below this critical concentration G″ was greater than G′. Slip at the wall of the measuring platens was a major problem encountered during the rheological measurement of grease, this is hardly surprising, and greases are designed to slip in their lubricating functions. Therefore the measuring platens were roughened by sandblasting and significantly higher yield values were recorded with the roughened geometries. Creep experiments were also performed. In the creep test, yield stresses of greases could be obtained. Zero shear viscosity was also calculated from the creep experiment and as a result viscosities over nine orders of magnitude were obtained. The power law index of the scaling law of the elastic modulus and yield stress with increasing volume fraction was found to be 4.7±0.2 suggesting that the flocculation of the particles that compose the grease is likely to be of the chemically limited aggregation variety. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The values of these parameters calculated with these two methods are comparable. The orders of kinetics of the two peaks are found to be different from either the first or the second. The b values obtained ranged from 1.023 to 1.134 for peak III and from 1.156 to 1.223 for peak IV. The E values ranged from 0.777 to 1.068 eV for peak III and from 1.328 to 1.428 eV for peak IV. The present values of kinetic parameters are compared with those from past studies on fluorite and the observed variations discussed. The electron lifetime in each of these traps, a parameter to dosimetry, was also determined.

Finite volume method was applied to describe the heat exchangers, and lumped parameter models were used to analyze the compressor and the hot water reservoir. Dynamic performances were evaluated as the hot water temperature changes for various sizes of the hot water reservoir. In order to compare the performance characteristics, time scale was normalized by the time constant determined from a quasi-steady state simulation of the system. From the simulation, the smaller size of the water reservoir was found to have larger transient performance degradation, and the larger size caused additional heat loss during the hot water storage period. Therefore, the reservoir size should be optimized in a design process to minimize both the heat loss and the performance degradation. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

One powerful way to mitigate emissions is to switch fuels from fossil fuels to renewable energy, such as biomass. In this paper, we systematically investigate several bioenergy processing options, quantify the reduction rate and calculate the specific cost of reduction. This paper addresses the issue of which option Sweden should concentrate on to achieve the largest CO2 reduction at the lowest cost. The results show that the largest and most long-term sustainable CO 2 reduction would be achieved by refining the woody biomass to fuel pellets for coal substitution, which have been done in Sweden. Refining to motor fuels, such as methanol, DME and ethanol, gives only half of the reduction and furthermore at a higher specific cost. Biomass refining into pellets enables transportation over long distances and seasonal storage, which is crucial for further utilisation of the woody biomass potential. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the fuzzy control methodology which has ever been reported has many problems, since structure and choosing of fuzzy rules, membership function and parameters in fuzzy controller are determined by trial and error depending on computer simulations and skilled person's intuition. In this paper, we introduce a learning control that is developed by synthesizing several basic ideas from fuzzy set and control theory, self-organizing control and conventional adaptive control. This provides the motivation for adaptive fuzzy control where the focus is on the automatic on-line synthesis and tuning of fuzzy controller parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed learning control is able to ensure the transient stability of power system under various fault conditions and significant disturbances.","ASMES; CSI; Fuzzy learning control; Power system stability","Control equipment; Fuzzy sets; Magnetic storage; Parameter estimation; Perturbation techniques; Robustness (control systems); Standby power systems; Advanced super-conducting magnetic storage (ASMES); Current source inverter (CSI); Fuzzy learning control; Power system stability; Superconducting magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12444347528

The converters are realized by reduced repeated power processing concept in which part of the input power is transferred to the load directly after the first power process. This results in lower storage capacitor voltage than that of previously developed S2PFCCs but maintaining high power factor. In addition, the inherent input current control allows the load current to reduce the input line current automatically when the load becomes light, preventing excessive amount of energy being stored in the storage capacitor. Although the proposed converters employed two power switches, a simple single-loop controller for the proposed S2PFCC to achieve power factor correction (PFC) and tight output regulation is also proposed.

A negative correlation between the accumulation of fat and the expression of UCP2 in adipocytes was also found. Ectopic expression of UCP1 in the white fat of aP2-Ucp1 transgenic mice mitigated obesity induced by genetic or dietary factors. In these mice, changes in lipid metabolism of adipocytes were associated with the depression of intracellular energy charge.

For the singly protonated tripeptides (LysTrpLysH+ and LysTyrLysH+), the decay curves are found to consist of a single component that can be reproduced with an assumption of statistical decay after equilibration of the photon energy among all vibrational modes. The rate constant is expressed in the Arrhenius form in terms of the microcanonical temperature, and the decay rate is obtained by integration over the energy distribution, which has a spread corresponding to the canonical energy distribution at room temperature. The resulting deviation from exponential decay makes it possible to determine the decay parameters from a measurement at a single photon wavelength. Activation energies of Ea = 1.24 ± 0.07 and 1.5 ± 0.4 eV were determined for LysTrpLysH + and LysTyrLysH+, respectively, with pre-exponential factors of Ad = 1011.1±0.5 and 10 12.9±2.6 s-1.",,"amino acid; hydrogen; lysine; peptide; proton; tripeptide; tryptophan; analytic method; article; dissociation constant; energy yield; fluorescence; high temperature; hydrogenation; photodynamics; proton transport; room temperature; statistical distribution; temperature dependence; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042662214

In the present paper we discuss the involved photophysics and photochemistry for protonated and deprotonated model chromophores of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and the Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP). We show specifically that the delayed dissociation after photoabsorption can be understood in terms of a thermally activated process of the Arrhenius type. The rate of dissociation as a function of time after laser excitation is modeled in a calculation which is based on calculated heat capacities of the chromophores. Absorption of only one photon is enough to dissociate the deprotonated GFP chromophore on a time scale of milliseconds whereas absorption of two to three photons occurs for other chromophore ions. The difference is attributed to different activation energies, pre-exponential factors and locations of the absorption bands. We obtain activation energies for the dissociation that are of the order of 1-3 eV. Collision-induced dissociation experiments were performed to help identifying the fragmentation channels. Loss of methyl is found to be the dominant fragmentation channel for the deprotonated GFP chromophore and is also likely to be important for the protonated GFP chromophore at high temperatures. Other channels are open for the RFP chromophores. For the deprotonated RFP chromophore there is evidence that dissociation occurs through a non-trivial dissociation with substantial rearrangement.",,"green fluorescent protein; red fluorescent protein; article; calculation; chromatophore; dissociation; light absorption; molecular physics; photochemistry; photostimulation; proton transport; reaction analysis; temperature sensitivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042567214

The light-induced spectral changes from orange-red sharp line emission to yellow-white broad band are observed in Sr2SiO4 : Eu at room temperature under irradiation with short UV or X-rays. The spectral changes are attributed to the optically assisted reduction of Eu3+ → Eu2+. The photoreduced Sr2SiO4 : Eu shows emission containing contributions from both Eu2+ and Eu3+ in comparison to chemically reduced samples. This is explained on the basis of preferential reduction of Eu3+ present in Sr(1) sites under irradiation due to unsatisfied EuSr-O-Si bonds. The absence of photoactivity for Ba2SiO4 : Eu3+ (space group = Pnam) as well as Ca2SiO4 : Eu3+ (space group = P21/n) indicates that crystal structure plays an important role in the photoreduction of Sr2SiO4 : Eu3+ because of the prevailing orientational as well as the positional disorder in the latter. Further, the orientationally disordered monoclinic random domains persist within the orthorhombic lattice of Sr2SiO4, resulting in the positionally disordered Sr atoms and orientationally disordered SiO4 tetrahedra. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies confirm the electron trapping by dynamically disordered (SiO4)4- under high energy photon illumination resulting in the formation of radical anion (SiO 4)5-. The substitutional studies indicate that the [Eu3+ ← O2-] charge-transfer (CT) state is directly involved in the photoreduction process. The excitation of Sr2SiO 4 : Eu3+ produces the [Eu3+ ← O 2-] CT state which relaxes and transfers electrons to SiO4 groups due to optically assisted rearrangement of local environment and mediates the electron transfer process to cause photoreduction of Eu 3+ to Eu2+. The yellow emission is stable at room temperature and reverts to red on annealing at elevated temperature in Ar atmosphere due to thermally activated detrapping of charge carriers present at the defect centers which, in turn, convert Eu2+ to Eu3+. The thermally activated conversion of Eu2+ → Eu3+ in Sr2SiO4 is optically reversible, thereby resulting in a highly efficient material for application as an optical storage medium.",,"Crystal structure; Electron transitions; Irradiation; X rays; Electron transfer; Positional disorders; Spectral changes; Europium; argon; barium derivative; calcium derivative; europium; silicon derivative; strontium; article; chemical bond; crystal structure; electron spin resonance; electron transport; field emission; illumination; irradiation; light; room temperature; spectrum; ultraviolet radiation; X ray",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942718671

Silver structures have been made in these wells using an electroless process that involves the reduction of silver ions and oxidation of silicon in the presence of fluoride ions. The silver deposition process is found to be diffusion controlled. The ""electroless"" solution composition determines the structure of the deposited silver. Thus structures can be generated that resemble a torus or a pillar or a small set of spheres. The torus structure was found to give SERS signals for pyridine about 100 times higher than other reported structures. The stability of the torus structure in pure water is limited, and it is therefore necessary to store these structures in alkaline media or with an adsorbate layer as a protector, so making long-term active substrate storage possible. The free energy difference that drives the conversion of tori to pillars has its origin in the excess surface energy, determined by the surface curvature. Optimized substrates have a SERS sensitivity of about 108 for pyridine and some ssDNA molecules. The laser spot to spot variation in SERS signal intensity over the substrate is small, ca. ±5%. For a molecule like R6G, where resonant absorption occurs, large enhancement is obtained such that a single molecule, in the field of view (3 micron spot size) of the Raman microscope, can be detected. The importance of the torus structure would seem to be empirically established. From a practical point of view, such as using SERS as an analytical tool or examining some resonant structure, these substrates offer a sensitive, uniform and reproducible adsorbent.",,"Absorption; Diffusion; DNA; Electroless plating; Fabrication; Fluorine compounds; Lithography; Raman spectroscopy; Silica; Silicon; Silver; Water; Caesium chloride; Nano fabrication processes; Silver ions; Nanostructured materials; cesium chloride; DNA; fluoride; pyridine; silicon; silicon dioxide; silver; water; adsorption; article; chemical structure; energy; microscope; oxidation; reduction; sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942714987

This synchrotron radiation source (Nucl. Instr. and Meth. A 470 (2001) 1; Proceedings of EPAC'2000, 708; Proceedings of PAC'01, 2821) is dedicated to the investigation on condensed matter physics, atomic physics, biology, medicine, chemistry, micromechanics, lithography and others. The storage ring DELSY is an electron storage ring with the beam energy 1.2 GeV and 4 straight sections to accommodate accelerator equipment and insertion devices. One of the straight sections is intended for a 10 T superconducting wiggler (wavelength shifter) and one for the undulator with 150 periods and a magnetic field of 0.75 T. The wiggler will influence many aspects of beam dynamics: linear motion, dynamic aperture, emittance, damping times, etc. The problem is rather serious for the DELSY machine because the energy of the electron beam is small while the wiggler's magnetic field is strong. In this paper we consider two models of the wiggler's magnetic field with and without the focusing caused by the sextupolar field of the wiggler as we need to develop the requirements to the wiggler design. We study the influence of the 10 T wiggler on the beam dynamics in the DELSY storage ring and propose a possible scheme to cure it (Proceedings of EPAC'2000, 708; Proceedings of PAC'01, 2821; Ph.D. Thesis, JINR, Dubna, 2002).

The quality and cleanness of CuInSe2(0 0 1) surfaces restored in UHV by thermal evaporation of the covering protective Se cap was assessed. For the study, MBE-grown heteroepitaxial CuInSe2/GaAs(0 0 1) films were employed. The Se capping and decapping process was monitored by reflection high-energy electron diffraction. The Se cap layer is amorphous and, after its reevaporation, the initial diffraction pattern of CuInSe2(0 0 1) is restored. The decapping process and the quality of decapped CuInSe2(0 0 1) surfaces were investigated by means of photoelectron spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation with excitation energies of 1050 and 95 eV. For a decapping temperature of 390 °C, an O 1s contamination signal as small as the detection limit was found.

The influence of the MgNi particle size on its electrochemical behavior as negative electrode for Ni-metal hydride (MH) batteries has been investigated. The initial discharge capacity is higher as the MgNi particle size increases, i.e. the initial discharge capacity of particles larger than 75μm is 439 mAh/g compared to 396 and 328 mAh/g for 20-75 and &lt;20μm particles, respectively. In addition, the cycle life of the MgNi electrode is improved by increasing the particle size. That is, the &gt;75μm particles electrode retains 41% of its initial capacity after 15 cycles compared to 35 and 23% for 20-75μm and &lt;20μm particles electrodes, respectively. The rate dischargeability is also improved by increasing the MgNi particle size. For example, at 400mA/g, the &gt;75μm particles electrode delivers 33% of its capacity measured at 20mA/g compared to 25 and 19% for 20-75μm and &lt;20μm powders, respectively. These results can be explained by the lower specific surface area of the electrode constituted of large particles which limits the formation of Mg(OH)2 resulting from the MgNi oxidation by the electrolyte. Moreover, on the basis of the evolution of the cycling discharge capacities with increasing charge input for the different powder fractions, it appears that the electrode resistance to pulverization is improved by increasing the MgNi particle size. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

HBP concentrations were varied from 0 to 50% v/v and the static and dynamic tensile properties were investigated along with interlaminar fracture toughness. Upon addition of HBP, the tensile modulus and dynamic storage modulus (E′) both diminished, although a greater decline was noticed in the static modulus. The elongation of the composites with HBP showed a pronounced increase as large as 314% at 50% v/v HBP. The loss factor (tan δ) indicated a lowering of the glass transition temperature (Tg) due to a change in crystal morphology from large, mixed perfection spherulites to finer, smaller spherulites. The change in Tg could have also resulted from some of the HBP being miscible in the amorphous phase, which caused a plasticizing effect of the PLLA. The interlaminar fracture toughness measured as the critical strain energy release rate (GIC) was significantly influenced by HBP. At 10% v/v HBP, GIC was at least double that of the unmodified composite and a rise as great as 250% was achieved with 50% v/v. The main factor contributing to high fracture toughness in this study was better wetting of the fibers by the matrix when the HBP was present. With improved ductility of the matrix, it caused ductile tearing along the fiber-matrix interface during crack propagation.","Biofibers; Biomaterials; Composites; Mechanical properties; Toughness","Composite materials; Crack propagation; Ductility; Fracture toughness; Natural fibers; Tensile properties; Ductile tearing; Hyperbranched polymers (HBP); Macromolecules; plasticizer; polylactic acid; polymer; article; composite material; concentration (parameters); crystal; energy; fiber; glass transition temperature; morphology; tensile strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544239237

Nanomaterials, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia","Australia is unique in terms of its geography, population distribution, and energy sources. It has an abundance of fossil fuel in the form of coal, natural gas, coal seam methane (CSM), oil, and a variety renewable energy sources that are under development. Unfortunately, most of the natural gas is located so far away from the main centres of population that it is more economic to ship the energy as LNG to neighboring countries. Electricity generation is the largest consumer of energy in Australia and accounts for around 50% of greenhouse gas emissions as 84% of electricity is produced from coal. Unless these emissions are curbed, there is a risk of increasing temperatures throughout the country and associated climatic instability. To address this, research is underway to develop coal gasification and processes for the capture and sequestration of CO2. Alternative transport fuels such as biodiesel are being introduced to help reduce emissions from vehicles. The future role of hydrogen is being addressed in a national study commissioned this year by the federal government. Work at the University of Queensland is also addressing full-cycle analysis of hydrogen production, transport, storage, and utilization for both stationary and transport applications. There is a modest but growing amount of university research in fuel cells in Australia, and an increasing interest from industry. Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd. (CFCL) has a leading position in planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) technology, which is being developed for a variety of applications, and next year Perth in Western Australia is hosting a trial of buses powered by proton-exchange fuel cells. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In order to further understand and evaluate the prerequisites for sustainable and energy-saving systems, ABB and Fortum have equipped an environmental information centre, located in Hammarby Sjöstad, Stockholm, Sweden, with an alternative energy system. The system is being used to demonstrate and evaluate how a system based on fuel cells and solar cells can function as a complement to existing electricity and heat production. The stationary energy system is situated on the top level of a three-floor glass building and is open to the public. The alternative energy system consists of a fuel cell system, a photovoltaic (PV) cell array, an electrolyser, hydrogen storage tanks, a biogas burner, dc/ac inverters, heat exchangers and an accumulator tank. The fuel cell system includes a reformer and a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) with a maximum rated electrical output of 4 kWel and a maximum thermal output of 6.5 kWth. The fuel cell stack can be operated with reformed biogas, or directly using hydrogen produced by the electrolyser. The cell stack in the electrolyser consists of proton exchange membrane (PEM) cells. To evaluate different automatic control strategies for the system, a simplified dynamic model has been developed in MATLAB Simulink. The model based on measurement data taken from the actual system. The evaluation is based on demand curves, investment costs, electricity prices and irradiation. Evaluation criteria included in the model are electrical and total efficiencies as well as economic parameters. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This investigation implies that partial cation substitutions using smaller sized- and/or higher valenced-cations with higher electronegativities might provide higher energy modes of Raman spectra, and then, lower hydrogen desorption (decomposition) temperatures. Next, as an example, the hydrogen desorption properties of LiNH2 and its partial cation substitution are preliminary examined.

Montesano 49, 80131 Naples, Italy","Ferritin is a ubiquitous protein required for intracellular iron storage; its biosynthesis is mainly regulated by iron-regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) at post-transcriptional level. This regulation prevents iron excess from promoting the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). IRP1 is regulated by such factors as intracellular iron levels, the oxidants H2O 2 and NO. We recently demonstrated that oxalomalate (OMA, α-hydroxy-β-oxalosuccinic acid), a competitive inhibitor of aconitase, which is an enzyme of the citric acid cycle, remarkably decreases the binding activity of IRP1. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this molecule could affect the expression of ferritin. The RNA-binding activity of IRP1, evaluated by gel retardation assay, decreased after treatment of several cell lines with 5 mM OMA, with a maximal decrease of about 3-fold after 6 h. This effect remained almost constant up to 48 h after which it returned to basal levels. Intracellular ferritin levels, determined by Western blot analysis, increased in correlation with the OMA-induced decrease of IRP1 binding activity. Furthermore, treatment of cells with OMA caused a rise in ferritin mRNA levels. Interestingly, in cells exposed to iron challenge, OMA-induced overexpression of ferritin prevented formation of ROS and cellular lipid peroxidation. These data show that an inhibitor of aconitase, OMA, besides being involved in energetic metabolism, is able to control ferritin expression, probably through molecular mechanisms of either post-transcriptional regulation or transcriptional modulation, with advantageous consequences for the cell. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

DK-1350, Denmark","A significant problem in current coastal research is the understanding of linkages between morphological phenomena occurring on different temporal and spatial scales. Morphodynamic processes in the nearshore typically exhibit nonlinear behaviour and consequently, phenomena which occur on short temporal (event) scales as, e.g. observed during field experiments have generally been difficult to upscale to provide an understanding of the long-term behaviour of the coast on the time scale of seasons or decades. This paper documents a persistent onshore migration of nearshore bar features over a period of 3 decades using a set of cross-shore profile surveys from a barrier on the Danish North Sea coast. The observed behaviour is consistent with experimental data obtained during weeklong field campaigns when sediment transport and bar migration were found to be landward directed during high-energy dissipative conditions. Hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes leading to onshore bar migration and eventually welding of the bars are documented to provide an explanation for the observed long-term evolutionary trends. In addition, bar welding and the resulting intertidal bar formation represent an onshore sediment storage which is subsequently available for aeolian transport. Observations on aeolian sediment transport indicate that transport rates and sediment supply to the foredunes critically depend on the presence of dry sand sources as represented by well-drained intertidal bars. Measurements of long-term accretion rates in foredunes indicate that volumes deposited on the crest and lee slope of the dunes are in reasonable correspondence with volumes supplied to the subaerial beach through the process of bar welding. Hence, the data suggest that a persistent onshore-directed sediment supply occurs from the shoreface, across the surf and intertidal zones and into the dunes of the investigated barrier. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

It has been shown that carbon is protecting the nickel nanocrystals from oxidation leading to a magnetic behaviour of the sample congruent with the superparamagnetic properties of single domain particles.

For this purpose, the protocol includes a low-cost failure-free mechanism requiring only locating the mobility agent maintaining the latest checkpoint of each process on an mobile node during its handoff process. This mechanism forces only the latest checkpoint to be maintained on the stable storage while incurring low failure-free overhead. Also, the protocol uses two garbage collection schemes to remove log information of mobile nodes. The first scheme enables each mobile node to autonomously remove useless log information in its storage by piggybacking only some additional information without requiring any extra message and forced checkpoint. The second scheme allows the mobile node to remove a part of log information in its storage if more empty storage space is required after executing the first scheme. It reduces the number of processes to participate in the garbage collection by using the size of the log information of each process. Simulation results show that the two proposed schemes significantly reduce the garbage collection overhead compared with traditional schemes. Additionally, we present an efficient recovery algorithm to avoid frequent stable storage accesses, impose no restriction on the execution of live processes during recovery and ensure consistent recovery in case of being integrated with independent checkpointing. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

T., Uttaranchal, India","Water scarcity, accelerated soil erosion, and food security are the basic concerns in rain-dependent agricultural systems. The conservation bench terrace (CBT) system, in conjunction with water harvesting and recycling techniques, is an efficient conservation measure for in situ rain water harvesting, minimizing soil erosion, and sustaining productivity in arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid climates. Economic analysis has revealed that the CBT system exhibited 71.7% and 58.5% higher net present value (NPV), respectively, when compared to a rainfed maize-wheat system and a conventional system of sloping borders (i.e., making plots on slopes at 2% to 4%) with supplemental irrigation from harvested runoff. Various combinations of conventional and CBT systems were analyzed for economic efficiency, nutrient loss, and food security under different probabilities of runoff-producing rainfall by extrapolating the experimental data. The pure CBT system was found to be inadequate to generate sufficient runoff to provide even one pre-sowing irrigation of 5 cm depth to winter wheat crop. In contrast, pure conventional and a combination of conventional and CBT systems in the ratios of 50:50 and 75:25 had the potential to yield runoff more than sufficient to provide two supplemental irrigations to wheat crop at all probability levels. However, these systems result in higher soil and nutrient losses. The conventional and CBT systems in the ratio of 25:75 produced sufficient runoff to provide two irrigations with negligible overflow. Benefit cost ratio (BCR), payback period (PBP), and internal rate of return (IRR) criteria favor the pure CBT system owing to its low initial investment on pond construction for less runoff storage. However, NPV was always superior for combinations of conventional and CBT systems in the ratios of 25:75 or 50:50 over other combinations. Total maize-equivalent and energy production criteria also confirm that these two combinations perform better than the others. It is thus concluded that conventional and CBT systems in the ratios of 50:50 or 25:75 are the best choices to maximize economic returns, ensure food security, minimize soil and nutrient losses, and produce sufficient runoff for harvesting and recycling under rainfed cropping systems in sub-humid climates.","Conservation bench terrace; Economic efficiency; Energy production; India; Maize equivalent; Sloping borders","Erosion; Food products; Harvesting; Irrigation; Nutrition; Probability; Productivity; Recycling; Soils; Conservation bench terrace (CBT); Water harvesting; Water scarcity; Climatology; crop production; economic analysis; erosion control; maize; rainfed agriculture; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Nucleopolyhedrovirus; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243085586

However, as this process generates large amounts of CO2, replacement of the combustion heat source with a nuclear heat source for 773-1 173 K processes has been proposed in order to eliminate these CO2 emissions. In this paper, a novel method of nuclear hydrogen production by reforming dimethyl ether (DME) with steam at about 573 K is proposed. From a thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of DME steam reforming, the authors identified conditions that provide high hydrogen production fraction at low pressure and temperatures of about 523-573 K. By setting this low-temperature hydrogen production process upstream from a turbine and nuclear reactor at about 573 K, the total energy utilization efficiency according to equilibrium mass and heat balance analysis is about 50%, and it is 75% for a fast breeder reactor (FBR), where turbine is upstream of the reformer.","Dimethyl ether; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Energy-utilization efficiency; Fast breeder reactor; Hydrogen production fraction; Low-temperature nuclear reactor; Nuclear hydrogen production; Nuclear power generation; Steam reforming","Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Hydrogen fuels; Liquefied petroleum gas; Steam; Synthetic fuels; Thermodynamics; Alternative energy sources; Fast breeder reactors (FBR); Steam reforming; Nuclear reactors; nuclear application",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242665149

However, there are a lot of problems associated with the system, such as regeneration being cancelled out by wheel slide and trolley voltage conditions, decreases in electric braking force in the higher speed ranges, and restrictions on regenerative power determined by power supply circuit impedance. In order to utilize and recycle braking energy and secure a steady regenerative load, we selected lithium ion batteries to store electric energy and developed a rechargeable lithium ion battery (600 V system) for use on electric railway vehicles as one of the prominent alternatives. In this paper, we report on an energy recycling contact-wire-less tramcar that uses the rechargeable lithium ion batteries and show the tramcar's performance and characteristics of the battery as developed. The battery under development has demonstrated excellent performance in terms of energy and power density, efficiency, 500 A charge and discharge current, internal resistance and maintenance work.","Braking energy; Contact-wire-less tramcar; Energy storage equipment; Rechargeable lithium ion battery; Regenerative ratio","Electric potential; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Ions; Lithium batteries; Recycling; Secondary batteries; Braking energy; Contact-wire-less tramcar; Energy storage equipment; Rechargeable lithium ion battery; Regenerative ratio; Electric railroads",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142753596

Energy storage media that use power efficiently and eradicate such problems have been attracting interest, with several energy storage applications, including batteries and flywheels, having already been investigated. A wide range of large-scale electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) quickly charged and discharged, offer durability, maintenance-free features, low pollution and high efficiency levels, have been developed. Our research compared batteries with EDLCs in terms of their ability to charge / discharge at DC 75V. For the latest study, we produced a prototype DC electrified railway energy storage system that consists of EDLCs, a diode bridge rectifier, a chopper system, and a pulse width modulated (PWM) converter, useful information being obtained from charge / discharge tests.

Moreover, we present a global constrained Markov model for contours in images that uses this statistical model for the likelihood. Our model is amenable to an Iterative Conditional Estimation (ICE) procedure for the estimation of the parameters; our model also allows segmentation by means of the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm the Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) algorithm, or the Modes of Posterior Marginals (MPM) Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm. This yields an original unsupervised statistical method for edge-detection, with three variants. The estimation and the segmentation procedures have been tested on a total of 160 images. Those tests indicate that the model and its estimation are valid for applications that require an energy term based on the log-likelihood ratio. Besides edge-detection, our model can be used for semiautomatic extraction of contours, localization of shapes, non-photo-realistic rendering; more generally, it might be useful in various problems that require a statistical likelihood for contours.","Contours in images; Edge-detection; Markov Random Field model; Parameter estimation; Unsupervised statistical segmentation","Edge detection; Estimation; Feature extraction; Markov processes; Mathematical models; Statistical methods; Vectors; Iterative conditional estimation; Modes of posterior marginals; Image processing; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biological model; cluster analysis; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer graphics; computer simulation; evaluation; image enhancement; image subtraction; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; probability; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; validation study; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Computer Graphics; Computer Simulation; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Markov Chains; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Subtraction Technique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042627315

Reinforcement of this questioning has been obtained in this work where we show that the binding capacity was improved when the molecular weight (MW) of the Xg polymers is decreased by enzymatic hydrolysis. Moreover, the enthalpy changes associated with the adsorption process between Xg and cellulose is similar for Xgs with similar MW (but differing in the fine structure such as the presence/absence of fucose). On the basis of these results, we suggest that the fine structure and MW of Xg determines the energy and amount of binding to cellulose, respectively. Thus, the occurrence of different fine structural domains of Xg (e.g. the presence of fucose and the distribution of galactoses) might have several different functions in the wall. Besides the structural function in primary wall, these results might have impact on the packing features of storage Xg in seed cotyledons, since the MW and absence of fucose could also be associated with the self-association capacity. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

We tested the hypothesis that photosynthesis is the primary target of iron stress in phytoplankton living in this specific environment, resulting in a reduced carbohydrate production. Cultures of a small Antarctic diatom, Chaetoceros brevis, were exposed to two different photon irradiances under iron-rich and iron-poor conditions. Under both light regimes growth rate was reduced only slightly by iron starvation, as expected because the iron requirement of a small-celled species such as C. brevis is low. Even so, iron-starved cells differed markedly from iron-replete cells: for low and high irradiance, respectively, they had a 20 and 27% lower content of light-harvesting pigments (chlorophyll a and c2 and fucoxanthin), a 8 and 15% decrease in light absorption and a 15 and 17% decrease in quantum yield of photosystem II. The diurnal production of water-extractable carbohydrates was reduced by 28 and 31%, which resulted in a low supply of energy and carbon skeletons from these storage products. This may well have influenced protein synthesis. The nocturnal consumption of carbohydrates was also reduced, which, together with the almost proportional decrease in cellular C and N content, suggests that the C and N metabolism were tightly tuned in iron-stressed cultures. The decrease in C and N content correlated with a decrease in cell volume. Our results indicate that iron limitation is likely to affect the ability of phytoplankton to maintain high rates of protein synthesis within the deep wind-mixed layer of the Southern Ocean. In addition, growth at the surface could be inhibited by too much light: iron-poor cultures of C. brevis grown at low irradiance showed enhanced sensitivity to photoinhibition.","Carbohydrates; Diatoms; Iron; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Pigments; Southern Ocean","carbohydrate; iron; metabolism; nutrient limitation; photosynthesis; algae; Bacillariophyceae; Bacillariophyta; Chaetoceros; Chaetoceros brevis; Eukaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542424961

The adipose tissue is a target organ for glucocorticoids and several studies have been carried out on the function of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in obese subjects without conclusive results. A recent and innovative finding is that adipose tissue can produce cortisol from its inactive precursor, cortisone. The identification of leptin, a hormone synthesised by fat tissue, has ushered in the modern view of this tissue as a true endocrine organ. Leptin is produced primarily by subcutaneous and to a lesser extent by visceral adipose tissue, and has a central role in controlling body weight and, especially in regulating fat stores. Leptin is also involved in several complex functions, including physiological processes-associated with puberty. Another hormone of fat tissue is angiotensinogen, which is produced in larger amounts by visceral than subcutaneous fat. Human and animals adipose tissue express a whole renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Angiotensin II, the final effector of this system is probably produced locally by adipose tissue. The function of adipose RAS is not well known. RAS can participate together with other hormones and substances, in adipocyte differentiation and fat tissue growth, but could be also involved in the pathogenesis of complications of obesity including arterial hypertension.","Adipocyte; Fat tissue; Hormone regulation; Hypertension; Obesity; Renin-angiotensin system","angiotensinogen; cortisone; glucocorticoid; hydrocortisone; leptin; adipocyte; adipose tissue; body weight; cardiovascular disease; cell differentiation; conference paper; endocrine disease; endocrine gland; hormone action; hormone synthesis; human; hydrocortisone release; hypertension; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; nonhuman; obesity; pathogenesis; puberty; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; subcutaneous fat; tissue growth; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Endocrine System; Endocrine System Diseases; Humans",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542420165

The aim is to develop a fuel-optimal control which is not relying on the a priori knowledge of the future driving conditions (global optimal control), but only upon the current system operation. The methodology developed is valid for those problem that are characterized by hard constraints on the state - battery state-of-charge (SOC) in this application - and by an arc cost - fuel consumption rate - which is not an explicit function of the state. A suboptimal control is found with a proper definition of a cost function to be minimized at each time instant. The ""instantaneous"" cost function includes the fuel energy and the electrical energy, the latter related to the state constraints. In order to weight the two forms of energy, a new definition of the equivalence factors has been derived. The strategy has been applied to the ""Hyper"" prototype of DaimlerChrysler, obtained from the hybridization of the Mercedes A-Class. Simulation results illustrate the potential of the proposed control in terms of fuel economy and in keeping the deviations of SOC at a low level.","Cost optimal control; Dynamic programming; Fuel optimal control; Road vehicle control; Suboptimal control","Computer simulation; Cost effectiveness; Dynamic programming; Electric currents; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Fuel economy; Electrical energy; Fuel optimal control; Parallel hybrid electric vehicles; Road vehicle control; Suboptimal control; Optimal control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442598173

Simulations were made for square shaped zones planted with 10 m high trees and areas ranging from 50,000 to 250,000 m2. The criterion used to evaluate the risk to a LPG storage sphere was the stress failure of the diagonal arm braces supporting it. The explosion effects were studied for a 14.5 m diameter LPG storage sphere, located at distances ranging from 10 to 100 m away from the border of the congested area. It is shown that congested areas of at least 100,000 m2 can pose a risk to the LPG spheres with minimal filling. It is possible to conclude that it is better to keep a smaller number of full filled spheres than many spheres with less filling of LPG. We estimated for congested areas with 25% blockage ratio that the minimum safe distance, measured from the border of the tree grove to the sphere, varies from 10 m, for 100,000 m2 areas, to 87.6 m, for 250,000 m2 areas. The tree spacing influence represented by the blockage ratio was also analyzed, showing that it affects the sphere minimum safe distance. Finally, recommendations are made regarding the minimum safe distance between the spheres and the congested area, which seems to have a maximum value, as well as other ways to lessen the risk represented by explosions, but further conclusions would require a different approach as the loading would be dynamic instead of impulsive for tree belts with areas bigger than 250,000 m2. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Main clinical features are paresthesia, hypohidrosis, angiokeratoma, renal insufficiency, and cardiovascular or cerebral complications. The exact pathogenesis is unclear. Beside mechanical storage biochemical factors might play a role. As FD is a multisystemic disorder and mitochondrial dysfunction has been described in patients with neuronal ceroidlipofuscinosis (another lysosomal storage disease) we examined mitochondrial function in fibroblasts from patients with FD. Results. Activities of respiratory chain enzymes I, IV, and V were significantly (p<0.01) lower in FD-cells. Mitochondrial recovery was unchanged as judged by the activity of the mitochondrial marker enzyme citratesynthase, cellular protein content was not significantly different. CP, ADP, and AMP concentrations were significantly (p<0.01) lower in FD-cells. ATP was slightly, but not significantly reduced (p=0.045). Conclusion. Organ dysfunction in FD may not only be explained by mechanical storage of glycosphingolipids. As in NCL, lysosomal storage material may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction with a reduction of respiratory chain enzyme activities and a subsequent drop in cellular levels of energy-rich phosphates. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

These amino acids were found in all regions of cuticle investigated, but in widely varying amounts. In fully mature adult locusts the largest amounts of di- and trityrosine were obtained from the prealar arms and wing-hinges, structures possessing long-range elasticity and being involved in energy storage in the flight system. In structures where deformations tend to occur more slowly, such as the clypeo-labral springs and tracheae, di- and trityrosine are less abundant. In sclerotized cuticle from femur and tibia, as well as in cornea and in the highly stretchable intersegmental membranes of mature females, they are only found in trace amounts and are probably unrelated to elasticity. The trityrosine-to-dityrosine ratio in the variuos cuticular regions vary from nearly equal amounts of the two amino acids to about ten times more dityrosine than trityrosine, indicating that the regions differ in degree of cross-linking; the tracheal wall is the material with the highest trityrosine-to-dityrosine ratio. In some cuticular regions the ratio increases during maturation from newly moulted (teneral) adults to reproductively active locusts; the most pronounced increase was observed for the wing-hinges, and only a small increase was observed for the abdominal tergal plates. In most cuticular regions in fifth instar locust nymphs the contents of di- and trityrosine corresponded to the contents measured for the adult cuticular regions, but only trace amounts of the two amino acids were obtained from the region of the nymphal wing base which corresponds to the wing-hinge containing cuticular region in adult locusts. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Cross-links; Cuticle; Dityrosine; Elasticity; Fluorescence; Locust; Resilin; Schistocerca gregaria","cuticle proteins, insects; dityrosine; drug derivative; insect protein; resilin; trityrosine; tyrosine; animal; article; chemistry; female; forelimb; grasshopper; growth, development and aging; histology; mass spectrometry; metabolism; nymph; tissue distribution; Animals; Female; Grasshoppers; Insect Proteins; Mass Spectrometry; Nymph; Tissue Distribution; Tyrosine; Wing; Orthoptera; Schistocerca; Schistocerca gregaria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942502860

The contact size is 0.32 μm and its height is varied between 2.1 and 3.8 μm which give aspect ratio from 6.7 to 11.9. It appears that both Ti thickness and aspect ratio play important role on contact resistance. Especially, P+ contact resistance is more sensitive to these parameters. P+ contact resistance in contact array is increased from 1 to 4 KΩ per contact when Ti thickness decreases from 900 to 500 Å, while N+ contact resistance is just increased from 300 to 400 Ω. TEM image reveals that the degree of Ti silicidation depends on the Ti thickness. The boundary between silicon and TiSi2 is non-uniform with Ti thickness of 500 Å, however, it becomes uniform and flat with Ti thickness of 900 Å. To characterize the behavior of current flow in various contacts, both contact array and Kelvin resistor patterns are used. It appears that Schottky barrier plays major role at low voltage region, while the spreading resistance dominates at high voltage region and thus contact resistance approaches to 220 Ω at high voltage region regardless of process condition. The Schottky barrier evaluated by thermionic emission model increases with decreasing Ti thickness and increasing aspect ratio. It appears that a relationship between Schottky barrier and process parameters is given by Schottky barrier energy=(Ti thickness)-0.26×(aspect ratio) 0.53. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that Neuber's rule is actually a particular case of ESED method, namely when the dissipation of the plastic strain energy at the notch root is neglected in ESED method. The reason for the overestimation of the local strains using Neuber's rule is thus explained essentially and the physical meaning of ESED method in both monotonic and cyclic form is further defined. In terms of the real physical behavior occurring at the notch root during cyclic plastic deformation, a modified version of ESED method, in which only the heat energy is considered as a dissipation and the stored energy is regarded as a contribution to local stress and strain ranges, has been developed in this paper. It is shown that, for the case of cyclic loading, the modified ESED method further improves the accuracy of the original ESED method in prediction of the nonlinear stress/strain behavior of notches. It is also shown that the relation developed in this paper can easily be used for a simulation of the local strain-stress history near a notch root. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The combined energy and attitude control system (CEACS) concept is based on a double counter rotating flywheel assembly serving simultaneously for the satellite energy storage and attitude control tasks. In the past years, this synergistic system was proposed for larger spacecraft, but until today a comprehensive end-to-end system demonstration for small satellites still has not been performed. On this basis, the investigation is narrowed to the consideration for small satellites at the inception of the study. First, the CEACS architecture is presented along with its mathematical models. Then, numerical treatments with a sufficient magnitude are performed, which allow an assessment of the system's merits. The simulation results pertaining to the ideal and non-ideal test cases indicate that the CEACS is judiciously an attractive synergistic system for future small satellites. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to detect alterations of cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolism in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) prior to the development of structural heart diseases. Therefore cardiac phosphorus-31 two-dimensional chemical shift imaging ( 31P 2D CSI) was employed. Twenty-four male patients (mean age 47.2 ± 12 years) homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the hemochromatosis associated HFE gene and twentyfour male healthy volunteers (mean age 47 ± 11 years) as age-matched controls were included in this study. Using a 1.5-Tesla whole-body magnetic resonance scanner, electrocardiograph-triggered transversal 31P 2D CSI was performed. Left ventricle mean phosphocreatine (PCr) to β-adenosine triphosphate (β-ATP) ratios of patients with HHC (1.60 ± 0.41) were significantly decreased in comparison to healthy volunteers (1.93 ± 0.36; p = 0.004). Furthermore, we detected moderate, negative correlations between left ventricular PCr to β-ATP ratios and transferrin saturation, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein as well as triglyceride. This study shows that 31P 2D CSI permits the detection of alterations of cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolism in patients with HHC, but without any evidence for heart disease. The decreased PCr to β-ATP ratios in HHC might be caused by mitochondrial impairment due to cardiac iron overload. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The boiler combustion air is supplied from a fan driven by a 30 kW at 1450-rpm induction motor. Since the fan motor running at nominal speed has supplied the same airflow rate, excess air amount and exhaust gas temperature were very high at low loads. In that stage, boiler efficiency was low due to thermal energy losses and also consequently leads to electrical energy losses. In order to increase the boiler efficiency, the fan motor speed is decreased to 400 rpm from 1450 by using variable speed drive (VSD). After implementation of the VSD, stack temperature was reduced from 195 to 145°C. This caused an increase of the boiler efficiency 2.5% and 8000 kWh electrical energy was saved in a month. The paper describes a method of energy saving in a boiler house by using a VSD. It is evaluated and quantified the energy losses associated with excess air rate and its cost to manufacturers. An overview and analysis of such conservation measures, along with, the potential energy and cost saving, the implementation cost and simple payback period are also given. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The technique is applied to control systems include three areas having two steam turbines and one hydro turbine tied together through power lines. As a consequence of continually load variation, the frequency of the power system changes over time. In conventional studies, frequency transients are minimized by using conventional integral and proportional controllers aiming of secondary control in AGC and zero steady-state error is obtained after sufficient delay time.

Design: Long-term follow-up (104 weeks) of a randomized, open-label study. Setting: Seventeen ambulatory HIV clinics in Australia and London. Subjects: Patients with HIV lipodystrophy were randomized to switch from a thymidine analogue to ABC, while continuing all other antiretroviral therapy (ABC arm) (n = 42) or continue current therapy (ZDV/d4T arm) (n = 43). Intervention: At week 24, all control patients could switch to ABC. Of the original 111 patients randomized, 85 had long-term follow-up data, with 77 having imaging data available at 104 weeks. Main outcome measure: The primary endpoint was time-weighted change in limb fat mass, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Results: At week 104, the mean increase in limb fat for the ABC and ZDV/d4T group was 1.26 ± 2.02 kg and 0.49 ± 1.38 kg, respectively. The time-weighted change for limb fat was significantly different between the two arms (0.43 kg; P = 0.008). On-treatment analysis demonstrated a trend for increased limb fat in patients in the ABC arm. Visceral fat accumulation, buffalo hump, self-assessed lipodystrophy or the lipodystrophy case definition score (LCDS) did not improve. Conclusions: In patients with moderate-to-severe lipodystrophy, significant improvements in subcutaneous fat continued over 104 weeks after switching from a thymidine analogue to ABC. Nevertheless, the lipodystrophy syndrome was still evident, indicating additional strategies need evaluating. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Abacavir; HIV lipodystrophy; Lipoatrophy; Thymidine analogues","abacavir; antiretrovirus agent; fat; stavudine; thymidine derivative; zidovudine; absorptiometry; adipose tissue; article; Australia; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; follow up; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypersensitivity reaction; imaging system; lipid storage; lipoatrophy; lipodystrophy; long term care; major clinical study; mitochondrial toxicity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; revertant; self evaluation; side effect; time series analysis; treatment outcome; United Kingdom; Adipose Tissue; Anti-HIV Agents; Body Composition; Bone Density; Densitometry, X-Ray; Dideoxynucleosides; Follow-Up Studies; HIV Infections; HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy Syndrome; Humans; Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors; Stavudine; Zidovudine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342589533

Methods: We evaluated serum markers of bone formation or resorption, and measured BMD using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), in three patients with MPS type III. Results: Serum vitamin D were low, and BMDs greatly reduced at lumbar and femoral sites, indicating the possibility of osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Discussion: These skeletal effects probably result from nutritional deficiencies and inability to walk, rather than from the genetic defect itself.

In this work, we have studied experimentally the structure, electrochemical and electronic properties of nanocrystalline and polycrystalline TiFe-, LaNi5- and Mg2Ni-type phases. These materials were prepared either by mechanical alloying (MA) followed by annealing or by induction melting method, respectively. The properties of hydrogen host materials can be modified substantially by alloying to obtain the desired storage characteristics. For example, it was found that the respective replacement of Fe in TiFe by Ni and/or by Mg, Cr, Mn, Co, Mo, Zr improved not only the discharge capacity but also the cycle life of these electrodes. In the nanocrystalline TiFe0.125Mg0.125Ni0.75 powder, discharge capacity of up to 158 mAhg-1 was measured. Independently, it was found that cobalt substituting nickel in LaNi4-xMn 0.75Al0.25Cox alloy greatly improved the discharge capacity and cycle life of LaNi5 material. In nanocrystalline LaNi3.75Mn0.75Al0.25Co 0.25 powder, discharge capacities up to 260mAhg-1 were measured. On the other hand, the Mg2Ni electrode, mechanically alloyed and annealed, displayed the maximum discharge capacity (100 mAhg -1) at the 1st cycle but degraded strongly with cycling. In nanocrystalline Mg1.5Mn0.5Ni alloy discharge capacities up to 241 mAhg-1 were measured. Finally, the electronic properties of nanocrystalline alloys are compared to that of polycrystalline samples. The studies show, that electrochemical properties of Ni-MH batteries are the function of the microstructure and the chemical composition and of used electrode materials. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Although initially the 'dynamic' hydrogen storage capacities were H/M ∼0.7, they decreased steeply within a few cycles, and then they declined gradually. At around 400th cycle, they decreased to nearly half of the maximum capacities regardless of crystal structures and compositions of the tested alloys. However, their 'equilibrium' capacities did not decrease as the 'dynamic' ones with progress of hydrogen sorption. As for the bulk, not serious disproportionation but pulverization and lattice expansion were observed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and microscopic analyses. The expansion indicated that some amounts of hydrogen remained in the lattice cells. It was considered that pulverization of the alloy particles and amorphous shell formed on the surface prevented the alloys from smooth hydrogen sorption, and which led to the decrease of the 'dynamic' hydrogen storage capacities without that of the 'equilibrium' ones in the cycle tests. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Instrumental to such goals will be the research and development of storage systems with performance characteristics compatible with major application requirements. Lithium or nickel are replacing lead in batteries, in order to better meet the extremely varying technical and economical requirements in fast growing conventional and new applications. Moreover, few technologies now permit to store hydrogen by modifying its physical state in gaseous or liquid form. The variety of hydrogen needs in the energy systems and in the vehicular sector is justifying the effort on solid state (metal hydrides and carbon nanostructures) or chemical systems (chemical hydrides). In this overview, emphasis is given to the major achievements in the field of electrical energy and hydrogen storage, in relation to the technological goals, which have been proposed in the major public research and collaborative programs throughout the world. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Batteries; Energy storage; Hydrogen storage; Supercapacitors","Capacitors; Diffusion; Electricity; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Environmental engineering; Hydrogen; Lead acid batteries; Lithium batteries; Mechanical alloying; Oxidation; Transport properties; Energy carriers; Hydrogen storage; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842425449

Using planetary and vibration mills, the influence of milling temperatures of up to 250°C and of the energy input during milling on the hydride formation has been studied. XRD and high resolution scanning electron microscopy were utilised to follow the structural evolution during hydride formation upon ball milling. Yield rates of up to 90wt.% for Mg2FeH6 were achieved after optimising the synthesis conditions and Fe concentration. The decomposition of the hydride on desorption was then studied in dependence on synthesis conditions and initial Fe content. Gravimetric analysis was performed to characterise kinetics of absorption and desorption. The role of minor additions of platinum group metals (PGMs) was investigated with regards to kinetics and reversibility. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed TLB is constructed as multiple banks, with a small two-bank buffer, called as a filter-bank buffer, located above its associated bank. Either a filter-bank buffer or a main bank TLB can be selectively accessed based on two bits in the filter-bank buffer. Power savings are achieved by reducing the number of entries accessed at a time, by using filtering and bank mechanism. The overhead of the proposed TLB turns out to be negligible compared with other hierarchical structures. That is, the two-cycle overhead of the proposed TLB is only about 3%, as compared with the 6% overhead of filter (micro)-TLB and the 9% overhead of banked-filter TLB. We show that the average hit ratios of the filter-bank buffers and the main banks of the proposed TLB are 88 and 12%, respectively. Therefore, significant power savings can be achieved with just a small performance degradation. The Power × Delay product can be reduced by about 88% compared with a fully associative TLB, 67% with respect to filter-TLB, and 37% relative to banked-filter TLB. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The feasibility of solid phase extraction (SPE) and stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) for the determination of eight PAHs in run-off water samples has been evaluated. Both are appropriate to determine PAHs in run-off waters, but SPE is suitable for the determination of overall PAHs, while SBSE is used for the determination of free PAHs. The combination of both extraction techniques can then be used to estimate PAHs bound to DOM. Another approach based in the only use of SBSE is proposed for the estimation of all PAHs fractions (free, bound to DOM, and overall), once we are able to estimate the fraction percentage the free concentration represents. The percentage of free fraction was variable in the run-off waters with medium levels of DOM depending on the number of aromatic rings, molecular weight and water solubility of PAHs. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Box 3015, 2601 DA Delft, Netherlands","The water balance of the upper Nile swamps, in particular, the Sudd, has been the topic of debate for many years. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) is a parameterization scheme of surface heat fluxes based on spectral satellite measurements. The SEBAL scheme has been applied to derive the energy balance components from National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) images over the extensive swamps in the upper Nile. The study area covers the swamps of the Sudd, Bahr el Ghazal and the Sobat sub-basins. The actual evaporation and soil moisture for an area between 2-12°N and 26-36°E (approximately 1000km×1000 km) have been investigated. Monthly (actual) evaporation and soil moisture maps for the year 2000 have been generated. The evaporation results were verified against longer-term averaged rainfall and flow data of the three sub-basins. A close resemblance was obtained for the Sudd (1.8% error) and the Sobat Basin (5.7% error), while the balance lacks closure for the Ghazal basin (27%) due to un-gauged or inadequately gauged inflow from the upper catchments. It is concluded that soil moisture availability controls the monthly evaporation rates for all areas that are not saturated with water, and that a significant dry-down in the winter period occurs. It is concluded that the evaporation for the Sudd wetlands is 20% less and the average area occupied by the wetlands is 74% larger than assumed in earlier hydrological studies (e.g. Jonglei canal studies). The derived results can serve as a sound basis to support the widely debated evaporation losses from the Sudd, as well as form an input to regional scale climate models for studying atmospheric circulation patterns over Africa and the Nile Basin. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

For planar PAH, the ability to store electrical energy is largely determined by the electronic hardness (half the electronic gap), which multiplied the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. The energy storage capability of PAH (oligophenyls, oligoacenes, and medium-size planar systems) depends on the size and shape of the molecules.

(J. Phys. Chem. B 2003, 707, 1028). According to Young's theory, the cosine of the contact angle is a function of the interfacial energy between the solid and the liquid, which in turn changes with the surface fraction of hydrophilic regions. As the photoreaction proceeds, the surface fraction of hydrophilic regions increases, which lowers the interfacial energy between the solid and the liquid, resulting in the lowering of the contact angle. Therefore, the cosine of the contact angle is more appropriate to extract both the rates of hydrophilic conversion processes and the rates of back-processes, compared with the reciprocal of the contact angle proposed empirically by Sakai et al. Our method provides a quantitative way to analyze the kinetics of both photoinduced hydrophilic conversion processes and the back-processes to the hydrophobic states during long-term storage in the dark.",,"Angle measurement; Contact angle; Hydrophilicity; Interfacial energy; Irradiation; Substrates; Titanium dioxide; Viscous flow; Light irradiation; Photoinduced hydrophilic conversion; Pressure difference; Surface fraction; Surface chemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342590781

The hydrogen storage capacity of fluorite-structured Mg-containing compounds are shown to have a reversible electrochemical storage capacity of more than four times that of the commonly used MischMetal-based AB5 compounds in NiMH, i.e. 1500mAh/g (5.6wt.%). The formation of octahedral sites within the crystal lattice is argued to be very crucial for the improved kinetics of hydrogen absorption and desorption. It is shown that the fluorite-structure can be conserved with both precious Sc and the less expensive Ti up to a Mg content of 80at.%. Both thermodynamic and kinetic data are presented in relation to the materials composition. In addition, the development of preshaped batteries, as the first step to battery integration, has contributed to a much higher level of design freedom for portable electronic equipment. The manufacturing process of preshaped batteries will be described together with their electrochemical characteristics. Advantageously, the mechanical stability is provided locally by polymer rivets, allowing to get rid of heavy metallic casings and to make use of a much wider range of battery shapes. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In order to find the best carbon-based materials, the specific roles of the molecular and solid-state contributions have to be understood. Here, the molecular contributions are analyzed. A semi-quantitative method is proposed to compare the charge storage capability of polyaromatic hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs). For planar PAHs, the ability to store electrical energy is found to be to a large extend determined by a single parameter, that is the electronic hardness (half the electronic gap) multiplied the number of carbon atom in the molecule.

The pellets were coated with an aqueous dispersion of ethyl cellulose (Surelease ®) to different levels of weight gain (5, 10, and 20%). The tensile strength, deformability, linear strain, elastic modulus, and shear strength of the coated and uncoated pellets were determined by conventional techniques, which are obtained from diametral compression test of individual pellets and compaction of a bed of pellets. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) was performed on single pellets to determine the storage modulus and phase angle of the coated pellets. This work demonstrated that the coating film affected the mechanical properties of the pellets differently depending on the properties of the core pellets. Analysis of variance established a significant increase in the strength of the soft GMS- or glycerol-containing pellets with coating, while the effect of the coating material was not significant with respect to the elastic modulus, storage modulus, and phase angle of such pellets. The effects of the coating material on the elastic modulus, deformability, storage modulus, and phase angle of the rigid lactose-containing pellets were significant. The sinusoidal stress-relaxation cycle of the DMA illustrated the increase in the viscoelasticity of all the pellets after coating. Finally, the work demonstrate the advantages of DMA in determining the reversible or dissipated energy by means of storage modulus or phase angle when compared with the irreversible structural destruction of the pellets by conventional techniques. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

All carbopol compacts showed a main glass transition, at a temperature between 130 and 140°C, Tg, independently of their cross-linking degree and molecular weight. Additionally two batches of Carbopol® 971P, which had greater contents in residual solvents, also presented a secondary transition at 65-70°C. Sorption of water during storage of carbopol compacts at different relative humidity environments caused the Tg to strongly decrease. Compacts stored at 97.5% relative humidity have Tg below 0°C and behave, at room temperature, as flexible hydrogels. The Gordon-Taylor/Kelley-Bueche equation only fit the dependence of Tg on water content well for carbopol compacts containing less than 15% water. The plasticizing effect of water was clearly evidenced in the considerable decrease in the storage and loss moduli of the compacts. Although the energy associated to the glass transitions of carbopol polymers, 0.40-0.50Jg-1°C-1, is high enough to be clearly detected by DSC, in some cases the evaporation of residual solvents may make it difficult to observe the Tg. This inconvenience is overcome using MTDSC or oscillatory rheometry. The decrease in Tg of carbopol caused by water sorption when compacts were stored at 97.5% R.H. explains why their loss (G″) and storage (G′) moduli at room temperature decreased four orders of magnitude. In contrast, in noveon varieties, calcium ions act as ionic cross-linkers of the carboxylic groups, providing rigid networks with much higher Tg, and storage and loss moduli. This explains that despite sorbing similar amounts of water to carbopol, the changes on the mechanical properties of noveon compacts were much less important (i.e., G′ and G″ decreased up to one order of magnitude). © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Owing to the extreme fragility of their tests (external part), little is known about them, and their diet is largely a matter of speculation. The extensive accumulation of fecal pellets (stercomes) within their tests attests to the degree to which xenophyophores feed on particulate matter. During the EUMELI 2 cruise, xenophyophores were recovered intact at the surface of box-cores from an abyssal mesotrophic site in the northeastern Atlantic. They were identified as Syringammina corbicula. In our study, we compare the lipid composition of xenophyophores collected at the top of cores with sediment from the same mesotrophic environment devoid of these protists. The distribution of lipid classes was obtained by the use of the Iatroscan (TLC-FID) technique, and the molecular composition of several lipid classes containing fatty acids and sterols was investigated. Of special interest are the triacylglycerols of xenophyophores, energy storage lipids in animals, resulting in part from fatty acids found in their diet. They contained a higher level of bacterial fatty acids than those in the reference sediment. It would seem that, in addition to particle trapping, xenophyophores also feed on microbes. Our study points to the occurrence of a specialized bacterial flora, probably growing on the stercomes, which might serve as a secondary food source different from the microflora found in the control sediment.","Atlantic; Deep-sea; Lipids; Northeastern tropical; Nutrition; Xenophyophores","deep sea; diet; fecal pellet; lipid; protist; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Corbicula; Protista; Syringammina corbicula; Syringammina corbicula; Xenophyophora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442419157

Procollagen type I C-terminal propeptide, procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP), carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were analysed in serum. Some GSD I and GSD III patients had low or very low BMD. There was no difference in total body BMD z-score between the GSD types after adjusting for height (p = 0.110). Bone marker analysis showed no consistent pattern. Urine fPYD: creatinine ratio was raised in four GSD I and two GSD III patients, while serum PINP was inappropriately low in some of these patients. There was no clear correlation between any markers of bone destruction and total body z-score, but the patient with the lowest total body z-score showed the highest concentrations of both urinary fPYD:creatinine and fDPD:creatinine ratios. We conclude that some GSD I and GSD III patients have very low bone mineral density. There is no correlation between mineral density and bone markers in GSD patients. The inappropriately low concentration of PINP in association with the raised urinary fPYD:creatinine and fDPD: creatinine ratios seen in two GSD I patients reflect uncoupling of bone turnover. All these findings taken together suggest that some GSD I and GSD III patients may be at an increased risk of osteoporosis. © SSIEM and Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"alkaline phosphatase bone isoenzyme; biological marker; carboxy terminal telopeptide; creatinine; deoxypyridinoline; peptide derivative; procollagen; pyridinoline; adult; amino terminal sequence; article; blood analysis; body height; bone density; bone destruction; bone mineral; bone turnover; carboxy terminal sequence; clinical article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; correlation function; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; glycogen storage disease; glycogen storage disease type 1; glycogen storage disease type 2; human; male; osteoporosis; randomization; risk assessment; scoring system; statistical analysis; urinalysis; Adult; Biological Markers; Bone Density; Bone Remodeling; Densitometry, X-Ray; Female; Glycogen Storage Disease; Glycogen Storage Disease Type I; Glycogen Storage Disease Type III; Humans; Male",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842433788

At the core of a chameleon's tongue is a cylindrical tongue skeleton surrounded by the accelerator muscle. Previously, the cylindrical accelerator muscle was assumed to power tongue projection directly during the actual fast projection of the tongue. However, high-speed recordings of Chamaeleo melleri and C. pardalis reveal that peak powers of 3000 W kg-1 are necessary to generate the observed accelerations, which exceed the accelerator muscle's capacity by at least five- to 10-fold. Extrinsic structures might power projection via the tongue skeleton. High-speed fluoroscopy suggests that they contribute less than 10% of the required peak instantaneous power. Thus, the projection power must be generated predominantly within the tongue, and an energy-storage-and-release mechanism must be at work. The key structure in the projection mechanism is probably a cylindrical connective-tissue layer, which surrounds the entoglossal process and was previously suggested to act as lubricating tissue. This tissue layer comprises at least 10 sheaths that envelop the entoglossal process. The outer portion connects anteriorly to the accelerator muscle and the inner portion to the retractor structures. The sheaths contain helical arrays of collagen fibres. Prior to projection, the sheaths are longitudinally loaded by the combined radial contraction and hydrostatic lengthening of the accelerator muscle, at an estimated mean power of 144 W kg-1 in C. melleri. Tongue projection is triggered as the accelerator muscle and the loaded portions of the sheaths start to slide over the tip of the entoglossal process. The springs relax radially while pushing off the rounded tip of the entoglossal process, making the elastic energy stored in the helical fibres available for a simultaneous forward acceleration of the tongue pad, accelerator muscle and retractor structures. The energy release continues as the multilayered spring slides over the tip of the smooth and lubricated entoglossal process. This sliding-spring theory predicts that the sheaths deliver most of the instantaneous power required for tongue projection. The release power of the sliding tubular springs exceeds the work rate of the accelerator muscle by at least a factor of 10 because the elastic-energy release occurs much faster than the loading process. Thus, we have identified a unique catapult mechanism that is very different from standard engineering designs. Our morphological and kinematic observations, as well as the available literature data, are consistent with the proposed mechanism of tongue projection, although experimental tests of the sheath strain and the lubrication of the entoglossal process are currently beyond our technical scope.","Catapult; Chameleon; Elastic energy; Power output; Projection mechanism; Tongue","biomechanics; lizard; physiology; prey capture; animal experiment; article; biomechanics; controlled study; elasticity; kinematics; lizard; nonhuman; priority journal; tongue; velocity; videorecording; Amphibia; Animalia; Chamaeleo melleri; Chamaeleo melleri; Chamaeleo pardalis; Chamaeleonidae; Oligacanthorhynchus; Reptilia; Squamata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842607544

The mathematical model is used to evaluate the annual variation of the solar fraction respect to the volume of the storage tank, demand hot water temperature required, difference of this temperature and preset storage tank water temperature, and consumption profile of the domestic hot water demand. The results for a number of designs with different storage tank volumes, show that the systems with greater volume yield higher solar fraction values. However, when a larger storage tank volume is used, the solar fraction is less sensitive to a variation of these operation parameters.

Pharmacologically it displays effects related to amphetamine-type drugs and a set of distinctive effects (closeness to others, facilitation to interpersonal relationship, and empathy) that have been named by some authors ""entactogen"" properties. MDMA is a potent releaser and/or reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). These actions result from the interaction of MDMA with the membrane transporters involved in neurotransmitter reuptake and vesicular storage systems. The most frequent effects after MDMA/ecstasy administration are euphoria, well-being, happiness, stimulation, increased energy, extroversion, feeling close to others, increased empathy, increased sociability, enhanced mood, mild perceptual disturbances, changed perception of colors and sounds, somatic symptoms related to its cardiovascular and autonomic effects (blood pressure and heart rate increase, mydriasis), and moderate derealization but not hallucinations. Acute toxic effects are related to its pharmacologic actions. The serotonin syndrome (increased muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, and hyperthermia), among others, is characteristic of acute toxicity episodes. MDMA metabolism is rather complex and includes 2 main metabolic pathways: (1) O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation; and (2) N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. The fact that the polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6 partially regulates the O-demethylenation pathway prompted some expectations that subjects displaying the poor metabolizer phenotype may be at higher risk of acute toxicity episodes. In this metabolic pathway a mechanism-based inhibition of the enzyme operates because the formation of an enzyme-metabolite complex that renders all subjects, independently of genotype, phenotypically poor metabolizers after the administration of 2 consecutive doses. Therefore, the impact of CYP2D6 pharmacogenetics on acute toxicity is limited. One of the interesting features of MDMA metabolism is its potential involvement in the development of mid- to long-term neurotoxic effects as a result of progressive neurodegeneration of the serotonergic neurotransmission system.","Ecstasy; MDMA; Metabolism; Pharmacokinetics; Toxicity","3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine; benzoic acid derivative; dopamine; glucuronide; noradrenalin; serotonin; sulfate; alkylation; anxiety disorder; appetite disorder; balance disorder; blood pressure; conference paper; confusion; deamination; delirium; demethylation; dizziness; drowsiness; drug disposition; drug metabolism; empathy; euphoria; extraversion; fatigue; hallucination; heart palpitation; heart rate; hot flush; human; insomnia; mood; mood disorder; muscle weakness; mydriasis; nerve degeneration; neurotransmission; neurotransmitter release; nystagmus; oxidation; panic; perception disorder; priority journal; psychosis; restlessness; serotonin syndrome; socialization; tremor; trismus; xerostomia; Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors; Drug Interactions; Humans; N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine; Overdose; Randomized Controlled Trials; Serotonin Agents; Tissue Distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143152622

The first set of experiments was performed with ""as receivedń commercial carbonate powders under liquid nitrogen conditions using a precooling procedure. A second set of experiments was performed under similar experimental conditions after a preliminary grinding (mechanical activation) of the carbonates. In addition, Na2CO3 *1H2O, NaHCO3 and KHCO3 powders were studied. It was found that sample pre-cooling allows distinction between hydrocarbonates and carbonate hydrates. Storage in air leads to formation of hydrocarbonates at the surface of Li2CO3 and Na2CO3. This phenomenon being more pronounced in the former. In contrast, K2CO3 forms a hydrate with one H2O molecule. Rb2CO3 and Cs2CO3 have hydrocarbonates as well as hydrates at the surface and this is more pronounced for Cs2CO3. Grinding of the carbonates results in the formation of hydrocarbonates at the surface, the tendency to do so was found to increase down the group IA, namely, K &lt; Rb ≪ Cs. For the most part, the hydrocarbonates formed were unstable in vacuum even under liquid nitrogen conditions.

A significant improvement in electrode performance was achieved. The resulting carbon contents in the sample 1 and sample 2 are 3.06% and 4.95% (mass fraction), respectively. It is believed that the synthesis of LiFePO4 with sugar added before heating is a good method because the synthesized particles having uniform small size are covered by carbon. The performance of the cathodes was evaluated using coin cells. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope observation. The addition of carbon limits the particles size growth and enables high electron conductivity. The LiFePO4/C composites show very good electrochemical performance delivering about 142 mAh/g specific capacity when being cycled at the C/10 rate.

Numerical simulations are carried out for a rotating flexible disk-spindle system supported by ball bearing and flexible shaft by the finite element method, and the vibrational energy transmission caused by an eccentric mass is analyzed by using structural intensity technique. The structural intensities in hybrid 1D, 2D and 3D elements, which are used to model different components of HDD, are obtained. Three different damping effects on the diversion and dissipation of energy flow are investigated. The calculated results show that different types of damping or dampers have different effect on energy flow path in HDD.

Estimates of the seasonal storage change vary between less than 50 mm water equivalent in areas with uniform climatic conditions to 450 mm water equivalent in tropical river basins with a strong seasonality of the climate. Due to the lack of adequate ground-based measurements of water storage changes, the evapotranspiration rate, which depends on the actual climatic and environmental conditions, is only an approximation for large areas until now, or it is based on the assumption that storage changes level out for long time periods. Furthermore, the partitioning of the water storage changes among different storage components is insufficiently known for large scales. The direct measurement of water storage changes for large areas by satellite-based gravity field measurements is thus of uttermost importance in the field of hydrology in order to close the water balance at different scales in space and time, and to validate and improve the predictive capacity of large-scale hydrological models. Due to the high spatial variability of hydrological processes temporal and spatial resolutions beyond that of GRACE are essential for a spatial differentiation in evapotranspiration and water storage partitioning. © Springer 2005.","Continental water balance; Large scale evapotranspiration; Large scale water storage; Satellite gravity missions; Sea level change; Ungauged catchments","gravity; hydrological response; temporal variation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30344466101

Furthermore, hydrogen is regenerative and environmentally friendly. There are two reasons why hydrogen is not the major fuel of today's energy consumption. First of all, hydrogen is just an energy carrier. And, although it is the most abundant element in the universe, it has to be produced, since on earth it only occurs in the form of water and hydrocarbons. This implies that we have to pay for the energy, which results in a difficult economic dilemma because ever since the industrial revolution we have become used to consuming energy for free. The second difficulty with hydrogen as an energy carrier is its low critical temperature of 33 K (i.e. hydrogen is a gas at ambient temperature). For mobile and in many cases also for stationary applications the volumetric and gravimetric density of hydrogen in a storage material is crucial. Hydrogen can be stored using six different methods and phenomena: (1) high-pressure gas cylinders (up to 800 bar), (2) liquid hydrogen in cryogenic tanks (at 21 K), (3) adsorbed hydrogen on materials with a large specific surface area (at T&lt;100 K), (4) absorbed on interstitial sites in a host metal (at ambient pressure and temperature), (5) chemically bonded in covalent and ionic compounds (at ambient pressure), or (6) through oxidation of reactive metals, e.g. Li, Na, Mg, Al, Zn with water. The most common storage systems are high-pressure gas cylinders with a maximum pressure of 20 MPa (200 bar). New lightweight composite cylinders have been developed which are able to withstand pressures up to 80 MPa (800 bar) and therefore the hydrogen gas can reach a volumetric density of 36 kg·m-3, approximately half as much as in its liquid state. Liquid hydrogen is stored in cryogenic tanks at 21.2 K and ambient pressure. Due to the low critical temperature of hydrogen (33 K), liquid hydrogen can only be stored in open systems. The volumetric density of liquid hydrogen is 70.8 kg·m-3, and large volumes, where the thermal losses are small, can cause hydrogen to reach a system mass ratio close to one. The highest volumetric densities of hydrogen are found in metal hydrides. Many metals and alloys are capable of reversibly absorbing large amounts of hydrogen. Charging can be done using molecular hydrogen gas or hydrogen atoms from an electrolyte. The group one, two and three light metals (e.g. Li, Mg, B, Al) can combine with hydrogen to form a large variety of metal-hydrogen complexes. These are especially interesting because of their light weight and because of the number of hydrogen atoms per metal atom, which is two in many cases. Hydrogen can also be stored indirectly in reactive metals such as Li, Na, Al or Zn. These metals easily react with water to the corresponding hydroxide and liberate the hydrogen from the water. Since water is the product of the combustion of hydrogen with either oxygen or air, it can be recycled in a closed loop and react with the metal. Finally, the metal hydroxides can be thermally reduced to metals in a solar furnace.

It is separated from the general circulation by the blood-brain barrier, has high energy consumption and a low energy storage capacity, uses only specific substrates, and it can record information from the peripheral organs and control them. Here we present a new paradigm for the regulation of energy supply within the organism. The brain gives priority to regulating its own adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration. In that postulate, the peripheral energy supply is only of secondary importance. The brain has two possibilities to ensure its energy supply: allocation or intake of nutrients. The term 'allocation' refers to the allocation of energy resources between the brain and the periphery. Neocortex and the limbic-hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (LHPA) system control the allocation and intake. In order to keep the energy concentrations constant, the following mechanisms are available to the brain: (1) high and low-affinity ATP-sensitive potassium channels measure the ATP concentration in neurons of the neocortex and generate a 'glutamate command' signal. This signal affects the brain ATP concentration by locally (via astrocytes) stimulating glucose uptake across the blood-brain barrier and by systemically (via the LHPA system) inhibiting glucose uptake into the muscular and adipose tissue. (2) High-affinity mineralocorticoid and low-affinity glucocorticoid receptors determine the state of balance, i.e. the setpoint, of the LHPA system. This setpoint can permanently and pathologically be displaced by extreme stress situations (chronic metabolic and psychological stress, traumatization, etc.), by starvation, exercise, infectious diseases, hormones, drugs, substances of abuse, or chemicals disrupting the endocrine system. Disorders in the 'energy on demand' process or the LHPA-system can influence the allocation of energy and in so doing alter the body mass of the organism. In summary, the presented model includes a newly discovered 'principle of balance' of how pairs of high and low-affinity receptors can originate setpoints in biological systems. In this 'Selfish Brain Theory', the neocortex and limbic system play a central role in the pathogenesis of diseases such as anorexia nervosa and obesity. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This puzzling finding has been subject to intense research for many years. Lately, it has gained renewed interest as a consequence of increased obesity and physical inactivity imposed by Western lifestyle. Why are humans so poor at metabolizing fat? Can fat metabolism be manipulated by exercise, training, diet and hormones? And why is fat stored in specialized adipose tissue and not just as lipid droplets inside muscle cells? In the present review, human fat metabolism is discussed in relation to how human fat metabolism is designed. Limitations in this design are explored and examples of different designs for fat metabolism from animal physiology are included to illustrate these limitations. Various means of manipulating fat metabolism are discussed with special emphasis on exercise, training, growth hormone (GH) physiology and GH administration. It is concluded that fat stores, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) availability and enzymes for fat oxidation can be increased substantially. However, it is almost impossible to increase fat oxidation during endurance exercise at higher intensities. It seems that, for some reason, the human being is far from optimally designed for fat oxidation during exercise. Acute GH administration has several unexpected effects on fat and carbohydrate metabolism during aerobic exercise, and future research in this area is likely to provide valuable information with respect to GH physiology and the regulation of fat and carbohydrate metabolism during aerobic exercise.","Comparative physiology; Exercise; Growth hormone; Lipolysis; Metabolism; Training","enzyme; fat; fatty acid; growth hormone; lipoprotein; oxygen; adipocyte; adipose tissue; adipose tissue blood flow; aerobic metabolism; bioavailability; bird; body composition; body weight; carbohydrate metabolism; chemical bond; diet; drug effect; drug mechanism; endurance; energy; energy expenditure; energy resource; exercise; experiment; fish; growth hormone release; human; hydration; in vitro study; in vivo culture; infusion; lifestyle; lipid metabolism; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipid transport; lipolysis; liver preservation; locust; measurement; metabolic rate; migration; mitochondrion; mobilization; muscle cell; nonhuman; obesity; oxygen consumption; physical activity; regulatory mechanism; review; sitting; species comparison; sport; training; transport kinetics; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Exercise; Growth Hormone; Humans; Lipolysis; Muscle Cells; Oxygen Consumption; Triglycerides",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342631850

In order to model the Mullins effect we introduce a damage variable depending on the maximum deformation reached in the process history. To model the Payne effect we introduce an intrinsic time variable which is a functional of deformation history, specify an evolution law driven by a fractional time rate of deformation and calculate analytical formulae for the storage and loss moduli. Finally, it isshown that both the frequency and amplitude dependence are well represented.","Constitutive modelling; Elastomer; Mullins effect; Payne effect; Viscoelasticity","Constitutive modelling; Mullins effect; Multiplicative splitting; Payne effect; Chemical bonds; Continuum mechanics; Deformation; Free energy; Mathematical models; Plastics fillers; Thermal effects; Viscoelasticity; Rubber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142815045

The red lipophilic pigment(s) extractable from Parma ham was(were) found to be very stable towards thermal degradation in acetone/water (75/25v/v %) solution for temperatures up to 70°C in contrast to the lipophilic pigment(s) extractable from dry-cured ham produced with nitrite salt, which was(were) found to have an energy of activation of 99 kJ/mol for thermal degradation. In contrast, quantum yields for photodegradation of the lipophilic ham pigments exposed to 366 nm (420 nm) monochromatic light were larger for Parma ham than for nitrite-cured ham [1.6×10-5 (6.9×10-6) versus 1.6×10-6 (2×10 -6) mol einstein-1] as determined for acetone/water (75/25v/v %) solution.

In addition, with the aid of power electronics devices, it is possible to independently exchange active and reactive power with the utility grid. This allows to perform a more effective primary frequency control and also to reduce the reserve power of generators. In this article, a model is presented of a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) with Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) used for controlling the primary frequency of the utility system.

This article presents a synthesis of the potential resources offered by the urban underground and some experiences derived from different cities around the world. Analysis of these experiences shows that these resources have often been developed without any real long-term planning. This synthesis proposes a more complete approach to underground resource management, insisting on the compatibilities or incompatibilities of a parallel exploitation of certain resources due to their interactions (e.g. geothermics - groundwater). Since the impact of most underground work goes far beyond the space occupied, it must be conceived on the city scale. To attain this objective, the authors propose the notion of three-dimensional land planning for urban territory. This new concept goes much farther than the GIS applications used for the ""cadastre"" in the first metres of underground. A new way of conceiving underground management for the long-term development of the city is recommended. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the pattern of some indicators of somatic and reproductive investment, such as gonadosomatic index (GSI) and liversomatic index (LSI), was investigated, as well as the relationship between lipid content and fish body size was studied over time in both sexes. Results showed that the amount of somatic lipids depends largely on the different levels of reproductive investment shown by the breeding individuals. Females had the lowest levels of somatic lipids at the beginning of the breeding season when large males reached, by contrast, the highest levels. Large males showed a strong decrease in their reserves as the breeding season proceeded, and their replenishment was significantly slower than that of smaller males, which had relatively high levels already in September. Analysis of the trends of GSI and LSI revealed that the difference between females and males in the primary reproductive investment (gonadic mass) can explain most of the differences in the levels of somatic energy storage. The relationship between body size and lipid content changed over time, being positive and statistically significant at the beginning of the breeding season for each reproductive group, indicating that during these phases all the breeding individuals had accumulated energy in their tissues and that the breeding season reduced their somatic energy storage although with different intensity.",,"bioenergetics; fish; growth; reproductive effort; Callogobius atratus; Channa; Vertebrata; Zosterisessor ophiocephalus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942469945

Paradoxically, many long-term field observations show that although plant litter is incorporated to soil in large quantities, soil C content does not necessarily increase. These results suggest that a negative relationship between C input and soil C conservation exists. Here, we demonstrate in controlled conditions that the supply of fresh C may accelerate the decomposition of soil C and induce a negative C balance. We show that soil C losses increase when soil microbes are nutrient limited. Results highlight the need for a better understanding of microbial mechanisms involved in the complex relationship between C input and soil C sequestration. We conclude that energy available to soil microbes and microbial competition are important determinants of soil C decomposition.","Carbon cycling; Carbon storage; Carbon:nitrogen coupling; Energy limitation; Microbial competition; Nutrient impact; Priming effect; Soil ecosystem functioning","carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; decomposition; ecosystem function; microbial activity; soil carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842844383

The FV formulation ensures that both schemes conserve mass and momentum and produce physically realizable shock fronts. The exact solution of the Riemann problem provides the fluxes at the cell interfaces. It is through the exact Riemann solution that the physics of water hammer waves is incorporated into the proposed schemes. The implementation of boundary conditions, such as valves, pipe junctions, and reservoirs, within the Godunov approach is similar to that of the method of characteristics (MOC) approach. The schemes are applied to a system consisting of a reservoir, a pipe, and a valve and to a system consisting of a reservoir, two pipes in series, and a valve. The computations are carried out for various Courant numbers and the energy norm is used to evaluate the numerical accuracy of the schemes. Numerical tests and theoretical analysis show that the first-order Godunov scheme is identical to the MOC scheme with space-line interpolation. It is also found that, for a given level of accuracy and using the same computer, the second-order scheme requires much less memory storage and execution time than either the first-order scheme or the MOC scheme with space-line interpolation. Overall, the second-order Godunov scheme is simple to implement, accurate, efficient, conservative, and stable for Courant number less than or equal to one. © ASCE.","Computation; Pipe flow; Water hammers","Finite volume method; Hammers; Interpolation; Physics; Pipe; Valves (mechanical); Water; Waves; Courant numbers; Riemann problem; Hydraulic machinery; boundary conditions; computer application; finite volume technique; fluid flow; pipe flow; water hammer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842690048

This system shows significantly higher distilled water output compared with that of an uncoupled still, and moreover has the advantage of supplying hot water from its storage tank. Through experimental data taken from system operation in the laboratory, the suitability of the developed ""input-output"" method, was proven for reliable description of the system operation. It was shown that the model previously developed is capable of estimating long-term distilled water production with deviation not higher than 3% for any considered period. Following this, a theoretical investigation of hybrid operation of the system is performed concerning reduction of produced distilled water caused by storage tank hot water draw-off of different volumes at the end of the day. The results show that draw-off of hot water volume equal to 1/4, 1/2 or 1 tank volume reduces distilled water output by 36%, 57% or 75%, respectively, by simultaneous energy output of about 1900, 3300 and 5200 MJ.

Three different types of excimer laser mixtures (KrF, ArF and XeCl) have been investigated in this study. The fluence levels of the lasers ranged from 0.3 to 5J/cm2. This work is not a comparative study of the three named mixtures but instead presents a review of the critical property enhancements provided by these treatments (e.g. lap shear strength, contact angle and reduction in the amount of wicking by water). The dry, fresh bond strength of this system does correlate well with the predictions provided by the theoretical ""work of adhesion"" calculations. The issue of wet performance of the adhesive bond is addressed and mechanical testing does reveal that a durable bond can only be provided if an epoxy primer is applied after pretreating the titanium. Contact angles measured after surface treatment were shown to be significantly less than that for the untreated surfaces but were also shown to increase with prolonged storage of the treated sample under ambient conditions. Therefore, emphasising the importance of bonding or primer application within the immediate hours after the surface treatment.

Hypoalbuminemia, which occurs in this population and always has been associated with malnutrition, seems to be a consequence of this inflammatory state. Data focusing on patients before dialysis treatment are lacking. Design Cross-sectional observational study. Setting Outpatients from the Nephrology Division of the University Hospital. Patients We investigated nutritional status and serum CRP in 27 patients (13 women) with advanced CRF on the occasion of their first visit. Methods Nutritional status was evaluated by anthropometric and serum measurements. Energy and protein intake were evaluated using a 24-hour recall questionnaire. Results Data are reported as mean ± SD. Glomerular filtration rate was 18 ± 5 mL/min. Anthropometric measurements showed normal body mass index in 75% of the patients, whereas the remaining patients were overweight; fat store was depleted in 60% of the patients. Serum albumin was 4.4 ± 0.5 mg/dL and CRP was 0.47 ± 0.63 mg/dL. Protein ingestion was 1.04 ± 0.24 g/kg/d, and energy intake was 23.57 ± 7.8 kcal/kg/d. Conclusion Patients with advanced CRF without specific treatment, evaluated for the first time, showed fat store depletion. This alteration was not associated with inflammation or with visceral protein loss, but with low energy intake. These results support the idea that this population should be followed up by specialists from the early stage of CRF to prevent malnutrition. © 2004 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.",,"C reactive protein; serum albumin; adult; aged; anthropometry; article; body mass; caloric intake; chronic kidney failure; clinical article; female; glomerulus filtration rate; hemodialysis; human; hypoalbuminemia; lipid storage; male; malnutrition; nephrology; nutritional status; obesity; outpatient; protein blood level; protein intake; questionnaire; university hospital; Adult; Aged; Anthropometry; C-Reactive Protein; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Inflammation; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Malnutrition; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Questionnaires; Serum Albumin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642421007

The momentum interpolation scheme with under-relaxation parameter is used to simplify the calculation algorithm and save the storage space of computer. The mushy region is introduced to provide a simple method to dispose of the pressure and velocity boundary conditions.

Obesity has many serious sequelae, the most common of which is type-2-diabetes. The benefits of weight loss on health are established but the major impediment to weight loss treatments is maintenance of weight lost over the long term. The reduced- or post-obese individual undergoes physiological changes that are geared towards energy storage and weight regain. One of the physiological changes is a reduced capacity to oxidise fatty acids pushing them through pathways of triacylglycerol synthesis. In this review, some of the past drug treatments aimed at increasing energy expenditure, such as dinitrophenol and ephedrine, are discussed. Current, or nearly current therapies such as sibutramine and rimonabant are also discussed in the context of increased energy expenditure.

Additives, namely Al 2O3, SiC, V and graphite are chosen so as to cover a wide hardness range. Structural refinement after milling is studied both metallographically and in terms of X-ray line broadening. It is found that for efficient structural refinement, the additives should be chosen not on the basis of their hardness but rather whether or not they are preserved with an acceptable size during milling. Thus, of the additives, it is found that graphite and Al2O3 are most effective. The milled structures are modified upon exposure to hydrogenation temperature, leading to similar structural sizes. In terms of hydrogenation, graphite appears to be the most effective additive.

At the same time the working pressure of direct steam generator prototypes is increasing. The scaling-up of these devices will make very interesting the production of nuclear or renewable hydrogen (and oxygen) and its use in advanced steam power-plants fed with stoichiometric hydrogen/oxygen mixtures. This is a long-term view, but it is possible to find an interesting application even in the near term. It is the nightly and seasonal storage of energy by means of hydrogen and its use in attached steam power-plants. In this case the thermal energy required at low temperature can be supplied by regeneration and coal, while the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen is employed only in the steam super-heating phases. It results in high steam temperatures, increased specific work and improved thermodynamic efficiency. Moreover the availability of the reactants directly at high pressure, allows to save energy usually needed for storage and to avoid the installation of large compression units. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

A total of eight different fuel chains is exergetically analysed. Exergy analysis is shown to have considerable additional value compared to conventional energetic well-to-wheels analyses based on the lower or higher heating value of fuels under consideration. Exergy can be used for both fuel and non-fuel resources and can play an important role in the quantification of resource depletion in fuel chains. With exergy analysis, it is possible to determine thermodynamic limits of processes and to locate and interpret process losses. Exergy analysis is therefore a useful tool in process improvement and process comparison. Furthermore, exergy can play a role in the quantification of the effort it would take to abate or recycle waste streams. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Postdam, Arthur-Scheunert Allee 114-116, 14558 Bergholz-Rehbrücke, Germany","Adipose tissue plays an active role in energy balance because it is not only a lipid storing and mobilizing tissue but consists of functionally specialized tissues able to produce heat (in brown adipose tissue) and to produce or release a vast number of so called adipokines or adipocytokines. These consist of polypeptides but also non-protein factors and are metabolically active molecules belonging to different functional categories like immunity (complement factors, haptoglobin), endocrine function (leptin, sex steroids, various growth factors), metabolic function (fatty acids, adiponectin, resistin), and cardiovascular function (angiotensinogen, PAI-1). Recent advances using genomic and proteomic approaches have identified numerous new adipocyte secreted factors whose function remain to be established. Too little as well as too much adipose tissue leads to metabolic disturbances like insulin resistance. Visceral obesity is especially strongly correlated with the development of diabetes, hypertension and cardio-vascular disease. Thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue is a means to dissipate excess energy, but in adult humans brown fat is very scarce and probably not functional. However, human white adipose tissue contains mesenchymal stem cells, and if these could be stimulated to differentiate into brown adipocytes, increased energy expenditure in white fat could help to shift energy balance towards a more negative state. © 2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Adipocytokines; Brown fat; Energy expenditure; Obesity; Thermogenesis; Visceral fat","acute phase protein; acylation stimulating protein; adipocytokine; adiponectin; angiotensin; beta 3 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; cathepsin; collagen; cytokine; entactin; fatty acid; fibronectin; glucocorticoid; growth factor; haptoglobin; interleukin 6; leptin; matrix metalloproteinase; osteonectin; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; polypeptide; resistin; sex hormone; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; adipocyte; adipose tissue; brown adipose tissue; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular function; cell differentiation; complement factor; cytokine production; diabetes mellitus; drug mechanism; endocrine function; energy balance; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; genomics; human; hypertension; insulin resistance; lipid storage; mesenchyme cell; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; obesity; protein function; protein secretion; proteomics; review; stem cell; thermogenesis; white adipose tissue; Adipose Tissue; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Obesity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347965985

It allows simulating the behaviour of electric, hybrid, fuel cell and internal combustion vehicles while driving any reference cycle [Simulation software for comparison and design of electric, hybrid electric and internal combustion vehicles with respect to energy, emissions and performances, Ph.D. Thesis, Department Electrical Engineering, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium, April 2000]. The goal of the simulation programme is to study power flows in vehicle drive trains and the corresponding component losses, as well as to compare different drive train topologies. This comparison can be realised for energy consumption and emissions as well as for performances (acceleration, range, maximum slope, etc.). The software package and its validation are described in [J. Automot. Eng., SAE IEE 215 (9) (2001) 1043L]. Different hybrid and electric drive trains are implemented in the software [Views on hybrid drive train power management strategies, in: Proceedings of the EVS-17, Montreal, Canada, October 2000]. The models used for the energy sources like fuel cells, batteries, ultracapacitors, flywheels and engine-generator units will be discussed in this paper in three stages: first their functionality and characteristics are described, next the way these characteristics can be implemented in a simulation model will be explained and finally some calculation results will illustrate the approach. This paper is aimed to give an overview of simulation models of energy sources for battery, hybrid and fuel cell electric vehicles. Innovative is the extreme modularity and exchangeability of different components functioning as energy sources. The unique iteration algorithm of the simulation programme allows to accurately simulate drive train maximum performances as well as all kind of power management strategies in different types of hybrid drive trains [IEEE Trans.

The external heat collection unit consisted of 27 m2 of south-facing solar air collectors mounted at a 55o tilt angle. The dimensions of the packed-bed heat storage unit were 6 × 2 × 0.6 m deep. The packedbed heat storage unit was built under the soil. The heat storage unit was filled with 6480kg of volcanic material. Energy and exergy analyses were applied in order to evaluate the system efficiency. During the charging periods, the average daily rates of thermal energy and exergy stored in the heat storage unit were 1242 and 36.33 W, respectively. Since the rate of exergy depends on the temperature of the heat transfer fluid and surrounding, the rate of exergy increased as the difference between the inlet and outlet temperatures of the heat transfer fluid increased during the charging periods. It was found that the average daily net energy and exergy efficiencies in the charging periods were 39.7 and 2.03%, respectively. The average daily net energy efficiency of the heat storage system remained nearly constant during the charging periods.

Being stored in proximity to the site of contraction and able to sustain high rates of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) phosphorylation, glycogen is viewed as the primary fuel for the maintenance of exercise of a moderate to intense nature. As such, to ensure optimal exercise performance, endurance athletes are encouraged to maximise the availability of muscle glycogen through the ingestion of a high carbohydrate (CHO) diet prior to competition. The skeletal muscle cell also contains significant quantities of triglyceride. Recent improvements in the ability to measure these intramyocellular triglyceride (IMTG) stores have confirmed that IMTG acts as a significant fuel substrate during prolonged exercise. While early research of the role of muscle glycogen in endurance exercise provided clear prescriptive information for the endurance-trained athlete, no such direction for optimising exercise performance is yet apparent from research concerning IMTG. In this article, we review the processes of muscle glycogen and triglyceride storage and metabolism. Attention is given to the effects of short-term alterations in diet on muscle substrate, particularly IMTG storage, and the implications of this to endurance exercise performance and competition preparation. We demonstrate that like glycogen, IMTG formation may be relatively rapid, and its storage predominates under conditions that promote minimal glycogen formation. This observation suggests that the role of IMTG is to maintain a readily available substrate to ensure that physical activity of a moderate nature can be performed when glycogen availability is not optimal. Under these conditions, IMTG may offer a similar availability of energy as glycogen in the endurance-trained athlete. Given the potential value of this substrate, the possibility of maximising IMTG storage without compromising glycogen availability prior to competition is considered.",,"glycogen; triacylglycerol; athlete; body fat; carbohydrate diet; cell level; endurance; exercise; glycogen metabolism; glycogen muscle level; human; intramyocellular triglyceride; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; muscle level; nonhuman; performance; review; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Glycogen; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal; Physical Endurance; Sports; Task Performance and Analysis; Triglycerides",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542721931

Model simulations suggest the most significant impact of these emission changes would occur in the troposphere, affecting OH. This impact is dependent upon the magnitude and nature of trade-offs in changing fossil fuel use. In the stratosphere, changes in water vapour resulting from expected increases in surface molecular hydrogen emissions via leaks occurring during production, transport and storage, are found to be significantly smaller than previous estimates. We conclude that the expected increase in molecular hydrogen emissions is unlikely to have a substantial impact on stratospheric ozone, certainly much smaller than the ozone changes observed in the last two decades.

We investigated the thermal gelation of cellulose solutions with rheometry and the structure of the gel with 13C NMR, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, environmental scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The cellulose solutions revealed an increase in both the storage modulus (G′) and the loss modulus (G″) with an increase in the temperature during gelation. The temperature at the turning point, where G′ overrides G″ because of the onset of gelation, decreased from 38.6 to 20.1°C with an increase of cellulose concentration from 4 to 6 wt %. Given enough time, G′ of all solutions can exceed G″ at a certain temperature slightly lower than the gelation temperature, indicating that the occurrence of the gelation is also a function of time. Each of the assigned peaks of NMR of the cellulose gel is similar to that of the cellulose solution, suggesting that the gelation resulted from a physical cross-linking. The gels were composed of relatively stable network units with an average diameter of about 47 nm. At either a higher temperature (at 60°C for 30 s) or a longer gelation time (at 30°C for 157 s), the gel in the 5 wt % cellulose solution could form.

In Plasmodium, however, this established function of TAG appears unlikely, despite detecting previously considerable amount of TAG associated with intraerythrocytic parasites, because plasmodial cells have very little capacity to oxidize fatty acids. Thus, it is plausible that TAG and its biosynthesis in Plasmodium have other functions. As a first step in understanding the biological significance of TAG and its biosynthesis to the intraerythrocytic proliferation of Plasmodium falciparum, we performed detailed characterization of TAG metabolism and trafficking in parasitized erythrocyte. Metabolic labeling using radiolabeled-oleic and palmitic acids in association with serum albumin, which have been shown to be among the serum essential factors for intraerythrocytic proliferation of P. falciparum, revealed that accumulation of TAG was strikingly pronounced from trophozoite to schizont, whereas TAG degradation became active from schizont to segmented schizont; the consequent products, free fatty acids, were released into the medium during schizont rupture and/or merozoite release. These results were further supported by visualization of lipid bodies through immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. At the schizont stages, there is some evidence that the lipid bodies are partly localized in the parasitophorous vacuole. Interestingly, the discrete formation and/or trafficking of lipid bodies are inhibited by brefeldin A and trifluoperazine. Inhibition by trifluoperazine hints at least that a de novo TAG biosynthetic pathway via phosphatidic acid contributes to lipid body formation. Indeed, biochemical analysis reveals a higher activity of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, the principal enzyme in the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate pathway for TAG synthesis, at trophozoite and schizont stages. Together, these results establish that TAG metabolism and trafficking in P. falciparum-infected erythrocyte occurs in a stage-specific manner during the intraerythrocytic cycle and we propose that these unique and dynamic cellular events participate during schizont rupture and/or merozoite release.","Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; Brefeldin A; Fatty acid; Malaria; Neutral lipid; Nile Red","acetyl coenzyme A acyltransferase; brefeldin A; diacylglycerol acyltransferase; fatty acid; glycerophosphate; lipid; oleic acid; palmitic acid; phosphatidic acid; serum albumin; triacylglycerol; trifluoperazine; article; cell secretion; cell vacuole; cellular distribution; controlled study; culture medium; developmental stage; electron microscopy; enzyme activity; erythrocyte; human; human cell; immunofluorescence microscopy; isotope labeling; lipid degradation; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipid transport; lipogenesis; merozoite; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; parasitosis; Plasmodium falciparum; priority journal; schizont; serum factor; trophozoite; Animals; Azo Compounds; Biological Transport; Boron Compounds; Brefeldin A; Cells, Cultured; Coloring Agents; Erythrocytes; Fluorescent Dyes; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Oxazines; Plasmodium falciparum; Trifluoperazine; Triglycerides; Eukaryota; Plasmodium falciparum; Protozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342446230

It adopts a pair of cameras at different positions and acquires simultaneously two images of an object to derive information on depth. The problem of correspondence between images is one of most important issues in the study of CSVS. The key concern of this problem is to determine which feature in one image corresponds to a given feature in the other image. Owing to the high complexity of the correspondence problem, the matching process usually suffers from slow computation time and imprecise results. The present paper proposes a scanline-based stereo-matching model. The objective function of the proposed model is a function with the means and variance of intensity, gradient magnitude and direction, and related constraints including uniqueness, geometry and epipolar constraints. The formulated energy function is then solved using genetic algorithms. Binary representation is used to match the relationship between the candidate features of both images. Two operators, the roulette selection operator and elite principle, are adopted for offspring selection. A modified position-based crossover operator and its repair mechanism are developed to exchange partially the chromosomes. In addition, an order-based mutation is used to prevent early convergence. Experiments show that the designed selection, crossover and mutation operators can effectively derive the matching relations line by line for real-world testing images. The proposed method was also compared with another method and was superior in computation speed and required less demand of the memory.",,"Cameras; Computational complexity; Computer vision; Convergence of numerical methods; Coordinate measuring machines; Data storage equipment; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Image analysis; Mathematical operators; Epipolar constraints; Flexible vision systems; Scanline-based stereo-matching model; Stereo vision",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242265226

Lithium-manganese oxides (LiMn2O4) with spinel structure and lithium-nickel-cobalt mixed oxides (LiNiCoO2) with layered structures have been extensively studied in the last few years for usage in high energy and high power batteries in order to replace lithium-cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) as cathode material in terms of cost, abundance and performance. In this paper, we summarize some basic mechanisms responsible for capacity fading under cycling and different storage conditions for both types of cathode materials. Lithium-nickel-cobalt mixed oxides show excellent storage stability in the discharged state and low metal solubility in the electrolyte. The cycling stability is mainly influenced by structural changes in the delithiated state and thermal instability arises from oxygen release at elevated temperatures in the charged state. Small amounts of aluminum and magnesium dopants stabilize the layered structure and increase cycling stability of lithium-nickel-cobalt oxide. Different mechanisms of capacity fading especially at higher temperatures are discussed for lithium-manganese oxide spinels. Capacity fading is highly dependent on cycling and storage conditions and caused by structural changes as well as by side reactions with electrolyte catalyzed by decomposition products of LiPF6 conducting salt and H2O impurities in the electrolyte. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Robinson) is an under-exploited native root crop of the Andes, which stores oligofructans (fructo-oligosaccharides, FOS) as its main component of dry matter (DM). FOS are of increasing economic interest because of their low caloric value in human diets and bifidogenic benefits on colon health. Two on-farm experiments were conducted to: (i) determine the effect of shaded, short-term storage at 1990 and 2930m a.s.l. in the Andean highlands; and (ii) address the effects of a traditional sunlight exposure ('sunning') on the carbohydrate composition in the DM of tuberous yacon roots. After a 6-day shade storage FOS concentrations were smaller at the lower (36-48% of DM) than at the higher altitude (39-58% of DM). After 12 days FOS concentrations were nearly equal at both sites (27-39% of DM). The concentration of free sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose) increased accordingly from 29-34 to 48-52%. During the 6-day sunning experiment FOS concentrations decreased from 50-62 to 29-44% and free sugars increased from 29-34 to 45-51%. The results indicate that partial hydrolysis of oligofructans starts shortly after harvest. Storage in highland environments should wherever possible exploit the cooler temperatures at higher altitudes.

The slower jump process responsible for the long-range H diffusion is satisfactorily described by the Arrhenius law with the activation energy of 0.22 eV. In the studied range of low H concentrations, the localized hydrogen motion (associated with the faster jump process) is found to be extremely rapid, giving rise to the proton spin-lattice relaxation rate peaks at T ≤ 50 K.

Phase-solubility studies showed that the carrier solubilizing power was in the order PEG&gt;PVP&gt;urea and evidenced a synergistic effect in drug solubility improvement when using carrier combinations. Binary and ternary systems, at 20/80 or 20/40/40 (w/w) drug/carrier(s) ratios, prepared by coevaporation of their ethanolic solutions or by cogrinding physical mixtures in a high-energy vibrational micromill, were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), hot stage microscopy (HSM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. The results of dissolution tests (USP paddle method), in terms of Dissolution Efficiency, indicated that ternary systems were up to 35% more effective than the corresponding binary preparations and coevaporated products were up to 45% more efficacious than the corresponding coground ones. The IBUX-PEG-PVP coevaporated was the best product, allowing a more than three-times increase in Dissolution Efficiency with respect to drug alone; moreover, t50% (&gt;60 min for pure ibuproxam) was &lt; 10 min, and 90% dissolution was achieved after 30 min, whereas only 40% was obtained after 60 min for pure drug. The best performance of this system was attributed to a joined effect of the strong amorphizing power of PVP (as demonstrated by solid state analyses) with the high solubilizing efficacy of PEG (as emerged from phase-solubility studies). The drug dissolution rate from solid dispersions remained practically unchanged after one-year storage at room temperature in closed containers.","Coevaporation; Cogrinding; Dissolution; Hydrophilic carriers; Ibuproxam; Ternary solid dispersions","alcohol; antiinflammatory agent; drug carrier; ibuproxam; macrogol; povidone; urea; article; differential scanning calorimetry; dispersion; drug mixture; drug potentiation; drug solubility; drug stability; drug storage; evaporation; grinding; hydrophilicity; microscopy; scanning electron microscopy; solid state; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Benzeneacetamides; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Drug Carriers; Hydroxamic Acids; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Powders; Solubility; X-Ray Diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242321019

Municipal water recycling provides a means to achieve these objectives by providing an alternative source of water as well as reducing sewage effluent discharges. This paper identifies the key factors impeding the rate of growth of water recycling in Australia. Such knowledge will be crucial to our effective allocation of efforts and resources required for a rapid and sustainable change in the way we manage our water. While Australia currently recycles around 11 per cent of effluents from sewage treatment plants, there is substantial scope for increase. The key impediments are identified as: • Lack of financial or economic incentive. • Concerns regarding the effective destruction of pathogenic micro-organisms. • Concerns regarding the presence of some inorganic and organic chemical contaminants. • Costs, limitations and a lack of knowledge regarding the effectiveness of advanced water recycling technologies. • Complications and costs associated with water transport and distributions systems. • The need to ensure community acceptance. • Energy demand and associated greenhouse gas emissions. • Issues with storage systems for large volumes of recycled water. • Availability of suitable reuse applications. • Issues regarding national guidelines and standards. Each of these issues will be addressed in a contemporary Australian context. Many of the identified constraints are of a practical nature and will require engineering-type solutions.

An effective means of achieving this is promoted through a multidisciplined, integrated approach to research and management of the total water cycle.

In current telecommunication electronics both portable and larger scale thermal transients that occur due to temporarily varying power dissipation are customary. The use of PCM heat storage to compensate for temperature peaks that may occur offer significant savings in time-dependent thermal management in the aforementioned products. The aim of this paper was to obtain physical validation of the numerical results produced using FEMLAB. This validation was obtained through a comparison of experimental data and numerical results. The numerical methods studied were an enthalpy method and an effective heat capacity method. An ensemble of experimental PCM storages, with and without heat transfer enhancement structures, was designed and constructed. The numerical predictions calculated with FEMLAB simulation software were compared to experimental data. Both numerical methods gave good estimations for the temperature distribution of the storages in both the melting and freezing processes. However, the effective heat capacity method, which used a narrower temperature range, dT=2 °C, was the most precise numerical method when the numerical results were compared to the experimental results. © 2003 Elsevier SAS.

Several thousands of kilometers of pipeline are networked in India for transportation of refinery products and crude to feed hundreds of refined oil reservoirs and crude storage tanks. Large-scale pumping operations are undertaken for the purpose. The Bottom Sediment Waste (BSW) from such reservoirs and crude storage tanks and pipelines have serious and much publicized catastrophic probability. Moreover, storage tanks are the most significant sources of hydrocarbon emissions. Vapors are emitted when storage tanks breathe. Leakages from valves and flanges of the pipelines are monitored and kept under check through regular maintenance. Therefore, proactive approach rather than focusing on treatment and cleanup (which would add to the refining cost) has been taken up by the refining industry in the form of implementation of EMS ISO 14001. In order to implement a workable EMS, the first fundamental step is to conduct a gap analysis in the form of Initial Environmental Review to establish the present status of environmental management vis-a-vis requirement for ISO certification. This paper evolves a mode/methodology of quantification of qualitative environmental parameters/elements to arrive at most significant environmental aspects and impacts during pipeline transportation of crude oil.","Disaster management plan oil water separator; Environmental aspects; Environmental impacts; Environmental labeling; Environmental management program; Life cycle analysis","Disaster management plan oil water separator; Environmental aspects; Environmental impacts; Environmental labeling; Environmental management program; Crude petroleum; Hydrocarbon refining; Leakage (fluid); Oil tanks; Petroleum reservoirs; Pipelines; Sediment transport; Pollution control",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30444440048

The sandwich configuration is composed of a viscoelastic core (based on Timoshenko theory) sandwiched between elastic faces (based on Euler-Bernoulli assumptions). The viscoelastic model used to describe the behavior of the core is a four-parameter fractional derivative model. Concerning the parameter identification, a strategy to estimate the fractional order of the time derivative and the relaxation time is outlined. Curve-fitting aspects are focused, showing a good agree-ment with experimental data. In order to implement the viscoelastic model into the finite element formulation, the Grünwald definition of the fractional operator is employed. To solve the equation of motion, a direct time integration method based on the implicit Newmark scheme is used. One of the particularities of the proposed algorithm lies in the storage of displacement history only, reducing considerably the numerical efforts related to the non-locality of fractional operators. After validations, numerical applications are presented in order to analyze truncation effects (fading memory phenomena) and solution convergence aspects.","Finite element method; Fractional derivatives; Sandwich beam; Transient dynamic analysis; Viscoelastic damping","Convergence of numerical methods; Damping; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Energy conservation; Equations of motion; Finite element method; Mathematical models; Mathematical operators; Poisson ratio; Vibrations (mechanical); Viscoelasticity; Fractional derivatives; Sandwich beams; Transient dynamic analysis; Viscoelastic damping; Sandwich structures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042783031

Intake of diacylglycerol, which comprises up to 10% of glycerides in plant-derived edible fats and oils and contains 70% of the unusual 1,3-species, has been shown to affect lipid and glucose metabolism. Effects include lowering of plasma triacylglycerol, decreasing postprandial hyperlipidemia and hemoglobin A1c, increasing energy expenditure, and reducing diet-induced obesity compared with triacylglycerol, which has a similar fatty acid composition. This review summarizes recent research into the metabolic effects and possible mechanisms of diacylglycerol outcome. Recent findings: Reacylation to triacylglycerol in small intestinal cells was found to be slower with diacylglycerol feeding than triacylglycerol feeding. Expression of mRNA of β-oxidative and uncoupling proteins 2 was also increased in liver and/or intestinal cells on feeding diacylglycerol compared with triacylglycerol. Because the energy value and absorptive and digestive properties are similar, the different effects of diacylglycerol compared with triacylglycerol are due to their structural differences. Summary: The stimulation of enzyme activities responsible for β-oxidation and regulation of lipid metabolism-related gene expression in the small intestine may contribute to reduced postprandial hyperlipidemia as well as to increased energy expenditure, which result in suppression of diet-induced obesity. Further analysis is required to elucidate the chemical and biological properties of diacylglycerol, especially of 1,3-diacylglycerol, on digestion, absorption and metabolic processes that may provide new insights for managing a lifestyle-related chronic disease such as the metabolic syndrome. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Diacylglycerol; Fatty acid; Postprandial hyperlipidemia; Weight reduction","cell nucleus receptor; diacylglycerol; diacylglycerol; absorption; body fat; chemical analysis; digestion; energy expenditure; enzyme activity; fatty acid oxidation; gene expression; human; hyperlipidemia; lipid composition; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; metabolic syndrome X; nonhuman; nutrition; obesity; outcomes research; postprandial state; protein expression; review; small intestine; animal; energy metabolism; enzymology; gene expression regulation; lipid metabolism; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; physiology; Animals; Diglycerides; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Humans; Intestine, Small; Lipid Metabolism; Nutrition Physiology; Oxidation-Reduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042540864

In this paper, we suggest hardware-assisted data compression as a tool for reducing energy consumption of processor-based systems. We propose a novel and efficient architecture for on-the-fly data compression and decompression whose field of operation is the cache-to-memory path. Uncompressed cache lines are compressed before they are written back to main memory, and decompressed when cache refills take place. We explore two classes of table-based compression schemes. The first, based on offline data profiling, is particularly suitable to embedded systems, where predictability of the data set is usually higher than in general-purpose systems. The second solution we introduce is adaptive, that is, it takes decisions on whether data words should be compressed according to the data statistics of the program being executed. We describe in details the architecture of the compression/decompression unit and we provide an insight about its implementation as a hardware (HW) block. We present experimental results concerning memory traffic and energy consumption in the cache-to-memory path of a core-based system running standard benchmark programs. The obtained energy savings range from 8%-39% when profile-driven compression is adopted, and from 7%-26% when the adaptive scheme is used. Performance improvements are also achieved as a by-product, showing the practical applicability of the proposed approach.","Data compression; Low-power design; Low-power dissipation","Bandwidth; Data storage equipment; Embedded systems; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Optimization; Program processors; Telecommunication traffic; Decompression units; Low-power design; Low-power dissipation; System-on-chip (SOC); Data compression",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142705792

One dominant niche, which we concentrate on, is embedded, multimedia software. The need is present to map large scale, dynamic, multimedia software onto an embedded system in a systematic and highly optimized manner.

The exploitation of grassland might have intriguing side effects like the conservation of cultural landscapes and the improvement of the ""stay option"" of farmers. Since 1999 comprehensive research starting from the raw material up to product formulation and development is carried out in Austria. However, in contrast to the centralized Biorefinery concepts in Europe, the Austrian Green Biorefinery focuses on a decentralized system based on grass-silage. Silage is rich in lactic acid and storage is organized decentralized. During the last years different green biomass and silage were analyzed. As a next step fractionation was carried out and trials for product separation took place. This work led to an integrated system elaboration of the Biorefinery concept. For economic assessment mass and energy balances were taken as the basis and a biogas plant has been considered as benchmark. However, due to permanent adoption of the economic models only current trends of economic assessment are summarized in this paper. With lactic acid and amino acids (proteins) as key products from silage the results support the assumption that Biorefineries can be viable and sustainable development efforts in rural regions are supported in Austria. This paper provides a condensed overview on research results of the last four years.","Biomass; Grass fibres; Grassland; Green biorefinery; Lactic acids; Proteins; Silage; Sustainability","Biogas; Biomass; Organic acids; Proteins; Raw materials; Sustainable development; Gras land; Grass fibres; Green biorefinery; Lactic acids; Silage; Sustainability; Biotechnology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842506306

The coupled flow of water, air, water vapour and heat is assumed to follow the theory of Philip and De Vries. Gravity, viscous and capillary forces are included in addition to volatilisation and dissolution of NAPL which are based on either local equilibrium or first order kinetics. The modified Galerkin weighted residual method is used in the spacial discretisation while the generalised mid-point rule is employed for time integration. The non-linearities are handled by both the Newton-Raphson algorithm for the flow equations and the iterative Picard Method for the transport and energy equations. Mass balance errors are minimised by specific treatment of the mass storage coefficients. The model was tested against several isothermal and non-isothermal analytical and 'benchmark' problems whenever available. A variety of problems constituting a subset of the general formulation have been simulated. Very good agreements were obtained between this model and the analytical solutions for the case of both one-dimensional and two-dimensional transient heat transfer. Additionally, the analytical results of steady transport in water and gas with and without biodegradation have been very well reproduced. The particular effect of the surface temperature variation on the flow of LNAPL and DNAPL in the subsurface was investigated and it has been shown to have significant impact on both the imbibition and redistribution stages. During the imbibition stage, the quantity of LNAPL or DNAPL contaminating the system is largely affected by the surface temperature. The resulting relative variation of NAPL saturation during the redistribution stage can reach about 30% for the range of surface temperature of 5-30 °C, mainly in the vadose zone near the ground surface. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","DNAPL; Finite element; Heat and mass flow; LNAPL; Non-isothermal; Three-phase flow","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Capillary flow; Dissolution; Flow measurement; Partial differential equations; Vaporization; Viscous flow; Non-isothermal subsurface; Multiphase flow; ground water; capillary pressure; heat transfer; non-aqueous phase liquid; pollutant transport; porous medium; three-phase flow; capillary pressure; heat transfer; nonaqueous phase liquid; pollutant transport; three phase flow; vadose zone; airflow; analytical error; article; biodegradation; capillary flow; controlled study; correlation coefficient; dissolution; finite element analysis; gas transport; glacial mass balance; gravity; heat transfer; mathematical model; meteorological phenomena; nonlinear system; observer variation; pollution monitoring; reproducibility; surface property; temperature dependence; theoretical study; viscosity; volatilization; water contamination; water flow; water pollution control; water transport; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842458451

Whereas mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is the chief energy source for the normal postnatal mammalian heart, the relative contribution of glucose utilization pathways is significant, allowing the plasticity necessary for steady ATP production in the context of diverse physiologic and dietary conditions. Because of the importance of insulin in the regulation of myocardial metabolism, chronic insulin deficiency or resistance results in a marked reduction in cardiac glucose utilization such that the heart relies almost exclusively on fatty acids to generate energy. High rates of fatty acid utilization in the diabetic heart could lead to functional derangements related to accumulation of lipid intermediates, excessive oxygen consumption... Chronic derangements in myocardial cell metabolism, as well as impairment of various intracellular signalling pathways, may therefore have maladaptive consequences, including functional abnormalities.","Fatty acid oxidation; Glucose utilization; Insulin signalling; Myocardial metabolism; Type 2 diabetes","adenosine triphosphate; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; cardiomyopathy; diabetes mellitus; diabetic cardiomyopathy; diet; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; glucose utilization; heart muscle metabolism; hormonal regulation; human; insulin deficiency; insulin resistance; lipid storage; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; pathogenesis; review; signal transduction; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Cardiomyopathies; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Fatty Acids; Female; Glucose; Humans; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Insulin Resistance; Male; Mice; Mitochondria, Heart; Models, Biological; Multienzyme Complexes; Myocardium; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen Consumption; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842429948

Afferent nerves are equipped with numerous sensors at their terminals in the gut related to visceral mechano- chemo- and noci-receptors, whose excitations may trigger a variety of visceral reflexes regulating GIT functions, including the appetitive behaviour. Food intake depends upon various influences from the CNS as well as from the body energy stores (adipocytes) that express and release the product of Ob gene, leptin, in proportion to fat stored and acting in long-term regulation of food intake. Leptin acts through receptors (Ob-R) present in afferent visceral nerves and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), whose neurons are capable of expressing and releasing neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti related protein (AgRP) that activate the ingestive behaviour through paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (""feeding center""). In addition, to this long-term regulation, a short-term regulation, on meal-to-meal basis, is secured by several gut hormones, such as cholecystokinin (CCK), peptides YY (PYY) and oxyntomodulin (OXM), released from the endocrine intestinal cells and acting via G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) either on afferent nerves or directly on ARC neurons, which in turn inhibit expression and release of food-intake stimulating NPY and AgRP, thereby inducing satiety through inhibition of PVN. In contrast, during fasting, the GIT, especially oxyntic mucosa, expresses and releases appetite stimulating (orexigenic) factors such as ghrelin and orexins (OX)-A and OX-B, and cannabinoid CB1 agonist. Ghrelin activates growth-hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) in hypothalamic ARC and stimulates growth hormone (GH) release and in vagal afferents to promote the expression and release of hypothalamic NPY and AgRP stimulating PVN and driving ingestive behaviour. The balance and interaction between anorexigenic (CCK, PYY, OXM) and orexigenic (ghrelin and OX) factors originating from GIT appears to play an important role in short-term regulation of food intake and growth hormone (GH) release. An impairment of this balance may result in disorders of feeding behaviour and weight gain (obesity) or weight loss (cachexia).","Appetite; Brain gut axis; CCK; Ghrelin; Leptin; Orexin; PYY","agouti related protein; cannabinoid receptor agonist; cholecystokinin; G protein coupled receptor; gastrointestinal hormone; ghrelin; growth hormone; growth hormone secretagogue receptor; leptin; neuropeptide Y; orexin A; orexin B; oxyntomodulin; peptide YY; adipocyte; appetite; autonomic nervous system; brain function; cachexia; central nervous system; cholinergic nerve; food intake; gastrointestinal tract; gene expression; growth hormone release; hypothalamus; intestine function; intestine innervation; lipid storage; nerve excitability; nociceptive receptor; noradrenergic nerve; parasympathetic nerve; receptor upregulation; regulatory mechanism; review; sensory nerve; sympathetic nerve; thalamus midline nucleus; vagus nerve; weight gain; Animals; Appetite Regulation; Brain; Digestive Physiology; Eating; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Models, Biological",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842428652

Based on the sticking probability plots we obtained as functions of the incidence H 2 beam energy, La is the best material for hydrogen storage, followed by Ti, and then by Mg. This is due to the absence of an activation barrier in the H2/La(0001) system. Both H2/Ti(0001) and H 2/Mg(0001) systems have activation barriers, but the H 2/Ti(0001) system has a very small activation barrier far from the curved region of the reaction path, while the H2/Mg(0001) system has a high activation barrier close to the curved region along the reaction path. Our results also indicate that the sticking probability has some dependence on the vibrational state of the impending H2 molecule for the Mg, Ti and La surfaces.

The FC is closest in hierarchy to the instruction fetch unit and it must be small in size to achieve energy-efficient realisations. A pattern prediction scheme is adapted to maximise energy savings in the FC hierarchy. The pattern prediction mechanism proposed relies on the spatial hit or miss pattern of the instruction access stream over previous FC line accesses. Unlike existing techniques, which make predominantly incorrect hit predictions, the proposed approach aims to minimise this, thereby reducing the performance and power penalties associated with it. Simulation results on an extensive set of multimedia benchmarks are presented as proof of its efficacy. The prediction technique results in energy-delay savings of up to 6.8% over the NFPT predictor, which has been proposed in the past as the preferred prediction scheme for FC structures. Investigations conclusively demonstrate that the performance of the proposed prediction scheme is comparable with and in most cases better than that based on NFPT. Unlike NFPT, the new proposed prediction technique lends well for VLSI efficient implementation, making it the preferred choice for energy aware implementations.",,"Algorithms; Computer simulation; Dynamic random access storage; Energy utilization; Finite automata; Program processors; Shift registers; Transistors; VLSI circuits; Filter cache (FC); Finite state machines; Next fetch prediction table (NFPT); Buffer storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642322859

An inverter model developed for 3-D device simulation is described, along with the analysis of the inverters device response as a function of time. The output thus obtained was applied as an input voltage source in circuit simulation of unit SRAM cell and the stability of this bistable circuit is studied on that basis. The effects on soft-error immunity of changes in alpha-particle injection conditions and in load resistance and capacitance are described. The validity of the presented model is examined through comparison of the bit-error-rate dependence on incident angle of alpha particles to that of measured rates. To simulate the angular dependence, we introduce statistical distribution models for alpha-particle energy, position of incidence on the device surface, and angle of incident. Results of device/circuit simulation carried out with many sets of energy, position, and angle are presented. Reasonable agreement between results of simulation and experimental data without the use of adjustment parameters is demonstrated. A map of soft-error tolerance on the CR plane with critical charge Qc as a parameter is presented and its derivation explained. An analytic expression for the tolerance is clarified by proposing an equivalent circuit model for the simulation of alpha-particle injection at the output node in an inverter circuit.

These last few years, the usual porous medium provided in wall and flooring constructions have been pointed out as possible passive systems capable of buffering the indoor climate variations in terms of temperature and humidity. The objective for the ongoing project is, therefore, to evaluate the possibility of ensuring an indoor climate within an acceptable range making use of large exposed massive wood surfaces. An experimental study, being performed in four occupied apartments of a multi-storey residential building in Sweden, is described in this paper. A brief analysis of the in situ recordings is also included. The temperature and relative humidity recordings show fairly well-agreement with the ASHRAE recommended values for a good indoor climate excepted during the cold periods revealing low indoor relative humidity. The first results show evidences that a large area of exposed massive wood contributes to buffer the indoor temperature variations. Furthermore, this far it does not shows evidences that a large area of exposed massive wood is able to damp the daily fluctuations in relative humidity. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The kinetics of gas exchange and softening were the same for the two seasons studied. CO2 partial pressures delayed softening but did not inhibit the rate of gas exchange. Lowering the O2 levels to near 0 kPa did not inhibit softening completely, suggesting that the rate of softening was driven by energy provided by both oxidative and fermentative processes. An integrated modelling approach was used to link the rate of softening to the rate of gas exchange explaining 88% of the effect of MA on both the rate of gas exchange and fruit softening. Shelf life simulations showed that during storage at 0°C, lowering O2 or raising CO2 gave a substantial benefit towards extending shelf life.

Methods: Ten female subjects performed a series of drop jumps from 40-cm height onto two sprung surfaces with different stiffness. Those trials of each subject displaying the maximal mechanical power during the upward phase were analyzed. The ground reaction forces were measured using a force plate. Sagittal kinematics of the subject's body positions and the deformation of the surface were recorded using two high-speed video cameras. Results: On the soft surface, the jumping height and the energy rates of the subjects during the contact phase were greater than on the hard one. The energy delivered by the subjects during the upward phase, the leg and joint stiffness, as well as the range of motion of the subjects remained unchanged for both surfaces. Conclusions: The absolute energy loss is lower for the hard surface, but the jumping performance is greater for the soft one. The reason is a higher ratio of positive to negative mechanical work done by the subjects during the contact phase. The adjustment of the subjects to different surfaces is not only dependent on the stiffness of the surface but also on the intensity of the movement.","Elasticity; Energy conversion; Leg stiffness; Mechanical energy; Strain energy","article; body position; energy; female; force; human; human experiment; joint stiffness; jumping; kinematics; mass; motion; normal human; surface property; Algorithms; Female; Gymnastics; Humans; Joints; Muscles; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542286595

The paste was thermally processed and packed in glass, polyethyleneterephthalate or high-density-polyethylene containers and stored at 5 ± 1 and 25 ± 1°C for 120 days. The rheological characteristics of the paste were studied by using a computer controlled rotational viscometer over the temperature range of 20-80°C. Samples were subjected to a programmed shear rate, increasing linearly from 0 to 200 s -1 in 3 min, followed by a steady shear at 200 s-1 for 3 min and finally decreasing linearly from 200 to 0 s-1 in 3 min. Ginger paste exhibited pseudoplasticity with yield stress and flow adequately described by the Herschel-Bulkley model. The yield stress decreased exponentially with process temperature and ranged between 3.86 and 27.82 Pa. The flow behaviour index (n) varied between 0.66 and 0.82 over the temperature range. Both consistency index and apparent viscosity decreased with increase in temperature and the process activation energies were found to be in the range of 16.7 to 21.9 kJ mol-1.

In elective surgery, induced hypothermia has beneficial effects. It is recommended to diminish complications attributable to ischemia reperfusion injury. Experimental studies have shown that hypothermia during hemorrhagic shock has beneficial effects on outcome. In contrast, clinical experience with hypothermia in trauma patients has shown accidental hypothermia to be a cause of posttraumatic complications. The different etiology of hypothermia might be one reason for this disparity because induced therapeutic hypothermia, with induction of poikilothermia and shivering prevention, is quite different from accidental hypothermia, which results in physiological stress. Other studies have shown evidence that this contradictory effect is related to the plasma concentration of high-energy phosphates (e.g., adenosine triphosphate [ATP]). Induced hypothermia preserves ATP storage, whereas accidental hypothermia causes depletion. Hypothermia also has an impact on the immunologic response after trauma and elective surgery by decreasing the inflammatory response. This might have a beneficial effect on outcome. Nevertheless, posttraumatic infectious complications may be higher because of an immunosuppressive profile.

Current iNO systems usually include a gas cylinder of N2 with a high concentration of NO. This system has an inherent risk of generating nitric dioxide (NO2) if leaked NO mixes with air. NO2 is thought to be toxic to the lungs. Therefore, a system that does not include storage of NO is very desirable for administering iNO. In this work, basic research for the development of an NO generator is described. NO is generated by pulsed arc discharges between two rod electrodes in a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen. An arc discharge having a temperature of about 10,000 K was produced, which was sufficient to generate NO. The concentration of NO can be controlled by adjusting the outlet pressure of gas mixture, the gas flow rate and the discharge energy, which is changed by altering the charging capacitance and the pulse repetition rate. The composition of the gas mixture after treatment with an arc discharge followed by exposure to heated molybdenum was 540 ppm of NO, 48 ppm of NO2 and the balance dry air at 0.1 MPa and 300±3 K. No ozone was detected at the outlet of the system by UV absorption. The density of the brass particles emitted from the electrodes, which had diameters over 0.3 μ m, was less than 1.39 μ g/L. A filter could readily capture and thus remove the brass particles.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14844310299

Ten subjects performed one-leg drop jumps (DJ) from different dropping heights with a constant rebound height. The fascicle length of the vastus lateralis muscle was measured by using real-time ultrasonography during DJ. In the braking phase of the DJ, fascicle lengthening decreased and the tendinous tissue lengthening increased with increased dropping intensity. In the subsequent push-off phase, the shortening of tendinous tissues increased with higher dropping intensity. The averaged electromyographic activities of the preactivation and braking phases increased and those of the push-off phase decreased as the drop height was increased. With higher dropping height but constant submaximal rebound jump, the stretched tendinous tissue length increased with less stretched fascicle during the braking phase. In the subsequent push-off phase, the recoil of tendinous tissues became greater. These results suggest that the increased prestretch intensity has considerable influence on the process of storage and subsequent recoil of the elastic energy during the stretch-shortening cycle action.","Drop jump; Elastic recoil; Ultrasonography","adult; article; controlled study; elasticity; electromyography; energy; exercise; height; human; human experiment; jumping; locomotion; male; measurement; muscle contraction; muscle length; muscle strength; muscle stretching; normal human; parameter; priority journal; real time echography; skeletal muscle; task performance; tendon; vastus lateralis muscle; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Electromyography; Exertion; Fascia; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Reflex, Stretch; Tendons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342346649

From the aspect of application, re-magnetization within a one domain state is preferred. However, in order to minimize stray field energies, lateral structures often form domains. Therefore, the study of the re-magnetization process is of particular interest. Polarized neutron reflectivity is a technique ideally suited for characterizing the magnetization reversal of periodically patterned structures. It can distinguish between magnetization reversal via coherent rotation or domain nucleation and wall movement. Re-magnetization measurements can be performed at the specular reflection as well as at Bragg reflections from the artificial periodicity. Whereas at the specular reflection an averaged signal over the complete sample is measured, the Bragg peaks filter out correlation effects between individual magnetic units. In this contribution polarized neutron reflectivity data from different periodic lateral structures are presented and discussed. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper the emphasis is put on the design, principles of operation and performance of a Bragg Curve Detector (BCD) optimized for internal beam experiments at storage rings. Very clean and distinct product identification (with Z up to ∼ 14) from reactions, in which a Ni target was bombarded with a 1.9 GeV circulating proton beam, is obtained. The individual elements are resolved for emission energies higher than 0.5 MeV/nucleon. Moreover, due to the detector read-out achieved by coupling a specially designed current sensitive preamplifier directly to a sampling ADC, the shape analysis of the signals from the BCD allows the isotope identification of light particles with A up to ∼ 11. It is also found that the BCD can be used efficiently as a thin ΔE detector for the telescope consisting of the BCD and a series of silicon detectors. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

BTN and BLTN films exhibit a maximum in the remanent polarization Pr at a Nb content x=0.018. At this Nb content, the BLTN film has a Pr value (25 μC/cm2) that is much higher than that of BiT and a coercive field (Ec=120kV/cm) similar to that of BiT. The polarization of this BLTN film is fatigue-free up to 109 switching cycles. The high fatigue resistance is mainly due to the substitution of Bi 3+ ions by La3+ ions at the A site and the enhanced P r arises largely from the replacement of Ti4+ ions by Nb5+ ions at the B site. The mechanisms behind the effects of the substitution at the two sites are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","D.

The assumption of a Gaussian site distribution for the Cr3+ ions taking as parameter the zero-phonon energy has been considered. For alkali disilicate glasses the inhomogeneous contribution to the broadening of the bands, associated to the site distribution, is lower than the homogeneous one. The electron-lattice coupling S and the mean phonon energy ℏω0 have been obtained with results around 4 and 500cm-1, respectively, similar to those obtained by other authors in oxide glasses. The site-resolved study of the emission and excitation spectra and the luminescence decay curves have been carried out as a function of temperature. On the one hand, there is evidence of a non-radiative de-excitation process that becomes important over 140K. On the other hand, and related to the site dependence of the radiative and non-radiative probabilities, different results involving low values for the quantum efficiencies and blue shifts of the emission bands as temperature increases have been explained. Besides, the non-exponential luminescence decay curves have been fitted to an expression proposed by the authors, which takes into account non-coupled distributions for the radiative and non-radiative de-excitation probabilities for the range of temperature covering from 13 to 300 K. From the fits, the temperature dependence of the non-radiative de-excitation probability is obtained for each disilicate glass, the results are in good agreement with the expression obtained assuming the harmonic approximation in the single configurational coordinate model. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of the steam to ethanol molar ratio on conversion and selectivities was relatively small. A more pronounced effect was observed for the oxygen to ethanol ratio. Overall, catalysts on all three supports were able to completely convert ethanol with high selectivities towards the desired products.

The electrochemical measurements showed that the cobalt-containing LaNi3.55Mn 0.4Al0.3Co0.75 alloy had a maximum capacity of 300 mA h/g at a rate of C/6. The capacity decrease was calculated by 5% after 20 cycles at C/6 rate with 100% depth of discharge (DOD). The cobalt-free LaNi3.55Mn0.4Al0.3Fe0.75 alloy showed a very good cycling stability, although the initial capacity (250 mA h/g at C/6 rate) was lower than that of the cobalt containing alloy. The capacity decrease of the cobalt-free alloy amounted to 1% after 20 cycles under the same rate and DOD. The mechanism of hydriding/dehydriding reaction on the alloy electrodes was also investigated using a constant potential discharge (CPD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. The obtained values of the hydrogen diffusion coefficient DH, were, 2 × 10-8 and 1.1 × 10-10 cm2 s-1 for LaNi 3.55Mn0.4Al0.3Co0.75 and 8 × 10-9 and 1.0 × 10-10 cm2 s-1 for LaNi3.55Mn0.4Al0.3Fe0.75, by CV and by CPD, respectively. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

It can be found that, by X-ray powder diffraction, the alloys are all consisted of the (La,Mg)Ni3 phase and the LaNi5 phase, and the lattice parameters and cell volumes of both the (La,Mg)Ni3 phase and the LaNi5 phase increase with increasing Mn content in alloys. The P-C isotherms curves indicate that the hydrogen storage capacity first increases and then decreases with increasing x, and the equilibrium pressure decreases. The electrochemical measurements show that the maximum discharge capacity increases from 342.6(x = 0.0) to 368.9 mA h/g(x = 0.3) and then decreases to 333.5 mA h/g(x = 0.5).

These systems are employed in applications where utility service is already available. In this case, there is no need for battery storage because grid power may be used to supplement photovoltaic systems (PV) when the load exceeds available PV generation. The load receives electricity from both the photovoltaic array and the utility grid. In this system, the load is the total electrical energy consumption. The main objective of the present work is to optimize the electrical load pattern in Kuwait using grid connected PV systems. In this situation, the electric load demand can be satisfied from both the photovoltaic array and the utility grid. The performance of grid connected photovoltaic systems in the Kuwait climate has been evaluated. It was found that the peak load matches the maximum incident solar radiation in Kuwait, which would emphasize the role of using the PV station to minimize the electrical load demand. In addition, a significant reduction in peak load can be achieved with grid connected PV systems. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

It consists of an Nb/Al/AlOx/Al/Nb layered structure and contains four STJs with sizes between 70×70 μm2 and 200×200 μm2. For dedicated characterization experiments we employed monochromatized undulator radiation of high spectral purity, which is available at the PTB Radiometry laboratory at the electron storage ring BESSY II. We investigated the STJ energy resolution at various photon energies below 1500 eV with respect to the detector area, the illuminated area, the incident photon energy and the count rate while recording the detector response. Applying a 50 μm-aperture to collimate the incident beam, we achieved an energy resolution of less than 10 eV at a photon energy of up to 900 eV for the 141×141 μm2-sized STJ. When a 5 μm-pinhole was employed approximately 25 mm in front of the STJ for the beam collimation, the energy resolution was independent of the detector size - between 5 and 9 eV for energies between 0.3 and 1.5 keV. Furthermore, we scanned both the effective detector area and the adjacent regions with a beam defined by a 5 μm-pinhole offering a beam width smaller than 18 μm. In this scan, both the energy resolution and the pulse height scale changed strongly within the central area of the STJ. These effects and those originating from the leads and edges are discussed. In addition, these findings contribute to understanding the decreasing energy resolution for increasing effective detector areas. We expect that such spatially resolved measurements will prove to be a proper method for detector evaluation and contribute to improving the detector layouts. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The use of symmetrical voltage cycling to control the actuation of polypyrrole is shown to lead to a slow net oxidation of the polymer after several tens of cycles. The result is a slow deterioration in the actuation strain. The use of current pulsing reduces this problem and gives a more stable strain response.

This trend was also observed in a new flood sequence following a dry period and is consistent with exhaustion of erodible soil. The sources of the loose soil particles is due to the activity of soil fauna and livestock footfalls, which cause soil particles to detach and accumulate on the surface during dry periods. This behaviour was modeled using a distributed model of sediment routing that simulates the transport of suspended solids as wash load. Particle motion is not limited by the energy of raindrop impact, but rather from the sediment lift and transport by surface runoff. Once a particle is moved, it is transported as wash load. The transport rate by wash load is governed by the runoff tractive strength and velocity, as well as by the particle density, diameter and shape. A model of wash load transport based on sediment storage depletion accounts reasonably well for the suspended load concentrations. Transport is influenced by the space distribution of loose particles: simulations show that the total mass of erodible soil, its particle size distribution and space distribution are significant factors affecting the concentrations of suspended load. The transport efficiency ratios varied over the range 0.003-0.247 of total mass of erodible soil. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

For this, pyrene is covalently coupled to a polyeclectrolyte that can then be incorporated into polyelectrolyte multilayers by layer-by-layer technology. High pyrene labeling (1:30) allows for high chromophore density in the film (1/10 nm3), which is necessary for efficient electron transfer. The photophysical properties of the covalently coupled dye do not differ much from those of the well-known free pyrene, except that the high local pyrene concentration yields considerable excimer emission. The multilayer is built in the form of the wall of hollow capsules of micrometer dimensions. This enables kinetic studies due to the high specific area and also gives perspectives for further development of the system for light harvesting and energy storage in the inside, in analogy to natural photosynthesis.

In contrast, both a higher growth potential and an increase in CF were found in northern cod when offspring of northern and southern cod from the same area and of the same age as the wild cod were housed together in a 'common-garden' experiment. The rapid growth in northern cod was achieved by higher success in food competition when given a restricted amount of food. Active feeding behaviour and larger energy allocation to storage tissues, as suggested by the higher increase in condition, represents adaptations to the high-latitude environment for northern cod and countergradient variation. These differences suggest the existence of genetically distinct sub-populations along the Norwegian coast. Development of sub-populations that differ in behaviour and life-history strategies are discussed in relation to mechanisms for local retention of early life stages and local adaptation of older stages. Sub-populations with different life histories may respond differently to fisheries, and attention to this could be beneficial for improving fisheries management.","Behaviour; Coastal cod; Countergradient variation; Fisheries management; Local adaptation; Sub-populations","fishery management; gadoid fishery; life history; subpopulation; Atlantic Ocean; Gadiformes; Gadus; Gadus morhua; Gadus morhua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542580031

Didemnin B was used as internal standard and, after protein precipitation with acetonitrile and liquid-liquid extraction with chloroform, APL was separated by liquid chromatography using a reversed-phase C 18 column and a linear gradient of acetonitrile in water (both containing 0.5% formic acid). Detection was performed using a turboionspray source operated in positive ion mode and by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM; m/z 1111→295 for APL and m/z 1113→297 for didemnin B). The method was linear (r≥0.9933) over the range 1-250ng/ml, with intra- and inter-batch precision and accuracy below 12.2% (except at LLOQ, ≤15.4%) for both plasma and urine. Recoveries were moderate, ranging from 54 to 70% in plasma and blood, and from 46 to 60% in urine, for both APL and didemnin B. The LOD was 0.25ng/ ml for both matrices. APL resulted stable in the different matrices at least for 6h (both at room temperature and 37°C), after freeze and thaw cycles and long term storage at -20°C. The method allowed demonstrating that APL is in a dynamic equilibrium between plasma and blood cells. Moreover, the method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of Aplidin® in cancer patients. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

CO temperature-programmed reduction provides a qualitative picture of the reducibility of that catalyst. Step-change experiments in CO concentration in the temperature range between 50 and 250°C allowed us to estimate the oxygen storage capacity of the catalyst as a function of temperature. The measured CO and CO2 responses were used to construct a detailed transient kinetic model based on elementary reaction steps. In the modeling, elementary reaction steps such as the adsorption of CO on oxidized and reduced catalyst active sites, diffusion of subsurface lattice oxygen to the surface, reoxidation of reduced catalyst active sites by the subsurface lattice oxygen, and the surface reaction of CO to CO2 were considered. The calculated activation energies for various surface reaction steps were in the range from 9.7 to 39.6 kJmol-1, for the catalyst reoxidation step 72.9 kJmol-1, and for the lattice oxygen diffusion in the Cu 0.1Ce0.9O2-y catalyst 40.0 kJmol-1.

The relationship between the current density for hydrogen evolution reaction and the amount of LaNi5 particles in Ni-Co baths is like the well-known ""volcano plot"". The Surface morphology and microstructure of Ni-Co-LaNi5 coatings were determined by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The kinetic parameters were determined from electrochemical steady-state Tafel polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technology in 1M NaOH solution. The values obtained for the apparent energies of activation are 32.48, 46.29 and 57.03kJmol-1 for the Ni-Co-LaNi5, Ni-Co and Ni electrodes, respectively. The hydrogen evolution reaction on Ni-Co-LaNi5 proceeds via Volmer-Tafel reaction route with the mixed rate determining characteristics. The composite coating Ni-Co-LaNi5 is catalytically more active than Ni and Ni-Co electrodes due to the increase in its real surface areas and the decrease in the apparent free energy of activation caused by the electrocatalytic synergistic effect of the Ni-Co alloys and the hydrogen storage intermetallic particles on the electrode surface. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

These intermetallic compounds absorbed nitrogen into their crystal lattices by heating in NH3 or N2 gas at 573-773 K to form the interstitial-type metal nitrides. The nitrogen stored in the metal nitrides was reversibly released by a successive heat treatment in a stream of H 2 gas at 523-723 K. The nitrogen absorption and desorption properties of RFe7 was superior to that of R2Fe 17 because of the ease of nitrogen diffusion due to the difference of crystal structure between them.

Overloading of white adipose tissue beyond its storage capacity leads to lipid disorders in non-adipose tissues, namely skeletal and cardiac muscles, pancreas, and liver, effects that are often mediated through increased non-esterified fatty acid fluxes. This in turn leads to a tissue-specific disordered insulin response and increased lipid deposition and lipotoxicity, coupled to abnormal plasma metabolic and (or) lipoprotein profiles. Thus, the importance of functional adipocytes is crucial, as highlighted by the disorders seen in both ""too much"" (obesity) and ""too little"" (lipodystrophy) white adipose tissue. However, beyond its capacity for fat storage, white adipose tissue is now well recognised as an endocrine tissue producing multiple hormones whose plasma levels are altered in obese, insulin-resistant, and diabetic subjects. The consequence of these hormonal alterations with respect to both glucose and lipid metabolism in insulin target tissues is just beginning to be understood. The present review will focus on a number of these hormones: acylation-stimulating protein, leptin, adiponectin, tumour necrosis factor α, interleukin-6, and resistin, defining their changes induced in obesity and diabetes mellitus and highlighting their functional properties that may protect or worsen lipid metabolism.","C3adesarg; Fatty acid trapping; Lipogenesis; Lipolysis","Esterification; Insulin; Lipids; Metabolism; Muscle; Proteins; Toxicity; Diabetes; Liver; Necrosis factors; Diseases; acylation stimulating protein; adiponectin; fatty acid; insulin; interleukin 6; leptin; lipid; protein; resistin; tumor necrosis factor alpha; acylation; adipocyte; adipose tissue; biosynthesis; catabolism; diet restriction; disease association; energy balance; energy expenditure; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid transport; glucose metabolism; homeostasis; hormonal regulation; human; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; liver function; metabolic syndrome X; muscle; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; nutritional status; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; postprandial state; protein expression; review; white adipose tissue; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fatty Acids; Hormones; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Models, Biological; Obesity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342639558

One such mechanism is reversible protein phosphorylation which is now known to contribute to the regulation of fuel metabolism, to ion channel arrest, and to the suppression of protein synthesis during hypometabolism. The present review focuses on two new areas of research in hypometabolism: (1) the role of differential gene expression in supplying protein products that adjust metabolism or protect cell functions for long-term survival, and (2) the mechanisms of protein life extension in hypometabolism involving inhibitory controls of transcription, translation and protein degradation. Control of translation examines reversible phosphorylation regulation of ribosomal initiation and elongation factors, the dissociation of polysomes and storage of mRNA transcripts during hypometabolism, and control over the translation of different mRNA types by differential sequestering of mRNA into polysome versus monosome fractions. The analysis draws primarily from current research on two animal models, hibernating mammals and anoxia-tolerant molluscs, with selected examples from multiple other sources.","Aestivation; Anoxia tolerance; Gene expression; Hibernation; Hypometabolism; Metabolic rate depression; Polysome profiles; Protein synthesis; Reversible phosphorylation","elongation factor; initiation factor; ion channel; messenger RNA; anoxia; cell function; cell survival; diapause; dissociation; gene expression; gene induction; genetic transcription; metabolic inhibition; metabolic rate; nonhuman; phylogeny; polysome; protein degradation; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis; review; ribosome; RNA transcription; RNA translation; species difference; transcription regulation; translation regulation; upregulation; Animals; Anoxia; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Hibernation; Protein Biosynthesis; Transcription, Genetic; Animalia; Mammalia; Mollusca",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442291120

Serum and liver triacylglycerol contents were significantly greater (P<0.05) in rats fed 200 g MLCT/kg diet, as were hepatic capacities of citrate synthase and cytochrome oxidase (P<0.05). The effects of MLCT on body fat were also examined in adult rats fed a limited amount of food (approximately 50 % of ad libitum intake). Reduction of body fat deposition during the food restriction was the same between in LCT and MLCT groups. These results suggest that accumulation of body fat was less efficient during long-term feeding of MLCT than LCT in rats fed high-fat diets ad libitum.

Pflanzengenetik K., Correnstrasse 3, D-06466 Gatersleben, Germany","Different aspects of barley grain development have been studied in detail, but a more global analysis of gene expression patterns is still missing. We have employed macro arrays, containing 1184 unique sequences from 1421 barley cDNA fragments, to study gene expression profiles in maternal and filial tissues of developing barley caryopses from fertilization to early storage phase. Principle component analysis (PCA) defined distinct expression networks in the pre-storage (0, 2, and 4 days after flowering (DAF)) and early storage phase (10 and 12 DAF). During an intermediate phase (6 and 8 DAF), PCA visualizes a dramatic reprogramming of the transcriptional machinery. In maternal tissues, a large set of protein-mobilizing enzyme mRNAs, together with upregulated lipid-mobilizing enzyme and downregulated reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzyme genes, suggests mobilization of stored compounds and programmed cell death (PCD). In the filial tissue fraction, a set of genes highly expressed during the pre-storage phase is involved in growth processes, including cell wall biosynthesis. The data suggest that the necessary UDP-glucose is provided both by sucrose synthase (isoform 3) and an invertase-driven pathway. Further, major developmental changes in pathways producing energy are predicted. A bell-shaped expression profile with a peak during the intermediate phase is characteristic for genes associated with photosynthesis and ATP production. The photosynthesis-determined increase of ATP concentration could be a prerequisite for the initiation of grain filling, dominated by starch and storage protein synthesis. Storage product accumulation is accompanied by high transcriptional activity of genes involved in glycolysis and fermentation, as well as in the citric acid cycle.","Barley; Coordinated development; Expression profiling; Grain-specific photosynthesis; Initiation of grain filling; Maternal and filial caryopsis tissues","DNA; Enzymes; Fermentation; Grain (agricultural product); Metabolism; Photosynthesis; Principal component analysis; RNA; Tissue; Metabolic pathways; Programmed cell death (PCD); Plants (botany); beta fructofuranosidase; enzyme; glucosyltransferase; reactive oxygen metabolite; sucrose; sucrose synthase; apoptosis; article; barley; cell wall; energy metabolism; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; methodology; photosynthesis; physiology; plant seed; Apoptosis; beta-Fructofuranosidase; Cell Wall; Energy Metabolism; Enzymes; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucosyltransferases; Hordeum; Photosynthesis; Reactive Oxygen Species; Seeds; Sucrose; Eukaryota; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Spermatophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342311966

Insulin sensitivity and IMTG content are both dynamic and can alter rapidly in response to dietary variation, physical activity and thermoregulatory response. Physically active humans (athletes) display elevated IMTG content, but in contrast to obese persons, are insulin sensitive. This paradox has created confusion surrounding the role of IMTG in the development of insulin resistance. In this review we consider the modern athlete as the physiological archetype of the Late Palaeolithic hunter-gatherer to whom the selection pressures of food availability, predation and fluctuating environmental conditions applied and to whom the genotype of modern man is virtually identical. As food procurement by the hunter-gatherer required physical activity, 'thrifty' genes that encouraged immediate energy storage upon refeeding after food deprivation (Neel, 1962) must have been of secondary importance in survival to genes that preserved physical capacity during food deprivation. Similarly genes that enabled survival during cold exposure whilst starved would be of primary importance. In this context, we discuss the advantage afforded by an elevated IMTG content, and how under these conditions, a concomitant muscle resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake would also be advantageous. In sedentary modern man, adiposity is high and skeletal muscle appears to respond as if a state of starvation exists. In this situation, elevated plasma lipids serve to accrue lipid and induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Reversal of this physiological state is primarily dependant on adequate contractile activity, however, in modern Western society, physical inactivity combined with abundant food and warmth has rendered IMTG a redundant muscle substrate.",,"glucose; insulin; lipid; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol; athlete; cold exposure; dietary intake; disease association; environmental factor; food availability; food deprivation; food intake; food preference; genotype; glucose transport; heat; human; immobilization; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; muscle contractility; muscle level; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; physical activity; physical capacity; predation; priority journal; refeeding; review; sitting; skeletal muscle; starvation; survival; thermoregulation; cell level; energy metabolism; gene; gene function; insulin resistance; lipid blood level; lipid metabolism; lipid oxidation; muscle cell; muscle function; obesity; pathophysiology; physical inactivity; Review; sedentary lifestyle; survival; thrifty gene; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Life Style; Muscle, Skeletal; Obesity; Physical Fitness; Selection (Genetics); Survival; Triglycerides",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242273876

A design-oriented temperature-distribution model for vertically stratified thermal storages that facilitates the evaluation of storage energy and exergy contents is utilized. The paper is directed towards demonstrating the thermodynamic benefits achieved through stratification, and increasing the utilization of exergy-based performance measures for stratified thermal storages. A wide range of realistic storage-fluid temperature profiles is considered, and for each the relative increase in exergy content of the stratified storage compared to the same storage when it is fully mixed is evaluated. The results indicate that, for all temperature profiles considered, the exergy storage capacity of a thermal storage increases when it is stratified, and increases as the degree of stratification, as represented through greater and sharper spatial temperature variations, increases. Furthermore, the percentage increase in exergy capacity is greatest for storages at temperatures near to the environment temperature, and decreases as the mean storage temperature diverges from the environment temperature (to either higher or lower temperatures). It is concluded that (i) the use of stratification in thermal storage designs should be considered as it increases the exergy storage capacity of a thermal storage and (ii) exergy analysis should be applied in the analysis and comparison of stratified thermal storage systems. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Energy; Exergy analysis; Stratification; Thermal storage","Exergy; Mathematical models; Thermal stratification; Storage capacity; Thermal storage systems; Energy storage; energy dissipation; exergy; storage; stratification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1142281893

The test pattern generator (TPG) scheme is based on a T-type flip-flop feedback shift register. The generator can be seeded similarly to a D-type flip-flop shift register. It generates test patterns in a test-per-clock mode. The TPG pattern sequence is modified at regular intervals by adding a modulo-2 bit from a modification sequence, which is stored in a memory. The memory can be either a ROM on the chip or a memory in the tester. The test patterns have both random and deterministic properties, which are advantageous for the final quality of the resulting test sequence, The number of bits stored in the memory, number of clock cycles, hardware overhead and the parameters of the resulting zero aliasing space compactor and MISR are given for the ISCAS benchmark circuits. The experiments demonstrate that the BIST scheme provides shorter test sequences than other methods while the hardware overhead and memory requirements are kept low.","Built-in self test; Test pattern compression; Test response compaction; Test-per-clock testing; Zero aliasing error","Benchmarking; Built-in self test; Data storage equipment; Error analysis; Flip flop circuits; Parameter estimation; Shift registers; Test patterns; Test response; Integrated circuit testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10744232078

Hydrocarbons such as benzene and biphenyl were mainly detected by gas chromotography-mass spectrometry at a temperature of 710 °C during thermo-gravimetric analysis of PPP. The microtexture and the structure of heat treated PPP samples were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and investigated by image processing.

The novel composite material was prepared by chemical or electrochemical polymerization of EDOT directly on the nanotubes or from a homogenous mixture of PEDOT and CNTs. Acetylene black (AB) has been also used as a composite component in order to evaluate whether nanotubes are giving improved properties or not. Electrodes prepared from such composites were used in supercapacitors operating in acidic (1 M H2SO4), alkaline (6M KOH) and organic (1 M TEABF4 in AN) electrolytic solutions. The capacitance values were estimated by galvanostatic, voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy techniques with two- or three-electrode cell configuration. Due to the open mesoporous network of nanotubes, the easily accessible electrode/electrolyte interface allows quick charge propagation in the composite material and an efficient reversible storage of energy in PEDOT during subsequent charging/discharging cycles. The composites with AB supply quite good capacitance results, however, nanotubes as electrode component gave definitively a more homogenous dispersion of PEDOT that should give a better charge propagation. The values of capacitance for PEDOT/carbon composites ranged from 60 to 160F/g and such material has a good cycling performance with a high stability in all the electrolytes. Organic medium is especially interesting because of higher energy stored. Another quite important advantage of this composite is its significant volumetric energy because of the high density of PEDOT. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The Fe-doped nanostructured graphite shows the most marked hydrogen storage properties among the Fe-, Co-, Ni- and Cu-catalyzed graphite systems. The absorbed hydrogen concentration reaches up to ∼4 wt% by mechanically milling for 32 h (∼7 wt% for 80 h), and two peaks of hydrogen (mass number=2) around 730 and 1050 K were observed in the thermal desorption mass spectra (TDS). The starting temperature for hydrogen desorption was ∼600 K. On the other hand, the Co-doped graphite indicates that absorbed hydrogen concentrations reaches up to ∼2 wt% by mechanically milling for 32 h. The TDS spectrum showed only a broad peak around 1100 K, but the starting point for hydrogen desorption lowered down to ∼500 K. The Ni- and Cu-doped graphites did not show any significant improvement for hydrogen storage. These results suggest that the catalytic effect on hydrogen storage properties strongly depends on the affinity of graphite and doped metals. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the different possible solutions for the greenhouse effect reduction, hydrogen has been proposed for energy transportation. Indeed, H2 can be seen as a clean and efficient energy carrier. However, beside the difficulties related to hydrogen production, efficient high capacity storage is still to be developed. Hydrogen can be stored as a compressed gas, in liquefied tanks or absorbed in solids. Many metals and alloys are able to store large amounts of hydrogen. This latter solution is of interest in terms of safety, global yield and long time storage. However, to be suitable for applications, such compounds must present high capacity, good reversibility, fast reactivity and sustainability. In this paper, we will review on the structural and thermodynamic properties of metallic hydrides. Their solid-gas hydrogenation behaviour and the related absorption-desorption isotherm curves are examined as a useful criterion for the selection of suitable materials for applications. The storage performances obtained with these alloys are reported and some solutions to common problems such as corrosion, passivation, decrepitation, poor kinetic and short cycle life are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The nanosize Sn particles are homogeneously dispersed in the graphite matrix via electroless chemical reduction. The tin-graphite composite showed a great improvement in lithium storage capacity. Since Sn is an active element to lithium, Sn can react with lithium to form Li4.4Sn alloys, a reaction accompanied by a dramatic volume increase, whereas the ductile graphite matrix provides a perfect buffer layer to absorb this volume expansion. Therefore, the integrity of the composite electrode is preserved during lithium insertion and extraction. Cyclic voltammetry was employed to identify the reaction process involved in lithium insertion and extraction in the graphite structure, as well as lithium alloying with tin. The tin-graphite composites provide a new type of anode material for lithium-ion batteries with an increased capacity.","Lithium intercalation; Lithium-ion battery; Micro-encapsulation; Sn-coated graphite","Anodes; Cyclic voltammetry; Electroless plating; Electrolytic reduction; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Energy storage; Graphite; Nanostructured materials; Particle size analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Solid electrolytes; Tin; Ultrasonic applications; X ray diffraction analysis; Solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI); Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0742324919

Much of the growth that the subject has witnessed has been fuelled by developments in, and successful application of, techniques and methodologies that have enabled new classes of experiments to be performed. Examples of progress in techniques include the availability of storage ring technology for measurements of dication lifetimes and the interaction of dications with electrons, heavy ion accelerators and synchrotron radiation sources for studies that probe the dynamics of multielectron ejection from molecules, new types of detectors for measurement of multicoincidence spectra, and of novel ion sources, like electrospray, for production of very highly charged molecules, particularly biomolecules that normally exist only in the liquid phase. Examples of progress in methodologies include the development of ion translational energy spectrometry to make lifetime measurements, the application of covariance mapping and other multi-coincidence methods that make possible studies of the decay dynamics of highly charged molecules, and new applications of time-of-flight and ion beams apparatus to probe reactivities of highly charged molecules. Perhaps the most dramatic progress has been in studies that probe negatively charged molecules possessing more than a single charge. Substantial experimental work has been accomplished in the last few years on the formation of molecular dianions, and their decay by electron and photon impact.

Further, it is expected that a many distributed generation facilities and energy storage systems will be installed at the end point of the power systems. Therefore, the future power system must be able to cope with these various qualities of power in the deregulated situation. The authors have proposed the FRIENDS (Flexible, Reliable, and Intelligent ENergy Delivery System) concept as a new distribution system that copes with a new framework of the electric power business in the near future. The most typical aspect of FRIENDS is the introduction of new equipment; Quality Control Centers (QCC) between distribution substations and customers. In this paper, the authors propose a concrete interior structure and investigate some control methods for realizing unbundling power quality supply and power conditioning using the proposed UPQC-type QCC.

The analysis of 17 different technology options, which were chosen in order to match the consumption behaviour of a typical Portuguese family, has shown that the use of electric heat pumps, both for space and water-heating, combined with the use of a natural gas cooker, leads to the lowest energy consumption and to the lowest environmental impacts in terms of carbon emissions. Considering only the running costs, this choice is 45% more economic than having a natural gas centralised heating system combined with a gas cooker, and is 60% more economic than having an electric resistance space heater combined with an electric storage water heater and electric cooker, which is the worst case. The life cycle cost (LCC) analysis shows that the economic optimum is reached by the combination of a natural gas water heater with an electric storage space heater, and a natural gas cooker. The cost of conserved carbon (CCC) analysis shows that the combination of an electric heat pump water heater with an electric storage space heater, and a natural gas cooker is the best option in terms of environmental performance. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Information on the viscoelastic properties of such materials at melt temperatures is of interest as this can lead to an improved understanding of polymer behaviour in processing and fabrication technologies. Samples were subjected to a strain which varied in a sinusoidal manner with time and the resultant response of the sample in terms of storage shear modulus (G′) and loss shear modulus (G″) was investigated (at a number of different temperatures) with increasing frequency of the applied strain. Results were assessed using the time-temperature superposition principal. Master curves show four characteristic features: a terminal zone at low frequencies, a fluid-elastic transition zone, a rubbery zone and a glassy zone at high frequencies. These features are indicative of different stress relaxation processes. The average molecular weight between entanglements (Me) was determined from the storage modulus associated with the rubbery zone. This was found to be approximately half the value of Mc (the critical average molecular weight for entanglement). The effects of molecular weight were clearly seen in the terminal zone where the polymer behaves analogous to a Newtonian fluid. The non-Newtonian behaviour of the material was reflected by a sharp increase in G′ and a decrease in the dynamic viscosity (Y′) with frequency. Acceleration factors derived from time-temperature superposition showed good adherence to the Arrhenius relationship with an activation energy for viscous flow found to be essentially independent of polymer molecular weight suggesting the unit of flow is a collection of chain segments rather than the whole chain itself. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The first one is to determine the thermal properties of lauric acid (LA)-stearic acid (SA), myristic acid (MA)-palmitic acid (PA) and palmitic acid (PA)-stearic acid (SA) eutectic mixtures as latent heat storage material. The properties were measured by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis technique. The second one is to study the thermal reliability of these materials in view of the change in their melting temperatures and latent heats of fusion with respect to repeated thermal cycles. For this aim, the eutectic mixtures were subjected to 360 repeated melt/freeze cycles, and their thermal properties were measured after 0, 90,180 and 360 thermal cycles by the technique of DSC analysis. The DSC thermal analysis results show that the binary systems of LA-SA in the ratio of 75.5:24.5 wt.%, MA-PA in the ratio of 58:42 wt.% and PA-SA in the ratio of 64.2:35.8 wt.% form eutectic mixtures with melting temperatures of 37.0, 42.60 and 52.30 °C and with latent heats of fusion of 182.7, 169.7 and 181.7 Jg-1, respectively. These thermal properties make them possible for heat storage in passive solar heating applications with respect to climate conditions. The accelerated thermal cycle tests indicate that the changes in the melting temperatures and latent heats of fusion of the studied eutectic mixtures are not regular with increasing number of thermal cycles. However, these materials, latent heat energy storage materials, have good thermal reliability in terms of the change in their thermal properties with respect to thermal cycling for about a one year utility period. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The ANSYS software release 5.4 was used for this purpose. Modifications were introduced embodying water properties and making the software compatible with the different types of loads. The behavior of parameters related to performance such as temperature, velocity distributions, mean tank temperature, total stored energy and the best location of the inlet and outlet water flows were investigated systematically. A new idea of introducing an internal horizontal adiabatic partition was investigated. The length of the partition and its location along the height of the storage collector was analyzed to give optimum stored energy and maximum possible mean tank temperature. The results showed that the performance of the storage collector can be improved by using the partition. The mean tank temperature reached 37 °C in the 1st of January and 46 °C in the 21st of June without partition.

Previous research has shown that reducing gas exchange during incubation by wrapping half the eggshell with an impermeable membrane results in impaired cognitive ability in young chicks. The results were interpreted within a three stage sequential model of memory using discriminated bead avoidance learning. Reducing gas exchange for 4 days from day 10 or 14, of the 21-day incubation, inhibits memory formation and consolidation into permanent storage. The nature of the cognitive deficit depended on the timing of the insult. Environmental hypoxia (14% oxygen), induced from days 10 to 14 and from days 14 to 18, replicated the memory deficits found previously when eggs were partially wrapped with a membrane. Oxygen is necessary to break down food and to provide energy to build tissue proteins, and therefore hypoxia (partial wrapping or environmental incubation) may indirectly cause malnutrition. Malnutrition, induced by removing 5%, 7.5% or 10% albumin from the egg prior to incubation, had no significant effect on memory consolidation. Raised corticosterone levels occurred in chicks malnourished by 5% and 7.5%, but brain sparing was only evident in chicks with 7.5% albumin removal. Hatch rates were very low in 10% malnourished chicks. Using the chick as a model of prenatal stress, we have been able to isolate the effects of hypoxia from contributing maternal factors. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrogen charge and discharge properties were investigated electrochemically in a three-electrode cell with KOH solution. As a result, the sample shown by ACe1-xMxO 3-δ (A=Sr or Ba, M=rare earth element) was found to store hydrogen in the bulk and repeat hydrogen charge and discharge at room temperature, which suggested that the oxides are candidates for anode materials of hydrogen batteries. The maximum content of hydrogen stored was 119 mA h g-1 for BaCe0.95Nd0.05O3-δ, which corresponded to the fact that 1.44 hydrogen atoms were present in one formula of the sample. However, the cycleability was degraded with increasing the cycle number. Considering higher hydrogen-storage performance in the cerium-containing perovskite-type oxides than in the others, the valence change in cerium would have an important role to store hydrogen. Furthermore, the fact that the 1.44 hydrogens stored exceed the number of cerium in the formula suggested the presence of atomic hydrogen in the perovskite-type oxide like in the hydrogen storage alloys. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, the stand-alone generating systems using diesel engines have been widely used for emergency supplies of plants or isolated islands and so on. However, in these cases, synchronous generators are usually used. If the output frequency is to be kept constant, there is the need to control the speed of the engine using a high-performance governor. Even then, the output frequency changes in the case of a sudden load change. This paper proposes a new stand-alone power generating system. In this system, the constant-frequency output voltage can be obtained even though rotor speed changes by several percent.","Generator; Rotor excitation; Stand-alone generator; Variable-speed constant-frequency generation; Wound-rotor induction machine","Asynchronous machinery; Electric frequency control; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Governors; Multivariable control systems; Rotors (windings); Speed control; Constant frequency power generating system; Output frequency; Rotor excitation; Stand alone power generating system; Variable speed power generating system; Wound rotor induction machine; Electric power systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0348041720

Despite numerous studies on the influence of dietary fibers on the regulation of energy metabolism, this issue still remains controversial. The objective of our current studies was to investigate whether 5-n-alk(en)ylresorcinols, natural phenolic components of high fiber human diets, may be considered as natural regulators of excessive fat accumulation. Our studies revealed that 5-n-alk(en)ylresorcinols isolated from wheat and rye bran inhibit glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the key enzyme in triglyceride synthesis in adipocytes, specifically and effectively. Further in vitro studies showed that these compounds also prevent triglyceride accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. The most effective compound in both systems was 5-n-heneicosylresorcinol. The results indicate that the potential to prevent triglyceride accumulation increases with the hydrophobicity of the phenolic inhibitor.","Alkylresorcinols; Cereals; Dehydrogenases; High fiber diet; Phenolic lipids; Resorcinolic lipids; Triglyceride accumulation","5 henicosylresorcinol; 5 n heptadecylresorcinol; 5 n pentadecylresorcinol; 5 nonadecylresorcinol; glucose 6 phosphatase; glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; lactate dehydrogenase; phenol derivative; resorcinol derivative; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; vasopressin; enzyme inhibitor; lipid; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; oxidoreductase; resorcinol derivative; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; animal cell; article; bran; energy metabolism; enzyme inhibition; high fiber diet; hydrophobicity; lipid storage; lipogenesis; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; rye; wheat; adipocyte; animal; cell strain 3T3; chemistry; drug antagonism; drug effect; enzymology; metabolism; mouse; Animalia; Secale cereale; Triticum aestivum; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Animals; Enzyme Inhibitors; Lipids; Mice; NAD; Oxidoreductases; Resorcinols; Secale cereale; Triglycerides; Triticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542289854

A range of mechanical properties from a simple fracture load to detailed load/displacement curves obtained when pellets were subjected to diametral compression test and a bed of pellets was compacted, were used to provide measure of tensile strength, deformability, linear strain, elastic modulus, yield and shear strength. Such conventional techniques resulted in irreversible damage to the structure of the pellets and were unable to establish the viscoelastic properties of the pellets. The application of the dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), however, allowed the determination of (1) an accurate Young's modulus of elasticity, which was found to be between 8.4 and 24-fold higher than that determined from the diametral compression test, (2) the presence of a reversible elastic deformation even after the yield point in terms of storage modulus and (3) a change in the values of the phase angle, which illustrates the increase in viscoelasticity of the pellets formed with ethanol, glyceryl monostearate (GMS) or glycerol, while a decrease in viscoelasticity with the incorporation of lactose into the microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) pellets. This work further demonstrated that the only feasible technique for determining the elastic and plastic deformability of the pellets is the one which subjects the specimen to stress/relaxation cycles and can determine the dissipated energy in terms of loss modulus or phase angle, and that is DMA. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, up to date no systematic study of the influence of the deposition conditions and of the substrate used on the films structural and morphological properties has been carried out. In the present work, the energy dispersive X-ray diffraction and reflectometry (EDXD and EDXR) techniques were used to investigate double-layer Cr/Pt thin films, deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) at different temperatures (from RT to 600 °C) both on crystalline (Si and MgO) and on amorphous (SiO2) substrates. The synergy of the two X-ray techniques allows correlating the structural properties of the samples (obtained by the EDXD) to their morphological characteristics (provided by EDXR). The result is that when the PLD deposition is performed under suitable working conditions and with use of crystalline substrates, films with good texture and with very smooth surfaces were obtained, as required by the magnetorecording applications. Moreover, the structural quality appears to be independent of the deposition temperature. Finally, the advantages connected with the joint use of the energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction and reflectometry are shortly discussed.",,"Chromium; Crystal structure; Crystallization; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Magnetic disk storage; Magnetic recording; Pulsed laser deposition; Textures; Crystalline substrates; Thin films; chromium; magnesium oxide; platinum; silicon dioxide; article; chemical structure; crystal structure; energy; film; laser; morphological trait; reflectometry; structure analysis; surface property; temperature; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642582231

Addition of these bacteria to pyrite triggers interfacial phenomena that lead to bacterial attachment and local forms of corrosion (surface pitting). As the leaching process proceeds, bacterial cells undergo changes, characterized by the release of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the uptake and storage of electro-dense nanoparticles. The latter are embedded in an exopolymeric capsule, which coats the bacterial surface leading to distinctive biomineralized assemblages. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses, quantitative energy-dispersive X-ray measurements and electron diffraction established that the embedded electron-dense nanoparticles comprise pyrite with a well-defined stoichiometry. Addition of Fe3+ alone did not induce any form of local corrosion on pyrite, which indicates that the reactions taking place between the attached bacteria and the underlying pyrite surface are responsible for the leaching patterns observed in this study. The observed corrosion process resembles that of 'electrochemical machining', because it uses a corrosion promoter, namely the locally concentrated Fe3+ in the biofilm environment, formed by the attached cells. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societies.","Biomineralization; Extracellular polymeric substance; Leptospirillum ferrooxidans; Nanoparticle; Pitting; Pyrite","ferric ion; ferrous ion; nanoparticle; pyrite; biomineralization; corrosion; geomicrobiology; leaching; microbial activity; pyrite; article; bacterial cell; bacterium; biomineralization; cell adhesion; controlled study; corrosion; electrochemistry; electron diffraction; extracellular space; leaching; leptospirillum ferrooxidans; microbial activity; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; stoichiometry; surface property; transmission electron microscopy; X ray analysis; Bacteria; Bacterial Adhesion; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biofilms; Biopolymers; Corrosion; Iron; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Nanoparticles; Sulfides; Bacteria (microorganisms); Leptospirillum; Leptospirillum ferrooxidans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642399111

It is widely accepted that DO3B forms long columnar supramolecular structure in nonpolar solvents like Cn due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between amide groups. The obtained storage and loss moduli as functions of frequency for DO 3B/Cn were simple and well described with a Maxwell model possessing only one set of a relaxation time (τ) and strength (G N) just like those in aqueous threadlike micellar systems formed by some surfactants. The value of GN is proportional to c2 as observed in fully entangled linear flexible polymer systems. The value of τ slightly decreases with increasing the value of c contrary to the behavior of the polymer systems. The activation energy of τ was determined to be 32 ± 2 kJ mol-1 irrespective of the sort of solvents and was different from those of the viscosity for each solvent. These strongly suggest that columnar, flexible supramolecular polymeric structure is generated in DO3B/Cn and densely entangles each other to show the pronounced viscoelasticity as well as in the polymer systems, whereas a mechanism for entanglement release is not similar to that in the polymer systems, but to that in aqueous threadlike micellar systems.",,"Activation energy; Benzene; Crosslinking; Hydrogen bonds; Micelles; Molecular structure; Organic solvents; Polymers; Relaxation processes; Superconducting transition temperature; Supramolecular chemistry; Surface active agents; Viscoelasticity; Viscosity; Organogels; Supramolecular polymeric systems; Paraffins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0942301085

The model components include the parameterization of land surface resistances, energy transfer, soil water movement, interception and surface runoff. What is distinguished in our model is the scheme for evapotranspiration partition by introducing a working variable related to the water vapor deficit at the reference height. The basin was divided into 6227 grids with resolution of 30 x 30 arc seconds. A digital elevation model was used to correct meteorological variables for altitude, and the inverse distance square method was adopted for spatial interpolation of precipitation over the basin. The remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in 1996 and the land use/cover data, both with the resolution of 30 x 30 arc seconds, were used to retrieve the distribution of vegetation leaf area index (LAI). The evapotranspiration simulated by using 1996 NDVI-derived LAI is close to that by using phenologically derived LAI. The differences of annual amounts of evapotranspiration from 1984 to 1997 simulated by using LAI derived by 1992, 1995 and 1996 monthly composite NDVI are less than 30 mm yr-1 (or 5%), in which 1995 represents drought and 1992 wet. The simulated annual evapotranspiration (ETa) plus soil storage change from 1984 to 1997 is in good agreement with precipitation minus discharge at the outlet. The spatial pattern of annual evapotranspiration and its components in 1996 clearly corresponded to the precipitation and LAI patterns over the basin. The highest monthly evapotranspiration (ETm) occurred in the period of July to August with 104 mm month-1. The value of ETm for irrigated farmland is higher than that for other vegetation types all the year and the values of ETm for grass and arid farmland are similar and about 10 mm month-1 higher than those for forest covers in summer. The predicted annual evapotranspiration in 1996 over the Lushi basin is 628 mm with the transpiration 327 mm, soil evaporation 256 mm and canopy interception 45 mm, respectively. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Tapes under study were carrying DC transport current and exposed to external AC (0-20 mT, 50-400 Hz) or DC (0-20 mT) magnetic fields perpendicular to the plane of the tape. The measurements were carried out with bifilar tape to avoid the influence of the self-field. The measured I-V curves are well described by power law in the range of electric field 0.1-10 μV/cm. The AC field affects the I-V curves in a much stronger way than the DC field. The application of the AC field results in a linear decrease of the critical current (criterion 1 μV/cm) independent of the frequency of the magnetic field. The exponent n also exhibits a strong dependence on the AC magnetic field decreasing with increasing AC field amplitude and increasing with increasing frequency. The results are interpreted by assuming a confinement of the DC transport current in the central AC field free region of the tape. A low current density is assumed to flow in the region to which the AC magnetic field has penetrated. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, the complete FC system must operate as efficiently as possible over the range of driving conditions that may be encountered while maintaining a low cost. To achieve this target, a storage unit can be introduced in the FC system to reduce the size of the fuel cell that is the most expensive component. This ""hybrid"" concept would not only reduce the drive train total cost but it also allow the recover of the braking energy and the operation at the voltage-current point of maximum efficiency for the FC system. Pro-and-cons of the ""full-power"" versus the ""hybrid"" configuration are shown in this work. The ""Hybridisation rate"" or ""Hybridisation degree"", a parameter expressed by the relationship between two installed powers, the generation power and the traction power, is also introduced and it is demonstrated that for each category of hybrid vehicles there is an optimal value of hybridisation degree. The storage systems considered are based on high power batteries or ultra capacitors (UCs) or a combination of them. A preliminary design of a sport utility vehicle (SUV) using a combined storage system and a FC energy source (called Triple Hybrid), is proposed.

The temperature- and frequency-insensitive damping and elasticity are of significance to extend the availability in the industrial uses. The irregular networks have been prepared by end-linking a mixture of bi- and monofunctional end-reactive precursor linear poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) chains with trifunctional cross-linker, or end-linking the bifunctional precursor chains with trifunctional cross-linker at off-stoichiometric ratios.

Svedberg Laboratory in Uppsala, Sweden. It is able to provide identity and momentum vector of up to 100 charged particles and fragments from proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at intermediate energies, 50-1000A MeV. All detector telescopes as well as the major part of electronic readout system are placed inside the target chamber in ultra-high vacuum (UHV, 10-9-10-7 Pa). This requires Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) microchip for the spectroscopic signal processing and the generation and transport of digital control signals. Eighteen telescopes, read out with chip-on-board technique by ceramics Mother Boards (MB) and corresponding 18 microchips are mounted on a 450 × 45 mm2 Grand Mother Board (GMB), processed on FR4 glass-fibre material. Each of these 28 GMB units contains a daisy-chain organisation of the VLSI chips and associated protection circuits. Analogue-to-digital conversion of the spectroscopic signals is performed on a board outside the chamber which is connected on one side to a power distribution board, directly attached to a UHV mounting flange, and on the other side to the VME-based data acquisition system (CHICSiDAQ). This in its turn is connected via a fibre-optic link to the general TSL acquisition system (SVEDAQ), and in this way data from auxiliary detector systems, read out in CAMAC mode, can be stored in coincidence with CHICSi data. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

There is not necessarily a sub-harmonic relation of two RFs between a linear accelerator and a circular accelerator. It is, however, indispensable to obtain a synchronous relation between both RFs and the timing of the gun trigger signal with the increasing beam current and shortening of beam time width from an electron gun in a linear accelerator. For a synchronous timing system in any electron accelerator facilities, there is no choice but to assemble a complicated system with the frequency dividers and multipliers in order to realize the synchronous relation between both RFs and the gun trigger signal. To simplify the complicated synchronous timing system, we have developed a new synchronization method for the RFs of both linear and circular accelerators. The new synchronization system has been installed into the synchrotron radiation facility, SPring-8 (Super Photon ring 8 GeV), which consists of a 1-GeV linac, an 8-GeV booster synchrotron and an 8-GeV storage ring. A 2856 MHz RF for the 1-GeV linac was generated by the 508.58 MHz RF of the 8-GeV storage ring with the new synchronous timing system, and the emission and acceleration under the condition of the shortening the beam time width in the linac was carried out. Since the synchronous relation between both the RFs and the gun trigger signal was realized by using the new synchronous timing system, the time jitter between the gun trigger signal and the RF phase of 2856 MHz was significantly reduced and resulted in beam energy stabilization. The new synchronous timing system has been used for usual beam operations at SPring-8. This timing system has achieved time jitters of 3.5 ps (rms) and beam energy stability of 0.009% (rms) under the condition of completely synchronized two RFs and the gun trigger signal. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Heat transfer model in the metal hydride bed based on the heat transfer mechanism for packed bed proposed by Kunii and co-workers is presented. The time-dependent hydrogen absorption/desorption rate and pressure in the metal hydride vessel calculated by the model were compared with the experimental results. During the hydriding, calculated hydrogen absorption rates agreed with measured ones. Calculated thermal equilibrium hydrogen pressures were slightly lower than the measured hydrogen pressures at the inlet of metal hydride vessel. Taking account of the pressure gradient between the inlet of metal hydride vessel and the metal hydride bed, it is considered that this discrepancy is reasonable. During the dehydriding, there were big differences between the calculated hydrogen desorption rates and measured ones. As calculated hydrogen desorption rates were lower than measured ones, there were big differences between the calculated thermal equilibrium hydrogen pressures and the measured hydrogen pressures at the inlet of metal hydride vessel. It is considered that those differences are due to the differences of the heat transfer characteristics such as thermal conductivity of metal hydride particles and porosity between the assumed and actual ones.

Cooling rate affected only weight loss and stalk quality. Hydro-cooling resulted in the lowest weight loss, possibly as a result of water uptake. Storage life was longer at 0°C than 2°C or higher, but 4°C was adequate for storage periods of up to 14 d. There were no consistent effects of the 16 combinations of 0, 5, 10 and 20% CO2 with 1, 2, 4 and 21% O2 and, overall, CA storage was not superior to air storage. Neither cooling rate nor CA storage affected the subsequent shelf-life at 10°C. Rotting was the major cause of loss during storage at 0°C and during shelf-life at 10°C or 20°C, and the extent increased during the shelf-life period, the longer storage at 0°C was prolonged. Respiration rate at 10°C was the same for samples previously stored at 0°C in air or 1% O2, but at 20°C the respiration rate was higher if the fruit had previously been stored in air. Fruit was more susceptible to bruising at 0°C than at 5°C, but the rate of increase in bruising with increasing impact energy was similar.

Since this actuator could be reversibly driven by hydrogen pressure control, it could function as a sensor and/or controller of the hydrogen gas flux in various hydrogen related devices. In the experiments, the incubation period of the actuation after hydrogen gas exposure was reduced from 100 to 10 s by the platinum surface treatment. This significantly modified mechanical response is attributed to a switching of the reaction rate determining steps. The platinum treatment enhanced the decomposition rate of hydrogen gas molecules at the surface. The platinum treatment should bring about a change of rate determining step to a permeation/diffusion of the hydrogen atoms into the film.","Actuator; Hydrogen storage alloy; LaNi5; Platinum; Thin film; Unimorph structure","Actuators; Decomposition; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Hydrogen; Platinum; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface treatment; X ray diffraction analysis; Hydrogen atoms; Hydrogen storage alloy; LaNi5; Unimorph structure; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9144270087

Eight prepubertal (PP), eight young adult (Y) and eight elderly (O) male subjects cycled at an intensity of 50 ± 1% of their maximum oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak) for 85 min (three 20 min bouts with three 7 min rest periods) in hot and dry conditions (41 ± 0.67°C, 21 ± 1% relative humidity). During the exercise-in-heat protocol, rectal temperature (Tre) skin temperatures (Tsk), heart rate (HR), V̇O2, V̇CO2, V̇E RER, sweat rate, and the number of heat activated sweat glands (HASG) were determined. Despite highest and lowest end-exposure Tre in the Y and O groups, respectively, the rise in rectal temperature (accounting for differences in baseline Tre) was similar in all age groups. Changes in body heat storage (ΔS), both absolute and relative to body mass, were highest in the Y and O groups and lowest in the PP group. While end-session as well as changes in mean skin temperature were similar in all three age groups, HR (absolute and percentage of maximum) was significantly lower for the O compared with the PP and Y groups. Total body as well as per body surface sweating rate was significantly lower for the PP group, while body mass-related net metabolic heat production ((M - W) kg-1) and heat gained from the environment were highest in the PP and lowest in the O group. Since mass-related evaporative cooling (Esk kg-1) and sweating efficiency (E sk/Msw kg-1) were highest in the PP and lowest in the O group, the mass-dependent heat stored in the body (ΔS kg -1) was lowest in the PP (1.87 ± 0.03 W kg-1) and highest in Y and O groups (2.19 ± 0.08 and 1.97 ± 0.11 W kg -1, respectively). Furthermore, it was calculated that while the O group required only 4.1 ± 0.5 W of heat energy to raise their body core temperature by 1°C, and the Y group needed 6.9 ± 0.9 W (1°C) -1, the PP group required as much as 12.3 ± 0.7 W to heat up their body core temperature by 1°C. These results suggest that in conditions similar to those imposed during this study, age and age-related characteristics affect the overall rate of heat gain as well as the mechanisms through which this heat is being dissipated. While prepubertal boys seem to be the most efficient thermoregulators, the elderly subjects appear to be the least efficient thermoregulators.",,"adolescent; adult; age; aged; article; controlled study; environmental temperature; exercise; heart rate; human; human experiment; humidity; male; normal human; oxygen consumption; rectum temperature; skin temperature; sweating; thermoregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844274080

Electric motor, inverter, and associated control technology has made substantial progress during the past decade and it is not the limiting factor to either vehicle performance or the large-scale production of hybrid vehicles. The search for a compact, lightweight, and efficient energy storage system that is both affordable and has acceptable life cycle remains the major roadblock to large-scale production of HEVs. This paper deals with an original HEV propulsion system that includes fuel cell generator and an energy storage system combining ultracapacitor tank and battery. The three on-board power sources supply the vehicle traction drive through a multi-input dc-to-dc power converter which provides the desired management of the power flows. In particular, in the proposed arrangement the ultracapacitor tank is used for leveling the battery load current during transients resulting from either acceleration or braking operation of the vehicle. The paper outlines the features of the dc-to-dc power converter being used in the proposed propulsion system. The control strategy adopted for power flow sharing among the on-board sources is described and main characteristics of a 35 kW prototype of the propulsion system jointly developed by ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Environment) and University ROMA TRE are depicted; both simulation and experimental results are presented.

The model consists of an oxygen storage sub-model and a kinetic reaction sub-model. Validation data for these models was recorded from a purpose-built catalyst flow reactor which uses O2 and NO as the oxidizing agents and CO, C 3H6 and C3H8 as the reducing agents. The main focus of the work is the oxygen storage sub-model and the identification of the relevant constants for the reaction kinetic equations. The procedure used for measuring the oxygen storage capacity, and the oxygen storage and release rates from ceria (CeO2), is presented and discussed. The activation energies and activity factors for all the oxidation and reduction components were also found from the apparatus and used in the model. The results show that, with the exception of the oxidation constant for O2, which is due, in part, to the interaction between ceria and platinum, the oxidation and reduction rate constants increase with increasing temperature. The relationship between ceria and platinum was investigated further by performing a second series of tests in the absence of platinum by using ceria powder.

Recently these have included the use of adaptive approaches. Such adaptive strategies attempt to alter the behavior of the HE power train based on the journey being undertaken. Unlike the journeys undertaken in personal vehicles, passenger buses often traverse the same unchanged route several times a day. If such a journey could be suitably modeled the model may then form part of an optimized control strategy. This paper describes the collection and analysis of a large number of bus journeys over a period of 10 months. Journey data was collected from a real route using a GPS receiver in conjunction with a handheld computer running bespoke logging software. A method has been developed to reduce each journey into a simple statistical representation based on power/energy use. This statistical model can then be used to demonstrate the variability between journeys on the same route for different conditions. These variations may then be used to adapt an existing 'normal' drive cycle of the journey to optimize the HE power train for the current conditions. Additionally the statistical model may be iterated with new data collected on route.

The total energy demand of electrical consumers in passenger cars is rising almost exponentially together with an increasing ratio of the peak to average current level. Such conditions can stimulate severe interactions between the various systems on the one hand, while on the other hand the battery charging state varies over a wide range. Recent field problems of high end cars from various vehicle manufacturers demonstrate the importance for an improved interaction analysis of the complete electrical system during the design phase and before the introduction of new functions. An efficient battery management is essential for modern vehicles to ensure a minimum state of charge and a proper lifetime of the battery. The electrical energy storage in hybrid vehicles which use the battery to buffer the combustion engine is even more important. An efficient energy management is mandatory in this context and affects directly both the gasoline consumption and the emissions. In order to address these concerns in the development and construction of the car electronics, detailed over-all simulations are necessary, which cover short-term high current dynamics as well as long-term time scales. The battery is the most important element in these systems, being the central energy storage device. For this reason, a new battery model was developed, which is able to simulate both the long-term and the high dynamic behavior of diverse battery technologies with high accuracy.

It is an optimization issue. Much work has been done in this field but a significant portion optimizes the component sizes and control strategy parameters separately. What's more, most work concerns single objective optimization although more than one objective is more common and natural in HEV optimization. This paper uses an advanced soft computing technique, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), one of the most efficient Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs), to optimize a parallel HEV's fuel economy and emissions including HC, CO, and NOx emissions simultaneously, instead of converting them into a single objective. The task is to find the trade-off solutions, namely, Pareto-optimal solutions, among the four objectives. In addition, three component sizing parameters and four control strategy parameters are treated as variables all together. The obtained set of optimal solutions demonstrates great success either in converging to the real Pareto front or in providing sufficiently diverse solutions. It is concluded that the MOEA serves as a useful guide in the HEV developing process, especially in the earlier phases, since it can furnish the developers with a somewhat comprehensive preview of the problem.

The exact number of vehicles involved in low-speed property-damage-only crashes is not known because many of these crashes are not reported to police or insurers. Nevertheless, data from U.S. automobile insurers indicate that the over-whelming majority of crashes producing vehicle damage occur at relatively low speeds. Each year more than 8 percent of recent model passenger vehicles have crash damage leading to insurance claims, with an average repair cost per claim of more than $3,000. The median damage amount is about $2,000, and the most common amount is in the $600 to $700 range. Furthermore, about 80 percent of the damage claims have no associated injury claims (Highway Loss Data Institute, 2003a, 2003b). These data show that low-speed crash damage constitutes a large portion of the total costs to U.S. society for repairing crashed passenger vehicles. These costs are huge; in 2003 more than $4 billion was spent to repair 2002 model vehicles alone. In the United Kingdom, insurers report the total annual cost of motor vehicle insurance is in the region of $10 billion. About 70 percent of these costs are related to damage repairs in low-speed crashes, with an average of $2,000 damage per incident (Association of British Insurers, 2002). Reducing vehicle damages in low-speed crashes could have a massive global financial benefit. Most of these relatively minor crashes involve damage to the fronts and rears of vehicles. Vehicle bumper systems should absorb the energy of these minor collisions, preventing damage to more expensive vehicle body parts. Unfortunately, although bumpers are designed to meet the minimum standards required by the regulatory body for their given market, they still can allow thousands of dollars of preventable damage in minor collisions. Existing test procedures provide no incentives for manufacturers to improve these bumper designs. There are four main test programs that evaluate vehicle bumper systems worldwide. In the United States, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA, 1977) has established a bumper standard for passenger cars that includes a series of car-into-barrier tests and subsequent pendulum tests on each vehicle. Barrier and pendulum impacts are conducted at 2.5 mi/h (4 km/h) on the full-width of the front and rear bumpers. Pendulum impacts also are conducted at 1.5 mi/h (2.4 km/h) on the corners of the bumpers. Although no damage to other parts of the vehicle is allowed from these impacts, unlimited damage is permitted to the bumper and its attachment hardware. The test pendulum impacts the vehicle at a height between 16 and 20 inches, effectively regulating the bumper heights of passenger cars. There is no NHTSA bumper standard for passenger vans, sport utility vehicles, or pickups. Regulatory tests in Canada are similar but with an impact speed of 5 mi/h (8 km/h) for the front and rear tests and 3 mi/h (4.8 km/h) for the corner impacts (Transport Canada, 1978) In Europe, vehicle manufacturers must comply with the bumper standard specified by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (1980). In this test, a profiled pendulum strikes a vehicle at a height of 15.25 to 19.75 inches with a speed of 2.5 mi/h (4 km/h) on the front and rear bumpers. A similar corner test is conducted at 1.6 mi/h (2.5 km/h). The standard does not dictate unacceptable amounts of bumper damage but only ensures the integrity of headlamps, turn signals, and steering controls. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS, 2002) has a consumer-information low-speed testing program designed to evaluate bumper performance based on the cost of repairing vehicle damage resulting from four test configurations. The four configurations are full-width front and rear impacts into a flat barrier, a front impact into an angled barrier, and a rear impact into a centered pole. All four tests are conducted at 5 mi/h (8 km/h). The first two configurations are patterned after the federal full-width impacts, whereas the latter two represent additional crash configurations that may be encountered in the real world. The Research Council for Automobile Repairs (RCAR, 1999) uses a fourth test procedure for assessing bumper designs. It consists of two tests evaluating bumper performance as well as how easily and cheaply any damage can be repaired. The tests are a 40 percent overlap front impact into a flat rigid barrier and a 40 percent overlap rear impact by a 1,000 kg mobile barrier. The test vehicle strikes the barrier at 15 km/h (9.3 mi/h) in the frontal test, and the moving barrier strikes the vehicle at the same speed in the rear test. The RCAR test program is used by several test houses in Europe, Asia, and South America. The Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre (Thatcham) in the United Kingdom uses the results from this test to rate vehicles for insurance pricing purposes. Although each of these test programs has its strengths and weaknesses, a limitation common to all four is the inability to test for the possibility of bumper override and underride. In real-world low-speed crashes, vehicles frequently underride or override other vehicle bumpers due to height mismatches. Even when bumper heights are relatively well matched and the bumpers initially engage, under/override still can occur due to inability of one or both bumpers to remain in position and stable during the crash. In 1999, IIHS conducted vehicle-to-vehicle tests that illustrate the bumper stability issue. In these tests, the front of a vehicle moving at 10 mi/h (16 km/h) struck the rear of a stationary vehicle of the same make and model. In the six tests, two models exhibited instability problems: the 1999 Ford Windstar overrode the rear bumper of its stationary partner, whereas the 1999 Saab 9-3 underrode the rear bumper of its partner (Figures 1-2). Evidence from real-world crashes confirms that bumper instability is a widespread and costly problem. Between November 2001 and February 2002, IIHS surveyed vehicles brought to five drive-in claims centers operated by insurers in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area (IIHS, unpublished data). Professional appraisers estimated the type and amount of damage for 509 vehicles (342 passenger cars) that were in relatively minor low-speed crashes. Approximately one-third of the passenger cars that collided with other vehicles experienced underride or override, and the associated damage was substantially higher for these vehicles. Two-thirds of the cars that struck SUVs sustained underride or override damage, whereas one-fifth of the cars that struck other cars sustained this type of damage. Passenger cars frequently underride SUVs because of height mismatches. However, the types and locations of the damage (such as vertical scrapes on the bumper covers) suggested that when underride or override occurred in car-to-car crashes it usually was after initial engagement of the bumpers. Thatcham conducted a survey in 1999 (Doyle, 2000), in which 1,500 real-world car-to-car impacts were assessed and the frequencies of common body part replacement and repair evaluated. Of 600 vehicles involved in frontal impacts, 86 percent required new bumper covers, 89 percent new headlamps, 42 percent new grilles, and 49 percent new hoods. Only 13 percent required any replacement of structural components such as front cross members, and 5 percent required replacement of frame rails. These findings suggest that during frontal crashes, there is a tendency for the striking car to underride the bumper of the other vehicle, causing more damage to cosmetic parts than to the structural elements typically damaged in low-speed damageability crash tests. Good engagement of structural items would likely cause more structural damage at frame height and less cosmetic damage above frame height. The instances of override and underride observed in car-to-car tests and the real-world data emphasize the prevalence of the bumper instability problem. Today's low-speed bumper assessment tests provide no incentives to vehicle manufacturers to address this problem. Positive test results against existing barriers and under current test conditions do not guarantee good bumper engagement in the real world. Test procedures are needed to evaluate a bumper's ability to remain in position during a crash. This paper describes initial tests designed to isolate the causes of bumper instability and to establish the requirements of a test procedure for evaluating this instability.

The electricity is passed to the national grid and the water returns to the river without delay or contamination. The ecological aspects of this form of abstraction mean that they are generally acceptable. Fisheries is one of several topics which requires close attention, and another is the consequences and effects brought about by changes to the flow regime. The purpose of this paper is to explore the interaction between those flows which are reduced (only some are affected) and the associated fishery issues. The effects of typical abstraction regimes on down-river hydrographs, and in particular on the magnitude and timing of flows, are explained in the context of the particularly variable conditions which occur in upland rivers, i.e. the preferred location for many so-called run-of-river hydroelectric schemes. The limited evidence which is available for migratory fish movement through such reaches is used to assess how these movements could be affected by typical abstraction regimes. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Abstraction policy; Fisheries; Hydro-electric power; Licensing; Power generation; Renewable energy; Riparian ecosystems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001083021

The proposed method enables the system to save fuel consumption by using PV energy effectively, reducing charge and discharge energy of the storage battery, and avoiding low-load operation of the DG. The PV power is simply predicted from a theoretical equation of solar radiation and the observed PV energy for a constant time before the prediction. The amount of fuel consumption of the proposed method is compared with that of other methods by a simulation based on measurement data of the PV power at an actual PV generation system for one year. The simulation results indicate that the amount of fuel consumption of the proposed method is smaller than that of any other methods, and is close to that of the ideal operation of the DG. © 2004, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Freshly harvested cassava roots were dipped in tap water and packed into polyethylene sacks in 2-kg batches and stored at room temperature (25°C ± 1°C). Samples of fresh cassava fufu were evaluated and then at two weekly intervals for a period of 8 weeks. Attributes evaluated were colour, smell, elasticity, smoothness and taste. A structured six-point ranking scale ranging from 6 (excellent) to 1 (very poor) was used for the evaluation. The data were analysed using analysis of variance, and the least significance difference test at P < 0.05 was used to determine differences between means. The results showed that storage of cassava roots for up to 8 weeks did not significantly affect the colour, smell, elasticity and taste of cassava fufu. However, smoothness of fufu prepared with cassava stored for 6 and 8 weeks was significantly different from the samples of the fresh cassava, and those stored for 2 and 4 weeks. It was concluded that cassava roots stored for periods up to 8 weeks in polyethylene sacks produced fufu of similar characteristics as fresh cassava fufu. This method is therefore recommended for use by homemakers, food service operators, cassava retailers and processors to save them time, energy and money used for the frequent trips for purchases.

The results show that the reaction rate accelerates when the reaction temperature increases and reaches its maximum at about 490 K, but if temperature is higher than 510 K, the reaction rate decreases rapidly. The whole reaction process is controlled by the reaction at the surface of the catalyst particles. The mass transfer resistance at gas-liquid interface and that from the bulk liquid phase to the surface of the catalyst particle can be neglected. The apparent reaction rate is zero order for toluene concentration and first order for hydrogen concentration in the liquid phase. The kinetic model is obtained . The kinetic model fits the experimental data very well.

Infants of semi-aquatic sea-gypsies swim before they walk, and have superior visual acuity compared with us. With adverse pregnancy behaviour (fear of fat, a trend to dieting), neglecting the need for brain fat to secure normal brain development and function, we run a risk of dysfunction - death. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome victims have depressed birth weight, lower levels of marine fat in brainstem than controls, and >80% suffer multiple hypoxic episodes prior to death. Depressed birth weight (more than 10% below mean) is seen in learning and behaviour disorders, and a trend towards weights of less than 3kg is increasing, which supports a rise in antenatal sub optimality. Given marine fat deficiency in pregnancy and infancy, neurons starved for fuel could delay myelination and maturation in the latest developed Frontal Lobes. The phylogenetic oldest Lateral Frontal Lobe System (feed-back mechanism etc.) derived from olfactory bulb-amygdala, which crosses in Anterior Commisure is probably spared, while the Medial Frontal Lobe System derived from Hippocampus-Cingulum and crosses in Corpus Callosum (delayed response task) is most likely affected. The rise in infantile autism (intact vision and hearing) with deficit in delayed response task only, could suggest a deficit in the Medial Frontal Lobe System. The human species is unique; 70% of total energy to the foetus goes to development of the brain, which mainly consists of marine fat. It undergoes pervasive regressive events, before birth, in infancy and at puberty. Minimal retraction of neuronal arborisation is advantageous. Attributable to adverse pregnancy-childrearing practice, excessive retraction is likely prenatally and in infancy. Pubertal age affects the fundamental property of nervous tissue, excitability: excessive excitatory drive is seen in early, and a deficiency in late puberty. It is postulated that with adequate marine fat, there is probably no risk of psychopathology at the extremes, whereas a deficiency could lead to paroxysmal (subcortical) dysfunction in early puberty, and breakdown of cortical circuitry and cognitive dysfunctions in late puberty. The post-pubertal psychoses, schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis at the extremes of the pubertal age continuum, with contrasting excitability and biological treatment, are probably the result of continuous dietary deficiency, which has inactivated the expression of genes for myelin development and oligodendrocyte-related genes in their production of myelin. The beneficial effect of marine fat in both disorders, in other CNS disorders as well as in developmental dyslexia (DD) and ADHD among others, supports our usual diet is persistently deficient. We have neglected the similarity of our great brain to other mammals, and our marine heritage. Given the amount of marine fat needed to secure normal brain development and function is not known, nor the present dietary level, it seems unduly conjectural to postulate that a dietary deficiency in marine fat is causing brain dysfunction and death. However, all observations point in the same direction: our diet focusing on protein mainly, is deficient, the deficiency is most pronounced in maternal nutrition and in infancy. Human nature is unique in a mismatch between what our brain needs and the usual diet.",,"brain derived neurotrophic factor; fat; myelin; n methyl dextro aspartic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; amygdaloid nucleus; attention deficit disorder; autism; behavior disorder; bipolar disorder; birth weight; brain development; brain dysfunction; brain function; brain region; brain stem; central nervous system disease; cognitive defect; corpus callosum; death; disease predisposition; dyslexia; energy; epigenetics; fat content; feedback system; fetus development; food intake; frontal lobe; gene expression; hearing acuity; hippocampus; human; hypoxia; infancy; learning disorder; lipid storage; maternal nutrition; mental disease; myelination; nerve cell; nerve cell excitability; nervous system development; nervous tissue; nutritional deficiency; olfactory bulb; oligodendroglia; pregnancy; prenatal period; protein synthesis; psychosis; puberty; review; risk assessment; schizophrenia; sensorimotor function; sudden infant death syndrome; swimming; visual acuity; walking aid; Mammalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7944230380

The opposed engine pistons reciprocate the hydraulic pump pistons directly and the hydraulic power to be used in the hydraulic motors is generated. The hydraulic pressure generated is substantially constant. The opposed free pistons rest after every gas cycle and hydraulic power is continuously supplied by a hydraulic accumulator during the free pistons' rest. The smaller the hydraulic flow output, the longer the duration of the rest. Every gas cycle is performed under a fixed working condition independent of hydraulic power output. The test results in this work indicate that the number of gas cycles per second of the free piston engine pump is directly proportional to hydraulic flow output. The opposed free pistons operate every 53.2 s when hydraulic flow output is 1.02cm3/s; at that time hydraulic power output is 0.0124 kW. Hydraulic thermal efficiency, the ratio of hydraulic energy produced to fuel energy consumed, has been measured in the range 0.0124 kW to 4.88 kW of hydraulic power output and it has become clear that hydraulic thermal efficiency in this range is constant. The measured value of hydraulic thermal efficiency is 31 per cent. It has been demonstrated that hydraulic thermal efficiency is kept constant even if hydraulic power output is very small.","Constant pressure system; Free piston engine; Fuel saving; Hydraulic power; Idling stop; Internal combustion engine; Opposed piston","Cost accounting; Energy storage; Fuel injection; Hydraulic motors; Optimization; Storage battery vehicles; Systems analysis; Constant pressure system; Free piston engine; Fuel saving; Hydraulic power; Idling stop; Opposed piston; Engine pistons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7544242634

This paper features the following points; 1) firstly quantified how much important is avoiding any additional process cost and area penalty rather than reducing the area of memory cell itself from the chip cost point of view for the new SoC applications. CMOS FUSE can provide cost-competitive than the high-density NV memories (50-fold higher density with 20% additional cost relative to CMOS FUSE) in the capacity range of ≦ 200 kbit for the SoC occupied the logic area of 40 mm2. 2) firstly discussed in detail how much the differential cell architecture can. change a data retention characteristics including an activation energy (Ea), failure-rate, and tail-bits issues relative to the conventional one based on the measured data of 0.13μm devices. Based on the measured data, retention characteristics at 300°C, 250°C, and 200°C, it is found that the proposed differential approach makes it possible to increase Ea by 1.5 times (from 1.52 eV to 2.23 eV), which means it can be expected to realize a 20000-fold longer data retention characteristics at 105°C. Even if considering the tail-bit issues for mass-production, an over 700-fold longer data, retention characteristics at 105°C can be expected while keeping the same failure rate (0.01 ppm) relative to the conventional OR-logical architecture. No significant V t shifts (≦ 140 mV and ≦ 200 mV) were observed even after applying surge stress of +2200V from I/O pad and 1000-times cycling of write and erase operations, respectively. In addition, 1024-bit CMOS-FUSE module has been embedded in the SoC without any additional area penalty by being laid out just beneath the power ring for SRAM macro and the stable memory read operation was verified at VDD=1.0 V under a severe I/O switching noise and an unstable VDD/GND condition in the power up sequence.","CMOS compatible; Data retention; Fuse; Nonvolatile memory","Computer architecture; Computer system recovery; Data processing; Formal logic; Random access storage; Switching; CMOS compatible fuses; Data retention; Differential cell architecture; Fuses; Nonvolatile memory; CMOS integrated circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7544238819

The technique, referred to as “multiple load aggregation algorithm” (or MLAA), uses two major thermal history periods, referred to as “past” and “immediate.” In addition, the MLAA accounts for thermal interference among boreholes by numerically solving the two-dimensional temperature field in the borefield. Results of a comparison between the MLAA and the duct storage (DST) model are presented. Several cases are examined with two different borefields and several load profiles. Results obtained for one- and ten-year simulations show that the MLAA is in very good agreement with the DST model. In the worst case, the maximum difference in fluid temperature is of the order of 2 K (3.6°F).

In order to decrease storage volumes and energy consumption for yellow water transport to fields, enrichment of nutrients in yellow water has to be considered. Laboratory-scale batch freeze concentration of yellow water has been tested in ice-front freezing apparatus: a stirred vessel and a falling film freeze concentrator (coolant temperatures: -6 to -16°C). With progressing enrichment of the liquid concentrate, the frozen ice was increasingly contaminated with yellow water constituents (ammonia, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, TOC, and salts determined as conductivity). The higher the initial salinity of the yellow water and the lower the mechanical agitation of the liquid phase contacting the growing ice front, the more the frozen ice was contaminated. The results indicate, that in ice-front freezing devices multistage processes are necessary, i.e. the melted ice phase has to be purified (and the concentrates must be further enriched) in a second or even in a third stage. Energy consumption of this process is very high. However, technical scale suspension freeze concentration is reasonable in centralized ecological sanitation schemes if the population exceeds 0.5 million and distance of yellow water transportation to fields is more than 80 km. © IWA Publishing 2004.","Ecological sanitation; Energy consumption; Freeze concentration; Nutrients; Yellow water","Bioreactors; Body fluids; Contamination; Coolants; Ecology; Energy utilization; Freezing; Freeze concentration; Salinity; Yellow water; Wastewater treatment; ammonia; fertilizer; nitrogen; phosphorus; sodium chloride; Freezing; nutrient; toilet; Wastewater treatment; article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; domestic waste; energy consumption; freezing; low temperature procedures; salinity; sanitation; urine; waste water management; waste water recycling; water transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7244221750

Fatigue is closely associated with depletion of the limited stores of carbohydrate in the muscle and in the liver. Therefore, it is not surprising that strategies have been developed to ensure that not only are the carbohydrate stores well stocked before exercise but that they are also restored as soon as possible after exercise. Consuming carbohydrate immediately after exercise increases the rate of muscle glycogen resynthesis and also results in greater endurance capacity during subsequent exercise. A recovery diet that is high in carbohydrate (~10 g kg-1 body mass/day) will allow athletes to restore their exercise capacity on the following day, which is not the case when they eat a mixed diet with matching energy content. The type of carbohydrate in the recovery diet also has an influence on endurance capacity the following day. A recovery diet that contains low glycaemic index carbohydrates result in a higher rates of fat oxidation and greater endurance running capacity than diets that are contain mainly high glycaemic index carbohydrate foods.

The physical changes that occur during puberty are mediated, in part, through sex steroids, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and leptin. However, data are lacking that address the extent to which concentrations of these hormones influence body composition, bone mass, and density in prepubertal children. Objective: We investigated the effects of IGF-I, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and sex steroids on body composition and fat distribution and the effects of these hormones and leptin on total body bone mineral content (TBMC) and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at the femoral neck and lumbar spine (LS) in 255 healthy children (137 girls), aged 7-8 y. Design: Body composition, fat distribution, TBMC, and vBMD were derived by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Association between variables was examined by using regression analysis. Results: No sex differences were found in age, height, or weight. However, girls had significantly more total body fat, trunk fat, and higher LS vBMD but significantly less fat-free soft tissue, TBMC, and femoral neck vBMD than did boys. Girls also had significantly (P < 0.001) higher IGF-I, estradiol, testosterone, and leptin concentrations than did boys. Estradiol concentrations predicted percentage body fat, which supported an effect of estrogen on fat storage. Leptin had an independent effect on LS vBMD, which suggests a positive effect for leptin on trabecular bone. Conclusions: The hormones examined explained 3-17% of the variations in body-composition measures, fat distribution, and bone density, which suggests that other factors are important predictors of prepubertal sexual dimorphism. © 2004 American Society for Clinical Nutrition.","Body composition; Bone density; Estradiol; Fat distribution; Leptin; Prepubertal children; Testosterone","estradiol; hormone; leptin; prasterone sulfate; sex hormone; somatomedin C; testosterone; leptin; prasterone; sex hormone; somatomedin C; absorptiometry; article; body composition; body fat; body height; body weight; bone density; bone mass; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; femur neck; human; lipid storage; lumbar spine; male; normal human; prepuberty; regression analysis; school child; sex difference; sex role; statistical significance; trabecular bone; X ray; adipose tissue; blood; bone density; bone mineralization; child; lumbar vertebra; metabolism; physiology; puberty; radiodensitometry; sexual development; spine; Adipose Tissue; Body Composition; Bone Density; Calcification, Physiologic; Child; Dehydroepiandrosterone; Densitometry, X-Ray; Estradiol; Female; Femur Neck; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Leptin; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Puberty; Sex Characteristics; Spine; Testosterone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5144231436

Italia 3318, 1160, Montevideo, Uruguay","Sensory systems must solve the inverse problem of determining environmental events based on patterns of neural activity in the central nervous system that are affected by those environmental events. Different environmental events can give rise to indistinguishable patterns of neural activity, so that there will often, perhaps even always, be multiple solutions to a sensory inverse problem. Imaging strategies and brain organization confine these multiple solutions within a bounded set. Three different active strategies may be employed by animals to constrain the number of solutions to the sensory inverse problem: active generation of the energy (carrier) that stimulates receptors; reorientation of the point of view; and control of signal conditioning before transduction (pre-receptor mechanisms). This paper describes how these strategies are used in sensory-motor systems, using electric fish as a paradigmatic example. Carrier generation and receptor tuning to the carrier improve signal to noise ratio. Receptor tuning to different frequency bands of the carrier spectrum allows a sensory system to evaluate different kinds of carrier modulations and to extract the different features of objects in the environment. Pre-receptor mechanisms condition the signals, optimizing their detection at a foveal region where the sensory resolution is maximum. Active orientation of the sensory surface redirects the fovea to explore in detail the source of interesting signals. Sensory input generated by these active exploration mechanisms ('reafference') has two components: one, necessary, derived from the self-generated actions and another, contingent, consisting of the information obtained from the external world. Extracting environmental information ('exafference') requires that the self generated afference be subtracted from the sensory inflow. Such subtraction is often associated with the generation and storage of expectations about sensory inputs. It can be concluded that an animal's perceptual world and its ability to transform the world are inextricably linked. Understanding sensory systems must, therefore, always require understanding the organization of motor behavior. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Both solidus and liquidus temperatures increase as Sb additions increase. Adding 1.5wt.%Sb leads to the narrowest range (6.6°C) between the solidus and liquidus temperature of the solder. Adding Sb decomposes the as-soldered ringlike microstructure of Sn3.5Ag and causes solid-solution hardening. The as-soldered hardness increases with increasing Sb addition. For long-term storage, adding Sb reduces the size of the rodlike Ag3Sn compounds. The hardness also increases with increasing Sb addition. Adding Sb depresses the growth rate of interfacial intermetallic compounds (IMCs) layers, but the difference between 1% and 2% Sb is not distinct. For mechanical concern, adding Sb improves both adhesive strength and thermal resistance of Sn3.5Ag, where 1.5% Sb has the best result. However, adding Sb causes a variation in adhesive strength during thermal storage. The more Sb is added, the higher the variation reveals, and the shorter the storage time requires. This strength variation helps the solder joints to resist thermal storage.","Adhesive strength; Intermetallic compound; Microstructure; Sn-Ag-Sb solder; Solidus and liquidus temperature; Thermal storage","Activation energy; Antimony; Eutectics; Heat resistance; Intermetallics; Microstructure; Tin alloys; Adhesive strength; Hot dipping; Thermal storage; Soldered joints",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4944238663

The release of glycerol and free fatty acids from human adipose tissue is mainly dependent on hormone-sensitive lipase which is intensively regulated by hormones and agents, such as insulin (inhibition of lipolysis) and catecholamines (stimulation of lipolysis). A special attention is paid to the recently discovered perilipins which could regulate the activity of the lipase hormono-sensible. Most of the plasma triacylglycerols are provided by dietary lipids, secreted from the intestine in the form of chylomicron or from the liver in the form of VLDL. Released into circulation as non-esterified fatty acids by lipoprotein lipase, those are taken up by adipose tissue via specific plasma fatty acid transporters (CD36, FATP, FABPpm) and used for triacylglycerol synthesis. A small part of triacylglycerols is synthesized into adipocytes from carbohydrates (lipogenesis) but its regulation is still debated in human. Physiological factors such as dieting/fasting regulate all these metabolic pathways, which are also modified in pathological conditions e.g. obesity.","Free fatty acids; Hormone-sensitive lipase; Lipogenesis; Lipolysis; Perilipin; Triacylglycerols","acyl coenzyme A; carbohydrate; carrier protein; catecholamine; CD36 antigen; chylomicron; fatty acid; fatty acid binding protein; fatty acid transporter; glucose; glycerol; glycerophosphate; hormone sensitive lipase; insulin; lipid; lipoprotein; lipoprotein lipase; perilipin; phosphoprotein; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; very low density lipoprotein; diet restriction; fat intake; gluconeogenesis; hormonal regulation; human; intestine absorption; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; lipoprotein synthesis; liver metabolism; obesity; postabsorptive state; postprandial state; review; starvation; white adipose tissue",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644356398

When operating in the doubly fed mode (DFIM), with the rotor fed by a variable frequency power converter, the WRIM behaves as a synchronous machine, differing from the latter in the variable speed operation and larger dumping effect when subjected to disturbances. As the converter only needs to be designed to handle a fraction of the total power, the system can be used at a high level of power.

The determination of ATCase activity, energy reserves levels and maturation stages were done in gonads of clams. Results showed that the seasonal cycle of storage and utilization of energy reserves in gonads of clams are linked to the bimodal reproduction well known in this bivalve. ATCase activity was high in clams at development and ripe stages, while this activity was low for individuals found in indifferent, spawning or spent stages. This difference can be explained by the fact that during gonad development, gonadal synthetic activity increased following the mitotic events associated to the reproductive cycle. The results presented in this paper have confirmed the link between ATCase activity and gametogenesis in M. arenaria. Further work should be realized in order to assess if ATCase activity could be considered as a potential biomarker to evaluate the disruption of sexual maturation in clams collected in sites such as the St. Lawrence estuary. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Both species showed an increase of amino acids and protein content in the gonad throughout sexual maturation (namely in oogenesis), but allocation of these nitrogen compounds from the digestive gland and muscle was not evident. The major essential amino acids in the three tissues were leucine, lysine and arginine. The major non-essential amino acids were glutamic acid, aspartic acid and alanine. With respect to carbon compounds, a significant increasing trend (P < 0.05) in the lipid and fatty acid contents in the three tissues was observed, and, consequently, there was also little evidence of accumulated lipid storage reserves being used for egg production. It seems that for egg production both Octopus species use energy directly from food, rather than from stored products. This direct acquisition model contrasts with the previous model for Octopus vulgaris proposed by O'Dor and Wells (1978: J Exp Biol 77:15-31). Most of saturated fatty acid content of the three tissues was presented as 16:0 and 18:0, monounsaturated fatty acid content as 18:1 and 20:1 and polyunsaturated fatty acid content as arachidonic acid (20:4n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3). Though cholesterol is an important precursor of steroid hormones, this sterol content exhibited variations that do not seem to be related with the maturation process. Moreover, significant differences (P < 0.05) were obtained between genders, suggesting that perhaps there is a greater physiological demand for cholesterol during spermatogenesis than oogenesis. If the component sterols of octopus are of a dietary origin, considerable variation in the cholesterol content between species might be expected on the basis of the sterol composition of their prey. The glycogen reserves increased significantly in the gonad and decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in the digestive gland and muscle of O. vulgaris (these trends were not evident in O. defilippi). Glycogen may play an important role in the maturation process and embryogenesis of these organisms, because carbohydrates are precursors of metabolic intermediates in the production of energy. It was evident that sexual maturation had a significant effect upon the gonad energy content, but the non-significant energy variation (P > 0.05) in the digestive gland and muscle revealed no evidence that storage reserves are transferred from tissue to tissue. The biochemical composition of digestive gland and muscle may not be influenced by sexual maturation, but rather by other biotic factors, such as feeding activity, food availability, spawning and brooding. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"amino acid; biochemical composition; cephalopod; lipid; maturation; protein; Cephalopoda; Cephalopoda; Mollusca; Octopus; Octopus defilippi; Octopus defilippi; Octopus vulgaris; Octopus vulgaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644239685

We target multimedia applications where a slight buffering delay is tolerable within a latency constraint. We modify the state transition and queue handling mechanism of multi-task scheduling in the kernel. In experiments, our algorithms achieve up to 44% of energy consumption saving for EDF scheduling and 49% for RM scheduling with realistic task set configurations and reasonable machine specifications.","Dynamic Voltage Scaling; Real-Time Systems; Scheduling","Algorithms; Buffer storage; Electric potential; Energy efficiency; Multimedia systems; Multitasking; Dynamic voltage scaling; Fixed priority algorithms; Process management; Real time systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544378808

We capitalize on the large occurrence of these operands in multimedia programs to build static narrow-width regions that may be directly exposed to the compiler. We propose to augment the ISA with instructions directly exposing the datapath and the register widths to the compiler. Simple exception management allows this exposition to be only speculative. In this way, we permit the software to speculatively accommodate the execution of a program on a narrower datapath-width in order to save energy. For this purpose, we introduce a novel register file organization, the byte-slice register file, which allows the width of the register file to be dynamically reconfigured, providing both static and dynamic energy savings. We show that by combining the advantages of the byte-slice register file with the advantages provided by clock-gating the datapath on a per-region basis, up to 17% of the datapath dynamic energy can be saved, while a 22% reduction of the register file static energy is achieved.","Clock-gating; Compiler; Energy management; Narrow-width regions; Reconfigurable computing; Speculative execution","Algorithms; Buffer storage; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Power control; Program processors; Real time systems; Clock gating; Narrow width regions; Reconfigurable computing; Speculative execution; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544279716

An acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans strain ANYL-1 was successfully isolated from the sludge collected from a wastewater treatment plant at Yuen Long district in Hong Kong. It was a Gram negative, non-motile rod shaped bacterium which used ferrous iron, elemental sulfur or thiosulfate as energy source, but did not utilize tetrathionate or glucose as energy source. The optimal temperature and pH for its growth and iron oxidation were 30-35°C and pH 2.0-2.5, respectively. When it was used in the bioleaching of anaerobically digested sewage sludge, an inhibition on metal solubilization was observed in fresh sludge except for Zn whose dissolution was solely a chemical process. Compared to the 3 and 4 days required for solubilization of Cu and Cr respectively from the sludge sample collected after the sludge holding tank (Sludge SHT), 6 days were required to bioleach Cu and Cr from fresh sludge (Sludge AD). The fresh sewage sludge posed an unfavorable condition for bioleaching of heavy metals from anaerobically digested sludge as reflected by the prolonged bioleaching time. Therefore, further studies were needed to understand the inhibitory effects in the fresh anaerobically digested sludge and develop measures to remove it in order to improve the heavy metal bioleaching efficiency. © Selper Ltd, 2004.","Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans; Anaerobic digester; Heavy metals; Sewage sludge; Sludge holding tank","Anaerobic digestion; Bacteria; Bioleaching; Chromium; Copper; Heavy metals; Land fill; Sewage sludge; Sewage treatment plants; Solubility; Tanks (containers); Wastewater treatment; Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans; Anaerobic digester; Anaerobically digested sewage sludge; Anaerobically digested sludges; Holding tank; Iron oxidizing bacteria; Metal solubilization; Wastewater treatment plants; Chemicals removal (water treatment); chromium; copper; element; ferrous ion; glucose; heavy metal; iron; sulfur; tetrathionic acid; thiosulfate; zinc; anaerobic process; bacterium; digestion; heavy metal; Leaching; sludge; Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans; anaerobic digestion; article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterium isolation; bioleaching; controlled study; dissolution; energy resource; Gram negative bacterium; Hong Kong; native species; nonhuman; oxidation; pH; sludge; sludge digestion; solubilization; storage; temperature; time; waste water treatment plant; Acidithiobacillus; Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans; Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544261048

The most common semi-intensive configuration used in Israel is made of anaerobic ponds followed by aerated lagoons. These small low-energy units remove about 75-80% of the BOD and are followed by wastewater reservoirs for storage and complementary treatment. The reduction in loading allows a flexible operation of the reservoirs for the removal of other pollutants, while providing storage capacity to cope with the changes in water demand for irrigation during the year. In schemes for wastewater reuse in irrigation, this lay-out has proved to be low-cost, low-energy, flexible, reliable and efficient. Variations of this basic configuration are the use of UASB reactors instead of anaerobic ponds, aerated lagoons in series or low-rate trickling filters instead of aerated lagoons, constructed wetlands or rock-filters for algae removal, etc. Semi-intensive technologies use less energy than intensive ones, and less land than extensive ones.

Based on the results of energy transfer efficiency and upconversion fluorescence spectra, the optimal Yb3+-Er3+ concentration ratio is found to be 5:1. Intense green and red emissions centered at 525, 546, and 657 nm, corresponding to the transitions 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, S3/2 → 4I 15/2 and 2F9/2 → 4I 15/2. respectively, were observed at room temperature. The quadratic dependence of the 525, 546, and 657 nm emissions on excitation power indicates that a two-photon absorption process occurs under 975 nm excitation.

Institute, Aston University, Birmingham, B4 7ET, United Kingdom","Causative factors: Nutritional supplementation or pharmacological manipulation of appetite are unable to control the muscle atrophy seen in cancer cachexia. This suggests that tumour and/or host factors might be responsible for the depression in protein synthesis and the increase in protein degradation. An increased expression of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway is responsible for the increased degradation of myofibrillar proteins in skeletal muscle, and this may be due to tumour factors, such as proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF), or host factors such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In humans loss of adipose tissue is due to an increase in lipolysis rather than a decrease in synthesis, and this may be due to tumour factors such as lipid-mobilising factor (LMF) or TNF-α, both of which can increase cyclic AMP in adipocytes, leading to activation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Levels of mRNA for HSL are elevated twofold in adipose tissue of cancer patients, while there are no changes in lipoprotein lipase (LPL), involved in extraction of fatty acids from plasma lipoproteins for storage. Treatment for cachexia: This has concentrated on increasing food intake, although that alone is unable to reverse the metabolic changes. Agents interfering with TNF-α have not been very successful to date, although more research is required in that area. The only agent tested clinically that is able to interfere with the action of PIF is eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA attenuates protein degradation in skeletal muscle by preventing the increased expression of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, but has no effect on protein synthesis. When used alone EPA prevents further wasting in cachectic patients, and, when it is combined with an energy- and protein-dense nutritional supplement, weight gain is seen, which is totally lean body mass. These results suggest that mechanistic studies into the causes of cancer cachexia will allow appropriate therapeutic intervention.","Cancer cachexia; Cytokines; Eicosapentaenoic acid; Muscle wasting; Proteolysis-inducing factor","fatty acid; hormone sensitive lipase; icosapentaenoic acid; muscle protein; proteasome; tumor necrosis factor alpha; ubiquitin; adipose tissue; anorexia; appetite; article; cachexia; diet supplementation; food intake; human; lean body weight; muscle atrophy; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein synthesis; skeletal muscle; wasting syndrome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344697232

Additionally the determination of thermal parameters of rocks plays an important role in the activities of geothermal energy production, energy storage and radioactive waste disposal. These activities require the determination of thermal conductivity coefficient of rocks especially around underground openings. This paper deals with the results of the variation of thermal conductivity of rocks with uniaxial and triaxial stress at the laboratory scale. In this way, it is possible to see the difference between thermal conductivity coefficient values under uniaxial and triaxial stress and to draw the conclusions necessary to be taken into consideration for heat flow calculations. To this end, rock specimens have been tested via a new device developed by authors. The results obtained from the tests performed with this device, as given in the related plots, show that the thermal conductivity coefficients determined are suitable for use to support design analyses. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the possible explanations for this phenomenon is that the spermatozoa actively catabolize adenine nucleotides. A relatively high rate of such catabolism could then contribute to the low ATP concentration and low adenylate energy charge observed in the spermatozoa in vitro. To check this hypothesis, we investigated ATP content and adenine nucleotide catabolism in African catfish spermatozoa stored at 4°C in the presence of glycine as an energetic substrate. Our results indicate that the storage of African catfish sperm at 4°C in the presence of glycine causes time-dependent ATP depletion. In contrast to ATP, the AMP content increases significantly during the same period of sperm storage, while the ADP increases only slightly. Moreover, a significant increase of inosine and hypoxanthine content was also found. Hypoxanthine was accumulated in the storage medium, but xanthine was found neither in spermatozoa nor in the storage medium. It indicates that hypoxanthine is not converted to xanthine, probably due to lack of xanthine oxidase activity in catfish spermatozoa. Present results suggest that adenine nucleotides may be converted to hypoxanthine according to the following pathway: ATP→ADP→AMP (adenosine/IMP)→inosine→hypoxanthine. Moreover, hypoxanthine seems to be the end product of adenine nucleotide catabolism in African catfish spermatozoa. In conclusion, our results suggest that a relatively high rate of adenine nucleotide catabolism contributes to the low ATP concentration and low adenylate energy charge observed in African catfish spermatozoa in vitro. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The adsorption pair is silicagel + water. The machine does not contain any moving parts, does not consume any mechanical energy except for experimental purposes and is relatively easy to manufacture. Cylindrical tubes function as both the adsorber system and the solar collector (flat-plate, 2 m2 double glazed); the condenser is air-cooled (natural convection) and the evaporator contains 40 l of water that can freeze. This ice functions as a cold storage for the cabinet (320 l). The first tests (September 2000) showed a very promising performance, with a gross solar cooling COPSR of 0.19. After minor modifications, a second test series was carried out during summer 2001. This test series shows how the external parameters influence the machine with respect to the COPSR (irradiation and external temperature). The latter varies between 0.10 and 0.25 with a mean value of 0.16. These values are higher than those obtained by earlier solar powered refrigerators (0.10-0.12).

The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of two levels of insulinaemia on glucose metabolism and energy expenditure in septic patients and volunteers. METHODS: Glucose uptake, oxidation and storage, and energy expenditure were measured, using indirect calorimetry, in 20 stable septic patients and 10 volunteers in a two-step hyperinsulinaemic (serum insulin levels 250 and 1250 mIU/l), euglycaemic (blood glucose concentration 5 mmol/l) clamp. Differences between steps of the clamp (from serum insulin 1250 to 250 mIU/l) for all parameters were calculated for each individual, and compared between septic patients and volunteers using the Wilcoxon nonpaired test. RESULTS: Differences in glucose uptake and storage were significantly less in septic patients. The differences in glucose oxidation between the groups were not statistically significant. Baseline energy expenditure was significantly higher in septic patients, and there was no significant increase in either step of the clamp in this group; when comparing the two groups, the differences between steps were significantly greater in volunteers. CONCLUSION: A hyperdynamic state of sepsis leads to a decrease in glucose uptake and storage in comparison with healthy volunteers. An increase in insulinaemia leads to an increase in all parameters of glucose metabolism, but the increases in glucose uptake and storage are significantly lower in septic patients. A high level of insulinaemia in sepsis increases glucose uptake and oxidation significantly, but not energy expenditure, in comparison with volunteers.",,"glucose; insulin; adult; aged; APACHE; article; blood; calorimetry; case control study; comparative study; drug effect; energy metabolism; glucose blood level; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; intravenous drug administration; metabolism; middle aged; oxygen consumption; sepsis; Adult; Aged; APACHE; Blood Glucose; Calorimetry; Case-Control Studies; Energy Metabolism; Glucose; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Insulin; Intensive Care Units; Middle Aged; Oxygen Consumption; Sepsis; Severity of Illness Index",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344595387

The excellent settling characteristics of aerobic granular sludge allow the design of very compact wastewater treatment plants. In laboratory experiments, high oxygen concentrations were needed to obtain stable granulation. However, in order to obtain energy efficient aeration and good denitrification low oxygen concentrations would be required. From earlier research on biofilm morphology, it was learned that slow growing organisms influence the density and stability of biofilms positively. To decrease the growth rate of the organisms in the aerobic granules, easily degradable substrate (e.g. acetate) has to be converted to slowly degradable COD like microbial storage polymers (e.g. PHA). Phosphate or glycogen accumulating bacteria perform this conversion step most efficiently. In this paper it is shown that the selection of such bacteria in aerobic granules indeed led to stable granular sludge, even at low oxygen concentrations. © IWA Publishing 2004.","Aerobic granular sludge; Growth rate; Oxygen concentration; SBR; Stability","Biofilms; Degradation; Oxygen; Sewage sludge; Wastewater treatment; Aerobic granules; Slow growing organisms; Water analysis; glycogen; phosphate; polymer; activated sludge; aerobic process; Chemical oxygen demand; pollutant removal; sequencing batch reactor; settling; wastewater treatment plant; aeration and oxygenation; airlift reactor; article; bacterium; biofilm; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; density; energy; growth rate; laboratory test; methodology; microorganism; nonhuman; oxygen concentration; sludge digestion; sludge stabilization; waste water treatment plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344584167

The photospheric magnetic configuration consists of two main polarities (dipolar structure) with some emerged new polarities, similar to a quadrupolar structure, during the event. The coronal loops in soft X-ray and EUV images show the signature of the loop interaction, i.e., the storage of the magnetic energy. The radio bursts at 1 -2 GHz were observed with fast frequency drifts with bidirectional drift pairs, which may provide a direct signature of upward and downward particle acceleration from the reconnection site, followed by the bulk energy release of the flare. After that, the soft X-ray and EUV loops were suddenly opened and closed again in 10 min. The open time is around the maximum phase of the flare as well as the start time of the associated CME. Meanwhile, the polarization sense of the microwave bursts suddenly reversed at 2.6-3.8 GHz, which might have been caused by the fast variation of coronal loops or the magnetic field. The high-time-resolution (8 ms) data show the microwave bursts at 2.6-3.8 GHz, with slow frequency drifts and zebra structures in the initial phase of the CMEs or shock formation. Hence it is suggested that flares and CMEs may be triggered simultaneously by some MHD instabilities or by reconnection in a favorable magnetic configuration to release the free magnetic energy in two different ways.

It quickly became apparent to the medical community that images with improved information content, whose display characteristics could be manipulated by the viewer, provided many advantages. Subsequently, digital systems for subtraction angiography and later for conventional projection radiography and fluoroscopy were developed. The timing of the introduction of these systems was highly dependent on the readiness of certain key component technologies to meet the requirements of each of these applications. These components are the x-ray detectors, analog to digital converters, computers, data storage systems, high-resolution electronic displays, and printers used in image acquisition, storage, and display. Mammography represents one of the most demanding radiographic applications, simultaneously requiring excellent contrast sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and wide dynamic range at as low of a radiation dose to the breast as is reasonably achievable while meeting the other requirements.

These cells are located in brown adipose tissue (BAT) depots which are found in abundance in small mammals as well as in newborns of larger mammals, including humans. Brown adipocytes comprise a very large number of mitochondria packed with cristae and are densely innervated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Sympathetic nerve endings release noradrenaline (NA) in the proximity of brown fat cells, where noradrenaline activates G-protein-coupled β-adrenergic receptors (AR) and by doing so initiates a cascade of metabolic events culminating in the activation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Uncoupling protein 1 is a unique feature of brown adipocytes that allows for the generation of heat upon sympathetic nervous system stimulation. It is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion, where uncoupling protein 1 uncouples the oxidation of fuel from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The expression of uncoupling protein 1 is strongly induced by cold exposure, revealing the importance of this uncoupling protein in thermoregulation. The thermoregulatory role of uncoupling protein 1 has been emphasized in uncoupling protein 1-deficient mice, whose resistance to cold is impaired. Uncoupling protein 1 expression is modulated by diet and metabolic hormones such as leptin and glucocorticoids, which suggests that the protein is a player in energy balance regulation.

Through successive steps, radiation fields are simulated, producing source Phase Space Data (PSD) that enable a dose calculation with good accuracy. Narrow photon beams used in radiosurgery can also be simulated by MC codes. However, the poor efficiency in simulating these narrow photon beams produces PSD whose quality prevents calculating dose with the required accuracy. To overcome this difficulty, a multiple source model was developed that enhances the quality of the reconstructed PSD, reducing also the time and storage capacities. This multiple source model was based on the full MC simulation, performed with the MC code MCNP4C, of the Siemens Mevatron KD2 (6 MV mode) linear accelerator head and additional collimators. The full simulation allowed the characterization of the particles coming from the accelerator head and from the additional collimators that shape the narrow photon beams used in radiosurgery treatments. Eight relevant photon virtual sources were identified from the full characterization analysis. Spatial and energy distributions were stored in histograms for the virtual sources representing the accelerator head components and the additional collimators. The photon directions were calculated for virtual sources representing the accelerator head components whereas, for the virtual sources representing the additional collimators, they were recorded into histograms. All these histograms were included in the MC code, DPM code and using a sampling procedure that reconstructed the PSDs, dose distributions were calculated in a water phantom divided in 20000 voxels of 1 × 1 × 5 mm3. The model accurately calculates dose distributions in the water phantom for all the additional collimators; for depth dose curves, associated errors at 2σ were lower than 2.5% until a depth of 202.5 mm for all the additional collimators and for profiles at various depths, deviations between measured and calculated values were less than 2.5% or 1 mm. © 2004 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","Monte Carlo; Radiosurgery; Source modeling","Digital storage; Graphic methods; Particle beams; Phantoms; Phase space methods; Photoelectrons; Photons; Radiotherapy; Calculated values; Dose calculation; Dose distributions; Energy distributions; Poor efficiencies; Radiosurgery; Sampling procedures; Source modeling; Monte Carlo methods; article; beam therapy; collimator; computer simulation; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic error; dosimetry; energy; image quality; image reconstruction; linear accelerator; mathematical computing; Monte Carlo method; multiple source model; particle size; phantom; photon; priority journal; radiation depth dose; radiation field; radiosurgery; radiotherapy; virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043060982

Wheat seeds that were developing at ambient oxygen (21%) were found to be hypoxic (2.1%). Altering the oxygen supply by decreasing or increasing the external oxygen concentration induced parallel changes in the internal oxygen tension. However, the decrease in internal concentration was proportionally less than the reduction in external oxygen. This indicates that decreasing the oxygen supply induces short-term adaptive responses to reduce oxygen consumption of the seeds. When external oxygen was decreased to 8%, internal oxygen decreased to approximately 0.5% leading to a decrease in energy production via respiration. Conversely, increasing the external oxygen concentration above ambient levels increased the oxygen content as well as the energy status of the seeds, indicating that under normal conditions the oxygen supply is strongly limiting for energy metabolism in developing wheat seeds. The intermediate metabolites of seed storage metabolism were not substantially affected when oxygen was either increased or decreased. However, at subambient external oxygen concentrations (8%) the metabolic flux of carbon into starch and protein, measured by injecting 14C-Suc into the seeds, was reduced by 17% and 32%, respectively, whereas no significant effect was observed at superambient (40%) oxygen. The observed decrease in biosynthetic fluxes to storage compounds is suggested to be part of an adaptive response to reduce energy consumption preventing excessive oxygen consumption when oxygen supply is limited. Phloem transport toward ears exposed to low (8%) oxygen was significantly reduced within 1 h, whereas exposing ears to elevated oxygen (40%) had no significant effect. This contrasts with the situation where the distribution of assimilates has been modified by removing the lower source leaves from the plant, resulting in less assimilates transported to the ear in favor of transport to the lower parts of the plant. Under these conditions, with two strongly competing sinks, elevated oxygen (40%) did lead to a strong increase in phloem transport to the ear. The results show that sink metabolism is affected by the prevailing low oxygen concentrations in developing wheat seeds, determining the import rate of assimilates via the phloem.",,"Biosynthesis; Carbon; Crops; Energy utilization; Metabolism; Oxygen supply; Plants (botany); Proteins; Seed; Starch; Energy production; Metabolic flux; Nutrients; Wheat; Physiology; Triticum; Triticum aestivum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543022128

In this paper, the liquid-solid phase diagram of the binary system of tetradecane and hexadecane has been used to obtain information of the phase transition processes for cool storage applications. The analysis of the phase diagram indicates that, except for the minimum-melting point mixture, all mixtures melt and freeze in a temperature range and not at a constant temperature. The latent heat of fusion evolves throughout this temperature range. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the thermophysical properties of the binary system. Depending on the DSC settings throughout the measurements, varying results were obtained. For example, when the DSC runs at a high heating/cooling rate, it will lead to erroneous information. Also, the correct phase transition temperature range cannot be obtained simply from DSC measurement. By combining phase equilibrium considerations with DSC measurements, a reliable design method to incorporate both the heat of phase change and the temperature range is presented. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The vehicle should climb to 17-20km by mainly taking advantage of direct Sun radiation and thereafter maintain a level flight; during the night, a fuel cells energy storage system would be used. A computer program has been developed to carry out a parametric study for the platform design. The solar radiation change over one year, the altitude, masses and efficiencies of the solar and fuel cells, and the aerodynamic performances have all been taken into account. The parametric studies have shown how fuel cells and solar cells efficiency and mass have the most influence on the platform dimensions. A wide use of high modulus CFRP has been made in designing the structure in order to minimise the airframe weight. A first configuration of HELIPLAT® (HELIos PLATform) was worked out, following a preliminary parametric study. The platform is a monoplane with eight brushless electric motors, a twin-boom tail type with an over-sized horizontal stabiliser and two rudders. The co-ordinates at the root and along the wing span as well as the wing planform were optimised to achieve the best efficiency.

Information is available about the mechanical properties of cuticle - Young's modulus of resilin is about 1 MPa, of soft cuticles about 1kPa to 50 MPa, of sclerotised cuticles 1-20 GPa; Vicker's Hardness of sclerotised cuticle ranges between 25 and 80kgfmm-2; density is 1-1.3 kg m-3 - and one of its components, chitin nanofibres, the Young's modulus of which is more than 150 GPa. Experiments based on fracture mechanics have not been performed although the layered structure probably provides some toughening. The structural performance of wings and legs has been measured, but our understanding of the importance of buckling is lacking: it can stiffen the structure (by elastic postbuckling in wings, for example) or be a failure mode. We know nothing of fatigue properties (yet, for instance, the insect wing must undergo millions of cycles, flexing or buckling on each cycle). The remarkable mechanical performance and efficiency of cuticle can be analysed and compared with those of other materials using material property charts and material indices. Presented in this paper are four: Young's modulus - density (stiffness per unit weight), specific Young's modulus - specific strength (elastic hinges, elastic energy storage per unit weight), toughness - Young's modulus (fracture resistance under various loading conditions), and hardness (wear resistance). In conjunction with a structural analysis of cuticle these charts help to understand the relevance of microstructure (fibre orientation effects in tendons, joints and sense organs, for example) and shape (including surface structure) of this fibrous composite for a given function. With modern techniques for analysis of structure and material, and emphasis on nanocomposites and self-assembly, insect cuticle should be the archetype for composites at all levels of scale. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, widely accepted as a model eukaryotic cell, contains two classes of neutral lipids, namely steryl esters and triacylglycerols. Triacylglycerols are synthesized through two pathways governed by the acyl-CoA diacylglycerol acyltransferase Dga1p and the phospholipid diacylglycerol acyltransferase Lrolp, respectively. Steryl esters are formed by the two steryl ester synthases Are1p and Are2p, two enzymes with overlapping function which also catalyze triacylglycerol formation, although to a minor extent. Storage of neutral lipids is tightly linked to the biogenesis of so called lipid particles. The role of this compartment in lipid homeostasis and its interplay with other organelles involved in neutral lipid dynamics, especially the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane, are subject of current investigations. In contrast to neutral lipid formation, mobilization of triacylglycerols and steryl esters in yeast are less characterized at the molecular level. Only recently, the triacylglycerol lipase Tg13p was identified as the first yeast enzyme of this kind by function. Genes and gene products governing steryl ester mobilization still await identification. Besides biochemical properties of enzymes involved in yeast neutral lipid synthesis and degradation, regulatory aspects of these pathways and cell biological consequences of neutral lipid depletion will be discussed in this minireview.","Lipid particles; Lipid storage; Steryl esters; Triacylglycerols; Yeast","diacylglycerol acyltransferase; ester; gene product; triacylglycerol; catalysis; catalyst; cell membrane; conference paper; endoplasmic reticulum; enzyme activity; enzyme immobilization; eukaryotic cell; gene function; lipid composition; lipid storage; lipogenesis; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; protein degradation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; yeast; Eukaryota; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242790123

We investigated these processes in male hamsters, over a broad range of supply as linseed oil (0.37, 3.5, 6.9, and 14.6% energy). Linoleic acid (LA) was kept constant (8.5% energy), and the LA/ALA ratio was varied from 22.5 to 0.6. The apparent absorption of individual FA was very high (>96%), and that of ALA remained almost maximum even at the largest supply (99.5%). The capacity for ALA transport and storage had no limitation over the chosen range of dietary intake. Indeed, ALA intake was significantly correlated with ALA level not only in cholesteryl esters (from 0.3 to 9.7% of total FA) but also in plasma phospholipids and red blood cells (RBC), which makes blood components extremely reliable as biomarkers of ALA consumption. Similarly, ALA storage in adipose tissue increased from 0.85 to 14% of total FA and was highly correlated with ALA intake.

As-cast alloy with the thickness of 10 mm shows better activation property, higher 1C discharge capacity and better cyclic stability than others.

Approximately 50% of patients with PCOS are overweight or obese with abdominal fat accumulation. Some metabolic alterations and abdominal fat distribution have also been reported in lean women with PCOS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect, if any, of obesity on metabolic features, body composition and fat distribution in patients with PCOS. Body composition and abdominal fat distribution (evaluated by DEXA), waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose tolerance and homeostasis model assessment index were determined in 23 lean [mean age 23±5 yr, mean body mass index (BMI) 22±2 kg/m2] and 27 overweight-obese (mean age 21±5 yr, mean BMI 32±5 kg/m2) patients with PCOS and in 20 age- and weight-matched eumenorrhoic women. Patients exhibited slight but non-significant differences in metabolic parameters, waist circumference, blood pressure and total and abdominal fat content compared with weight-matched controls. None of the lean subjects suffered from metabolic syndrome according to the National Cholesterol Education Program - Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATPIII) criteria as opposed to 10 overweight-obese patients and three overweight-obese control subjects (37% and 33.3% of each subgroup, respectively). Our data do not show significant metabolic alterations in lean PCOS women. Results indicate that obesity seems to underpin the metabolic alterations exhibited by the overweight-obese patients. However, since women with PCOS are at increased cardiovascular risk, further studies are needed to evaluate metabolic alterations and body composition in these patients. © 2004, Editrice Kurtis.","Body composition; Fat distribution; Fat PCOS; Lean PCOS; Metabolic characteristics","lipid; adipose tissue; adult; anovulation; article; blood pressure; body composition; cardiovascular risk; clinical article; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat content; female; glucose tolerance; homeostasis; human; hyperandrogenism; lean body weight; lipid storage; menstruation; metabolic disorder; metabolic parameters; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; obesity; ovary polycystic disease",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242694176

The double MTJs were subjected to long-time annealing at various temperatures (185-400°C) in order to investigate the thermal stability due to the interdiffusion. Magnetoresistance (MR) ratio and resistance were measured at room temperature before and after annealing. The thermal changes of MR ratio are well-explained by considering three phenomena with effective activation energies of 2.6 eV, 0.26 eV, and 1.9eV. These values are in good agreement with the activation energies of the interdiffusion based on the vacancy mechanism. The three phenomena with the effective activation energies are well-explained by considering the interdiffusion and redistribution of O and Mn at the AlO x/Co-Fe/Ir-Mn interfaces.

The main part of this work consisted of the development of empirical correlations for the thermal transmittance UA and tuning it based on experimental tests in a test facility. The input variables are the inlet temperature and flow rate of the secondary fluid, while the output variables are the outlet temperature, the heat transfer rates, and the ice tank inventory. It was verified that the heat transfer area for freezing and melting is not constant. Additionally, the model was validated for other tank capacities using manufacturer data.

The modern analytical methods applied today are also presented and illustrated. The development of technology and the use of advanced numerical techniques such as AKTS-TA-Software® enables prediction of the reaction progress of materials in broad temperature ranges. In fact, the goal for numerical simulations is to replace experiments in situations when direct accessibility to the test item or set-up is not possible for timing or safety reasons.

Linear correlations between sensory acceptability and trained panel scores were used to determine the sensory failure cutoff point for each descriptor. To estimate shelf life, DL samples were stored at 25, 37, and 45°C. Plastic flavor was the first descriptor to reach its cutoff point at 25°C and was used for shelf-life calculations. Plastic flavor vs. storage time followed zero-order reaction rate. Shelf-life estimations at different temperatures were 109 d at 25°C, 53 d at 37°C, and 9 d at 45°C.

Due to the recent acute safety concerns and land shortage, storage facilities tend to be located underground. For the construction of underground storage facilities for low temperature materials, besides its mechanical characteristics, the thermal characteristics of rock under temperature variation should be understood. In this study, laboratory experiments for the measurement of the specific heat, thermal conductivity, and thermal expansion coefficient of rock were performed in the temperature range of -160 °C to 40 °C. Experiment results show that thermal conductivity changed little with decreasing temperature, but that specific heat and the thermal expansion coefficient decreased with decreasing temperature. Specific heat at -160°C was about 40% of that at 20 °C. The LETC (linear thermal expansion coefficient) was developed for typical Korean rocks such as granite and sandstone. The results of this study can be utilized for the evaluation of thermal propagation in rock mass and the thermo-mechanical stability of underground facilities at low temperatures. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.","Low temperature; Specific heat; Thermal characteristics; Thermal conductivity; Thermal expansion coefficient","Gas fuel storage; Granite; Liquefied natural gas; Liquefied petroleum gas; Low temperature effects; Mining; Specific heat; Storage facilities; Thermal characteristics; Rock mechanics; gas storage; low temperature; rock property; thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042820412

The principle is based on ordinary drilling where energy is injected into the borehole in the form of pressurised fluid, mechanical torque, and mechanical feed force, which all dissipate into heat. Part of the heat leaves the borehole with the fluid while the rest is mainly transferred into the formation. By determining the energy flows, ground thermal conductivity can be estimated. This new measurement method would have many advantages. Ground conductivity values would be continuously estimated along the borehole, meaning that values are obtained through the formation. This quality could, for example, be used during production drilling in a mine to instantly detect lithological boundaries, resulting in increased ore extraction efficiency. Energy storage systems could be dynamically designed since the system capacity could be recognized and verified during drilling. Presented simulation results, where realistic drilling parameters were used, show that the method has the potential to be practically applied. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.","Borehole; Conductivity; Drilling; Energy; Ground; Thermal response test","Boreholes; Mining engineering; Parameter estimation; Rock drilling; Thermal conductivity; Mechanical feed force; Mechanical torque; Rock mechanics; borehole; drilling; measurement method; thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042818983

The results of the microroughness reduction and the comparisons were made before and after the line beam irradiations for as-grown and post-chemical mechanical penalization (CMP) tungsten films as a function of irradiated laser wavelength, in 248 nm and 308 nm, laser fluence, and the irradiated number of pulses. Characterizations of the microroughness were performed by atomic forced microscopy. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness and peak-to-valley, Ap-v, roughness of the as-grown tungsten films were decreased by about 30%-40% compared with the initial values. The RMS roughnesses of the post-CMP tungsten films were 25-30 Å for a 5 μ.m × 5 μm measurement. Fluctuations of the reduced microroughness were mainly caused by the beam inhomogeneity and local distributions of the hot (peak energy) spots along or across the line beam. The lowest RMS roughness of 8.0-8.4 Å was obtained for the post-CMP tungsten films by the irradiation of 30 pulses of 308 nm with a fluence of 100 mJ/cm2. Irradiation of the 248 nm and 308 nm homogenized flat-top line beam reduced the peak-to-valley roughness, Ap-v of the post-CMP tungsten films down to 1/3 of its initial value. It was found that the optimum number of pulses for microroughness diminution of the post-CMP tungsten film is 50 pulses with a fluence of 150 mJ/cm 2. The wavelength dependency of the microroughness diminution was not surprising, but 308 nm irradiation showed a slightly better performance with consistent results than the 248 nm irradiation did.","Atomic forced microscopy (AFM); Laser polishing; Line beam; Microroughness reduction; Tungsten film","Actuators; Atomic force microscopy; Bonding; CMOS integrated circuits; Data storage equipment; Etching; Excimer lasers; Hydrofluoric acid; Infrared radiation; Laser ablation; Laser beams; Pulsed laser applications; Surface roughness; Tungsten; Laser polishing; Line beams; Microroughness reductions; Tungsten films; Metallic films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042800888

The data were collected from February 1999 to September 2002, as part of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA). During the dry seasons, although precipitation and specific humidity are greatly reduced, the soil moisture storage profiles down to 3.4 m indicate that the forest vegetation continues to withdraw water from deep layers in the soil. For this reason, seasonal changes observed in the energy partition and CO2 fluxes in the forest are small, compared to the large reductions in evaporation and photosynthesis observed in the pasture. For the radiation balance, the reflected short wave radiation increases by about 55% when changing from forest to pasture. Combined with an increase of 4.7% in long wave radiation loss, this causes an average reduction of 13.3% in net radiation in the pasture, compared to the forest. In the wet season, the evaporative fraction (λE/Rn) at the pasture is 17% lower than at the forest. This difference increases to 24% during the dry season. Daytime CO2 fluxes are 20-28% lower (in absolute values) in the pasture compared to the forest. The nighttime respiration in the pasture is also reduced compared to the forest, with averages 44% and 57% lower in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. As the reduction in the nocturnal respiration is larger than the reduction in the daytime uptake, the combined effect is a 19-67% higher daily uptake of CO2 in the pasture, compared to the forest. This high uptake of CO2 in the pasture site is not surprising, since the growth of the vegetation is constantly renewed, as the cattle remove the biomass. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"carbon flux; comparative study; energy flux; grassland; seasonal variation; tropical forest; Amazonia; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042781249

In contrast to the early childhood form of the B variant, the B1 variant appears at a later clinical stage (3 to 7 years of age) with neurodegenerative symptoms leading to the death of the patient in the second decade of life. The most frequent mutation responsible for the GM2 gangliosidosis B1 variant is R178H, which has a widespread geographic and ethnic distribution. The highest incidence has been described in Portugal, which has been suggested as the point of origin of this mutation. Biochemical characterization of this lysosomal disease is carried out using negatively charged synthetic α subunit-specific sulfated substrates, since Hex A isoenzyme heat-inactivation assays are not applicable. However, the determination of the apparent activation energy of Hex using the neutral substrate 3,3′-dichlorophenolsulfonphthaleinyl N-acetyl-β -D-glucosaminide, may offer a valid alternative. The presence of an α subunit in the αβ heterodimer Hex A means that its activation energy (41.8 kJ/mol) is significantly lower than that of the ββ homodimer Hex B (75.1 kJ/mol); however, as mutation inactivates the α subunit, the Hex A of the B1 variant presents an activation energy that is similar to that of the Hex B isoenzyme.","Activation energy; Biochemical characterization; GM2 gangliosidosis B1 variant; β-hexosaminidase isoenzymes","arginine; beta n acetylhexosaminidase A; beta n acetylhexosaminidase B; chlorophenol; dimer; ganglioside GM2; glucosamine derivative; histidine; isoenzyme; phthalein; sulfur derivative; alpha chain; biochemistry; childhood disease; death; degenerative disease; energy; enzyme assay; enzyme deficiency; enzyme inactivation; enzyme substrate; ethnic difference; gene mutation; genetic code; geographic distribution; heat treatment; heterozygosity; homozygosity; human; incidence; lipid hydrolysis; lysosome storage disease; Portugal; review; sulfation; symptomatology; Tay Sachs disease; validation process",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042686662

Large areas of the nuclear chart have been mapped to check theoretical predictions and to investigate structure changes far off stability. The storage of atomic nuclei fully stripped or as few-electron systems allows one to study them under interstellar conditions; specific decay modes can be switched off.

Selected short-term weather forecasting models are introduced and investigated with respect to their forecasting accuracy as measured by root mean square error, mean bias error, and the coefficient of variation. The most complex model, a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), shows the worst performance, followed by a static predictor model that references standard weather archives. The best prediction accuracy is found for bin models that develop a characteristic daily profile from observations collected over the past 30 or 60 days. The model that projects yesterday's patterns one day into the future proved to be a surprisingly poor predictor. We test the predictor models in the context of a predictive optimal control task that optimizes building global temperature setpoints and active thermal energy storage charge/discharge rates in a closed-loop mode. For the four locations investigated in this article—Chicago, IL, Denver, CO, Omaha, NE, and Phoenix, AZ—it was determined that the 30-day and 60-day bin predictor models lead to utility cost savings that are only marginally inferior compared to a hypothetical perfect predictor that perfectly anticipates the weather during the next planning horizon. In summary, the predictive optimal control of active and passive building thermal storage inventory using time-of-use electrical utility rates with significant on-peak to off-peak rate differentials and demand charges is a highly promising control strategy when perfect weather forecasts are available. The primary finding of this paper is that it takes only very simple short-term prediction models to realize almost all of the theoretical potential of this technology. © 2004 American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.",,"Closed loop control systems; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Optimal control systems; Optimization; Forecasting accuracy; Predictive optimal control; Thermal storage; Total utility cost; Air conditioning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942718982

Total energy calculation showed that some elements stabilize and expand the B36N36 structure. Bandgap energies of the B36N36 clusters were found to be reduced by introducing a metal atom inside the cluster, which indicates controllability of the energy gap. Chiralities of BN nanotubes with zigzag- and armchair-type structures were directly determined from high-resolution images, and structure models are proposed. Total energies of BN nanotubes with a zigzag-type structure were lower than those of armchair-type structure, and these results agreed well with the experimental data of disordered tube structure. BN nanotubes encapsulating BN clusters and a yttrium nanowire were also found. In addition, BN nanohorns with tetragonal BN rings were synthesized and proposed, and multi-walled BN nanohorns would be stabilized by stacking of BN nanohorns.

A number of cereals are grown in different countries, including rye, oats, barley, maize, triticale, millet and sorghum. On a worldwide basis, wheat and rice are the most important crops, accounting for over 50% of the world's cereal production. All of the cereals share some structural similarities and consist of an embryo (or germ), which contains the genetic material for a new plant, and an endosperm, which is packed with starch grains. After harvest, correct storage of the grain is important to prevent mould spoilage, pest infestation and grain germination. If dry grains are held for only a few months, minimum nutritional changes will take place, but if the grains are held with a higher amount of moisture, the grain quality can deteriorate because of starch degradation by grain and microbial amylases (enzymes). Milling is the main process associated with cereals, although a range of other techniques are also used to produce a variety of products. Slightly different milling processes are used for the various grains, but the process can generally be described as grinding, sifting, separation and regrinding. The final nutrient content of a cereal after milling will depend on the extent to which the outer bran and aleurone layers are removed, as this is where the fibre, vitamins and minerals tend to be concentrated. There is potential for contamination of cereals and cereal products by pests, mycotoxins, rusts and smuts. Recently, acrylamide (described as a probable carcinogen) has been found in starchy baked foods. No link between acrylamide levels in food and cancer risk has been established and based on the evidence to date, the UK Food Standards Agency has advised the public not to change their diet or cooking methods. However, the Scientific Committee on Food of the European Union (EU) has endorsed recommendations made by Food and Agriculture Organisation/World Health Organization which include researching the possibility of reducing levels of acrylamide in food by changes in formulation and processing. Cereals have a long history of use by humans. Cereals are staple foods, and are important sources of nutrients in both developed and developing countries. Cereals and cereal products are an important source of energy, carbohydrate, protein and fibre, as well as containing a range of micronutrients such as vitamin E, some of the B vitamins, magnesium and zinc. In the UK, because of the mandatory fortification of some cereal products (e.g. white flour and therefore white bread) and the voluntary fortification of others (e.g. breakfast cereals), cereals also contribute significant amounts of calcium and iron. Cereals and cereal products may also contain a range of bioactive substances and there is growing interest in the potential health benefits these substances may provide. Further research is required in this area, including identification of other substances within cereals and their bioavailability. There is evidence to suggest that regular consumption of cereals, specifically wholegrains, may have a role in the prevention of chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, diabetes and colorectal cancer. The exact mechanisms by which cereals convey beneficial effects on health are not clear. It is likely that a number of factors may be involved, e.g. their micronutrient content, their fibre content and/or their glycaemic index. As there may be a number of positive health effects associated with eating wholegrain cereals, encouraging their consumption seems a prudent public health approach. To increase consumption of wholegrain foods, it may be useful to have a quantitative recommendation. Additionally, a wider range of wholegrain foods that are quick and easy to prepare would help people increase their consumption of these foods. As cereal products currently contribute a considerable proportion of the sodium intake of the UK population, manufacturers need to continue to reduce the sodium content of foods such as breakfast cereals and breads where possible. Nutrition labelling is currently not mandatory in the UK, although many manufacturers provide information voluntarily. The fibre content of most UK foods is still measured using the Englyst method rather than the American Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC) method used by other EU countries and the USA. However, UK recommendations for fibre intake currently relate to fibre measured by the Englyst method and not the AOAC method, and hence need revisions. EU changes to labelling regulations will see the labelling of common foods and ingredients causing allergic reactions, including cereals containing gluten and products derived from these foods. The introduction of EU legislation covering health claims may help consumers identify foods with proven health benefits. Several misconceptions exist among the public with regard to cereals and cereal products. Firstly, many more people believe they have a food intolerance or allergy to these foods than evidence would suggest and, secondly, cereals are seen by some as 'fattening'. The public should not be encouraged to cut out whole food groups unnecessarily and, as cereals and cereal products provide a range of macro- and micronutrients and fibre, eliminating these foods without appropriate support and advice from a registered dietitian or other health professional could lead to problems in the long term. In the future it is possible that white flour in the UK may be fortified with folic acid (the synthetic form of the B vitamin folate) to decrease the incidence of neural tube defects during pregnancy. Such a move could also be of benefit for heart health, as poor folate status is associated with high homocysteine levels, an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, high intakes of folic acid can mask vitamin B12 deficiency, a condition that occurs more frequently with age and has serious neurological symptoms affecting the peripheral nervous system. Manipulating the expression of native genes can increase the disease resistance of cereal crops. Novel genes may also be used for this purpose, as well as for developing cereals with resistance to herbicides, and cereals with improved nutritional properties (e.g. increased levels of iron in cereals and of beta-carotene in rice). The long-term consequences and consumer acceptability of such advances must be considered and consumer choice maintained. There is a continual growth in the knowledge of the interactions between human genes and nutrients, and in the future it may be possible to target specific nutrition messages to people with specific genetic profiles. © 2004 British Nutrition Foundation Nutrition Bulletin.",,"acrylamide; alpha tocopherol; alpha tocotrienol; amylase; antioxidant; beta carotene; beta glucan; calcium; carbohydrate; carcinogen; carotenoid; flavonoid; folic acid; gluten; herbicide; iron; magnesium; mineral; mycotoxin; nicotinic acid; protein; pyridoxine; riboflavin; thiamine; tocopherol; trace element; unindexed drug; vitamin; vitamin B group; zinc; age; aleurone; antioxidant activity; barley; caloric intake; cancer risk; cereal; chronic disease; clinical trial; colorectal cancer; cooking; cyanocobalamin deficiency; degradation; diabetes mellitus; diet supplementation; disease resistance; European Union; fiber; food allergy; food composition; food contamination; food industry; food intake; food packaging; food preservation; food processing; food quality; food spoilage; gene expression; genetic manipulation; germination; grinding; heart protection; human; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; law; maize; millet; neural tube defect; neurologic disease; nutritional intolerance; nutritional value; oat; peripheral neuropathy; pest management; plant genetics; plant seed; Poaceae; priority journal; professional standards review organization; review; rice; rust (plant disease); rye; separation technique; smut (plant disease); sorghum; triticale; United Kingdom; wheat; world health organization; Avena; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Poaceae; Secale cereale; Triticosecale; Triticum aestivum; Uredinales; Zea mays",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942565729

Here we show that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising material for such laser devices because it has a direct bandgap in the ultraviolet region. We obtained a pure hBN single crystal under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, which shows a dominant luminescence peak and a series of s-like exciton absorption bands around 215 nm, proving it to be a direct-bandgap material. Evidence for room-temperature ultraviolet lasing at 215 nm by accelerated electron excitation is provided by the enhancement and narrowing of the longitudinal mode, threshold behaviour of the excitation current dependence of the emission intensity, and a far-field pattern of the transverse mode.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Crystal growth; Cubic boron nitride; Laser applications; Luminescence; Ophthalmology; Photocatalysis; Refractive index; Sterilization (cleaning); Surgery; Thermodynamic stability; Ultraviolet devices; Absorption spectra; Bandgap energy; Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN); Ultraviolet laser devices; Single crystals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942513238

The geological analysis assessed over 100 potential environmentally sustainable sites for CO2 injection (ESSCIs) by applying a deterministic risk assessment based on the five factors of: storage capacity, injectivity potential, site details, containment and natural resources. Utilising a risked storage capacity suggests that at a regional scale Australia has a CO2 storage potential in excess of 1600 years of current annual total net emissions. Whilst this estimate does give an idea of the enormous magnitude of the geological storage potential of CO2 in Australia, it does not account for various factors that are evident in source to sink matching. If preferences due to source to sink matching are incorporated, and an assumption is made that some economic imperative will apply to encourage geological storage of CO2, then a more realistic analysis can be derived. In such a case, Australia may have the potential to store a maximum of 25% of our total annual net emissions, or approximately 100-115 Mt CO2 per year. Crown © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Most of this research is focused on the capture and storage components of the process but the critical linking component, CO2 transmission, is often overlooked. It is likely, for most onshore and near-shore CO2 storage projects in geological reservoirs, that the CO2 will be transmitted by a pipeline network. One of the potential risks for CO2 release during any storage operation would be as a result of a transmission pipeline failure. Carrying CO2 in pipelines onshore is not a new concept. In the USA, there is already an extensive CO2 pipeline infrastructure carrying (mostly) naturally occurring CO2 to oilfields as part of CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) operations. The aim of this paper is to draw upon the experiences that can be gained from the existing CO2 pipeline networks to derive estimates of the risk of CO2 releases from CO2 transmission pipelines; the results show that such pipelines do not represent a significant risk in terms of potential for release, which should help build confidence that such lines would not represent a significant public hazard.

The oil and gas industry has a long commercial practice of gas injection, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and gas storage. Using a depleted oil or gas reservoir for CO2 storage has several interesting advantages. The long-term risk analysis of the CO2 behavior and its impact on the environment is a major concern. That is why the selection of an appropriate reservoir is crucial to the success of a sequestration operation. Our modeling study, based on a synthetic reservoir, quantifies uncertainties due to reservoir parameters in order to establish a set of guidelines to select the most appropriate depleted reservoirs. Several production and sequestration scenarios are investigated in order to quantify key parameter for CO2 storage. The influence of parameters such as API gravity, heterogeneity (Dykstra-Parson coefficient), pressure support (water injection) and cap rock integrity are analyzed. Estimation of sequestration capacity is proposed through a sequestration factor (SF) estimated for different reservoir production drives. Multiple regression relationships were developed, allowing SF estimation.

Of particular importance, geological storage has widely been seen as an effective solution for large CO2 sources like power plants or refineries. Many R&amp;D projects have been initiated, whereby research institutes, government agencies and end-users achieve an effective collaboration. So far, progress has been made towards reinjection of CO2, in understanding and then predicting the phenomenon and fluid dynamics inside the geological target, while monitoring the expansion of the CO2 bubble in the case of demonstration projects. A question arises however when talking about sequestration, namely the time scale to be taken into account. Time is indeed of the essence, and points out the need to understand leakage as well as trapping mechanisms. It is therefore of prime importance to be able to predict the fate of the injected fluids, in an accurate manner and over a relevant period of time. On the grounds of geology, four items are involved in geological storage reliability: the matrix itself, which is the recipient of the injected fluids; the seal, that is the mechanistic trap preventing the injected fluids to flow upward and escape; the lower part of the concerned structure, usually an aquifer, that can be a migration way for dissolved fluids; and the man-made injecting hole, the well, whose characteristics should be as good as the geological formation itself. These issues call for specific competencies such as reservoir engineering, geology and hydrodynamics, mineral chemistry, geomechanics, and well engineering. These competencies, even if put to use to a large extent in the oil industry, have never been connected with the reliability of geological storage as ultimate goal. This paper aims at providing an introduction to these interactions and examining the consequences of storing CO2 underground over long period of time. It is indeed of tremendous importance, if geological storage is to become an accepted solution from both a technical and social point of view, to focus from now on long term issues. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Aquifers; Dissolution; Energy efficiency; Fluid dynamics; Geology; Hydrodynamics; Matrix algebra; Power plants; Reliability; Energy demand; Geological storage; Geomechanics; Sequesteration; Energy management; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; emission control; underground storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642512206

The barley samples were analysed under germination capacity and energy conditions after harvest and after long time cold storage at 7°C three-six years. These parameters were each correlated by Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to two separate multivariate data sets: a set of ten physical-chemical parameters and to Near Infrared Transmission (NIT) spectra (850-1050 nm). Surprisingly high correlation coefficients for each of these two data sets were obtained especially with vigour, extract (%) and β-glucan in wort (mg/L) when outliers with viability below 92% were removed. Hard, slowly germinating seeds were more resistant to decay in vigour and viability storage than soft seeds. This change could be predicted by PLSR correlations to the two physical-chemical multivariate methods. Vigour was a more sensitive indicator for the ability to store than viability. The steep criterion was also found to have a physical-chemical basis. The results indicate that NIT calibrations can be used to predict vigour in malting grade barley.","Malt quality; Near Infrared Transmission spectroscopy; Physical-chemical properties; Seed imaging analysis; Seed viability; Seed vigour","Computer simulation; Electromagnetic wave propagation; Imaging techniques; Infrared radiation; Mathematical models; Seed; Spectrum analysis; Malt quality; Near infrared transmission spectroscopy; Physical chemical properties; Seed imaging analysis; Seed viability; Seed vigour; Grain (agricultural product); Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Phthiraptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542591024

This review attempts to draw out the most topical or useful of these reports, and we provide now a synopsis of some interesting areas and trends. Extraction efficiencies vary greatly between samples, thus it appears unrealistic to strive for a universal optimal extraction procedure for arsenic species. Rather, sample extraction procedures should be tailored to the particular application and desired analytes. Most arsenicals are reasonably stable and can be stored frozen for long periods. Some, however, are labile even when stored frozen, and their rate of conversion depends on the sample matrix. There is a need for a thorough study of stability of arsenicals/storage conditions which could provide information on the fundamental transformation processes at work. Such a study should be based on existing information on physico-chemical properties of redox reactions such as stability diagrams as a function of pH and redox potentials. A neglected area of arsenic speciation research is that dealing with the ""insoluble"" fraction which is thought to comprise ""protein- bound"" arsenic and/or ""lipid-arsenic"". Research in these areas is currently hindered by lack of suitable analytical methods, and increased attempts should be made to overcome these problems. Application of the right analytical strategy is likely to lead to novel and interesting results. Improvements in chromatographic separation have been reported using HPLC with gradient elution, but the application of these techniques to real samples may be limited because of severe matrix effects. CE provides excellent separation of many arsenicals but the small sample sizes preclude its use for real samples, and this restriction is unlikely to be overcome in the near future. HPLC-ICPMS is the most powerful and commonly used method for arsenic speciation analysis, and this usage should continue to grow as the required (but expensive) instrumentation becomes more widespread. The method provides reliable quantitative data for arsenic species at environmentally relevant levels in various and diverse matrices. Methods based on HPLC coupled to AAS, AES or AFS, and used in conjunction with HG, provide lower cost options for arsenic speciation analysis. The application of these techniques to refractory arsenicals (arsenobetaine for example) through the use of a decomposition step should be handled cautiously because the degree of degradation is strongly influenced by the matrix. We expect a decline in the coming years in research investigations into arsenic speciation analysis using optical detection systems. The application of these techniques to study various aspects of arsenic speciation, however, is likely to continue. Molecular mass spectrometric methods have provided the most interesting recent results in terms of structural elucidation of new metabolites, and they hold the promise of identifying more novel arsenicals and thereby better explaining arsenic's fate and role in biological systems. Molecular MS is also increasingly being used to provide verification of chromatographic peaks detected and quantified with ICPMS. The use of molecular MS alone, however, is likely to stay mainly in qualitative analysis. An exception may arise if there is a need to routinely analyse a specific arsenical, for toxicological purposes for example, which would encourage development of a targeted sample preparation procedure applicable to molecular MS analysis. X-ray spectroscopic methods, long used for abiotic samples, are now being applied to biological samples and they have already provided interesting data on novel arsenic species and arsenic species in situ. Their ability to handle solid samples removes most concerns regarding sample extraction and sample storage which can reduce the usefulness of the traditional coupled techniques based on chromatography. X-ray spectroscopy is currently restricted to arsenic-rich samples but further developments in fluorescence detection methods may extend its use. The most topical issues on arsenic speciation research are the reduced species MA(III) and DNA(III) in human urine, and the recently reported thio arsenic species in sheep urine. On closer inspection, the data presented so far for MA(III) and DNA(III) are not totally convincing and require confirmation with appropriate sample collection, storage and preparation procedures. On the other hand, the data showing the presence of thio arsenic species look sound and there is the likelihood that other As-S compounds will be found. Given the current uncertainty surrounding MA(III) and DMA(III), the possibility that arsenic species assigned as such may in fact be thio arsenic species should be considered.",,"arsenic derivative; carbohydrate derivative; hydrogen; solvent; analytic method; atomic absorption spectrometry; biolistic transformation; biotransformation; capillary electrophoresis; chemistry; cleaning; collisionally activated dissociation; cryobiology; electrospray; Fourier analysis; fractionation; gas chromatography; gel permeation chromatography; high performance liquid chromatography; human; ion pair chromatography; mass spectrometry; medical research; metabolite; methylation; molecular mechanics; nuclear energy; phase separation; quantitative analysis; review; roentgen spectroscopy; sediment; simulation; soil; solvent extraction; species differentiation; standard; stomach juice; structure analysis; time of flight mass spectrometry; urine; water sampling; X ray analysis; X ray spectrometry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442666423

Yet, these polynuclear molecules, reminiscent of oxide clusters, present a wide range of structures and with them ideal frameworks for the deployment of a plethora of useful magnetic, electroionic, catalytic, bioactive and photochemical properties. With this in mind, a new trend towards the application of these remarkable species in materials science is beginning to develop. In this review we analyze this trend and discuss two main lines of thought for the application of polyoxometalates as materials. On the one hand, there is their use as clusters with inherently useful properties on themselves, a line which has produced fundamental studies of their magnetic, electronic or photoelectrochemical properties and has shown these clusters as models for quantum-sized oxides. On the other hand, the encapsulation or integration of polyoxometalates into organic, polymeric or inorganic matrices or substrates opens a whole new field within the area of hybrid materials for harnessing the multifunctional properties of these versatile species in a wide variety of applications, ranging from catalysis to energy storage to biomedicine.","Conducting polymers; Delocalized electrons; Electroactivity; Energy storage and conversion; Heteropolyacids; Heteropolyanions; Heteropolyblues; Hybrid materials; Magnetism in oxide clusters; Polyoxometalates; Rechargeable lithium batteries; Redox","inorganic compound; oxide; polyoxometalate derivative; unclassified drug; metal; oxygen derivative; polymer; transition element; biomedicine; catalysis; chemical structure; inorganic chemistry; quantum chemistry; review; chemistry; electrochemistry; materials; nanotechnology; surface property; Electrochemistry; Manufactured Materials; Metals; Nanotechnology; Oxygen Compounds; Polymers; Surface Properties; Transition Elements",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442651871

Semi-volatile organic compounds in leachates from reclaimed asphalt pavement, measured in field samples and in laboratory column test, were analysed through a GC/MS screen-test methodology. Sixteen PAH (polyaromatic hydrocarbons) were also analysed in leachates from the column study. The highest concentrations of semi-volatile compounds, - 400 μg 1-1, were measured in field samples from the scarified stockpile. Naphthalene, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) were the most dominant of the identified semi-volatiles. The occurrence of these compounds in urban groundwater, also indicate high emission rates and persistent structures of the compounds, making them potentially hazardous. Car exhausts, rubber tires and the asphalt material itself are all probable emission sources, determined from the organic contaminants released from the stockpiles. The major leaching mechanism indicated was dissolution of organic contaminants from the surface of the asphalt gravels. In the laboratory column test, the release of high-molecular weight and more toxic PAH was higher in the leachates after two years than at the commencement of storage. The concentrations of semi-volatiles in leachates, were also several times lower than those from the field stockpile.

To examine what is known about the effectiveness of interventions, and how treatment might be improved. Recent findings: Obesity is a common problem in the elderly, although its prevalence decreases in extreme old age. Decreased physical activity and decreased energy expenditure with ageing predispose to fat accumulation and fat redistribution. Reduction in muscle mass (sarcopenic obesity) is an important determinant of physical function and metabolic rate. Chronic inflammation and endocrine changes contribute to the changes in metabolism and body composition that accompany ageing, and are potential therapeutic targets. Body weight and body mass index are imperfect indicators of risk from obesity. The focus of treatment should be on reduction of intra-abdominal fat and preservation of muscle mass and strength. A number of recent studies have confirmed the effectiveness of exercise interventions in the elderly. Progressive resistance training, rather than endurance exercise, may be more effective in many cases. Reduced function and decreased quality of life accompany development of the complications of obesity such as diabetes and vascular disorders. There is considerable scope to impede the development of these complications in the elderly with lifestyle interventions. Summary: Sarcopenic obesity, with accumulation of intra-abdominal fat, is a major determinant of health status in the elderly. As in the younger population, prevention and treatment programmes have the potential to decrease the impact of diabetes, vascular disease, and other complications of obesity. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Body composition; Elderly; Endocrine changes; Exercise; Inflammation; Metabolic rate; Morbidity; Mortality; Obesity; Quality of life; Treatment","antiinflammatory agent; fat; gonadorelin; interleukin 6; liothyronine; sibutramine; somatomedin C; testosterone; tetrahydrolipstatin; tumor necrosis factor alpha; abdomen; aging; arthritis; atherosclerosis; basal metabolic rate; body fat; body mass; body weight; caloric intake; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; chronic inflammation; clinical examination; cognitive defect; diabetes mellitus; diet; disease course; drug targeting; dyslipidemia; endocrine system; energy expenditure; health program; health status; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; hypogonadism; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; ischemic heart disease; lifestyle; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; metabolic syndrome X; morbidity; mortality; muscle atrophy; muscle exercise; muscle mass; muscle strength; muscle training; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; physical activity; preservation; prevalence; quality of life; respiratory tract disease; review; smoking; tissue distribution; aged; female; male; metabolism; middle aged; obesity; patient selection; Aged; Aging; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Patient Selection; Quality of Life",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442485784

In both groups, the ICD showed overall and cardiac mortality reduction.

The abundance of influencing factors, their interactions and the complex relationships between mechanical impacts and the resulting tissue discolouration, however, hamper an easy solution. The main objectives of this work were the introduction and construction of a frame of reference for the PTR 200 electronic potato and the development of a predictive tissue discolouration model taking into account both impact energy level and a reduced number of potato bruise susceptibility parameters. The attention was mainly focussed on dry matter content and tuber temperature as influencing factors because of their fast determination possibilities, which is essential for an online evaluation and support system. In the 2000, 2001 and 2002 harvesting seasons, field experiments were carried out with seven potato varieties on harvesters and storage lines using the PTR 200 electronic potato. For each harvester or storing line the individual energy levels of the impacts were measured and the values were used to compute a general energy level, set as a sensor index IS. Produce samples were taken at several points in the processing chain and analysed for tissue discolouration and dry matter content. Both characterisations resulted in average values for energy level, discolouration and dry matter content. Tuber temperature, cultivar differences and - in some cases - potassium (K) content of the tubers were taken into account. Multiple linear regressions were performed and analysed. The regression models showed moderate coefficients of determination. On the basis of the statistical models, discolouration prediction intervals were computed for new measurements with the PTR 200. This allowed the prediction of tissue discolouration in potato by means of PTR 200 measurement results. Due to the limited number of bruise susceptibility factors in the models, the seasonal and biological variability and the moderate coefficients of determination, prediction intervals are rather wide which limits the predictive power of the models. © 2004 Silsoe Research Institute.

There are two fundamental methods of solar energy conversion: photothermal and photoelectric. The paper is dealing with the analysis of photothermal conversion in the high latitude countries. Different types of solar active and passive systems are considered. The more reliable the solar system and the higher the temperature requirements, the required technology is more modern and sophisticated, and the construction of the system, together with the automatic control, is more complicated. The degree of complexity depends on the function of the system and required mode of its operation. In the case of solar space heating in high latitude countries, it is evident that thermal performance of solar source is not coherent with the heat demand. Therefore the use of solar energy requires a special upgrading, e.g. in a form of a heat pump or seasonal storage. However, the best idea for efficient use of solar energy is to design a building in a proper way, including the passive systems. The architecture is crucial for the energy balance of a building and it should assure proper use of environment, improving solar energy gains in winter and protecting inside of the building against solar overheating in summer.","Availability of solar radiation; Heat pumps; Isorads; Photothermal conversion of solar radiation; Solar active heating systems; Solar architecture; Solar passive systems","Absorption; Crops; Electric power systems; Energy conversion; Heat pump systems; Mirrors; Photoelectric cells; Power generation; Public utilities; Solar radiation; Availability of solar radiation; Isorads; Photothermal conversion of solar radiation; Solar active heating systems; Solar architecture; Solar passive systems; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342468672

Its relatively high stability has been the main obstacle for practical applications. Here, first-principles calculations of MgH2 and MgH2 - X (X = Al, Ti, Fe, Ni, Cu, or Nb) were carried out to investigate the influences of selected alloying elements on the stability of the magnesium hydride. The full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method within the generalized gradient approximation was used in the present study. The influence of alloying elements on the stability of magnesium dihydride was investigated through calculations of the total energy of the considered systems. It was shown that the alloying elements considered here decrease the heat of formation of (Mg, X)H2–i.e., destabilizing the hydride–with decreasing order of effect from Cu, Ni, Al, Nb, and Fe to Ti. The destabilization of the magnesium hydride by the alloying elements was due to a weakened bonding between magnesium and hydrogen atoms. Hence, the dehydrogenation properties of MgH2 are expected to be improved to a different extent by the addition of alloying elements. © 2004 American Physical Society.",,"alloy; aluminum derivative; copper derivative; hydrogen; iron derivative; magnesium derivative; magnesium dihydride; nickel; titanium derivative; unclassified drug; addition reaction; article; chemical analysis; energy; hydrogenation; physical chemistry; reaction analysis; thermal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342429665

Objective: We assessed the effect of an imposed sedentary routine on appetite, energy intake (EI), EB, and nutrient balance in lean men for 7 d. Design: Six men with a mean (±SD) age of 23.0 ± 2.3 y, weight of 69.2 ± 11.4 kg, and height of 1.76 ± 0.07 m were each studied twice during a sedentary [1.4 X resting metabolic rate (RMR)] and a moderately active (1.8 X RMR) regimen. During each treatment, they resided in the whole-body indirect calorimeter for the 7 d and had ad libitum access to a medium-fat diet of constant, measurable composition. Meal size, frequency, and composition were continually monitored. Motivation to eat was recorded during waking hours. Subjects were weighed in light clothing each morning, and their weight was corrected to nude. Results: Energy expenditure was 9.7 and 12.8 MJ/d [P < 0.01; SE of the difference between means (SED) = 0.41] during the sedentary and active regimens, respectively. EI was 13.5 and 14.4 MJ/d (P = 0.463, SED = 1.06), respectively. There was no regimen effect on hunger, appetite, or body weight. By day 7, cumulative EB was 26.3 and 11.1 MJ, respectively. Conclusions: Reducing a level of physical activity from 1.8 to 1.4 X RMR can markedly affect EB. A sedentary routine does not induce a compensatory reduction of EI and leads to a significantly positive EB, most of which is stored as fat. © 2004 American Society for Clinical Nutrition.","Appetite; Calorimetry; Energy balance; Exercise; Humans; Sedentariness","adult; appetite; article; body weight; calorimetry; controlled study; energy balance; energy expenditure; human; human experiment; hunger; lean body weight; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; medical assessment; metabolic rate; motivation; normal human; nutrient concentration; physical activity; sample size; sitting; test meal; wakefulness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21744438365

Sources of data: An extensive bibliographic review of the topic was carried out. Articles selected in the MEDLINE and Lilacs databases, publications from national and international organizations, theses and dissertations were reviewed. Some key articles were also selected from the citations referred in other papers. Summary of the findings: New knowledge acquired about child feeding over the last 20 years have led to a significant change in the current feeding recommendations for breastfed children in relation to the prior recommendations. The current recommended nutritional needs are lower than the old recommendations, complementary food is introduced in a more precise age, around 6 months, and new methods are recommended for promoting the child's healthy eating. The new recommendations emphasize the health feeding practices which comprise both the adequate food quantity and quality, including care with food handling and preparation, feeding and storage practices, and the respect and adequacy to the cultural characteristics of each people. Conclusions: The adequate complementary feeding of the breastfed child is critical for the optimal child growth and development. Therefore, it is an essential factor for both the populations' food security and the development of nations. The health professionals are ought to effectively pass on to mothers/care takers the new recommendations for promoting the healthy complementary feeding of the breastfed child. It is up to the governments to provide the adequate conditions for supporting such a promotion.

The calculated width of the micropulse was roughly in accord with the observed pulse width. Moreover, we showed that the macropulse intensity and the energy spread were approximately expressed by simple functions when there was only longitudinal detuning. Using these expressions for the macropulse intensity and the energy spread, we clarified that the pulse height of the intensity was greater than twice the difference between the average intensity and the minimum intensity to maintain the macropulse zone. It was also observed that the period of the increase of the energy spread in a macropulse depends negligibly on the detuning length, and this rule for the macropulse was approximately explained using simple expressions. We will be able to apply the simple simulation to investigate the peak power in a Q-switch operation.","Energy spread; Free electron laser; Intensity; Longitudinal detuning; Macropulse; Micropulse; Storage ring","Difference equations; Dissociation; Finite difference method; Isotopes; Laser pulses; Photons; Q switching; Ring lasers; Energy spread; Intensity; Longitudinal detuning; Macropulses; Micropulses; Free electron lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142655065

This fact gives rise to a large pΔV term, which under the right conditions can overcome unfavorable energy and entropy changes for the confinement of H2, as demonstrated for the confinement of H2 in graphite. It produces a remarkable two dimensional array of H2 with ordered orientation, as H2 is forced into the narrow and seemingly inhospitable space sandwiched between two hexagonal carbon rings.

In addition, a face-to-face survey of 212 randomly selected individuals was conducted. We found that, on first hearing about CCS in the absence of any information on its purpose, the majority of people either do not have an opinion at all or have a somewhat negative perspective. However, when (even limited) information is provided on the role of CO2 storage in reducing CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, opinion shifts towards expressing slight support for the concept. Support depends, however, upon concern about human-caused climate change, plus recognition of the need for major reductions in CO2 emissions. It also depends upon CCS being seen as just one part of a wider strategy for achieving significant cuts in CO2 emissions. A portfolio including renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, and lifestyle change to reduce demand was generally favoured. CCS can be part of such a portfolio, but wind, wave, tidal, solar and energy efficiency were preferred. It was felt that uncertainties concerning the potential risks of CCS had to be better addressed and reduced; in particular the risks of accidents and leakage (including the potential environmental, ecosystem and human health impacts which might result from leakage). © 2004 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon dioxide capture and storage; CCS; Public perceptions","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; emission control; public attitude; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20644461923

In a unified approach these layers develop in a natural transition as a function of the state variables pressure, deviatoric stress, temperature and strain-rate. We find that the main storage of elastic energy lies in the domain where brittle and ductile strain-rates overlap so that shear zones are attracted to this zone of maximum energy dissipation. This dissipation appears as a local heat source (shear heating). The brittle-ductile transition zone evolves through extreme weakening by thermo-mechanical feedback. The physics of the weakening process relies on repeated breaching of a critical energy flux threshold for feedback within this sub-horizontal brittle-ductile flow layer, thus developing unstable slipping events at post-and pre-seismic strain-rates. The width- and the temperature domain of the feedback layer is controlled by the activation enthalpy Q of the material. For olivine rheology (Q ∼ 500 kJ/mol) the layer can be extremely thin <500 m and adheres to the 875 K isotherm. For quartz (Q ∼ 135 kJ/mol) the width of the feedback layer fans out into multiple interacting ductile faults covering a temperature domain of 450-600 K. The weakening by thermal-mechanical feedback entirely controls the location and rejuvenation of upper crustal shear zones propagating from the detachment upwards in the form of listric faults. Within the detachment shear layer we identify an astonishing rich dynamics featuring distinct individual creep bursts. We argue that the rich ductile dynamics holds the key to earthquakes in the brittle field.

Losses by diffusion of tritium from metallic Mg and Fe are found to occur on time scales of months, while metallic Al, Si, and stone meteorites are much more retentive. The production rate ratios P(3H)/P(3He)d obtained in the simulation experiments are 0.73, 1.28, and 1.16 for O, Al, and Si, respectively. These rates are based on our best knowledge about the 3H and 3He production rates and should, therefore, replace data published earlier (Leya et al. 2000a). The earlier calculations for 4He, 20, 21, 22Ne, and 36, 38, 39Ar remain valid. The new modeled correlation 3Hecum/21Ne versus 22Ne/21Ne for chondrites exposed to cosmic rays with an energy spectrum characterized by a modulation parameter of Φ = 650 MeV is in fair agreement with the empirical relationship (""Berne plot""). However, for small meteorites and little shielding in larger ones, there are systematic differences that most likely are due to an underestimation of the spallogenic 22Ne/21Ne ratio by ∼2%. © Meteoritical Society, 2004.",,"cosmic ray; meteorite; noble gas; tritium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2042450808

Ectopic expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in the white adipose tissue of the aP2-Ucp1 transgenic mice reduced obesity induced by genetic or dietary manipulations. Furthermore, respiratory uncoupling lowered the cellular energy charge in adipocytes, while the synthesis of fatty acids (FA) was inhibited and their oxidation increased. Importantly, the complex metabolic changes triggered by ectopic UCP1 were associated with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic master switch, in adipocytes. Effects of several typical treatments that reduce adiposity, such as administration of leptin, β-adrenoceptor agonists, bezafibrate, dietary n-3 polyunsaturated FA or fasting, can be compared with a phenotype of the aP2-Ucp1 mice. These situations generally lead to the upregulation of mitochondrial UCPs and suppression of the cellular energy charge and FA synthesis in adipocytes. On the other hand, FA oxidation is increased. Moreover, it has been shown that AMPK in adipocytes can be activated by adipocyte-derived hormones leptin and adiponectin, and also by insulin-sensitizes thiazolidinediones. Thus, it is evident that metabolism of adipose tissue itself is important for the control of body fat content and that the cellular energy charge and AMPK are involved in the control of lipid metabolism in adipocytes. The reciprocal link between synthesis and oxidation of FA in adipocytes represents a prospective target for the new treatment strategies aimed at reducing obesity. © 2004 Nature Publishing Group.","Adipose tissue; Ampk; Transgenic mice; Uncoupling protein","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; adiponectin; beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; bezafibrate; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; leptin; mitochondrial protein; omega 3 fatty acid; uncoupling protein 1; adipocyte; body fat; conference paper; dietary intake; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid synthesis; genetic manipulation; human; in vitro study; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; obesity; phenotype; priority journal; prospective study; transgenic mouse; treatment planning; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Carrier Proteins; Choristoma; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Ion Channels; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Proteins; Models, Biological; Multienzyme Complexes; Obesity; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Mus musculus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19944433011

The classification is solely due to the in vitro capability of these enzymes to accept phytate as a substrate. Phytases have been studied intensively in recent years because of the great interest in such enzymes for reducing phytate content in animal feed and food for human consumption. They have a wide distribution in plants, microorganisms, and in some animal tissues. Due to several biological characteristics, such as substrate specificity, resistance to proteolysis and catalytic efficiency, bacterial phytases have considerable potential in commercial applications. In bacteria, phytase is an inducible enzyme and its expression is subjected to a complex regulation, but phytase formation is not controlled uniformly among different bacteria. It was suggested that phytase is not required for balanced growth of bacterial cells, but may be synthesised in response to a nutrient or energy limitation.","Bacterial phytase; Biotechnological application; Dephosphorylation; Occurrence; Phytase formation; Phytate","Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19944373812

In particular, the effects of strain level, loading-unloading rate, and deformation temperature are analyzed. DSC traces indicate that a remarkable fraction of the mechanical work of deformation (in the range from 25 up to 62%) is stored in the material after unloading. Final strain dependence of stored energy values for specimens deformed up to 40% follows the general S-shaped trend observed for many amorphous and semicrystalline polymers. The ratio of the stored energy to the mechanical work of deformation (ΔUST/W) is decreasing as the final deformation level increases. For a given final strain level, the amount of energy stored in specimens deformed under Tg increases as either loading or unloading rates increase: in particular, both ΔUST and ΔU ST/W values are linearly increasing with the logarithm of loading rate. On the other hand, energy storage for specimens deformed at Tg results to be practically independent from the loading rate. Moreover, as the deformation temperature increases from 25 to 100°C, ΔUST values markedly decrease, while the ratio ΔUST/W is almost constant around an average value of about 51%. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Lipid bodies are regarded as intracellular domains for the synthesis of eicosanoid mediators that can be induced by inflammatory stimuli. The aim of the present study was to establish whether hypothermic ischemic lung storage without further preservation measures leads to an induction of lipid body formation in canine type II pneumocytes. The lungs of 18 dogs were fixed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) immediately after cardiac arrest (six double lungs) and after ischemic storage in Tutofusin solution at 4°C for 20 min, 4 hr, 8 hr, and 12 hr (six single lungs, respectively). Type II pneumocytes were analyzed qualitatively by conventional TEM (CTEM) and quantitatively by stereology. The relative phosphorus content of surfactant containing lamellar bodies, lipid bodies, and intermediate forms was investigated by energy-filtering TEM (EFTEM). By CTEM, lipid bodies as well as forms intermediate between lipid bodies and lamellar bodies were already noted in the control group but were more pronounced in the ischemia groups. Beginning at 20 min of ischemic storage, a significant increase in the volume density of lipid bodies was noted in the ischemic groups as compared to the control group. By EFTEM, the highest intracellular phosphorus signals were recorded over lamellar bodies and lamellar areas of intermediate forms in all experimental groups, while lipid bodies and homogeneous areas of intermediate forms did not show a clear phosphorus signal. These results indicate that the formation of lipid bodies in canine type II pneumocytes is induced early during ischemic lung storage. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Lamellar body; Lung preservation; Stereology; Surfactant; Transmission electron microscopy","icosanoid; phosphorus; surfactant; tutofusin; animal cell; animal tissue; article; controlled study; dog; female; heart arrest; inflammation; ischemia; lamellar body; lung alveolus; lung alveolus cell type 2; lung alveolus epithelium; male; nonhuman; priority journal; stereology; transmission electron microscopy; Canis familiaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842510033

Alteration of WAT mass in obesity or lipoatrophy, affects the production of most adipose secreted factors. Since both conditions are associated with multiple metabolic disorders and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, the idea has emerged that WAT could be instrumental in these complications, by virtue of its secreted factors. Several adipokines are increased in the obese state and have been implicated in hypertension (angiotensinogen), impaired fibrinolysis (PAI-1) and insulin resistance (ASP, TNFα, IL-6, resistin). Conversely, leptin and adiponectin both exert an insulin-sensitizing effect, at least in part, by favoring tissue fatty-acid oxidation through activation of AMP-activated kinase. In obesity, insulin resistance has been linked to leptin resistance and decreased plasma adiponectin. In lipoatrophic mice, where leptin and adiponectin circulating levels are low, administration of the two adipokines synergistically reverses insulin resistance.

In a storage ring free electron laser (FEL) they can compete with the induced beam heating and thus be treated as a further concomitant perturbing source of the beam dynamics. Bunch length and energy spread measurements, carried out at the Super-ACO storage ring, can be correctly interpreted according to a broad-band impedance model. Quantitative estimations of the relative role that is played by the microwave instability and the laser heating in shaping the beam longitudinal dynamics have been obtained by the analysis of the equilibrium laser power. It has been performed in terms of either a theoretical limit, implemented with the measured beam longitudinal characteristics, or the numerical results obtained by a macroparticle tracking code, which includes the laser pulse propagation. Such an analysis, carried out for different operating points of the Super-ACO storage ring FEL, indicates that the laser heating counteracts the microwave instability. © 2004 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18244396338

The disadvantages of conventional methods, based on the atom or ion stripping in a material target, are emittance growth, energy straggling, and production of ions in many charge states. Recently suggested stripping methods based on direct photoionization require employment of hard-UV lasers, which still do not exist and must obviously be very bulky and expensive. An alternative method, suggested for injection of proton beams, employs excitation of the atom to 3p intermediate state with subsequent Lorentz ionization in a magnetic field gradient. This technique applies rigid requirements to laser characteristic and is not free of growing of the beam divergence. In this paper a variant of the stripping technique based on the resonantly enhanced two-photon ionization (RETPI) is considered. The technique allows ionization of singly charged ions of the elements from helium to bismuth. A variant of the technique can be used for proton injection. RETPI can be applied for both ion injection and stacking, as well as for diagnostics of ion beam characteristics on the orbit. Stripping efficiency can be about 100% for the singly charged ions having the singlet ground state and decreases for the other ions. Special methods for ""cleaning"" unwanted atomic states in such ions, that can provide high stripping efficiency, are discussed. Excimer lasers with very moderate parameters can be employed for implementation of this technique for almost all elements. Numerical examples show that for most of the singly charged ions and for hydrogen atom necessary laser-beam energy density is merely 0.5-8 J/cm2 for aim interaction region, and is 10 times higher for several light ions. © 2004 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18244376127

This work investigates the influence of a reduction of ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) on storage metabolism in these seeds. To manipulate the activity of AGPase in a seed-specific manner, a cDNA encoding the small subunit of AGPase was expressed in the sense or antisense orientation under the control of an embryo-specific thioesterase promoter. Lines were selected showing an embryo-specific decrease in AGPase due to antisense and cosuppression at different stages of development. At early developmental stages (25 days after flowering), a 50% decrease in AGPase activity was accompanied by similar decreases in starch content and the rate of starch synthesis measured by injecting 14C-Suc into seeds in planta. In parallel to inhibition of starch synthesis, the level of ADP-Glc decreased, whereas Glc 1-phosphate levels increased, providing biochemical evidence that inhibition of starch synthesis was due to repression of AGPase. At 25 days after flowering, repression of starch synthesis also led to a decrease in the rate of 14C-Suc degradation and its further metabolism via other metabolic pathways. This was not accompanied by an increase in the levels of soluble sugars, indicating that Suc import was inhibited in parallel. Flux through glycolysis, the activities of hexokinase, and inorganic pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, and the adenylate energy state (ATP to ADP ratio) of the transgenic seeds decreased, indicating inhibition of glycolysis and respiration compared to wild type. This was accompanied by a marked decrease in the rate of storage lipid (triacylglycerol) synthesis and in the fatty acid content of seeds. In mature seeds, glycolytic enzyme activities, metabolite levels, and ATP levels remained unchanged, and the fatty acid content was only marginally lower compared to wild type, indicating that the influence of AGPase on carbon metabolism and oil accumulation was largely compensated for in the later stages of seed development. Results indicate that AGPase exerts high control over starch synthesis at early stages of seed development where it is involved in establishing the sink activity of the embryo and the onset of oil accumulation. © 2004 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Biochemistry; Biodegradation; Biosynthesis; DNA; Enzyme kinetics; Metabolism; Plants (botany); Starch; ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (AGPase); Repression; Starch deposition; Storage metabolism; Enzymes; Biochemistry; Biodegradation; Biosynthesis; Enzymes; Metabolism; Nucleic Acids; Plants; Starch; Brassica napus; Sinapis arvensis; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; complementary DNA; fatty acid; glucose 1 phosphate adenylyltransferase; nucleotidyltransferase; plant DNA; rapeseed oil; starch; sucrose; vegetable oil; article; biosynthesis; enzymology; gene; gene expression; genetics; glycolysis; growth, development and aging; lipid metabolism; metabolism; molecular genetics; plant seed; prenatal development; rapeseed; transgenic plant; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Brassica napus; DNA, Antisense; DNA, Plant; Fatty Acids; Gene Expression; Genes, Plant; Glucose-1-Phosphate Adenylyltransferase; Glycolysis; Lipid Metabolism; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleotidyltransferases; Plant Oils; Plants, Genetically Modified; Seeds; Starch; Sucrose",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16544388759

A CaSO4/H2O/ CaSO4I/2H2O hydration/dehydration CHPD system and a CaO/ H2O/Ca(OH 2 hydration/dehydration CHPD system were examined. The CHPD systems store heat and simultaneously release the increased amount of heat at different temperature levels by using two chemical heat pumps (CHP) in their heat-enhancement mode. Furthermore, we propose enhanced systems using chemical heat pipes (CHPipe) for their environmental and cost merits. As a result, the consumed energy and the cost of using the CHPD systems in the industrial ceramics drying process are found to decrease to less than half of the conventional drying process using gas-fired boilers.

The mechanisms involved in anthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity are still poorly understood, but numerous investigations have indicated a role for iron in this process. Our previous studies using neoplastic and myocardial cells showed that anthracyclines inhibit iron mobilization from the iron storage protein, ferritin, resulting in marked accumulation of ferritin-iron. Although the process of ferritin-iron mobilization is little understood, catabolism of ferritin by lysosomes may be a likely mechanism. Because anthracyclines have been shown to accumulate in lysosomes, this latter organelle may be a potential target for these drugs. The present study demonstrated, using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-59Fe autoradiography, that ferritin-59Fe mobilization is an energy-dependent process that also requires protein synthesis. Depression of lysosomal activity via the enzyme inhibitors E64d [(2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-2-methylbutane ethyl ester] and leupeptin or the lysosomotropic agents ammonium chloride, chloroquine, and methylamine resulted in a 3- to 5-fold increase in 59Fe-ferritin accumulation compared with control cells. In addition, the proteasome inhibitors N-benzoyloxycarbonyl (Z)-Leu-Leuleucinal (MG132) and lactacystin also significantly increased 59Fe-ferritin levels compared with control cells. These effects of lysosomotropic agents or inhibitors of lysosomal activity were comparable with that observed with the anthracycline doxorubicin. Collectively, our study indicates a role for lysosomes and proteasomes in ferritin-iron mobilization, and this pathway is dependent on metabolic energy and protein synthesis. Furthermore, the lysosome/proteasome pathway may be a novel anthracycline target, inhibiting iron mobilization from ferritin that is essential for vital iron-requiring processes such as DNA synthesis.",,"aloxistatin; ammonium chloride; anthracycline derivative; antimetabolite; benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal; chloroquine; doxorubicin; enzyme inhibitor; ferritin; iron; iron 59; lactacystin; leupeptin; lysosomotropic agent; metabolic inhibitor; methylamine; proteasome; protein synthesis inhibitor; unclassified drug; article; autoradiography; cardiotoxicity; catabolism; controlled study; DNA synthesis; drug mechanism; energy metabolism; human; human cell; iron kinetics; iron metabolism; lysosome; metabolic inhibition; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein synthesis; protein synthesis inhibition; Anthracyclines; Biological Transport; Cycloheximide; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Cytosol; Doxorubicin; Ferritins; Humans; Iron; Iron Radioisotopes; Lysosomes; Mitochondria; Multienzyme Complexes; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Protein Synthesis Inhibitors; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642576976

There are two possible approaches: to mould dispersed biomass charcoal with a phenol-formaldehyde binder or to produce this material by carbonising the biomass fiberboard prepared by making use of steam explosion autohydrolysis pulp or steam explosion lignin as a binder. In the first step, steam explosion lignin, as a modifier and a binder is introduced to the lignocellulosic biomass by impregnation or during the hot pressing process to form a hard fiberboard. By subsequent carbonisation of the fiberboard panels or blocks, carbonised panels or blocks with high bending and crushing strength and suitable thermodynamic properties are obtained due to the formation of an internal lignin reinforcement in cell lumina and impregnation of cell walls with lignin solution or molten lignin. The carbonised panels demonstrate a good dimensional stability after a standard treatment with water. The bending strength of the carbonised panels after 24 h soaking in water is 93% of that in dry state. The thermodynamic properties and porosity of the carbonised panels demonstrate their suitability for use as a building material. Lignin, a natural binder of fiberboards, has proven to be suitable for preparation of cabonaceous panels and boards. In this respect new carbon building blocks and panels from moulded biomass and carbonised steam exploded biomass act as a concentrated form of long term carbon storage and will be a factor stabilizing the growing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

Lean and ob/ob mice infused with either leptin or phosphate-buffered saline were treated with TPM for 7 days. TPM was mixed into the diet and administered at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, whereas leptin was infused at the rate of 100 μg/kg/day using osmotic minipumps, which were subcutaneously implanted in the interscapular region. Food intake and body weight were monitored throughout the study. Body composition was measured prior to and following treatment with TPM and leptin, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Glucose (glucose oxidase method) and insulin (radioimmunoassay) were also determined. TPM and leptin significantly reduced body weight gain, food intake and body fat gain in obese mice. The effects of TPM and leptin on fat gain were also statistically significant in lean animals. There was no interaction of TPM and leptin on the energy balance variables, the effects of the two substances being additive instead. Leptin abrogated hyperinsulinemia in obese mutants whereas TPM did not alter insulin levels in either lean or obese mice. The combination of leptin and TPM led to the normalization of glucose levels in obese mice. Our study demonstrates an effect of TPM in leptin-deficient animals, which suggests that TPM does not require the presence of leptin to exert its effect. They also show that the effects of leptin and TPM can be additive. The treatment with leptin in ob/ob mice neither accentuated nor blunted the effect of TPM on energy balance. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast to glucose, fat stores are very large, fat contains more than twice as much energy per gram than carbohydrate, but the capacity to oxidize fatty acids is limited when the exercise intensity increases. Several nutritional procedures have been suggested to promote fatty acid oxidation and attenuate the rate of muscle glycogen depletion. Topics. - The reason for the limited use of fat stores during exercise is not fully elucidated, but this limitation might be located at different levels. The rate of mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue clearly is one of these limiting steps, especially through the effects of insulin and the α-β adrenergic balance on lipolysis. Fatty acids in the plasma are carried bound to albumin and this step is not limiting. Evidence is accumulating, indicating the existence of a carrier system for fatty acids across the myofiber membrane. Three carrier protein families have been identified in skeletal muscle, involved in the fatty acid transport from capillaries to mitochondria. Although the expression of these carrier proteins is regulated by endurance training, their limiting role for long chain fatty acid uptake in skeletal muscle during exercise remains difficult to evaluate with certainty. The transport of fatty acids across the outer mitochondrial membrane is likely the most critical step in controlling fatty acid flux through the β-oxidative pathway; recent studies demonstrated the inhibiting role of malonyl-CoA on the activity of carnitine-palmytoyl transferase-1, the key carrier of fatty acid transport across the outer mitochondrial membrane. However, it seems likely that factors other than changes in malonyl-CoA concentration are involved in the shift in fuel utilization from lipid to carbohydrate during progressively increasing exercise intensity. Finally, there is a strong interaction between carbohydrates and fatty acids; increasing fat availability decreases carbohydrate oxidation during exercise, and vice versa, mainly through the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. Several nutritional strategies have been suggested to potentially increase plasma fatty acid levels and up-regulate the mechanisms involved in transport and oxidation of fatty acids; however, only regular endurance training can be classified as being successful in this respect. Even, available data suggest that medium-chain triglyceride ingestion, together or not carbohydrate, is without detectable benefit for improving endurance performance. Future prospects. - The mechanisms regulating the shift in fat-to-carbohydrate utilization during progressively increasing exercise intensity, have not been thoroughly elucidated. This question remains of physiological and clinical relevance, first to enhance athletic performance, but above all for patients with dysmetabolism diseases who are exercised. © 2003 Elsevier SAS.

The rheological, crystalline, thermal, dynamic mechanical, and morphological characteristics of these blends were investigated. The viscosity of the blends was higher than PBT in the whole shear rate range. At low shear rate, the viscosity of blends decreased with LCP concentration. Higher percent crystallinity was observed with increasing LCP-g content in the blend with PBT. The thermal stability increased with LCP-g content in the blend with PBT. The relaxation phenomenon as observed from DMTA analysis was changing depending on the blend ratio. The variation of stiffness and storage modulus as a function of LCP-g concentration at various temperatures suggested the phase inversion occurred at 40% LCP-g present in the blend. The orientation of the LCP-g molecules probably play a major role in determining the surface morphology rather than the surface free energy difference.","DMTA; Liquid crystalline polymer; Percent crystallinity; Polybutylene terephthalate; Viscosity","Adhesion; Concentration (process); Crystalline materials; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Esterification; Free energy; Liquid crystal polymers; Mixing; Molecular dynamics; Morphology; Polybutenes; Relaxation processes; Thermal effects; Viscosity; Flexible matrix polymers; Interfacial adhesion; Polymer blends",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642443209

According to the stages of construction, the amplitudes of each tidal constituent, rather than the phases showed different variability patterns. The semidiurnal (M2 and S 2), and fourth-diurnal (M4 and MS4) amplitudes increased significantly post-dyke construction, whereas the diurnal (K 1 and O1) amplitudes decreased slightly post-seawall construction. That is, the semidiurnal and fourth-diurnal amplitudes were markedly affected by the dyke construction, and less affected by the construction of the two seawalls. In contrast, the diurnal amplitudes were little influenced by the dyke construction, and slightly influenced by the construction of the two seawalls. Three numerical simulations with different stages of construction reveal that an increase/advance in tidal amplitudes/phases in Mokpo Harbour is closely related to change in the MCZ from a choked coastal system to a non-choked system. Before the construction, amplitudes/phases inside the MCZ were lower/more delayed than those that are outside due to narrow channels in comparison with large capacity of water storage inside the MCZ. In addition to results of the numerical model, a simple analytic model showed that semidiurnal tides are more affected than the diurnal tides under the choked system because of their different frequencies. Tidal amplitudes increase in the shallow Youngam and Geumho Basins due to the shoaling effect, while remaining low in the Youngsan River Estuary due to intensive tidal dissipation within the river. The presence of the Aphae Channel, together with relatively active tidal dissipation in the Muan Basin accounts for the low amplitudes compared to those of the Youngam and Geumho Basins. Reduction in capacity of water storage induced by the series of constructions in the MCZ shifts the complex hydraulic system to a simple non-choked system. Therefore, the difference in tidal amplitudes and phases between inside and outside of the Mokpogu Channel was significantly reduced after construction. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The linear polycarbonate (PC-L) as reference and three branched polycarbonates (PC-Bs) have similar molecular weights and molecular weight distributions, while the PC-Bs have different branching degrees, below 0.7 branch points/chain and above twice of Mc. The long-chain branched polycarbonates exhibit higher zero-shear viscosities, more significant shear shinning, higher flow activation energies, and much longer relaxation times. It was also found that long-chain branches increase the elasticity of melt characterized by the steady-state recoverable compliance and the storage modulus. The 'dissident' rheological behavior of long-chain branching exhibiting mainly in addition polymers such as polyolefin, is confirmed in condensation polymers. These behaviors resulted from additional molecular entanglements of long-chain branches can be understood qualitatively in terms of the tube model for topological constraints. The dielectric α-relaxation of linear polycarbonate and branched polycarbonates has been fitted with Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-Hesse (VFTH) equation and the shape of relaxation time curves is also analyzed. The long-chain branched polycarbonates present longer relaxation times, but divergent α-relaxation temperatures, because the latter is dominated by the free volume. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The electricity load in the municipality is provided for by the CHP plant and electricity bought from the Nordic electricity market. It is therefore desirable to produce as much electricity as possible during periods when the price of electricity is high. The variations in the price of electricity over a 24-h period are significant. The idea presented in this paper is that heat storage can be used to maximise the amount of electricity produced in the CHP plants during peak-price periods. It can also be used to minimise the use of plants with higher operational costs. For storing heat, both a hot-water accumulator at the CHP plant and storage in the building stock are suggested. The situation is analysed using a mixed integer linear-programming model and a case study is presented for the city of Linköping, a City of approximately 130,000 inhabitants, situated 200 km south of Stockholm in Sweden.

It is a control in the partitioning of energy and water related to evapotranspiration and runoff and thereby influences the hydrological response of an area. Characterizing the temporal and spatial distribution of soil moisture has important hydrologic applications, yet soil moisture varies in response to many processes acting over a variety of scales; the relative importance of different temporal and spatial controls on soil moisture is still poorly understood. In this paper we analyze both temporal and spatial soil moisture data empirically for two catchments in Australia and a further three in New Zealand. Hydrological conditions at these field sites covered a wide range over a 2 year period. The ground-based soil moisture data set is unique in its temporal and, in particular, its spatial coverage. Analyses attempt to isolate and quantify different deterministic sources of variability, measurement error, and a remaining unexplained component of variability. Because of limited data (especially relating to soils) we take a pragmatic approach of removing patterns that we can define in time and space (namely, seasonality and terrain) and then analyzing the unexplained variation. We then look for consistent patterns in this unexplained variability and argue that these are related to meteorological conditions, especially precipitation events, in the temporal case, and a combination of soils and vegetation in the spatial case. We were able to explain most of the observed variance in time and space, and the temporal variance was typically 5 times larger than spatial variance. Seasonality is the dominant source of temporal variability at our sites, although this conclusion obviously depends on climate and does not hold where soil water storage is limited. Most importantly, in controlling the distribution of soil moisture in space, the spatial distribution of soils and vegetation seems to be of similar importance to that of topography, a fact often ignored in hydrological modeling, or else surrogate soils patterns are used, but these are often not well correlated to the actual patterns [Grayson and Blöschl, 2000]. Better methods for defining the spatial properties of soils and vegetation as they affect soil moisture patterns are a key challenge.","Seasonality; Soil moisture; Spatial variability; Temporal variability","Catchments; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Hydrology; Moisture determination; Runoff; Vegetation; Hydrological cycle; Spatial distribution; Soil testing; catchment; hydrological modeling; soil moisture; spatial variation; temporal variation; Australasia; Australia; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642307220

The analyses by medium-angle powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and vis-Raman spectroscopy showed that the Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 powders were solid solutions of pure tetragonal phase, whether as-prepared at 160 °C or calcined at 773-1273 K. By low-angle PXRD and transmission electron microscopy, the as-prepared Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 showed a short-range ordered mesostructure probably as a result of the natural agglomeration of uniform nanoparticles upon hydrothermal treatment. The as-prepared powders had high surface areas (232-281 m2 g-1) and narrow pore size distributions (3.5-4.0 nm), according to the measurements of nitrogen adsorption. After calcining at 773 K, this mesostructure was retained to some degree with lower surface areas (66-75 m2 g-1) and larger pore sizes (5.1-7.2 nm). Determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the numbers of oxygen vacancies (0.025-0.037) on the nanocrystalline surface was high for both as-prepared and calcined Ce0.2Zr0.8O2. UV-vis absorption measurements showed that the band gap energy of the as-prepared Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 nanocrystals was distinctly blue-shifted compared with the bulk value due to the quantum size effect. The catalytic tests demonstrated that the Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 nanosized powders synthesized at 160 °C showed higher thermal stability in terms of surface area and phase composition, and higher catalytic activity for CO conversion than that synthesized at 140 °C. Among all the catalysts tested, the mesostructured one with the highest surface area and the largest pore volume displayed the highest oxygen storage capacity of 233 µmol CO g-1 at 773 K, and the lowest 50% conversion temperature of 641 K. © the Owner Societies.",,"carbon monoxide; cerium; urea; zirconium oxide; adsorption; article; catalysis; light absorption; nanoparticle; porosity; Raman spectrometry; synthesis; transmission electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray powder diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642304792

Due to high energy costs the islands are proving to be excellent test beds for the introduction of new technologies, and some islands are trying to become so-called renewable islands, to satisfy their energy demand mainly or entirely from indigenous and renewable sources, thus increasing the security of supply, and employment opportunities, without necessarily increasing the costs. Islands that have energy sources, such as hydro or geothermal energy, can easily integrate them into the power system, but those with mainly intermittent renewable energy sources are confronted with the necessity of energy storage. The most promising technologies are reversible hydro where geography allows, and storing hydrogen where it does not. The stored hydrogen can later be used for electricity production, and also for transport. This paper describes the H2RES model for optimisation of integration of hydrogen usage with intermittent renewable energy sources on the example of an isolated island in the Madeira archipelago, Porto Santo. It shows that it is possible to significantly increase the penetration of renewable energy sources, albeit at a relatively high cost, with hydrogen storage technology. The H2RES model, which includes reversible hydro and batteries as storage technologies, can serve as a valuable tool for island energy planning. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We discuss the energetics of electron injection in such an artificial solid consisting of weakly coupled quantum dots. We show that quantum confinement and electron–electron repulsion determine the charging characteristics. The electron–electron repulsion energy can be screened by three-dimensional charge compensation from trapped holes or positive inert ions inserted in the assembly. We present experimental results on the electron storage and long-range transport in assemblies of ZnO nanocrystals in which the electron charge is compensated by positive ions. The electron–electron repulsion energy in assemblies permeated with an aqueous electrolyte solution is strongly screened. In contrast, the repulsion energy is about 100 meV in aprotic solvents; the repulsion energy strongly influences electron storage and the characteristics of long-range electron transport. © 2004 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"aqueous solution; colloid; conference paper; electron transport; energy transfer; ionic strength; nanoparticle; quantum chemistry; solid state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542327538

This paper explores to what extent some of these theoretical advantages are realized in two collaborative housing units in a major Swedish city. Food-related energy use and waste flows were measured and compared with results from food service institutions and some data relevant for households. Results show that energy use for cooking decreases in collaborative houses compared with households but energy use for food storage increases. Plate and food preparation wastes are low in the studied collaborative houses but food leftovers may be abundant. The latter result depends on how the dining system is organized. A bottleneck for improving the environmental efficiency in collaborative housing is the static view of apartment design held by many architects and real estate owners. Another bottleneck may be the unwillingness of households to make advance commitments to daily dining.

This is a promising process for the conversion of solar radiation to its chemical form and storage. When carbon is used as a reducing agent, the main product gases are zinc, CO, and CO2. A major problem is the need for rapid cooling and separation of the zinc to avoid back reaction and reoxidation. In industry, lead splash condenser is used to remove the zinc vapor rapidly. The lead is circulated out of the condenser and chilled, so that the solubility of the dissolved zinc is reduced and part of the molten zinc is separated and floats on the lead. Because lead is capable of dissolving only a small amount of zinc, the amount of lead to be circulated is about 400 times as much as the amount of produced zinc. This technology is complicated and cumbersome. This paper describes a new approach for two-step process for the reduction of ZnO that can potentially solve this problem. The two-step process can be characterized by the following equations: ZnO(s)+Fe(l)→Zn(g)+FeO(l), ΔH0=177 kJ/mol, FeO(l)+C(s)→Fe(l)+CO(g), ΔH0=153 kJ/mol. Both steps are endothermic, require temperatures in the range of 1300-1600 °C, and can be carried out using concentrated solar energy. In the first step, iron reduces ZnO and Zn vapors are distilled out (zinc is miscible in iron, but at the relevant temperatures, and at atmospheric pressure it volatilizes). In the second step, carbon is injected into the FeO melt and reduces it back to iron. The CO obtained in the second step is separated from the zinc vapors. Basically, this is a gasification process. The carbon is converted to CO. When using coal, the ashes form slag on the surface of the melt and can be removed. The advantages of this process compared to the direct carboreduction are: (i) high rates of heat and mass transfer mechanisms between the iron melt and the ZnO powder; (ii) avoiding the necessary preparation of the feed as required in the direct process, mixing ZnO and carbon in a measured proportion, preparation of briquettes; if ZnO is recycled from zinc/air batteries, there is no need for size reduction and, in principle, large-size fractions can be processed; (iii) avoiding the major difficulty of separation of the CO and providing the possibility for simpler zinc condenser compared to the lead splash condenser. The process has higher thermodynamic gain and higher contribution of solar radiation. This paper analyzes the thermodynamics of the two-step process and compares it to the direct carboreduction of ZnO. The kinetics and mechanism of the reactions are discussed. Experimental results with solar energy for the first step are described. A mixture of ZnO and iron was heated at the Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS) solar furnace. At 1600 °C, 90% of the theoretical yield was obtained after 5 min of testing. The zinc vapors were condensed and X-ray diffraction analysis showed very high purity of zinc and crystalline. The second step is known in the literature. Finely divided carbonaceous materials, e.g. coal are injected into the FeO melt (which floats above the iron as it forms). The coal is dissolved in the FeO and reduces it, thus creating CO gas. The gasification of coal takes place very rapidly owing to the high temperature, the carbon content of the melt and the mixing created by the evolving gas. A conceptual scheme of the solar reactor is shown. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The same characteristics of the deformation process were measured for a copper single crystal under similar deformation conditions. The measurements were performed for the samples at room temperature in the mode of uniaxial compression using a new deformation calorimeter. Energy storage in polymer glasses was found to begin immediately after the region of Hookean elasticity, well before the macroscopic yield point. At the earliest stages of inelastic deformation, 100% of the work of external forces is transformed into the internal energy stored in the sample. At a total strain of εdef ≈ 8-10%, this part decreases to 60-80% of the deformation work, whereas the remaining 20-40% of the external work is converted into the deformation heat. For the copper single crystal, the situation is completely different: immediately after the region of the Hookean elasticity, almost all the external work of the deformation is dissipated into heat. This difference in the thermodynamic behavior of polymer glasses and copper indicates a crucial difference in the inelastic deformation mechanisms of the two different classes of solids: perfect metallic crystals and disordered organic polymer glasses. A comparison of the early and moderate (after the yield tooth) deformation stages shows that, as soon as an inelastic response appears in the polymer (in polymer glasses, at εdef = 2-3%), the key mechanism controlling the total kinetics of the process is the nucleation of localized inelastic shear transformations. It is the nucleation and accumulation of such transformations that is responsible for the storage of internal energy, which is typical of the deformation of glassy polymers. In the postyield region, new shear transformations are also initiated; however, the kinetics of plasticity may be controlled in this case by an alternative process, such as merging, or coalescence, of new and existing shear transformations. At all stages of loading, polymer glasses experience conformational rearrangements in chains. The number of new conformers in the sample increases with ε def. However, since the conformational rearrangements occur quite easily, they do not limit the overall kinetics of plasticity. Conformational rearrangements in chains only accompany the basic deformation microprocess, namely, the nucleation and coalescence of shear transformations. Usually a marked heat release appears during active loading at strains somewhat below the macroscopic yield strain εy; the rate of this process increases with εdef. We attribute this deformation heat release to a relaxation of excited strain carriers, i.e., shear transformations. New chain conformers appear in a polymer during its active loading due to such a relaxation process. All the results of this work are consistent with the mechanism of inelastic deformations of glassy solids suggested in our earlier papers.",,"epoxide; poly(methyl methacrylate); polycarbonate; polymer; adsorption kinetics; article; calorimetry; conformational transition; cross linking; crystal structure; energy transfer; heat treatment; measurement; plasticity; room temperature; shear flow; solid state; thermodynamics; viscoelasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442326717

The direct dissociation of SnOx without any reducing substances needs temperatures T&gt;2000 K at 1 bar. In the presence of CH4 or C, SnOx can be reduced at T&lt;1250 K. The production of H2 from Sn, SnO and H2O is investigated. A real overall solar yield η real is defined which compares the output of real fuel cells, fed by solar-produced chemicals, with the total solar input necessary to produce these chemicals. ηreal is then used to find the most promising thermochemical reaction of the system SnO2/SnO/Sn+C/ CH4. The optimal reaction is SnO2+2CH4 ↔Sn+2CO+4H2, proceeding at 980 K (Δr G=-60 kJ), which is followed by Sn+2H2O↔SnO2 +2H2. CO and H2 are then fed to fuel cells producing electricity with ηreal=0.23. The amount of solar upgrading of the fossil fuels CH4 and C is given. A combination of solar reactor, heat recovery device and a following reactor to produce H2 is proposed.

The increasing availability of families artificially selected for faster growth has enabled physiological experiments to investigate the genetic basis for variable rates of growth. Fast growth is achieved by a combination of increased rates of feeding, reduced metabolic rates and lower metabolic costs of growth. In at least one species there is a trade-off between growth in protein and the storage of lipids that are utilized in gametogenesis. Energy requirements for maintenance are also higher in slow-growing individuals. Reduced costs of growth are due in part to increased efficiencies of protein turnover. Nevertheless, high protein turnover (and therefore high metabolic cost) may benefit fitness in the later stages of gametogenesis. Faster feeding rates do not impair flexibility in feeding behavior which compensates for changes in the food environment. Both inter- and intraspecies differences in feeding behavior are evident and suggest possible constraints imposed by faster feeding on the efficiency of selection between food particles of different nutritional value.",,"Bivalvia; Mollusca",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13844296793

In this study, we applied a short-term preservation of the TLM to human pancreata after prolonged cold ischemia prior to islet isolation, and investigated the mechanisms of resuscitation of the ischemically damaged human pancreas by the TLM. Human pancreata were procured from cadaveric donors and preserved by the TLM for 3.2 ± 0.5 h after 11.1 ± 0.9 h of cold storage in UW (TLM group), or by cold UW alone for 11.0 ± 0.3 h (UW group). Islet isolations of all pancreata were performed using the Edmonton protocol. Islet recovery and in vitro functional viability of isolated islets were significantly increased in the TLM group compared with the UW group. According to the criteria of the Edmonton protocol, 10/14 cases (71%) in the TLM group were transplanted to patients with type I diabetes mellitus compared with only 5/21 cases (24%) in the UW group. In the metabolic assessment of human pancreata, levels of energetic parameters (ATP, total adenylates, and energy charge) were significantly increased, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly decreased after the TLM preservation. There was no observable change in the incidence or degree of mitochondrial injury after the TLM preservation. Additional short-term storage by the TLM resuscitates the ischemically damaged human pancreas by regenerating the energetic status and prevents further damage by oxidative stress, ultimately leading to improvements of islet recovery and in vitro function. Use of the TLM following prolonged storage in UW provides an excellent adjunctive protocol for treating human pancreata for the rigors of the islet isolation process.","Human islet isolation; Oxygenation; Pancreas preservation; Perfluorochemical; Two-layer method","adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; malonaldehyde; article; cell isolation; controlled study; cryopreservation; energy; human; human cell; human tissue; ischemia; organ preservation; oxidative stress; pancreas injury; pancreas islet cell; pancreas transplantation; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342288556

Regenerative thermal storage systems are used in many traditional applications, e.g. in steel-making processes. Supply of solar energy is uncontrollable due to cloud passages. The projected 10 MWe solar power plant PS10, to be built in Sanlúcar la Mayor, Spain, is based on the atmospheric air circuit technology. In order to qualify for a special energy price benefit, the plant must operate with solar energy input only. For a successful operation of the plant, the energy to the steam system must be controllable. During so lar transients, a regenerative thermal storage unit is to supply the hot air to the steam generator, until the solar power returns or a controlled plant shutdown is performed. New tools for the design of efficient storage units specifically for solar applications permit the definition of core elements that exhibit favourable heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics. With them, good use of the storage materials and consequently efficient storage unit designs can be achieved.

We infused normal rats with dexamethasone given intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) for 3 days. This resulted in hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, and marked insulin resistance. Similar metabolic defects were observed following i.c.v. infusion of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in normal rats. As central dexamethasone infusion enhanced NPY content in the arcuate nucleus, it suggested that its metabolic effects are mediated by NPY. Moreover, due to the lack of effects observed in vagotomized animals, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system by central dexamethasone infusion is proposed. Glucocorticoid action is known to involve prereceptor metabolism by enzymes such as 11β-HSD-1 that converts inactive into active glucocorticoids. Mice overexpressing 11β-HSD-1 in adipose tissue were shown to be obese and insulin resistant. We recently observed that adipose tissue 11β-HSD-1 mRNA expression is increased at the onset of high-fat diet-induced obesity and positively correlated with the degree of hyperglycemia. In human obesity, increased adipose tissue 11β-HSD-1 expression and activity were also reported. Resistin is a new adipose tissue-secreted hormone shown to play a role in glucose homeostasis by increasing hepatic glucose production and inhibiting muscle and adipose tissue glucose utilization. We observed increased adipose tissue resistin expression in the early phase of high-fat diet-induced obesity as well as decreased resistin expression in response to leptin. A positive correlation between glycemia and adipose tissue resistin expression further suggested a role of this hormone in the development of insulin resistance. The melanocortin system is another important player in the regulation of energy balance. Peripheral administration of a melanocortin agonist decreased food intake and body weight and favored lipid oxidation, effects that were more marked in obese than in lean rats. It is proposed that both resistin and melanocortin agonists may influence adipose tissue 11β-HSD-1, thereby decreasing or enhancing glucose metabolism. © 2004 Nature Publishing Group.","Glucocorticoids; Glucose metabolism; Insulin sensitivity; Melanocortin system; Neuropeptide y; Resistin","dexamethasone; glucocorticoid; glucose; melanocortin; melanocortin agonist; neuropeptide Y; resistin; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal tissue; arcuate nucleus; body weight; conference paper; controlled study; correlation analysis; energy balance; food intake; gene overexpression; glucose metabolism; homeostasis; hormonal regulation; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; hyperphagia; insulin resistance; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; metabolic disorder; mouse; nonhuman; parasympathetic nerve; pathophysiology; priority journal; steroid metabolism; vagotomy; 11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1; Adipose Tissue; alpha-MSH; Animals; Central Nervous System; Dexamethasone; Glucocorticoids; Glucose; Homeostasis; Hormones, Ectopic; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Mice; Neuropeptide Y; Rats; Resistin; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12444257790

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: Apparently healthy Japanese subjects with a body mass index (BMI) between 20 and 23.5 kg/m 2 (265 males and 741 females, age 21-69 y). MEASUREMENTS: BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) were measured. Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated by the Friedewald formula. Percentage fat mass (%FM) and trunk fat mass-leg fat mass ratio (FMtrunk/FMlegs) were obtained by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: WC, WHR, %FM and FMtrunk/FMlegs were significantly correlated with TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG with the tendency of FMtrunk/FMlegs to show the strongest correlations. For %FM and FMtrunk/FMlegs in both sexes, odds ratios (ORs) of the third tertiles with respect to the first tertiles increased for LDL-C elevation, TG elevation and dyslipidemia. In males, ORs of the third fertiles of WC were significantly high for LDL-C elevation and dyslipidemia whereas those of WHR were high for TG elevation and dyslipidemia. ORs of the third tertiles of WC and WHR were significantly high for TG elevation in females. BMI was not associated with the risk of abnormal lipid levels. ORs for hypertension showed significant increases in none of the variables of obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Excess accumulation of FM, especially to the upper body, was related to dyslipidemia in normal-weight subjects. Simple anthropometric variables, WC and WHR, may be useful for screening and management of dyslipidemia in these subjects.","Cardiovascular risk factor; Lipid; Metabolically obese; Normal body weight; Upper-body obesity; Waist","adult; anthropometry; article; body fat; body mass; body weight; case report; cholesterol blood level; correlation analysis; diastolic blood pressure; dyslipidemia; female; human; hypertension; Japan; lipid blood level; lipid storage; male; normal human; obesity; priority journal; systolic blood pressure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242306692

The effects of storage (temperature and humidity) and moulding pressure on the polymorphic transition of CPM in HP-β-CyD matrix were investigated, in comparison with those of the CPM polymorphs, Form A (stable form) and Form C (metastable form). The formation of an amorphous complex of CPM with HP-β-CyD was confirmed by powder X-ray diffractometry and differential scanning calorimetry. During storage at various temperature and humidity conditions, the metastable Form C of CPM converted to the stable Form A, where the conversion proceeded according to the Jander equation with an activation energy of 51 kJ/mol (25-60°C) and a reaction-order of 1.55 with respect to water content (relative humidity (RH) 20-75%). No polymorphic transition of Form A crystals was observed under the experimental conditions. In the case of the amorphous HP-β-CyD complex, Form C crystals were slowly produced, but the further conversion of the resulting Form C to Form A was markedly suppressed in HP-β-CyD matrix. Upon compression (2000 kg/cm2), Forms A and C were converted to amorphous CPM in a major portion and Forms C and A, respectively, in a minor portion. The polymorphic transition behavior was clearly reflected in the dissolution rate of CPM, i.e., (1) the dissolution rate was in the order of HP-β-CyD complex &gt; Form C &gt; Form A, and (2) the dissolution rate of Forms A and C after the compression increased because of the conversion to amorphous state, while the complex maintained the fast dissolving property even after the compression. The results indicated that HP-β-CyD is useful not only for converting crystalline CPM to an amorphous substance, but also for maintaining the metastable form with fast dissolution rate, Form C, over a long period.","2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin; Chlorpropamide; Humidity; Moulding pressure; Polymorphic transition; Temperature","2 hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin; chlorpropamide; oral antidiabetic agent; complex formation; compression; conference paper; crystal structure; crystallization; drug solubility; drug storage; humidity; pressure; spray drying; structure analysis; temperature dependence; X ray diffraction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12344279022

The ratio of non-magnetic to magnetic zones in the LHC is close to 3%. Such a low percentage leads to a very compact design of systems and sub-systems situated in the interconnections, like the mechanical compensation system, composed of the bellows expansion joints, that have to compensate for the thermal contraction of the magnets. Given the complexity of the LHC interconnections, the requirements concerning their reliability were considerably increased since the availability of the collider for physics cannot be compromised. The failure modes taken into account in the present analysis are grouped into 3 categories: material failures, structural stability failures and fatigue failures. Optimisation of stainless steel for cryogenic applications has been carried out.

Forty 4-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (n = 10) were fed either a normal diet (10 kcal fat%) or high fat diet (60 kcal fat%) given with or without oral administration of A. senticosus extract (ASE; 0.5 g/kg of body weight) for 12 weeks. Feed consumption was not different among the groups, but energy intake was higher in the groups fed high fat diets than in the groups fed normal diets. Body weight gain, abdominal fat accumulation, and serum leptin concentrations were significantly higher in the high fat-fed groups than the other groups. Animals fed the high fat diet had significantly higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in serum and higher triglyceride accumulation in liver, but the ASE supplement restored both to the same levels as in the animals fed low fat diets. Total carnitine concentration were not significantly different between the two diet groups; also the oral administration of ASE did not alter carnitine status. Accordingly, the current results suggest the oral administration of ASE seemed to lower the weight gain, serum LDL-cholesterol concentration, and liver triglycerides accumulation in mice with obesity induced by high fat diets. These results seemed to suggest that supplementation with ASE might have a role in the prevention of obesity in high fat-fed mice.","abdominal fat; Acanthopanax senticosus; Adipogenicity; Leptin; Lipid profiles","carnitine; Eleutherococcus senticosus extract; leptin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; abdomen; amino acid blood level; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; caloric intake; cell culture; cell suspension; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; drug effect; drug synthesis; Eleutherococcus senticosus; feeding; food intake; hormone blood level; lipid diet; lipid storage; liver level; low fat diet; male; mouse; mouse strain; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; weight gain; Acanthopanax; Animalia; Eleutherococcus; Eleutherococcus senticosus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11844294620

The uptake of both substrates shared some similar characteristics. In particular, the absorption in both cases was controlled by an active process as evidenced by the inhibitory effect of CCCP and inhibitors of ATPases (DES, DCCD, orthovanadate). Both absorptions also involved the thiol and histidyl groups of protein carriers included in the plasmalemma as shown by treatment with specific compounds (PCMBS, mersalyl, NEM) inhibiting the transport of the nutrients in tissues and in purified PMV. However, it was shown that these uptakes present major differences. Firstly, unlike sucrose uptake, valine uptake was very sensitive to transmembrane electrical potential. Indeed, hyperpolarizing treatment with FC increased valine uptake but did not modify sucrose uptake. By contrast, treatment with high concentrations of KCl, which should result in depolarization of the cells, considerably decreased valine uptake and activated sucrose uptake. Secondly, ion mobilizations were different in the two types of transport. Unlike sucrose, application of valine to tissues strongly modified the time course of H + influx. By contrast, sucrose uptake was controlled by K+ involvement as shown by effects either of modulators of K+ mobilization (LiCl, TEA) or of treatments inducing K+ starvation from the external medium. © 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

An ability to accurately forecast the natural inflow can result in the increased production of electric energy as a result of an enhanced flexibility in the management of the stored water. In this article a novel methodology for building an efficient short-term water-inflow forecaster using neural network techniques is presented. The emphasis is given to a precise definition of the problem and the tailoring of the problem-solving requirements to specific case conditions. The proposed methodology was applied to the River Soča cascade hydroelectric system. The efficiency of the algorithm was evaluated in terms of the reduction in the amount of water spillage and the enhanced production-planning accuracy.

Most high-frequency power factor correctors use resistor emulation to achieve a near-unity power factor and a small line current distortion. This technique requires forcing the input current with an average-current-mode control to follow the input voltage. Stability of this system was discussed previously by using some linear models. However, in this paper, two nonlinear phenomena have been encountered in the PFC circuit, period doubling bifurcation and chaos. Detection of these new instability phenomena in the stable regions predicted by the prior linear PFC models makes us more susceptible towards them, and reveals the need to consider a nonlinear models. A nonlinear model performing the practical operation of a boost PFC converter has been developed. Then, a simplified and accurate nonlinear model has been proposed and verified experimentally. As a result from this model, instability maps have been introduced to determine the boundary between stable and unstable operating ranges. Then, the period doubling bifurcation has been studied through a new proposed technique based on the capacitor storage energy. It is cleared that, As the load lessens, a required extra storage power is needed to achieve the significant increase in the output voltage. Then, if the PFC system can provide this extra energy, the operation can reach stability with new zero-storage energy else the system will have double-line zero energy that is period doubling bifurcation.","Bifurcation; Chaos; Low frequency instability; Nonlinear analysis; Power-factor-correction converter","Codes (standards); Electric loads; Electric power systems; Frequencies; Linear systems; Topology; Waveform analysis; Bifurcation; Low frequency instability; Nonlinear analysis; Power factor correction converters; Power converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144342228

This is evident in current discussions of environmental risks related to global climate change, biotechnology and the use and storage of nuclear energy. The aim of this paper is to consider more closely how uncertainty affects our moral responsibility to future generations, and to what extent moral agents can be held responsible for activities that inflict risks on future people. It is argued that our moral responsibility to posterity is limited because our ability to foresee how present decisions and activities will affect future people is limited. The reason for this is primarily that we are in a situation of ignorance regarding the pace and direction of future scientific and technological development. This ignorance reduces our responsibility in a temporal dimension because in most areas it is impossible to predict the interests and resource needs of future generations. In one area, however, we have fairly reliable knowledge about future people. It is reasonable to assume that future human beings will have the same basic physiological (physical and biological) needs as we have. On this basis, it is argued that we can be held responsible for activities causing avoidable damage to critical resources that are necessary to provide for future physiological needs. Furthermore, it is suggested that it is prima facie immoral to impose risks upon future generations in cases where the following conditions are fulfilled: (1) the risk poses a threat to the ability of future generations to meet their physiological needs, and (2) the risk assessment is supported by scientifically based harm scenarios. © 2004 The White Horse Press.","Environmental risks; Future generations; Moral responsibility; Reasonable and unreasonable risks; Uncertainty","attitudinal survey; environmental values; ethics; risk factor; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10844226664

A kinetic model evaluated from calorimetric data gives a reliable basis for implementing the analysis by means of numerical simulation. The purpose of this paper is to discuss some features of the approach as applied to such typical problems as determination of critical conditions of thermal explosion and the self accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT) for solid and liquid reactive chemicals. First a brief survey of some popular simplified theories is discussed to reveal their main limitations. Second the mathematical models of thermal explosion in solid and liquid reacting systems are presented followed by a basic sketch of the numerical methods chosen to solve the problems. Finally the practical usefulness of the kinetics-based simulation approach for analysing the influence of various factors on explosion development is illustrated with several examples. The discussed models and methods were included in the ThermEx and ConvEx program packages developed by CISP. All the presented results were obtained by means of this software.","Numerical simulation; Reaction hazard; Thermal explosion","Accident prevention; Activation energy; Chemical analysis; Computer simulation; Decomposition; Gas hazards; Temperature distribution; Thermal effects; Liquid reacting systems; Reaction hazards; Self accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT); Thermal explosion; Explosions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10644277297

Much work has been done to improve the properties of carbon materials as to enhance their absorption capacity towards gases. Recent developments have resulted in the discovery of novel carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes. Numerous researches have shown that carbon nanotubes have excellent capacity for hydrogen storage. However, significant research has been undertaken to further improve the adsorption capacity through the advancement in synthesis methods for the fabrication of carbon nanotubes. Among the starting material widely employed for synthesis of carbon nanotubes is high purity graphite. Therefore, purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of thermal treatment on several synthetic graphites. Thermal treatment was conducted at temperatures ranging from 400 800°C at different dwelling times. The morphology and surface analysis of the graphites were examined using Scanning Electron Microscope and nitrogen gas adsorption techniques, respectively. It was found that temperature, time and conditions of treatment significantly change the surface structure of the graphites. A decrease in particle size was observed due to the release of internal surface area.","Carbon materials; Carbon nanotubes; Graphite; Thermal treatment","Artificial graphite; Carbon nanotubes; Chemical vapor deposition; Corrosion resistance; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Gas adsorption; Heat conduction; Laser ablation; Scanning electron microscopy; Solid oxide fuel cells; Strength of materials; Carbon materials; Nongraphitic carbon; Nonmetal properties; Heat treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10644239966

It is found that the activity, discharge capacity and high rate dischargeability of the alloys are improved after physical and chemical modification as a result of the increase of the surface area and formation of the electrocatalysis layers, which increase both the electrochemical reaction rate on the alloy surface and H diffusion rate in the alloy bulk. It is also found that both the over-coarse and over-fine particle size increase the contact resistance of the electrode, resulting in a decrease of discharge capacity, deterioration of high rate dischargeability and lower discharge plateau. In another word, a suitable particle size distribution can enhance the alloy activity, discharge capacity and high rate dischargeability. In addition, the high rate dischargeability is enhanced by increasing La content and decreasing Ce content of the alloy composition because of enlargement of the unit cell volume and the improvement of the surface activity. Moreover, B additive results in the formation of the second phase, and makes the alloys easier pulverization, which greatly improves the activity, discharge capacity and high rate dischargeability.","Activity; Discharge capacity; High rate dischargeability; Hydrogen storage alloy; Rare earths; Storage energy technology","Additives; Boron; Cerium; Composition; Hydrogen; Lanthanum; Particle size analysis; Rare earth elements; Surface treatment; Activity; Boron additives; Discharge capacity; High rate dischargeability; Hydrogen storage alloy; Particle size distribution; Rare earth composition; Storage energy technology; Gas fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444238656

Preliminary screening evaluations were conducted by using a dropping-test method. Propulsive performances of the combinations having passed satisfying dropping-test requirements were then investigated on a specially designed thrust engine. The results revealed that short ignition delay and reliable propulsion performances could be acquired in both steady-state and pulse-mode operations, and the combination of kerosene with additives and H2O2 of 90% concentration could still have good performances after 3 months storage time.

By contrast, thermal processes such as pyrolysis have typically been used only for energy recovery. One such technology has demonstrated at commercial scale that all of the energy in sludge can be beneficially recovered and reused. No attempt was however made to recover and reuse sludge nutrients. There are many potential benefits of using pyrolysis for both energy and nutrient recovery. Firstly, unlike digestion, the principal energy product is oil, which can readily be stored and used when required, ensuring that energy recovery is maximised. Secondly is that the sludge nutrients are recovered in the pyrolysis char. Laboratory soil incubation studies using char from the Subiaco demonstration plant were conducted over an eight-week period to confirm nutrient availability. Results from this study showed that the phosphorus in the char is plant available although the nitrogen was insoluble. Based on these results it appears that there is potential to use pyrolysis as an effective means to recover and reuse both the energy and the very valuable phosphorus present in sewage sludges. © IWA Publishing 2004.","Biosolids; Energy recovery; Nutrient recovery; Pyrolysis; Sewage sludge","Anaerobic digestion; Electric power generation; Phosphorus; Pyrolysis; Sewage sludge; Soils; Biosolids; Char; Nutrients; Thermal processes; Electric energy storage; nitrogen; oil; phosphorus; digestion; Pyrolysis; Sewage; sludge; Wastewater treatment; anaerobic digestion; article; biotechnology; computer program; controlled study; energy balance; energy recovery; incubation time; land use; nutrient availability; pyrolysis; recycling; sludge treatment; soil analysis; solubility; thermal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10244234179

Adipose tissue has been considered for a long time as only a passive organ for the storage of excess energy in the form of fat. However, compelling evidence gathered during the last decades has revealed adipocytes as extremely active endocrine secretory cells playing a relevant role in the regulation of metabolism, reproduction, immunity, blood pressure, fibrinolysis, coagulation, and angiogenesis, among others. An extensive cross talk at a local and systemic level in response to specific external stimuli or metabolic changes underpins the multifunctional characteristics of fat cells, which rely on their ability to secrete a large number of hormones, growth factors, enzymes, cytokines, complement factors, and matrix proteins, collectively termed as adipokines or adipocytokines, at the same time expressing receptors for most of these factors. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was designed to investigate the ANS activity in lean and obese children, focusing on the differences in physical activity levels. SUBJECTS: This study was performed on 1080 school children initially recruited to the present study. In all, 24 physically active and 24 inactive obese children (≥120% of the standard body weight) were chosen as samples. Then, 24 lean-active and 24 lean-inactive children, who were matched individually in age, gender, height, and the amount of sports activity, were carefully selected from the remaining children. MEASUREMENTS: Physical activity was classified as the frequency of participation in after-school sports activities (active; ≥3 times per week, inactive; nothing). The ANS activities were measured during the resting condition by means of heart rate (HR) variability power spectral analysis, which enables us to identify separate frequency components, that is, low frequency (LF; 0.03-0.1 5 Hz), reflecting mixed sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity, high frequency (HF; 0.1 5-0.5 Hz), mainly associated with PNS activity, and total power (TP; 0.03-0.5 Hz), evaluating the overall ANS activity. The spectral powers were log transformed for statistical testing. RESULTS: The lean-active group demonstrated lower resting HR as well as significantly higher TP, LF, and HF powers compared to the remaining groups. In contrast, the obese-inactive group showed significantly lower TP (P<0.05 vs the remaining groups), LF (P<0.05 vs the lean groups), and HF power (P<0.05 vs the lean groups), respectively. The obese-active and lean-inactive groups were nearly identical in all spectral parameters. The correlation analysis revealed that TP among 48 inactive children was significantly and negatively associated with the percentage of body fat (r= -0.53, P< 0.001); however, such correlation among 48 active children was modest (r=-0.33, P= 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that obese children possess reduced sympathetic as well as parasympathetic nervous activities as compared to lean children who have similar physical activity levels. Such autonomic reduction, associated with the amount of body fat in inactive state, might be an etiological factor of onset or development of childhood obesity.

Forest management, cropland management, grazing land management and re-vegetation are allowable activities under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. Soil carbon sinks (and sources) can, therefore, be included under these activities. In this paper, the role of croplands in the European carbon budget and the potential for carbon sequestration in European croplands are reviewed. The global context is then considered. Croplands are estimated to be the largest biospheric source of carbon lost to the atmosphere in Europe each year, but the cropland estimate is the most uncertain among all land-use types. It is estimated that European croplands (for Europe as far east as the Urals) lose 300MtC per year. The mean figure for the European Union is estimated to be 78 (S.D. 37)MtC per year. There is significant potential within Europe to decrease the flux of carbon to the atmosphere from cropland, and for cropland management to sequester soil carbon, relative to the amount of carbon stored in cropland soils at present. The biological potential for carbon storage in European (EU15) cropland is of the order of 90-120MtC per year with a range of options available including reduced and zero tillage, set-aside, perennial crops and deep rooting crops, more efficient use of organic amendments (animal manure, sewage sludge, cereal straw, compost), improved rotations, irrigation, bioenergy crops, extensification, organic farming, and conversion of arable land to grassland or woodland. The sequestration potential, considering only constraints on land-use, amounts of raw materials and available land, is up to 45MtC per year. The realistic potential and the conservative achievable potentials may be considerably lower than the biological potential due to socioeconomic and other constraints, with a realistically achievable potential estimated to be about 20% of the biological potential. As with other carbon sequestration options, potential impacts on non-CO2 trace gases need to be factored in. If carbon sequestration in croplands is to be used in helping to meet emission reduction targets for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, the changes in soil carbon must be measurable and verifiable. Changes in soil carbon can be difficult to measure over a five-year commitment period and this has implications for Kyoto accounting and verification. Currently, most countries can hope to achieve only a low level of verifiability during the first commitment period, whilst those with the best-developed national carbon accounting systems will be able to deliver an intermediate level of verifiability. Very stringent definitions of verifiability would require verification that would be prohibitively expensive for any country. Carbon sequestration in soil has a finite potential and is non-permanent. Soil carbon sequestration is a riskier long-term strategy for climate mitigation than direct emission reduction and can play only a minor role in closing carbon emission gaps by 2100. However, if atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are to be stabilised at reasonable levels (450-650ppm), drastic reductions in carbon emissions will be required over the next 20-30 years. Given this, carbon sequestration should form a central role in any portfolio of measures to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the next 20-30 years, whilst new energy technologies are developed and implemented. Given that improved agricultural management often has a range of other environmental and economic benefits in addition to climate mitigation potential, such ""win-win"" strategies to improve soil carbon storage are attractive and should be implemented as part of integrated sustainability policies. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The formed cross-links are nonpermanent and somewhat dynamic in nature because the cross-linking reaction is governed by a complexation equilibrium. Gelation processes are traced by dynamic viscoelastic measurements to examine the effects of Borax content, SPG concentration, temperature, salt concentration, salt type, and strain. The first-order kinetic model containing three parameters, t0 (induction time), 1/τc (gelation rate), and G′sat (saturated storage modulus), is successfully applied to describe the gelation of the SPG-Borax system. Gelation occurs faster at higher Borax content, higher SPG concentration, higher salt concentration, or lower temperature. Moreover the gelation is cation-type-specific. Storage modulus is a linear function of both Borax content and SPG concentration. The linear relationship between storage modulus and Borax content can be explained by a modified ideal rubber elasticity theory with a front factor α to take into account the presence of ineffective cross-links and the effect of SPG chain rigidity. On the other hand, the linear dependence of storage modulus on SPG concentration could be explained on the basis of chain-chain contacting behavior of extended SPG chains. Apparent activation energy and cross-linking enthalpy are calculated to be -74.5 and -32.4 kJ/mol for the present system. Strain sweep measurements manifest that the elasticity behavior of this gel starts to deviate from Gaussian-chain network at a small strain of 10%.",,"Activation energy; Complexation; Concentration (process); Crosslinking; Elasticity; Gelation; Salts; Strain; Viscoelasticity; Gel networks; Storage modulus; Gels; barium chloride; borate sodium; calcium chloride; cation; cesium chloride; lithium chloride; potassium chloride; rubber; schizophyllan; sodium chloride; chemical model; chemical reaction kinetics; complex formation; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cross linking; elasticity; energy; enthalpy; gel; gelation; low temperature; molecular stability; priority journal; review; rigidity; viscoelasticity; young modulus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0842279870

The elemental technologies covered include electrolyte membranes, electrode catalysts, fuel reforming and hydrogen storage, to be applied in next-generation PEFC systems whose operating temperature is 120°C or higher. The survey also asks experts to gauge the effect of R&D investment on the time required to develop a technology. Results are analyzed statistically to quantitatively compare success probabilities, time periods and the potential for R&D investment to reduce development time. The estimated net time period needed to reach performance and cost targets for both stationary and automotive PEFC systems averaged around 17 years.

During the resulting storage, the immature kerogen in the clay would be subjected to thermal stress and some of the products which could be generated might affect the efficiency of the geological barrier. The kerogen isolated from a representative clay sample, collected in the underground laboratory of the Nuclear Energy Research Centre at Mol (Belgium), was subjected to short heating at 300°C to examine the thermolabile fraction released. The fraction contains a wide variety of components including hydrocarbons, ketones, alkanoic acids, phenols, furans and pyrroles. Information about the origin of these compounds was obtained through comparison with the bitumen and with the previously examined pyrolysis products generated from the kerogen at higher temperature (400°C). The thermolabile fraction appears to correspond to ""free"" compounds trapped in the macromolecular structure of the kerogen and ""labile"" moieties linked by covalent bonds with a relatively low thermal stability. The study affords additional information on the sources and composition of the kerogen.

The climate change produced by the greenhouse gases, the inefficiency of the energy system or the lack of power supply infrastructure in most of the poor countries, the liberalization of the energy market and the development of new technologies in the field of distributed generation (DG) are the key factors of this revolution. It seems clear that the solution at the moment is the DG. The advantage of DG is the energy generation close to the demand point. It means that DG can lower costs, reduce emissions, or expand the energy options of the consumers. DG may add redundancy that increases grid security even while powering emergency lighting or other critical systems and reduces power losses in the electricity distribution. After the development of the different DG and high efficiency technologies, such as co-generation and tri-generation, the next step in the DG world is the interconnection of different small distributed generation facilities which act together in a DG network as a large power plant controlled by a centralized energy management system (EMS). The main aim of the EMS is to reach the targets of low emissions and high efficiency. The EMS gives priority to renewable energy sources instead of the use of fossil fuels. This new concept of energy infrastructure is referred to as virtual utility (VU). The VU can be defined as a new model of energy infrastructure which consists of integrating different kind of distributed generation utilities in an energy (electricity and heat) generation network controlled by a central energy management system (EMS). The electricity production in the network is subordinated to the heat necessity of every user. The thermal energy is consumed on site; the electricity is generated and distributed in the entire network. The network is composed of one centralized control with the EMS and different clusters of distributed generation utilities and heat storage tanks. Each of these clusters is controlled by a local management station (LMS). Every LMS has information about the requirements (heat, cold and electricity) of the users connected to its cluster and the state of the utilities and water level of the storage tanks in its cluster. The EMS receives the information from the LMSs and sets the electricity input or output of every cluster in the network. With the information ordered by the EMS, the LMS set the run or stand-by of the utilities of its cluster. The benefits of the VU are the optimization of the utilization yield of the whole network, the high reliability of the electricity production, the complete control of the network for achieving the main aim of the EMS, the high velocity for assuming quick changes in the demand of the system and high integration of renewable energy sources, plus the advantages of the DG. This paper indicates the state of the art of the VU concept, analyses the projects that are being developed in this field and considers the future of the VU concept. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Cogeneration; Conventional energy generation facilities; Distributed generation; Energy infrastructure; Energy management system; Low emissions; Renewable energy sources; Virtual utility","Electricity; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Greenhouses; Industrial emissions; Optimization; Power plants; Tanks (containers); Greenhouse gases; Virtual utility; Power generation; cogeneration; electricity generation; energy planning; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0442328532

This study investigated the effects of prolonged fasting-induced winter sleep on the fat and nitrogen metabolism of the species. Half of the animals were treated with continuous-release melatonin implants to induce artificial short photoperiod. Autumnal accumulation of fat was characterized by low plasma free fatty acid (FFA), diacylglycerol (DG), and triacylglycerol (TG) levels. After transition to winter catabolism, the circulating lipid levels increased due to enhanced lipolysis. Two months of fasting resulted in a steady 3.1 kg weight loss (28% of body mass, 0.47% day-1). Storage fat was mobilized during the winter sleep reflected by the elevated FFA and DG concentrations. The lowered insulin levels could be a stimulator for TG hydrolysis. The plasma total amino acid concentrations, urea levels, and urea-creatinine ratios decreased due to fasting, whereas ammonia and total protein concentrations remained stable. The effects of melatonin on energy metabolism were modest. The results indicate that the raccoon dog is well adapted to long-term wintertime fasting utilizing fat as the principal metabolic fuel. The species can maintain its protein catabolism constant for at least 60 days. Decreased cortisol and thyroid hormone concentrations may contribute to protein sparing.","Fasting; Lipids; Nitrogen metabolism; Nyctereutes procyonoides; Raccoon dog","amino acid; creatinine; diacylglycerol; fat; fatty acid; hydrocortisone; melatonin; nitrogen; thyroid hormone; triacylglycerol; urea; adaptation; animal; article; blood; Carnivora; diet restriction; dog; drug effect; metabolism; physiology; season; time; Adaptation, Physiological; Amino Acids; Animals; Carnivora; Creatinine; Diglycerides; Dogs; Fasting; Fats; Fatty Acids; Hydrocortisone; Melatonin; Nitrogen; Seasons; Thyroid Hormones; Time Factors; Triglycerides; Urea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0442298737

The storage system is composed of a number of rectangular channels for the flowing heat transfer fluid (HTF), separated by a phase change material (PCM). Using an enthalpy method, the melting of the PCM is solved. The forced convective heat transfer inside the channels was analysed by solving the energy equation, which was coupled with the heat conduction equation in the container wall. The velocity profile for the rectangular channel is given by an exact analytical solution. A numerical code based on the finite difference method was developed and validated by comparing numerical predictions with exact analytical solutions available in literature.

The radioactive nuclei are produced by projectile fragmentation at medium energies (400-800) AMeV, separated and stored in a medium energy storage ring. The antiprotons are produced with 30 GeV protons, accumulated, cooled, decelerated and stored at energies of about 5 MeV in a small storage ring. The medium energy radioactive beams are brought to head on collisions with the low energy antiproton beam in an interaction section of both rings. The coasting radioactive beam and the reaction products from the collisions with the antiprotons are observed with the Schottky noise frequency analysis method, which allows one to separate all reaction products and measure their production rates as well as the loss rate of the primary beam. From these observations, the total and partial reaction cross sections may be determined, even with a small number of rare ion species in the ring. An analysis of the total and partial reaction cross sections will allow to determine both 〈r p2〉 as well as 〈rn2〉 for nuclei far off the stability. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of the present study was to determine whether changes in energy substrates and antioxidants of semen extender could limit loss of quality and lipid content of turkey spermatozoa during storage. Spermatozoa were incubated in extenders based on Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender (BPSE) to which different energy substrates (acetate, pyruvate and hydroxybutyric acid) or antioxidant (Vitamin E) had been added. Semen was stored at 4°C for 48 h and changes in quality, phospholipid and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of semen were evaluated. Among the different substrates studied, only acetate was able to limit the loss of motility and ATP content after 48 h in vitro storage. Losses of spermatozoal phospholipids were similar when gametes were incubated in an extender without any substrate or in normal BPSE (784-675 nmol/10 9 spz versus 837-703 nmol/109 spz). However, motility and ATP content were significantly more affected after 48 h of storage in samples incubated without substrates than in BPSE (motility, 2.2 versus 0; ATP, 10 nmol/109 spz versus 3 nmol/109 spz). The addition of Vitamin E to the extender did not modify either the MDA or phospholipid content of fresh or stored spermatozoa, but increased the motility of stored semen. In conclusion, acetate is an essential substrate for in vitro storage. Spermatozoal phospholipids decreased during storage, but this did not seem to originate from metabolism of endogenous fatty acids. The positive effects of Vitamin E on semen storage did not originate from preservation of lipid oxidation. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Anaerobic digestion of pig and cattle manure in biogas reactors before outside storage might reduce the potential for CH 4 emissions. However, manure pre-stored at 15 to 20°C in buildings before anaerobic digestion may be a significant source of CH 4 and could reduce the potential CH4 production in the biogas reactor. Degradation of energy-rich organic components in slurry and emissions of CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) from aerobic and anaerobic degradation processes during pre-storage were examined in the laboratory. Newly mixed slurry was added to vessels and stored at 15 and 20°C for 100 to 220 d. During storage, CH4 and CO2 emissions were measured with a dynamic chamber technique. The ratio of decomposition in the subsurface to that at the surface indicated that the aerobic surface processes contributed significantly to CO2 emission. The measured CH4 emission was used to calculate the methane conversion factor (MCF) in relation to storage time and temperature, and the total carbon-C emission was used to calculate the decrease in potential CH 4 production by anaerobic digestion following prestorage. The results show substantial methane and carbon dioxide production from animal manure in an open fed-batch system kept at 15 to 20°C, even for short storage times, but the influence of temperature was not significant at storage times of &lt;30 d.

Therefore, detailed information about several physical magnitudes of the whole system are given along the time: ceramic brick temperature, electrical demand, heat fluxes, and indoor temperature. The main application of this load model has been oriented towards the simulation of the ETS device performances, in order to assess load management (LM) programs. The proposed model has been implemented and validated using data collected for the last two years in residential areas, in order to evaluate its accuracy and flexibility. Finally, a simulation case study is presented to show the possibilities of limiting and reducing the actual winter-peak by means of an LM program, proposed by the authors, that takes into account customer minimum comfort levels and the experimental data of residential load curve profiles.","Demand side; Electric thermal storage; Load models; Residential heating; Sustainable development","Electric load flow; Electric load management; Heating equipment; State space methods; Sustainable development; Thermoelectric equipment; Physically based load model; Residential electric thermal storage; Residential heating; Energy management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347603437

ANU dish technology, in which steam is collected across the field and run through large steam turbines, has not been commercialised. Emphasis in solar thermal electricity applications in two-axis tracking systems seems to be shifting to tower technology. Two central receiver towers are planned for Spain, and one for Israel. Our own multi-tower solar array (MTSA) technology has gained Australian Research Council funding for an initial single tower prototype in Australia of approximately 150 kW(e) and will use combined microturbine and PV receivers. Non-tracking systems are described of two diverse types, Chimney and evacuated tubes. Solar chimney technology is being proposed for Australia based upon German technology. Air is heated underneath a large glass structure of about 5 km in diameter, and passes up a large chimney through a wind turbine near the base as it rises. A company Enviromission Ltd. has been listed in Australia to commercialise the concept. Evacuated tubes are growing rapidly for domestic hot water heating in Europe and organic rankine cycle engines such as the Freepower 6 kW are being considered for operation with thermal energy developed by evacuated tube and trough systems. These may replace some PV in medium sized applications as they offer potential for inexpensive pressurised water storage for 24 h operation, and backup by fuels instead of generators. In the medium term there is a clear trend to creation of smaller sized systems which can operate on a retail electricity cost offset basis near urban and industrial installations. In the longer term large low cost plants will be necessary for large scale electricity and fuels production. Retrofit central generation solar plants offer a cost effective transition market which allows increased production rates and gradual cost reduction for large solar thermal plant. In the paper the author describes current funding systems in Europe, Australia, and the USA, and makes suggestions for more effective programmes of support. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Electric generators; Electric rates; Gas turbines; Mirrors; Pressurization; Rankine cycle; Solar cell arrays; Solar collectors; Steam turbines; Stirling engines; Thermoelectric power plants; Thermoelectricity; Solar thermal electricity; Solar energy; gas turbine; microtechnology; Solar power; technological development; wind turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347541237

These places are mostly outside the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) installations. DAE supplies such sources. The most important application of nuclear energy in DAE is in electricity generation through nuclear power plants. Fourteen such plants are operating and many new plants are at various stages of construction. In view of the above mentioned wide spread applications, Indian parliament through an Act, called Atomic Energy Act, 1964 created an autonomous body called Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) with comprehensive authority and powers. This Board issues codes, guides, manuals, etc., to regulate such installations so as to ensure safe use of such sources and personnel engaged in such installations and environment receives radiation exposures within the upper bounds prescribed by them. Periodic reports are submitted to AERB to demonstrate compliance of its directives. Health, Safety and Environment Group of Bhabha Atomic Research Centres, Mumbai carries out necessary surveillance and monitoring of all installations of the DAE on a routine basis and also periodic inspections of other installations using radiation sources. Some of the nuclear fuel cycle plants like nuclear power plants and fuel reprocessing involve large radioactive source inventories and have potential of accidental release of radio activity into the environment, an Environmental Surveillance Laboratory (ESL) is set up at each such site much before the facility goes into operation. These ESL's collect baseline data and monitor the environment throughout the life of the facilities including the de- commissioning stage. The data is provided to AERB and is available to members of the public. In addition, a multi-tier system of AERB permissions is in place to ensure that all aspects of safety have been considered before permission to operate is granted. The stages where permission of AERB is essential are site selection, design data, and several stages during construction and operation. The details required by AERB include provision for treatment and storage of radioactive waste, de-commissioning procedures and provision of costs. In addition to AERB, nuclear power plants have to comply with the requirements of Ministry of Environment and Forests and get their clearance. This is given on the basis of Environmental Impact Assessment Report which should satisfy the authorities that no ecological damage will be caused and the facility will not have adverse effect on the environment. In addition, the State Pollution Control Board where the facility is to be located has to permit the site of the plant for its proposed discharges into the environment. It is largely due to the above comprehensive regulatory controls that none of the plants in India had any accident during the last 3-4 decades of operation. The type of measurements carried out by the ESL's and results from a few typical ESL's will be presented. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Precision measurements of the characteristics of ortho- and para-positronium are certainly suited to help solving such fundamental questions. The method of positronium generation, based on a low energy positron storage ring equipped with an electron cooling system, gives the possibility to obtain monochromatic positronium fluxes with small angular spread. It has to be pointed out that the low energy positron storage ring together with a small antiproton ring can be used for a high intensity antihydrogen atom flux generator. With positronium fluxes in vacuum one can perform new original experiments without distortion, caused by the medium in traditional methods of positronium generation in a target.

The radiation distribution on the absorber of an asymmetric CPC collector with a flat bi-facial absorber is measured for three different absorber mounting angles using a photo diode. The annual optical efficiency factors and a relative measure of the annual collected energy are determined for collectors with the absorber fin thickness 0.5 and 1 mm, and for a collector with a teflon convection suppression film mounted around the absorber. With the local optical efficiency factors and the annual incident solar energy distribution considered, the analysis indicates that the energy gain for a mounting angle of 20° is higher than for a collector with 65° absorber mounting angle. The annual collected energy is increased with 6-8% if the absorber fin thickness is increased from 0.5 to 1 mm. The annual average optical efficiency factor is relatively independent of the absorber mounting angle. It was found to be 0.87-0.88 for a collector with a 0.5 mm thick absorber fin and 0.92 for a collector with a 1 mm thick absorber fin or for a collector with 0.5 mm thick absorber fin with a teflon convection suppression film added. The low annual average optical efficiency factor is not caused by the uneven irradiance distribution but by the relatively high UL-values. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Thirty-one male Wistar rats were divided into 40% energy restricted (n=24) or ad libitum-fed control (CL) rats (n = 7). The energy-restricted rats were grouped into the most fat (MF, n=7), medium (n 10) and the least fat (LF, n=7) by their intra-abdominal fat pads mass (epididymal, mesenteric, and perirenal) after ER. A superficial portion of M. gastrocnemius tissue obtained before and after the diet period were analyzed to determine the activities of hexokinase (HK), β-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (β-HAD) and citrate synthase (CS). Blood samples were also collected for a serum leptin assay. At the baseline, no difference was found in either the leptin concentration or the enzyme activities among LF, MF and CL. The serum leptin concentration was positively correlated with the muscle activities of β-HAD and CS, while it negatively correlated with HK/β-HAD. After ER, the activities of HK, β-HAD and CS were all significantly lower in LF than in CL. Among the energy-restricted rats, the intra-abdominal fat pad weight, leptin concentration and the activities of β-HAD, CS, β-HAD/CS all significantly correlated with one another. The changes in leptin and the activity of β-HAD were also positively correlated. These findings indicate that parallel decreases in the serum leptin and skeletal muscle enzyme activities with the energy restriction-induced intra-abdominal adipose reduction, thus may suggest the leptin to have a regulative effect on the muscle enzyme activity during ER. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This multifunctionality of PP1 relies on its association with a host of function-specific targetting and substrate-specifying proteins. In this review we discuss how PP1 affects the biochemistry and physiology of eukaryotic cells. The picture of PP1 that emerges from this analysis is that of a ""green"" enzyme that promotes the rational use of energy, the recycling of protein factors, and a reversal of the cell to a basal and/or energy-conserving state. Thus PP1 promotes a shift to the more energy-efficient fuels when nutrients are abundant and stimulates the storage of energy in the form of glycogen. PP1 also enables the relaxation of actomyosin fibers, the return to basal patterns of protein synthesis, and the recycling of transcription and splicing factors. In addition, PP1 plays a key role in the recovery from stress but promotes apoptosis when cells are damaged beyond repair. Furthermore, PP1 downregulates ion pumps and transporters in various tissues and ion channels that are involved in the excitation of neurons. Finally, PP1 promotes the exit from mitosis and maintains cells in the G1 or G2 phases of the cell cycle.",,"actin; adenosine triphosphatase (calcium); calcium channel; glycogen; ionotropic receptor; myosin adenosine triphosphatase; phosphoprotein phosphatase 1; protein kinase; transforming growth factor beta receptor; apoptosis; Arabidopsis; Caenorhabditis; cell cycle; cell cycle G1 phase; cell cycle G2 phase; cell division; centrosome; crystal structure; dephosphorylation; enzyme active site; enzymology; eukaryotic cell; glycogen metabolism; meiosis; nerve cell stimulation; nonhuman; pachytene; priority journal; protein protein interaction; protein synthesis; review; RNA processing; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; signal transduction; starvation; Animals; Cell Cycle; Cytoskeleton; Humans; Phosphoprotein Phosphatase; Phosphorylation; Stress; Transcription, Genetic",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346728803

Mainly, we deal with two-machine problems. The problems are extensions of a one-machine problem with a common due date and a non-regular optimization criterion, where the sum of absolute deviations of the completion times from the due date is to be minimized. There are two reasonable generalizations: Either, the objective function is kept the same as in the one-machine problem, where the completion time is now the completion time of the last operation of the job, or a second penalty is added to this term which takes into account the storage costs of the intermediate. For both types of problems, we study the flow shop, the job shop, and the open shop environment. In the case of intermediate storage costs, we distinguish the cases of a due date d = 0 (which leads to a regular optimization criterion) and a non-restrictive due date. We obtain the following results. The two-machine flow shop problem with intermediate storage costs defined in this paper is NP-hard in the strong sense for d = 0 as well as for a non-restrictive due date. We prove the similar results for the two-machine open shop problem. In absence of intermediate storage costs, the open shop and the job shop problem are polynomially solvable for a non-restrictive due date. The just-in-time production philosophy has lead to a growing interest in scheduling problems considering both earlines and tardiness penalties. Most publications considering these so-called non-regular objective functions are devoted to single-stage problems. This paper describes the two main approaches to extend the objective function to multi-stage environments and investigates the computational complexity of the problems obtained. The investigations in this paper may serve as a starting point for the development of appropriate algorithms for the type of problem considered. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The system is modeled using a TRNSYS computer program and the climatic conditions of Cyprus, included in a typical meteorological year (TMY) file. An artificial neural-network is trained using the results of a small number of TRNSYS simulations, to learn the correlation of collector area and storage-tank size on the auxiliary energy required by the system from which the life-cycle savings can be estimated. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm is employed to estimate the optimum size of these two parameters, for maximizing life-cycle savings: thus the design time is reduced substantially. As an example, the optimization of an industrial process heat-system employing flat-plate collectors is presented. The optimum solutions obtained from the present methodology give increased life-cycle savings of 4.9 and 3.1% when subsidized and non-subsidized fuel prices are used respectively, as compared to solutions obtained by the traditional trial-and-error method. The present method greatly reduces the time required by design engineers to find the optimum solution and in many cases reaches a solution that could not be easily obtained from simple modeling programs or by trial-and-error, which in most cases depends on the intuition of the engineer. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

To search for novel adipocytokines by the large-scale random sequence analysis of expressed genes in adipocytes, we identified an adipose-specific collagen-like molecule, adiponectin. This novel adipocytokine has plural biofunctions, such as antidiabetic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiinflammatory functions.

A spatially distributed approach was followed to aggregate the HYDRUS Model to basin scale. The effects of spatial variability on the estimation of evapotranspiration at basin scale are emphatically discussed. In the present work the main emphasis was focused on the estimation of the spatial variability of both evapotranspiration and the calculation of statistical parameters of soil water storage from local scale to basin scale. Our results illustrate that the changes of the local and area-averaged potential evapotranspiration (ET p), actual evapotranspiration (ET) show a strong seasonal trend where the mean and standard deviation (STD) approximately fit the two-harmonics of Fourier series. Moreover, ETp and ET are random variables which follow the normal distribution with mean and deviation changing with season. A sensitivity analysis of the results shows that to a reasonable degree, the incorporated model can be used to determine the relationship between the actual area-averaged evapotranspiration and the main controlling factors for both bare soil and vegetated surfaces. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

One is that of helping the off-grid population improve a situation of discomfort, environmental risks and high lighting costs. Another is that of cutting fuel subsidies in the local utility grids supplied by diesel generators. Simulation shows that PV systems with energy storage connected to existing diesel generators, allowing them to be turned of during the day, provide the lowest energy costs. Implementation potential of that choice is evaluated for local grids up to 100 kW, where transportation costs cause maximal wholesale diesel prices for Northern Brazil to be increased of 15% and more, it is economical to convert diesel systems up to 50 kW peak power into hybrid systems. In locations where the costs increase is of 45% and more, systems up to 100 kW turn economical. A new legal mechanism for subrogation of diesel subsidies to renewable energy projects changes those limits to 0% and 21%, respectively. Therefore, the actors in power generation are motivated to consider solar energy. A program with the scope described should give the Brazilian photovoltaic industry a relevant push and launch a transition towards a sustainable power supply for the region. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The study shows that with 30 10-kW WECS together with 150 m2 PV, and 3 days of battery storage, the diesel back-up system has to provide 17% of the load demand. However, in the absence of battery storage, about 38% of the load needs to be provided by the diesel system. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This frame is accordingly used to analyse the local wind energy market situation during the last 15 years. According to the results obtained, one may-on pure economic basis-explain the evolution of wind energy applications in the three major Greek sections presenting interest for wind power stations construction, i.e. the small medium sized Aegean Archipelago islands, the Crete Island and the windy sites of mainland. Furthermore, the proposed model predicts no additional wind parks in the Aegean Sea Islands and Crete. The only solution to this negative evolution is the development of additional energy storage systems, e.g. wind-hydro stations. On the contrary, the Greek mainland opportunities in selected windy sites are more encouraging under the precondition of strengthening the existing electricity transportation networks and properly handling the increasing public annoyance towards new large wind turbines erection in relatively few closed areas. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The alloy, which has not been exposed to air before activation, can be activated with ease under moderate activation conditions. However, with increasing duration of exposure, its full activation became more difficult. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy results show about 4-7 nm thick oxide layer on the surface of the air-exposed samples, which implies that formation of surface oxide layer may play an important role in controlling activation. As indicated by scanning electron microcopy, the activation process of the alloy is closely related with fragmentation of alloy particles. According to X-ray diffraction results, activation leads to expansion of the crystal lattice of the alloy and the expanded structure would not be restored even after hydrogen desorption, which benefits the decrease in activation energy for hydrogen absorption and desorption and makes the process easy. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

The physical basis for the scenarios is the exploitation of renewable energy resources already in progress in Denmark. Hydrogen is proposed as a convenient energy carrier due to its versatility in use, transmission and as an energy storage medium. Two main scenarios are constructed, differing in the degree of decentralisation of energy production and management: one resembles the current system with centralised facilities and commercial management, the other being based upon a projected scale-independent cost structure of energy producing and handling equipment, that will allow extreme decentralisation of the physical energy conversion system, possibly accompanied by a similar decentralisation of ownership and control. The simulation studies show that both scenarios are technically feasible, and that the storage problems arising from the mismatch between demand and intermittent sources can be solved in both a centralised and a decentralised fashion. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

The experimental results showed that their maximum hydrogen storage capacity (H/M, M=Ti1-XZrXMn1.4) increased with increasing X. The value of H/M for X=0.4 reached up to 2.916 which corresponds to 2.05 wt.% of hydrogen in the hydride, while the maximum reversible hydrogen storage capacity of the alloys appeared at X=0.1. The introduction of zirconium into the alloy did not cause any change in the phase constitution. C-14 type Laves phase was still predominant in the alloy while the lattice parameters a and c increased with increasing content of zirconium substituting for titanium. The introduction of zirconium increased the changes of entropy and enthalpy of hydrogen absorption.

PHAs have been attracting considerable attention as biodegradable substitutes for conventional polymers. To reduce their production cost, a great deal of effort has been devoted to developing better bacterial strains and more efficient fermentation/recovery processes. The use of mixed cultures and cheap substrates can reduce the production cost of PHA. Accumulation of PHA by mixed cultures occurs under transient conditions mainly caused by intermittent feeding and variation in the electron donor/acceptor presence. The maximum capacity for PHA storage and the PHA production rate are dependent on the substrate and the operating conditions used. This work reviews the development of PHA research. Aspects discussed include metabolism and various mechanisms for PHA production by mixed cultures; kinetics of PHA accumulation and conversion; effects of carbon source and temperature on PHA production using mixed cultures; PHA production process design; and characteristics of PHA produced by mixed cultures. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Here, mechanical alloying (MA) was used to process powder mixtures of MgH 2 with 8 mol% M (M=Al, Ti, Fe, Ni, Cu and Nb) in order to modify hydrogen storage properties of the Mg hydride. Electronic simulations of the systems were carried out to clarify the mechanisms of the alloy effects. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the milled samples revealed the formation of new phases: a bcc solid solution phase for the (MgH2+Nb) mixture; TiH2 phase for the (MgH2+Ti); and MgCu2 phase for the (MgH 2+Cu). For all the mixtures, a high-pressure phase, γ-MgH 2, was also identified after mechanical alloying. Further qualitative and quantitative phase analyses were carried out using the Rietveld method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the milled powder clearly showed substantial particle size reduction after milling. Dehydrogenation at 300°C under vacuum shows that the (MgH2+Ni) mixture gives the highest level of hydrogen desorption and the most rapid kinetics, followed by MgH 2 with Al, Fe, Nb, Ti and Cu. Theoretical predictions show that the (MgH2+Cu) system is the most unstable, followed by (MgH 2+Ni), (MgH2+Fe), (MgH2+Al), (MgH 2+Nb), (MgH2+Ti). The predicted alloying effects on the stability of MgH2 generally agree with the experimentally observed change in the hydrogen desorption capacity.

Harvesting the crop during one short seasonal period of the year results in the need to store most of the material for between one to 12 months in order to provide a continual supply of feedstock. Storage of large volumes of biomass is costly and also results in dry matter losses over time. An alternative system would be to harvest small areas as required every few weeks throughout the year, This would enable cheaper, lower performance equipment to be used and hence provide a continual supply of biomass feedstock for delivery to the plant. Four systems of conventionally harvesting the biomass during one short seasonal period of 8-10 weeks were compared with two systems of harvesting it continually throughout the year. Whether the biomass is stored on the farms after harvest to allow for transpirational drying or at the plant was also compared.

Box 50, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark","Miscanthus is a perennial rhizomatous warm-season grass with C4-photosynthesis. It shows considerable production potentials (10-20 t dry matter ha-1) under NW European growth conditions and plantations of Miscanthus are established to provide biomass for energy. The plant senesees in the autumn in response to adverse climatic conditions, but harvest is normally postponed until spring when the biomass is more suitable for combustion. Total pre-harvest and harvest losses may account for as much as two-thirds of autumn standing biomass and these losses provide a significant carbon input to the soil. In this study, we examine soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and turnovers beneath 9 and 16 year old Miscanthus plantations established at Hornum, Denmark (56°50′N, 09°26′E). The soil is a loamy sand (Typie Haplumbrept, coarse loamy, mixed, mesic) with a C3 vegetation history. Soil was sampled at 0-20, 20-50 and 50-100 cm depth in the Miscanthus plantations and in two reference sites under C3-plants. The 0-20 cm samples were divided into fine soil (&lt; 2 mm), particulate organic matter (POM; 250-2000 μm), rhizomes/stubbles and coarse roots. All samples were analysed for carbon content and 13CV12C ratio. Rhizomes/stubbles accounted for 10.9-12.6 t DM ha-1 and coarse roots for 3.2-3.7 t DM ha -1 at 0-20 cm depth. No rhizomes and coarse roots were observed in the deeper soil layers. Concentrations of SOC were higher at all soil depths under the 16 year old Miscanthus whereas 9 years of Miscanthus and reference sites showed similar SOC concentrations. (δ13C in 0-20 cm reference soil averaged -27.6‰ while soil beneath 9 and 16 year Miscanthus showed -25.6‰ and -22.8‰, respectively. Difference in (δ13C between reference and Miscanthus soils was smaller at greater soil depths. SOC inventories at 0-100 cm ranged from 91-92 t C ha -1 in reference and 9 year Miscanthus to 106 t C ha-1 under 16 years of Miscanthus growing. The main part of the SOC was at 0-20 and 20-50 cm soil with 30-40 t C ha-1 in each layer. Although changes in the overall SOC storage were less significant, 13% and 31% of the SOC present in 0-20 cm soil was derived from Miscanthus beneath 9 and 16 year plantations, respectively. The organic matter recovered in POM contained 48-65% of Miscanthus derived C. At 20-50 and 50-100 cm depth, the fractions of SOC from Miscanthus were 6-9% and 1.3-6%, respectively. It was estimated that 26-29% of the cumulated C input from Miscanthus had been retained in the soil. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The colour degradation kinetics of coriander leaf puree was studied using a fraction conversion technique during thermal treatment at 50, 65, 80, 95 and 110°C for up to 60 min. Blanched, comminuted coriander leaf puree was subjected to heat treatment at selected temperatures in an oil bath with agitation. Treated samples were removed from the bath at selected time intervals (0-60 min after come-up period), cooled immediately and analyzed for colour using a Hunterlab colourimeter. The rheological characteristics of the puree were evaluated using a computer-controlled Haake rotational viscometer at 50, 60, 70 and 80°C and it was found that the Herschel-Bulkley model adequately represented shear stress-shear rate data. Temperature dependency of the consistency index and apparent viscosity at a shear rate of 100 s-1 followed the Arrhenius relationship and the flow activation energy ranged between 17.2 and 17.9 kJ/mol. Coriander puree was converted to paste by adding common salt (2%) and the required volume of citric acid to adjust the pH to 4.2. The paste was then filled into glass bottles and stored at selected temperatures (5, 25 and 37°C) for 6 months and was periodically evaluated for colour, total aerobic plate count and physicochemical properties. Coriander puree/paste colour was expressed in terms of tristimulus colour value a and combination (L×a×b). First order reaction kinetics adequately described the changes in colour values during both thermal treatment of puree and storage of paste. The process activation energies were 29.3 and 22.1 kJ/mol, respectively, for a and (L×a×b) during thermal treatment. The corresponding values during storage were 12.7 and 12.2 kJ/mol. The paste was microbiologically stable with no significant changes (P&gt;0.05) in physicochemical characteristics during storage. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The photovoltaic array consists of 300 photovoltaic modules of 60 Wp each, for a combined 18 kWp total installed power. The micro-hydraulic system consists of a water pump of 6 kV A and a water turbine coupled with a DC generator of 7.5 kW and two identical water reservoirs of 150 m3 capacity each. During the day, the load is satisfied directly form the photovoltaic generator through an inverter (UPS unit of 25 kV A, 380 V-3 phases alternative current), while any energy surplus is directed to the pump for pumping water from the low level reservoir (at about 100 m altitude from sea level), to the high level reservoir (at about 200 m altitude from sea level). During the night, water is turbined to the low level reservoir providing energy to the load.

Both, technical and economical feasibility is evaluated and presented. The typical electrical energy and cooling-load demand profiles of the buildings concerned are determined. Payback period, internal rate-of-return (IRR), net present value (NPV) and net profit of the Institute is determined through cash-flow analysis. Then, cogeneration coupling with thermal energy storage (TES) is studied and its technical and economical feasibility is evaluated and compared with that of cogeneration. On-site cogeneration with a double-effect absorption chiller provides a potential of at least 13% peak-demand reduction and about a 16% savings in energy consumption. It provides IRR greater than 21% but the saving potential is limited by the low demand of co-generated chilled water within the community of the Institution. Cogeneration coupling with thermal energy storage offers a simple and economically more attractive approach for maximizing the utilization of co-generated chilled-water and shows 23% reduction in peak demand and a 21% savings in energy consumption.

This valuable resource needs to be conserved and its alternatives need to be explored. In this perspective, dissemination and utilisation of renewables such as solar energy has gained worldwide momentum since the onset of oil crises of 1970s. Moreover, burning of fuels is the principal cause of air pollution, and possibly environmental warming. Saudi Arabia, being blessed with a fairly high level of solar radiation, is a suitable candidate for deployment of solar photo-voltaic (PV) panels for power generation during crisis. Literature indicates that commercial/residential buildings in Saudi Arabia consume an estimated 10-45% of the total electrical energy generated/consumed. In the present study, hourly mean solar radiation data for the period 1986-1993 recorded at the solar radiation and meteorological monitoring station, Dhahran (26· 32′ N, 50· 13′ E), Saudi Arabia, have been analyzed to investigate the potential of utilizing hybrid (PV·diesel) power systems to meet the load requirements of a typical commercial building (with an annual electrical energy demand of 620,000 kWh). The monthly average daily solar global irradiation for Dhahran ranges from 3.61 to 7.96 kWh/m2. The hybrid systems considered in the present analysis consist of different combinations of PV panels/modules (different array sizes) supplemented with a battery storage unit and diesel back-up. The study shows that with a combination of 3700 m2 PV together with 12 h of battery storage, the diesel back-up system has to provide 6% of the load demand.

Regarding reflector types, the ICS models with CPC reflectors achieve higher mean daily efficiency, while models with involute reflectors present high efficiency only in low operating temperatures. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, both are practically difficult to maintain beyond a certain limit. The reflectivity of the bottom causes the loss of a fraction of the incident radiation flux, resulting in lower absorption of flux in the pond. Turbidity hinders the propagation of radiation. Thereby it decreases the flux reaching the storage zone. Both these factors lower the efficiency of the pond significantly. However, the same turbidity also prevents the loss of radiation reflected from the bottom. Hence, the combined effect is compensatory to some extent. The present work is an analysis of the combined effect of the bottom's reflectivity and water turbidity on the steady state efficiency of solar ponds. It is found that in the case of a reflective bottom, turbidity, within certain limits, improves the efficiency of pond. This is apparently contradictory to the conventional beliefs about the pond. Nevertheless, this conclusion is of practical importance for design and maintenance of solar ponds. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
