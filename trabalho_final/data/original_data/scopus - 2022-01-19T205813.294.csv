Further, sub-Saharan Africa is expected to experience increased consumption of food, energy and water resources due to rapidly growing economies and urban populations. This calls for innovative and appropriate technologies to support production systems amid the changing climate. Collection, storage and use of rainwater for off-season irrigation, if combined with climate-smart agriculture, have the potential to improve food security and income for smallholder farmers. Replication, scaling-up and transfer of integrated rainwater harvesting (RWH) irrigation management systems require a multidimensional assessment of existing technologies and their use. This study sets out to assess and map best practices in RWH irrigation systems in dryland agro-ecosystems in Kenya. We used both primary and secondary sources in our evaluation. Primary data was based on key informant interviews of institutions and practitioners, and stakeholder workshops in RWH. Secondary sources included journals, technical reports and other relevant publications. Our study identified adoption of place-specific rainwater harvesting systems. These included in situ, micro- and macro-catchment technologies. While the in situ and micro-catchment systems included soil conservation measures, macro-catchment systems were run-off-based. Our finding shows that arid and semi-arid areas of Kenya have high potential for climate resilient food production if RWH irrigation technologies are adopted and scaled up, hence the need for policies that would promote adoption of context-specific rainwater harvesting technologies for different climatic, bio-physical, socio-economic and cultural conditions. This will enhance adaptive capacities of smallholder farmers and reduce their vulnerabilities to climate change while increasing food production to meet growing demand in the country with a view to contributing to sustainable development. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Adoption Dryland agro-ecosystems; Best practices; Mapping; Rainwater harvesting",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043724453

A practical control strategy for filling (charging) and emptying (discharging) of the buffer, based on a virtual value (costate) of the stored heat (the state), is suggested and illustrated by simulation. Heating and ventilation decisions are obtained by maximizing, at each time step, the virtual increase in value of the greenhouse system (including stored heat). As long as the heat buffer is neither empty nor full, the virtual value (co-state) of the stored heat remains constant. When the buffer is full (towards the end of a day), this value is gradually decreased, until the buffer starts to discharge. When the buffer empties (towards the end of a night), the virtual value is gradually increased, until recharging of the buffer starts again. This heuristic strategy is meant to minimize the time that the buffer is empty or full, because in these states the buffer is inactive (ineffective). Simulations with an annual weather sequence show the following: (1) the winter-Time virtual value of stored heat is about equal to the actual cost of heat, while in summer it is close to zero; (2) the utilization of the buffer, judged by the time on the storage bounds (full or empty), is roughly uniform along the year; (3) the performance of the system improves asymptotically with an increase of the installed capacity of the buffer; (4) expensive energy (heat) results in reduced intensity of cultivation (less heat and less yield).","Co-state-based policy; Co2 enrichment; Day-To-night heat storage; Greenhouses",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037743324

However, fresh vegetables are highly perishable, and have a short shelf-life unless kept in a cool environment. Mechanical refrigeration is recommended for cooling vegetables, but it is costly and requires a steady supply of electricity. Thus, it cannot be easily adopted by smallholders, especially those in rural areas without electricity. In this study, three alternative cooling methods were tested on amaranth and African nightshade: 1) zero-energy cool chamber (ZECC), 2) ice packs, and 3) ice packs in insulated bags. The use of a ZECC reduced weight loss effectively in amaranth, but not in African nightshade. The use of one to three ice packs per plastic crate lowered the leaf temperature and decreased the weight loss of African nightshade. The use of insulated bags enhanced the cooling effect, and resulted in further reduction of weight loss and retention of green color in amaranth. The results demonstrate that the low-cost cooling methods tested have great potential to reduce postharvest losses of vegetables caused by lack of proper storage conditions.","Evaporative cooling; Packed ice; Shelf-life; Traditional leafy vegetables",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037702581

Differential algebraic equation based dynamic sub-models are developed for key components, including compressor, internal heat exchanger, storage chamber and turbine. A case study is presented where a 2 MW wind turbine is integrated with a small-scale CAES system.

However, solar power is intermittent and dynamic by its nature. Therefore, the system suffers from operational and control issues affecting the performance of the electricity generation system. Recent studies suggest that small-scale CSP systems with organic Rankine cycles (ORC) have strong potential for off-grid power solution. Keys to successful implementation of this technology lie in optimizing the solar collectors for low-temperature thermal output (< 200°C) and employing automatic control to attenuate fluctuating thermal input as well as electricity demand. Thus, this work aims at developing dynamic models and implementing the simulation using a commercial simulator, DYNSIM. Besides, comparison and discussion of the two different types of thermal energy storage (TES) adopted in a CSP system including two-tank and packed-bed TES, was performed. Also, control structures for the systems with both types of TES were proposed and discussed. The two-tank TES exhibited higher performances as the efficiency of solar collector and boiler is independent of the level of energy stored. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","concentrating solar power; control; dynamic simulation; solar energy",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041411745

The cement production industry is one of the largest industrial sources of CO2 (about 5% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions). Among various carbon capture methods suitable to be implemented into the cement production process, two reactive gas-liquid absorption and gas-solid (calcium looping) options are evaluated in this paper in post-combustion CO2 capture configurations. The paper evaluates (using CAPE methods) the techno-economic and environmental performances for cement plants with carbon capture having an output of 1 Mt/y. Mass and energy integration aspects of the carbon capture unit, associated heat and power plant as well as the influence of various CO2 capture options on the overall cement production performances are discussed in details. For comparison reason, a conventional cement plant without carbon capture was also considered as benchmark case to quantify the energy and cost penalties for CO2 capture. The assessments show that the innovative calcium looping system has significant advantages compared not only to benchmark case without capture but also to the gas-liquid absorption CO2 capture case such as: the higher energy efficiency, lower energy penalty for CO2 capture, improved mass and energy integration potential and better techno-economic and environmental performances. The presented techno-economic and environmental analysis for cement production process with carbon capture is very promising to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of this important industrial sector. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Calcium looping; Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS); Cement production; Gas-liquid absorption",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041403432

Therefore the oncoming energy crisis must be solved by developing new sustainable energy supply that has lower or, preferably, negligible impact on the environment. Any new sustainable energy solutions will have to envelope three important sets of technologies: production, storage and transportation. Additionally, in order to determine whether these solutions are truly sustainable, adequate life cycle assessment methodology (LCA) needs to be developed and properly applied.

This trend in conjunction to the available technologies for providing advanced sensing, measurement, process control, and communication lead towards the new field of Cyber-Physical System (CPS). Due to superior performance of these systems it is expected to play a major role in the design and development of future engineering platforms with new capabilities that far exceed today's levels of autonomy, functionality and usability. Although CPS exhibits remarkable characteristics, their design and implementation is a challenging issue, as numerous (heterogeneous) components and services have to be appropriately orchestrated together. The problem of designing efficient decision making mechanisms becomes far more challenging in case the target system has to meet also real-time constraints. Throughout this manuscript, we introduce a novel framework to support the efficient, yet flexible, rapid prototyping of decision-making mechanisms for CPSs. Furthermore, a new toolbox that automates the tasks of our framework was also developed as an open-source software. For evaluation purposes, the proposed solution was applied to a building use case in order to support optimum configuration of smart thermostats. Based on our analysis, we depict that the introduced approach maximizes thermal comfort metric with the minimum possible energy cost, as compared to existing state-ofthe- art solutions.

This transient energy flow can be based on relatively simple circuits consisting of passive discrete resistive-inductive-capacitive elements, transformers or transmission lines, and switches, which convert the energy stored in the electric fields of capacitors or magnetic fields of coils into well-defined voltage pulses. Here, transient phenomena of single and stack circuits are described as a basis of the generation and handling of high-voltage pulses, which are described elsewhere in this handbook. These include direct capacitive discharge, comprising a single switch or an association of circuits to circumvent the still voltage and current limitation of semiconductors, which include adder and Marx generator circuits. The use of a single step-up transformer or inductive adder circuit will be described also. Also, the utilization of transmission lines to generate and format pulses into well-defined loads is explained. In addition, the use of inductive storage with normally closed switches is presented. Finally, an example of the techniques that use resonant circuits with saturable inductor or transformer is outlined.

This special structure makes the fabric lightweight and flexible. Spacer fabrics can be developed to have cushioning feature with three distinct stages under compression, i.e., linear elasticity, plateau, and densification. To enhance the impact protective performance of the hollow knitted spacer structure, a novel impact hardening polymer (IHP) was synthesized to reinforce the spacer structure. The IHP showed a storage modulus at a higher shear strain rate of 6000 times as that at a lower shear strain rate. The impact protective properties of the developed hollow 3D knitted structure reinforced composites were assessed via drop-mass impact tests under both the flatwise and hemispherical forms. It was found from the flatwise impact tests that the developed hollow composites have adaptive initial stiffness subjected to different impact velocities. Their energy absorption capacities were significantly improved compared to the original spacer fabric. The hemispherical tests proved that the developed composites can tend to rigid instantly upon impact and shunt the impact force to a larger area. The composites were also tested according to the European Standard BS EN 1621- 1:1998 to assess whether they are suitable for human body protection and compared with the results of some typical commercial hip protectors. The results showed that the novel composites possess superior impact protective performance without compromising of comfort. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2017.

However, the associated physical processes are less explored. The purpose of this study was to explore several approaches for heat storage in tunnel greenhouses. The study was conducted in unheated tunnel greenhouses growing a basil crop, located in the Beit Shean valley of Northern Israel. Some of the tunnels were equipped with a row of black plastic water sleeves (WS) positioned vertically inside the tunnel adjacent to the northern sidewall to store solar energy. Four treatments were investigated: (i) control - without WS, single plastic cover; (ii) WS, double plastic cover; (iii) WS, double cover: plastic & ""Agril"" (non-woven plastic cloth or net, internal cover); (iv) without WS, double plastic cover. Microclimatic measurements included air temperature, air humidity, solar and net radiation, water temperature within the sleeves, and soil temperature. The results indicated that the nighttime air temperature in tunnels with water sleeves and double plastic cover was highest of all treatments, and 4.8°C (average data from 5∼11 Jan, 2014) higher than the control tunnel. Hence, water sleeves stored a significant amount of heat which could balance the uneven distribution of solar energy between day and night. Nighttime temperatures in treatments (iii) and (iv) were roughly the same, and lower than treatment (ii), while the control tunnel temperature was lowest during the night. Water sleeves accumulated energy during the daytime (7:00∼15:00); during the rest hours of the day the sleeves dissipated heat into the greenhouse air. Vertical profiles of water temperature inside the sleeves indicated a generally stable thermal stratification, with warmer water at upper levels within the sleeve. We conclude that water sleeves with double plastic cover provided best nighttime conditions for basil production in this region of the country. © 2017 ISHS.","Air temperature; Basil; Heat storage; Solar energy; Water sleeves",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029588733

The intense current interest stems from fundamental importance as well as technological relevance for energy conversion and storage technologies (e.g., batteries, photovoltaics, fuel cells, and sensing devices), and recent progresses have been extensively reviewed. The raison d'être of the review, consequently, lies in the personal account and reflections weaved into the fabric of current developments of the two areas. For the part of electronic conductivity, large, fused aromatics (e.g., triphenylene or even larger -electron building blocks) figure prominently because of the intrinsically rich and diverse electronic properties that can be accessed for the synthesis of potentially highly conductive networks in the solid state. For the part of ionic conductivity, we characterize the unifying design scheme as one of the establishing strong anionicity on the host frameworks so as to facilitate the incorporation of potentially mobile protons or other cations in the porous domain. Interestingly, the pursuit of the two apparently disparate conductive properties can both be greatly facilitated by the common and abundant element of sulfur, because of its versatile chemical functionalities. For example, whereas thiol-equipped porous MOF grid can readily lock in soft and polarizable metal ions to install metal-thiolate bridges across the organic -electron systems, and thus to potentially boost electronic transport throughout the solid-state framework, similar thiol-equipped net can be treated with oxidants (e.g., H2O2 or O3) to generate postsynthetically the highly ionic sulfonate function to impart strong ionic conductivity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Conductive materials; Crystal engineering; Hard-and-soft principle; Metal-organic frameworks; Metal-sulfur networks; Porous polymer frameworks",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046139609

High order and possibility of tailoring the pore channels according to the needs of particular applications make it more important for several applications including electrochemical supercapacitors (SCs) and hydrogen storage in fuel cells. The templated synthesis provides excellent control over the inherent structure of carbon materials where pores directly depend on the internal structure of the templates. Zeolites have received tremendous attention in this regard owing to their ordered structures, large surface areas, and well-defined pores. The zeolite structure can be replicated into the resulting carbon to achieve highly ordered carbon structures. In addition, other sacrificial templates (metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, etc.) which possess inherent carbon sources in the form of organic ligand have also been explored widely in recent times to derive highly porous carbon. The resulting ordered/porous carbon has shown promising results for energy storage applications including SCs and hydrogen storage.

Development of new synthetic methods for emerging polymer science is of great importance in this regard. Bergman cyclization is a chemical process in which highly reactive aryl diradicals form from enediyne precursors, having a strong impact in a number of fields including pharmaceutics, synthetic chemistry, and materials science. Diradical intermediates stemming from enediynes can cause DNA cleavage under physiological conditions, leading to the strong cytotoxicity of many naturally occurring enediyne antibiotics. Meanwhile, diradical intermediates can quickly couple with each other to construct polyarylenes, providing a novel method to synthesize these conjugated polymers with the advantages of facile and catalyst-free operation, high efficiency, and tailored structure. Moreover, conjugated polymers generated by Bergman cyclization exhibit many remarkable properties, such as excellent thermal stability and good solubility and processability, enabling their further processing into carbon-rich materials. This review presents a brief overview of the trajectory of Bergman cyclization in polymer science, followed by an introduction to research advances, mainly from our group, in developing polymerization methods based on Bergman cyclization, taking advantages of its catalyst-free, byproduct-free, in situ polymerization mechanism to synthesize new polymeric materials with various structures and morphologies. These synthetic strategies include fabrication of rod-like polymers with polyester, dendrimer, and chiral imide side chains, functionalization of carbon nanomaterials by surface-grafting conjugated polymers, formation of nanoparticles by intramolecular collapse of single polymer chains, and construction of carbon nanomembranes on the external and internal surface of inorganic nanomaterials. These polymers with novel structural features have been used in a variety of fields, such as energy transformation, energy storage, catalyst support, and fluorescent detection. Finally, the outlook for future developments of Bergman cyclization in polymer science is presented. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Bergman cyclization; Conjugated polymers; Enediynes; In situ polymerization; Two-dimensional polymers","polymer; chemical structure; chemistry; cyclization; polymerization; synthesis; Cyclization; Molecular Structure; Polymerization; Polymers",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020781439

The progression of left ventricular dysfunction is associated with changes in cardiac energy metabolism. Mitochondria play a central role in a variety of cardiomyocytes functions, including oxidative energy production, storage of calcium ions, and programmed cell death. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content correlates with the size and number of mitochondria, which change under different energy demands and oxidative stress. Experimental studies demonstrated that any genetic manipulation resulting in significantly decreased mtDNA could accelerate the ageing process and cause adverse myocardial remodeling and dysfunction. On the other hand, preservation of the mtDNA copy number in mouse hearts delays the development of heart failure after myocardial infarction. Recent general population study also demonstrated that echocardiographic indexes of left ventricular structure and function are significantly and independently associated with mtDNA content measured at peripheral blood cells in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.

The debate about the place and timing of a green economy in Africa is intense and receives attention at all levels of society. Africa is blessed with an abundance of resources, yet its people remain poor and vulnerable to exogenous shocks. New technology imbedded in a green economy and green agriculture could provide opportunities for development but it could also have the opposite unintended effect. Africans rightfully ask if it is morally justifiable for the developed world to expect African countries to implement green technologies in order to reduce CO2 emissions while first world countries developed their economies with cheaper and well-known technologies. The challenges in Africa are complex and not only centered on technology or the lack thereof. Governance and policy should be used to create an enabling environment for the implementation of new and green technology for economic growth and development. Examples of major infrastructural development projects in parts of Africa are evidence that African leaders in some countries already recognize its importance. Most of these project focus on transportation, energy generation/distribution, and water related services. The food-water-energy nexus is critical for the future development in Africa and innovative technology should be utilized to increase access to education, unlock the potential of natural resources, increase the efficiency of transport systems, unlock markets, and to increase the efficiency of food production, food storage and food distribution. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054948636

PCMs give the ability to store passive solar and other heat gains as latent heat within a specific temperature range, leading to a reduction of energy usage, an increase in thermal comfort by smoothing out temperature fluctuations throughout the day, and a reduction and/or shift in peak loads. The interest around PCMs has been growing significantly over the last decade, both for new buildings and retrofitting of existing ones. Hence, several commercial products have arrived on the market with various areas of use in building applications. This study reviews commercial state-of-the-art products found on the market and shows some of the potential areas of use for PCMs in building applications. Examples of how PCMs can be integrated into buildings, and furthermore building materials and projects using PCMs that have already been realized, have also been reviewed. There seems to be a scarcity of data published on actual performance in real-life applications so far. However, many laboratory and full-scale experiments have shown positive results on energy savings.

The initial source of energy was fossil fuels that might release some harmful gases. Burning of fossil fuels was practiced since the 18th century, which consequently resulted in 40% increase in atmospheric CO2 according researcher. Presently, the atmospheric level of C is increasing day by day. However, this level would reach ~1000 ppm at the end of this century. The consistent discharge of CO2 into the atmosphere is a major threat to global warming; hence, it is important to minimize the atmospheric CO2 by using innovative carbon sequestration technologies. Therefore, soil and water can act as a sink for C storage with the assistance of microorganisms. Here, an attempt is made to discuss these processes in details, interactions between plant and microbes, and the requirement of C sources for C sequestration in the context of climate change.

In the case of soft or water rich parts of food, the irradiation free radicals decay very fast (lifetime in microseconds or less) and cannot be observed by conventional, continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Once created, the free radicals undergo a process of recombination, or capture by the other components of the media, leading to compounds that do not possess unbound electrons. The generation, as well as the disappearance (fading) of free radicals could be considered as first order reactions so that the free radical content follows exponential dependencies on the adsorbed dose (saturating exponential) or on the storage time (exponential decay). In the latter case, the higher the storage temperature, the faster the fading. Therefore, pertinent information regarding the number of different free radical species could be obtained by both isothermal and isochronous annealing. In the first case, the analyses of the decay curve could be helpful in individualizing them, while the Arrhenius plots are very useful in the case of isochronous annealing as they allow determination of the activation energy of each species of free radicals. Notwithstanding these considerations, the presence of characteristic free radical ESR signals can demonstrate a previous microbial decontamination by irradiation, but the absence of such signals does not unambiguously signify the absence of an irradiation treatment. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

With incomplete theoretical modeling for eruptions in the solar atmosphere, activity forecasting is mainly supported with statistical models. Solar observations with high temporal and spatial resolution continuously from space well describe the evolution of activities in the solar atmosphere, and combined with three dimensional reconstruction of solar magnetic fields, makes numerical short-Term (within hours to days) solar activity forecasting possible.

People in the deprived regions of the world can only be lifted out of poverty by offering them affordable energy. Fear of depletion of the cheap-fuel resources coupled with increasing anxiety of excessive global warming have led to advocate cogeneration of heat and electricity and to support for a drastic increase in renewable energy. This section will describe the relationship between energy use and the global economy. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.

The kinetics of polycondensation of anilines by oxidation of their gels was investigated by the method of differential scanning calorimetry. It was found that the rate of the oxidative copolycondensation in the presence of xerogel depends on the composition of the reacting mix due to the different reactivity of the nitroaniline isomers to copolycondensation reaction with aniline.

Global energy production is almost entirely associated with the use of highly contaminant fossil fuels, responsible for greenhouse emissions that contribute to climate change. In order to diminish the impact of human activities related to conventional energy production, we must transition to more environmentally friendly sources such as sustainable renewable energy (IPCC, 2012; EIA, 2016). However, the development of renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, and geothermal is not without challenges; much work is needed to solve problems related to production, storage, and use. In combination, renewable systems could transform primary renewable energy into chemical energy like solar fuels or hydrogen as proposed by artificial photosynthesis (Listorti et al., 2009; Vlcek, 2012; Seh et al., 2017) to be later used for power generation in fuel cells, which have great potential for direct conversion of chemical energy into electricity.

The most promising direction in the optimization of lithium batteries is the synthesis of a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE). This type of electrolyte can exclude the majority of the safety and ecological hazards, due to its construction. The main disadvantage of all types of the SPE is a low ionic conductivity at ambient temperature. One of the ways to improve its conductivity is the incorporation of inorganic fillers into SPE to obtain a novel composite polymer electrolyte (CPE). Membranes were prepared by casting of an organic polymer solution (solvent casting technique), followed by drying to evaporate the solvent. CPE based on PVdF were obtained to enhance their electrochemical properties. Micro- and nano-particles of titanium oxide (IV) was used as a filler, lithium per chlorate as a doping salt. The effect of the filler was investigated by SEM, TG-DSC, Tensile strength and Galvanostatic pulse method. The CPE showed good results in ionic conductivity (1.01 mS/cm), thermal stability (range from 25-165°C) and mechanical strength (4.5% at 6.9 MPa). © 2018 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.","Composite polymer electrolytes; Lithium ion conductivity; Lithium polymer batteries; PVdF; Solid polymer electrolytes; TiO2","Fillers; Ionic conductivity; Ionic strength; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanoparticles; Solid electrolytes; Tensile strength; Titanium castings; Titanium dioxide; Composite polymer electrolytes; Lithium-ion conductivity; PVdF; Solid polymer electrolytes; TiO2; Polyelectrolytes",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058603569

It is no wonder that the last several decades proudly bear the name “The Information Age.” Information, in its many forms, is an invaluable asset and its dissemination, collection, storage, and analysis have been the primary focus of researchers in numerous fields. Ever-increasing hunger for information exchange has driven supporting technologies to new levels. The transition from electric to optical domain has proved to be one of the most significant milestones of modern communications. According to TeleGeography and Huawei Marine Networks, as of early 2017, it has been estimated that close to 1.1 million kilometers of submarine optical cables exist, each bearing several optical fibers, and approximately 99% of all international telecommunications traffic is carried over this infrastructure. Starting from the overloaded backbone links, optical technology was gradually implemented in the lower levels of network hierarchy, with the ultimate goal of reaching individual users in the foreseeable future. Decreasing attenuation, eliminating electromagnetic interference, reducing the power consumption, and 632diminishing the possibility of eavesdropping are just some of the advantages the new technology has realized (Ramaswami, 2002). With advantages also come challenges, as we are gravitating toward increased efficiency, which includes increased capacity over larger distances with decreased signal degradation and power consumption, and aggregation of fixed and mobile networks into a single network architecture (Carapellese et al., 2014). Aside from information exchange, information processing and storage in the optical domain remain in focus as we pursue all-optical solutions to mitigate unnecessary electro-optic and opto-electric conversion (Ramaswami, 2002; Sygletos et al., 2008). Many steps have already been taken, both in the physical layer, where new materials and production technologies significantly influenced performance, and in the higher levels of abstraction, where new modulation formats and protocols have been introduced (Ramaswami, 2002; Gladisch et al., 2006; Sygletos et al., 2008). Devices that are simple, but can perform multiple functions, have always been highly regarded. One example is the semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)-a photonic device that under adequate conditions can amplify the input optical signal. SOAs have been extensively studied and perfected over the past three decades. Similar to laser diodes, they are compact and easy to produce and integrate with other photonic devices on a single chip (Xing et al., 2004). Wide amplification spectrum makes them suitable for use in wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) optical networks (Mecozzi and Wiesenfeld, 2001; Zimmerman and Spiekman, 2004; Kani, 2010).

Currently, the critical issues induced by the excessive usage of fossil fuels have become more and more noticeable, like energy crisis and air pollution. Therefore, the development and utilization of renewable energy resources have been inevitable for further sustainable development. However, the natural intermittency, uncontrollability, and instability of renewable energy resources make it difficult to connect and dispatch through the grid. Therefore, large-scale energy storage technologies become vital for the development and utilization of renewable energies. Large-scale energy storage technologies mainly contain both physical energy storage technologies (e.g., hydro-pumping, compressed-air, fly wheel, superconductor, and super-capacity), and chemical energy storage technologies (e.g., flow batteries, sodium-sulfur batteries, lithium-ion batteries, and lead batteries).

This is frequently reported in DSP and the other memory devices. Thus, the detection of soft error becomes an interesting research topic. For the purpose of detecting the occurrence of soft error occurred in storage areas of a DSP program, a control flow integrity based checking scheme for soft error detection is presented in this work. In this work, the DSP program implemented in assembly language is mainly focused. Firstly, the program is divided into a number of basic blocks with corresponding structure information being stored in a partition table. Then, for each basic block, a checkpoint is set at the end. The program control flow error can be easily determined by examining the consistency between the information at runtime and that recorded information in the partition table. Compared with the signature-based method, the proposed method is able to achieve almost 100% of error detection coverage. Furthermore, the proposed detection scheme has better cross platform portability under almost same detection efficiency and detection overhead. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Control-flow error; DSP; Integrality checking; Soft error",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049228537

Moreover, the introduction of new loads such as electric vehicles and other storage systems, as well as local micro-generation and the possibility of using demand as a manageable resource create new challenges for the overall power system optimization. The deployment of smart metering and advanced communications capabilities will allow power systems to be managed more in accordance with generation availability, demand needs, and network conditions. A key issue for this optimal management is the existence of dynamic tariffs, according to the availability of several resources, congestion situations, generation scheduling, etc. Dynamic tariffs foreshadow a more active role for the consumer / prosumer concerning electricity usage decisions (consumption, storage, generation, and exchanges with the grid), namely in the residential sector. Demand Response (DR) can be used in this context by residential end-users to make the most of energy price information, weather forecasts, and operational requirements (e.g., comfort) to minimize the electricity bill. Nevertheless, the implementation of DR actions require the time availability of residential end-users, data processing capability, and the need to anticipate the corresponding impacts on the electricity bill and end-users satisfaction regarding the quality of energy services in use. Energy management systems (EMS) capable of offering decision support should be used to assist end-users optimizing the integrated usage of all energy resources. A multi-objective model has been developed aimed at minimizing the electricity bill and the possible dissatisfaction caused to the end-user by the implementation of DR actions. An evolutionary algorithm to cope with the multi-objective and combinatorial nature of the model has been developed, which is tailored to the physical characteristics of the problem, namely using adequate solution encoding schemes and customized operators. Simulation results show that significant savings might be achieved by optimizing load scheduling, local micro-generation, and storage systems including electric vehicles (EVs) in both grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and V2G (vehicle-to-grid) modes. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Demand response; Evolutionary algorithm; Load management; Multi-objective optimization",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048200558

One of the major factors that can increase the efficiency of wind turbines (WTs) is the simultaneous control of the different parts in several operating area. A high performance controller can significantly increase the amount and quality of energy that can be captured from wind. The main problem associated with control design in wind generator is the presence of asymmetric in the dynamic model of the system, which makes a generic supervisory control scheme for the power management of WT complicated. Consequently, supervisory controller can be utilized as the main building block of a wind farm controller (offshore), which meets the grid code requirements and can increased the efficiency of WTs, the stability and intermit-tency problems of wind power generation. This Chapter proposes a new robust adaptive supervisory controller for the optimal management of a variable speed turbines (VST) and a battery energy storage system (BESS) in both regions (II and III) simultaneously under wind speed variation and grid demand changes. To this end, the second order sliding mode (SOSMC) with the adaptive gain super-twisting control law and fuzzy logic control (FLC) are used in the machine side, BESS side and grid side converters. The control objectives are fourfold: (i) Control of the rotor speed to track the optimal value; (ii) Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) mode or power limit mode for adaptive control; (iii) Maintain the DC bus voltage close to its nominal value; (iv) Ensure: a smooth regulation of grid active and reactive power quantity, a satisfactory power factor correction and a high harmonic performance in relation to the AC source and eliminating the chattering effect. Results of extensive simulation studies prove that the proposed supervisory control system guarantees to track reference signals with a high harmonic performance despite external disturbance uncertainties. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Contaminant chemicals may have considerable implications for human health and safety, welfare and the value of nature. Air contaminants include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). These gases brings climate change by increasing the temperature of the earth’s atmosphere and oceans. Climate change is responsible for unpredictable changes in precipitation, rising sea level and extreme climate events. Air contamination can be controlled by passing a law against harmful chemicals production, introducing special devices that reduce green houses gases, and making use of alternative sources of energy. Major water contaminants include sewages, petroleum products (like polychlorinated biphenyls), nitrates, insecticides, sediments and excess organic matters. Harmful chemicals may reach water bodies from outlet of pipes in industries; leakage of pipe line or storage tanks, mining operations, improper application of fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural fields and some leakage from ships. Water contaminants inflict vital body organs, nervous systems, and cause different types of cancers and cardiovascular effects. Soil contamination is caused by dispersion of toxic compounds, acidification, salinization and sodification, enhanced soil erosion, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, and the accumulation of heavy metals and other inorganic contaminants. Like air and water contaminants, soil contaminants, if they enter into our body, are also causative agents of many diseases.

Solid-state batteries with non-flammable inorganic solid electrolytes are one candidate to replace the currently-used liquid electrolyte. In recent years, a novel class of inorganic ceramic solid electrolyte with garnet structure Li7La3Zr2O12, known as LLZO, has been developed, which has several superior advantages, such as high Li-ion conductivity, high chemical and electrochemical stability in air. However, Li-ion conductivity for LLZO solid electrolyte is still too low to be applied in the industry. In order to obtain high Li-ion conductivity of LLZO, the priority is to stabilize its cubic phase, because the conductivity of tetragonal phase is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the cubic phase. Previous studies indicated that elemental doping was an effective means to stabilize the cubic phase as well as increase the density of ceramic samples, especially with Al3+. It can not only substitutes the corresponding element in the lattice but also helps expel pores through low melting-point phase formed at grain boundaries, which leads to a good connection between the cubic grains. In addition, Mo (normally Mo6+) substitution for Zr4+ may lead to more Li vacancies in LLZO, which is beneficial to the enhancement of ionic conductivity. In this study, Mo6+ doped Li6.5La3Zr1.75Mo0.25O12 (LLZM) solid electrolytes are successfully prepared via field assisted sintering technology (FAST). The effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure and lithium ionic conductivity is mainly investigated. The results show that pure cubic phase LLZM can be obtained at the range of temperatures from 1050 to 1150 °C for no more than 10 min. For the sample sintered at 1150 °C, a maximum relative density of &gt;95% with a total ionic conductivity as high as 1.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 are obtained at room temperature.

This paper presents CO-TDMA, a low power consumption TDMA protocol using adaptive beacons, which provides a capability to both collect data and transmit OAP codes at the same time. A CO-TDMA frame consists of several data slots, an access slot and several beacon slots. The data slots are used to transmit collecting data, the access slot is used to update network topology or other changes, and the beacon slots are used to transmit data ACK beacon and optional OAP data. The major contribution is the design of the adaptive beacon transmitted in beacon slots: in data collection state, the beacon only carries the ACK information of collecting data for every node in the network (Beacon-piggyback mechanism); when the OAP transmissions are needed, the OAP codes will attach behind the ACK bytes in the payload of a packet. The OAP information is encoded with rateless digital fountain codes to close to 100% reliability if enough packets are received. By multiplex use of beacon slots, we can transmit the OAP codes with very little extra energy consumptions (0.113% RDC), without impacting the normal data collection. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","ACK; Beacon; OAP; TDMA; WSN","Codes (symbols); Digital storage; Time division multiple access; Wireless sensor networks; Beacon; Data collection; Digital fountain codes; Low-power consumption; Network topology; TDMA protocol; Transmit data; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Data acquisition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040115582

These networks transmit and distribute the power generated by these power plants to consumers. Over recent years, a new trend opposing this centralization of power facilities has been observed, resulting from the drop in price of distributed generation, mainly solar photovoltaic (PV) panels [1]. Owing to this effect, it is expected that in the future, small-scale industries and residential consumers of electricity will rely more and more on local renewable energy production capacities for covering, at least partially, their need for electrical power. This leads to the creation of the so-called microgrids that are electrical systems, which include loads and distributed energy resources that can be operated in parallel with the broader utility grid or as an electrical island.

Due to some attractive features of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), the extensive utilization of WSN-based SHM systems is promoted. When finding the Optimal Wireless Sensor Placement (OWSP), the performance of the WSNs is emphasized except the performance of data because wireless sensors are generally equipped with limited energy resources and bandwidths. Unfortunately, the two objectives are in conflict with each other and difficult to be optimized simultaneously. In the paper, the OWSP is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with the aim of finding a wireless sensor configuration trade-off modal independency and energy efficiency while maintaining the connectivity of the whole WSN. A Multi-Objective Firefly Algorithm (MOFA) is developed to find the Pareto front in the OWSP. A directive movement strategy is employed to drive fireflies to fly toward the Pareto front, while the nondirective movement approach is introduced to keep the diversity of the firefly population. Numerical simulation of a cable stayed bridge is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the MOFA. The results indicate that the developed MOFA is capable of capturing the Pareto optimal wireless sensor configurations with high accuracy and efficiency. Many wireless sensor configurations are provided to meet the demand of excellent modal independency or the requirement of high energy efficiency. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Bioluminescence; Cable stayed bridges; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Fire protection; Mechanics; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Pareto principle; Wireless sensor networks; Firefly algorithms; High energy efficiency; Large scale structures; Limited energy resource; Multi-objective optimization problem; Optimal sensor placement; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Structural health monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036480436

Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series, and mostly can be found in either +3 or +4 ionization states. It can be considered one of the rare earth elements with relatively low toxicity and a lot of biological applications depending on its redox (reduction-oxidation) process between the +3/+4 ionization states and oxygen storage capability. This book focuses on the cerium compounds such as oxides and silicides, with detailed studies about its structures, characterizations and related applications. Chapter One mainly presents some optical characteristics of stoichiometric ceria nanoparticles - whether undoped or doped – with some other lanthanide elements. Then, some applications of ceria nanoparticles, such as optical nanosensors and solar cell coaters, are discussed based on optical characteristics of CeO2-x. Chapter Two studies the catalytic activity of cerium dioxide (CeO2) included within nanophase (nanocomposite) metal-oxide systems such as Al2O3/cordierite carriers and prototypes of anode materials for SOFCs (based on stabilized zirconia), within different processes of environmental catalysis. CeO2 increases stability of the Ni-Al2O3 catalysts by suppressing surface carbonization and enhancing resistance to poisoning by sulfur compounds. Cerium dioxide as a modifying additive within the ZnO–CuO–CeO2/Al2O3/cordierite catalysts is shown to stabilize their operation in the decomposition of methanol by suppressing surface carbonization, thereby facilitating hydrogen formation as the target product. In Chapter Three, another cerium-dependent compound –cerium silicide (CeSix) – and its nanowires were investigated over a broad range of different cerium monolayers on Si(110)-16×2 surfaces via scanning, tunneling, microscopy and spectroscopy. The growth progress of the CeSix nanowires undergoes a coverage-dependent metal-insulator-metal electronic transition, which has never been found in other rare-earth silicide nanowires. suppressing surface carbonization, thereby facilitating hydrogen formation as the target product. Moreover, the insulating CeSix nanowires have been structurally and electronically studied, without lattice distortions with large Coulomb repulsion energy between the filled and empty surface bands. Thus, the insulating phase of atomically precise CeSix nanowires is an electronically driven phase because of its temperature and structure independence. Chapter Four is mainly concerned with some biological applications of ceria nanostructures through the treatment of diseases characterized by increased oxidative stress levels. This chapter offers a study of consumption and occupational exposures, and consequently its toxicology properties are discussed due to the recent applications of nanoceria as a high priority material for toxicological evaluations. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In fact, it is mainly used to improve diagnosis and facilitate collaboration among healthcare professionals. Nevertheless, in order to build and deploy Electronic Medical Records (EMR), systems require powerful platform, including software and hardware. To address these issues, Cloud Computing has been recently introduced to reduce operating costs. In this respect, only needed resources are provided to the clients and billed according to services utilization. Accordingly, Storage-as-a-Service (SaaS) model aims at outsourcing the storage of medical data to a third party. In spite of its economic benefits, Cloud adoption still faces security challenges. Alternatively, various implementations based on traditional encryption algorithms have been suggested. However, most of them do not take into consideration image features, and hence, they are not suitable for medical images. They are also computationally expensive, and distort the medical image quality by using lossy methods. In this study, we rely on a segmentation approach to protect health information without affecting its quality. In this regard, the secret image is split into several portions by means of a K-means algorithm. Furthermore, each party is stored in a distinct Cloud to enhance data privacy. That is why we use DepSky as a Multi-Cloud environment for safeguarding patient’s digital records. The implementation results show that our proposal guarantees both security and quality of medical images. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Cloud computing; K-means; Security; Storage","Cloud computing; Cryptography; Data privacy; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Energy storage; Image segmentation; Imaging techniques; Medical computing; Medical image processing; Medicine; Operating costs; Storage as a service (STaaS); Ubiquitous computing; Electronic medical record; Encryption algorithms; Health care professionals; Health informations; K-means; Security; Security challenges; Software and hardwares; Medical imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034613533

The innovation of optical microscopy technology has been proven to be a driving force in the development of biology and medicine. In particular, advanced nonlinear optical microscopes have unique advantages over traditional microscopy approaches: intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) imaging with <1 um lateral resolution reduces photodamage to tissue samples, decreases photo-bleaching to fluorescent molecules, and gives a deep penetration depth with the usage of near-infrared lasers. In the past two decades, much effort has been devoted to develop nonlinear optical microscopy based on different kinds of nonlinear optical contrast mechanisms. In particular, the intrinsic nonlinear optical signals of two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF), second harmonic generation (SHG), third harmonic generation (THG), coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) have become the most popular contrast mechanisms for imaging a variety of biomedical specimens in vivo. Specifically, the recently developed spectral- and time-resolved fluorescence detection technology further enables investigating biochemical functions, such as energy metabolism, protein alteration, cellular acidification, etc., during the study of biological processes. This chapter focuses on introducing label-free and multimodal nonlinear optical microscopies and their potential biomedical applications. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.","Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering; Endogenous fluorophore; Hemoglobin; Label free; Multimodal imaging; Nonlinear optical microscopy; Second harmonic generation; Sum frequency generation; Supercontinuum; Third harmonic generation; Timeand spectral-resolved detection; Two-photon excitation fluorescence","Coherent scattering; Fluorescence; Fluorescence microscopy; Fluorophores; Harmonic analysis; Harmonic generation; Hemoglobin; Image enhancement; Infrared devices; Infrared lasers; Medical applications; Metabolism; Optical data storage; Optical microscopy; Photons; Raman spectroscopy; Stimulated Raman scattering; Coherent anti Stokes Raman scattering; Endogenous fluorophores; Label free; Multi-modal imaging; Nonlinear optical microscopy; Spectral resolved; Sum frequency generation; Super continuum; Two photon excitation fluorescence; Nonlinear optics",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034408307

Much of this has been done within the confines of the Global Energy Village, an annual storage event conducted by EnergyWise. An event brings together the best minds so that new trends and innovations can be explained and compared and thereby scenarios developed. Key issues include Europe’s diminished gas production and its increased dependency on gas imports, in particular from Russia. While gas imports will probably stay long term at their current level, long-term this can change. There is a question whether Gazprom can finance its Yamal’s assets to ensure a continued supply of gas to Europe. And Europeans are increasingly turning to renewable fuels. How this will play out remains to be seen. Europe’s energy politics is in the short-to-medium term a muddle. The rise of shale gas in the USA has given a sharp rise to coal imports to Europe. CO2 emission trading prices are too low; hence, they are irrelevant. Continuous subsidies for green energy continue to distort the marketplace. And in Germany ‘brown coal’ continues to be popular as an industrial fuel. Also an analysis is given of the oil and gas industry. The basic tenant of a hydrocarbon base, known in the industry as Reserve Replacement Ratio (RRR), is critically examined. Instead, it is argued that the industry should introduce an ‘Energy Unit’, based on renewables, and be CO2 neutral. This can be the basis of a new Energy Road Map. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034403781

Nowadays the lifetime of electronic devices is becoming very short. In order to cope with the exponentially growing amount of electronic waste, biodegradable organic electronic and photonic materials are needed and already considered by the world science and innovation community. Biopolymer materials are being developed, studied and already tested as substrates and insulators, semiconductors, and conductors. Organic materials are suited to produce electronics that possess functionalities inaccessible to standard crystalline semiconductors. Biopolymers find their application in solid polymer electrolytes for fuel cells, solar cells and energy storage batteries. The sustainable development of the society includes substitution of synthetic materials for bio-based materials in all areas, including the environment monitoring. This chapter presents: 1. Possible application in components for electronics and photonics of different biopolymer-based materials, such as cellulose and other polysaccharides (glucose, starch, PLA, chitosan, pectin, agar, etc.), DNA, as well as other natural biopolymer materials (silk, shellac, keratin, gelatin, melanine). 2.

Human rights to water, as water is becoming a commodity threatens the poor. Global water crisis in term of quantity and quality is a man-made disaster linked to environmental imbalance and degradation of the life-support ecosystem. It is a crisis of water management, fragmented institutions, inadequate policies and legal systems, lack of political will, and a widening gap between science and policy making at the national, regional and global levels. Already one third of the world population is living in water-scarce or water-short areas. Climate change will accelerate the figure to one-half. 12% of the world’s population uses 85% of its fresh water. And water supply resources are being stretched to their limits. By 2050 an additional three billion people will be born mostly in countries already suffering from water shortage. According to the IPCC-Nov 2014 report, the world’s electricity must be produced from zero carbon sources by 2050; otherwise, our planet faces irreversible damage. The report says renewables have to grow from 30% share of the power sector to 80%. And all fossil fuel generation without carbon capture and storage (CCS) has to be phased out by 2100. Global warming is unequivocally linked to human interference in the ecosystem, causing glaciers to melt on the polar ice caps resulting in the rise of sea level flooding of agricultural coastal areas. The Nile delta, which is the food basket of Egypt housing 46 million people, may disappear. Coastal fresh water aquifers may be flooded by seeping seawater threatening food security of many large regions of the world. With the advent of climate change, most of water stressed areas particularly in arid and semi-arid zones (Middle East and MENA regions) will face a rainfall decline of 20% and a temperature rise of 2-3 °C that would result in large losses of water resources, basic food, basic needs, and increased poverty. Water science is a “must” in developing a unique water management scheme. It contributes to well-defined policies for efficiency, sound strategy and sustainable plans of action. There is unlimited potential with what science can do on our planet, where salt water and fresh water comprise 97.5% and 2.5% of planet waters, respectively. With 70% of waters tied in polar caps, only 30% is left in rivers, lakes and ground waters to humanity. Food production accounts for 70% of water used in the world. Through the efficient use of water by renewables for desalination, recycling water for agriculture, using new cultivars under stress of low level of waters and brackish waters and genomes resistant to pests and droughts etc., have to intrigue scientists in our part of the world to find a lasting solution to the challenging problem. Fundamental change in water policies and engaging science to develop a unique water management scheme is imperative. Currently, water policies are divorced from sound science. Demands should be managed by a new culture of efficiency, cutting losses, and protecting water from overuse and pollution. There is no doubt that the Climate change and Water - Energy - Food security Nexus in the Arab Middle East, is becoming more complex due to rapid population growth and growing demands by industrial and agricultural developments. Therefore, science becomes crucial in providing the basis for sound governance and a holistic approach enlightened policy linked to energy and water management for sound food security. The potential of what modern science R&D can do is without limits. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Climate change; Global warming; Water management","Aquifers; Arid regions; Carbon capture; Climate change; Cultivation; Desalination; Ecosystems; Floods; Food supply; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Global warming; Hydrogeology; Population statistics; River pollution; Sea level; Water management; Water supply; Agricultural development; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Efficient use of water; Environment and development; Fundamental changes; Irreversible damage; Rapid population growth; Unlimited potentials; Water recycling",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034240714

The output power port of wind farm consists of a direct current (DC) collector . The offshore wind farm is integrated with a photovoltaic (PV) source and a battery storage system (BSS). The BSS and PV are needed for counteracting the intermittent power generation from offshore wind farm. The conventional AC power network consists largely of AC loads including few DC loads which are fed through the power converters. It is true that the power converters are the main sources of voltage/current harmonic distortion into the power system, thus affecting significantly the power quality. In this study, an interconnected AC and DC power networks is considered, which feed power separately to AC and low-voltage DC loads. The interchange of power between high-voltage DC link and low-voltage DC loads is facilitated through an automatic adapter. The technical concept of the automatic adapter is introduced in this chapter. The interchange of power between the AC and DC networks is facilitated through a bidirectional AC–DC voltage source converter (VSC). The proposed distributed power network topology reduces the need for large number of power converter into the conventional AC power network to feed DC loads, thus reducing the presence of voltage/current harmonic or ripple and also improving the AC network efficiency. Details of operation of the proposed distributed power network topology is analysed and discussed. The mechanism to control the active and reactive power is clearly explained. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed power network topology, intensive simulations are carried out using the Power Simulator (PSim) software. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Active rectifier; DC collection grid; Offshore wind farm; Voltage source converter; Wind energy conversion unit","Computer software; Electric impedance measurement; Electric network analysis; Electric power system interconnection; Electric rectifiers; Electric utilities; Energy conversion; HVDC power transmission; Offshore wind farms; Power converters; Topology; Active and Reactive Power; Active rectifiers; Alternating current; Battery storage system; DC collection grid; DC voltage sources; Distributed power; Voltage source converters; Electric power transmission networks",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034106891

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has presented a report claiming that it is possible to limit global warming by 2°C, only in case of abatement of carbon emissions (IPCC, 2013). Most of the UN countries, as a part of their effort, set policies that stimulate the use of technologies based on renewable energy sources (RES) that also contribute to a reduction of carbon emissions (IPCC, 2014). In the case of Kazakhstan, the government is conducting various programmes to switch to a “green economy”. While there are efforts to promote RES in Kazakhstan by introducing an additional price margin for electricity produced from renewables, the situation with current carbon releases is rather vague. There is uproar in the media regarding “decarbonisation”; however, the movement lacks real momentum. It is clear that decarbonisation is currently too expensive to conduct, due to the development phase of the associated technologies as well as high investment costs. It is necessary to point out that the launch of cleaner technologies is restricted by competition in the world market, and it will remain infeasible unless there is enforced help to overcome this barrier. Such help could be established by organising an emissions trading system or setting specific emission limits for each emitter as well as by introducing emission taxes. In this chapter, we propose a study of the CO2 allowance price and its impact on the penetration of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and RES technologies in Kazakhstan's energy sector. © 2018 Yelena Kalyuzhnova and Richard Pomfret.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032883536

We aimed to give a brief overview on the wealth of possibilities, also highlighting the particular importance of each method. The presented approaches span through chemical, electrochemical, and photo-polymerization of the conducting polymer (CP), but certain examples for the in situ formation of the inorganic component was also demonstrated. One common feature in all cases was the precise control over the properties of the organic/inorganic interface. Such control may include the manipulation of the composition, morphology, and optoelectronic properties of the hybrid assembly. It is also important that various comparative studies evidenced the superior performance of such prepared hybrid materials compared to their counterparts obtained via simple mechanical mixing.

Since the building sector still remains as one of the three major global end energy consumer - climate change is closely related to construction and design. We have developed the archetype sun space to what it is today : a simple but effective predominant naturally ventilated sun trap and as well as living space enlargement. With the invention of industrial glass orangery's more and more changed from frost protecting envelopes to living spaces from which we meantime expect thermal comfort in high quality. But what level of thermal comfort provide sun spaces? And to what extend may sun spaces manage autarkic operation profiting from passive solar gains and, beyond that, surplus energy generation for energy neutral conditioning of aligned spaces? We deliver detailed information for this detected gap of knowledge. We know about limited thermal comfort in sun spaces winter times. This reasons the inspection of manifold collector technologies, which enable to be embedded in facades and specifically in sun space envelopes. Nonetheless, effective façade integrated collectors are ineffective in seasons with poor irradiation. Hence, the mismatch of offer and demand we have experienced with renewable energies ignites thinking about appropriate seasonal energy storages, which enlarges the research scope of this work. This PhD thesis project investigates on both, a yearly empirical test set up analysis and a virtual simulation of different oriented and located sun spaces abroad Germany. Both empirical and theoretical evaluation result in a holistic research focusing on a preferred occupation time in terms of cumulative frequencies of operational temperature and decided local discomfort, of potential autarkic sun space operation and prospective surplus exergy for alternative heating of aligned buildings. The results are mapped geographically for Germany. Fossil fuel substitution, as far as this thesis elaborated, is closely related to quality of thermal comfort, sun space orientation and energetic standard of the aligned building. Unexpectedly, spaces, which define envelopes incorporating collectors in combination with storage technologies both profit and suffer to some extend in respect to thermal comfort. Essentially, we can conclude, that the more area-wise efficient and the more integral the collector technology is incorporated into façade design, the more distinct significance of thermal comfort quality and fossil fuel substitution is. Eventually, this dissertation determines the potential of a new generation of sun spaces in the context of energy transition. © 2017 Christian Wiegel.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031817816

Nevertheless, relatively limited synthetic methods for preparing these 2D nanosheets undoubtedly restrict further progress, especially for materials with non-layered structures or quasi-layered structures containing relatively strong bonds and van der Waals forces between layers. Therefore, developing novel synthetic methods for 2D nanosheet preparation will not only enrich the family of 2D crystals with atomic thickness, but also bring us unprecedented surprises.

These generators can be powered by various renewable energy sources. Distributed energy technologies are becoming increasingly important in the energy supply systems of many countries. Renewable distributed energy incorporates a wide range of renewable technologies including solar power, wind turbines, geothermal, hydro, biogas, energy storage and ocean thermal energy conversion systems. Renewable distributed energy also has the potential to mitigate congestion in transmission lines, reduce the impact of electricity price fluctuations, strengthen energy security and provide greater stability to the electricity grid. In this work, different renewable energy distributed generation technologies are discussed with their advantages and disadvantages. As a stand-alone system, renewable energy-based power plants often require a backup energy generator and a backup energy storage system due to the intermittent and unexpected nature of its availability. The former is utilized to facilitate the provision of electricity when the renewable energy source is not available, and the latter is a means to store excess electricity generated by the renewable energy source. By connecting a renewable energy system to an existing power grid, it is possible to bypass the need of additional components such as generators and battery systems, as the grid now acts as a backup power generator by providing electricity during downtime and by accepting excess electricity generated during surplus availability. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Energy policy; Energy security; Ocean thermal energy conversion; Solar energy; Wind turbines; Distributed generation technologies; Electricity price fluctuation; Energy storage systems; Ocean thermal energies; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy systems; Renewable energy technologies; Renewable technology; Geothermal energy",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029005985

Every operation regime has an optimum charging time, which increases by decreasing the hot gas inlet temperature. Also, there is an optimum gas mass flow rate that makes the exergy destruction number a minimum minimorum. The stratified TES units are normally more effective than the fully mixed units from the point of view of exergy conservation. The standard approach based on the concept of the number of thermal units tends to overestimate the performance of TES systems.

The water storage tank operates in fully mixed regime. An indirect optimal control technique based on Pontryagin’s maximum principle is implemented. The optimal operation strategy involves two-steps up and down jumps between zero and a maximum allowable fluid flow rate in the primary circuit. During days with overcast sky the pump in the primary circuit operates almost continuously. During days with cloudy or clear sky the pump often stops. When a constant flow rate strategy is adopted, there is an optimum ratio between the volume of the storage tank and the area of the solar energy collection surface: (Figure presented.) (Formula presented). The optimal control strategy does not exhibit such an optimum: the thermal energy supply to the user (slightly) decreases by increasing the ratio (Figure presented.) (Formula presented). Storage units are usually included in solar energy conversion systems designed for direct thermal energy utilization. Closed loop should be preferred to open loop configurations in this case.

In this paper, the cellulose fibers with energy storage and temperature regulation were prepared by wet spinning process using paraffin as phase change material. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) were utilized to characterize the morphology structure, crystalline properties, phase transition properties and heat resistance of fibers and so on. The results showed that the fiber surface without holes and paraffin was uniformly distributed in the cellulose matrix, and paraffin was not easily overflow during the process of phase change. Paraffin and cellulose substrate had good compatibility due to the interaction of hydrogen bonding, and 30% of paraffin did not cause a significant impact on the degree of crystallinity and thermal stability of cellulose fibers.

However, batteries can deliver power only for a limited time span. They slowly degrade with every charge-discharge cycle. This degradation needs to be taken into account when considering the battery in long lasting applications. Some detailed models that describe battery degradation processes do exist, however, these are complex models and require detailed knowledge of many (physical) parameters. Furthermore, these models are in general computationally intensive, thus rendering them less suitable for use in larger system-wide models. A model better suited for this purpose is the so-called Kinetic Battery Model. In this paper, we explore how this model could be enhanced to also cope with battery degradation, and with charging. Up till now, battery degradation nor battery charging has been addressed in this context.

The Srcomposition dependence of the dielectric performance in this thin film materials system was investigated. The results indicated that dielectric constant changing with Sr-composition in the PSNN thin films showed the shape of a parabola, resulting from the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) effect caused by the existence of both orthorhombic and tetragonal tungsten bronze phases.

The very dissimilar characteristics of these elements, as well as the ever increasing performance requirements imposed to them, makes the design of control systems for power generation plants a remarkably challenging task. A promising approach to provide effective solutions to this problem is by applying the paradigms of Intelligent Agents and Multi-Agent Systems. In this paper, the definition of an Intelligent Multi-Agent System for Supervision and Control (iMASSC) is proposed to create intelligent power plants for either renewable or conventional power generation units. A Multi-Agent System with a generic structure is used instead of a single specific Intelligent Agent. This approach is more realistic in that it takes into account the complexity of current power plants. Later, the community of intelligent power plants, through autonomous and coherent collaboration, will achieve the objectives of the hybrid power system. Hence, the iMASSC model is expected to provide feasible solutions to the operation of modern intelligent hybrid power systems and smart grids. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Hybrid power systems; Intelligent agents; Intelligent power plants; Multiagent systems","Artificial intelligence; Electric power transmission networks; Intelligent agents; Smart power grids; Soft computing; Conventional power plants; Design of control system; Hybrid power systems; Intelligent multi agent systems; Intelligent power plants; Multiple agent systems; Performance requirements; Power generation plants; Multi agent systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028474670

As a component of a data center, the storage system consumes almost 27% of the total energy. Therefore, increasing attention has been drawn to the research on energy conservation. In this paper, existing energy-saving methods for disk drives are summarized, which include disk power management, cache management, workload skew and RAID configuration. We find that power management is the basic strategy widely used in other models. Workload skew is efficient for energy saving although it could cause response delay due to the load concentration. Multiple models based on RAID are also developed for energy conservation.

Then we use the tree-like structure to store the popular data and use the redundant mode to store the cold data.

Meanwhile, researches on AODV have very in-depth, whether in improving performance, or enhancing security. Unfortunately, there are few researches on joint energy efficiency and security. In this article, we propose an Energy-efficient Secure AODV Protocol (E-SAODV) in Industrial Wireless Sensor Network (IWSN).

However, there exist performance limitations due to existence of elasticity in SEAs, i.e., low accuracy in position control, low control bandwidth in force control as coupling stability is guaranteed, and impedance constraints in impedance control. Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs) are designed to address the performance degradation but increases complexity in mechanism. As a result, control in SEAs plays a more important role than that in their rigid counterparts. We address this challenge by cascade control severing as the same purpose as that of VSAs’ without losing favorable advantages of SEAs to imitate humanoid manipulation. Then stability and passivity constraints is derived. Performance analysis is conducted in terms of quasi-rigid performance and apparent stiffness.

The epoxy group in GO structure was reduced using hydrazine 80 wt% at a temperature of 70, 80, and 90 °C. The optical properties of produced rGO were characterized by using UV-Vis and FTIR spectrometer. From UV-Vis spectroscopy we observe that the absorbance of rGO decreased as increasing the reduction temperature because the higher reduction temperature yields a high degree of rGO defect. The rGO produced at a reduction temperature of 70 °C has very close similiraties absorbance spectrum with rGO produced by Sigma Aldrich Company.The UV-Vis absorbance of rGO was used to calculated optical constant, and by using Kramers-Kronig relation we got refractive index values of rGO. The decreasing of absorbance may also stem out from the reducing of C=C bonding with sp2hybridization due to the presence of energetic Hydrazine as indicated by the decrease of FTIR spectrum at ~1600 cm–1. Our produced rGO then used to fabricated the supercapacitor device with a mass of 0,03 gram using Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) as a binder. From cyclic voltammetry measurement, we obtain the specific capacitance of our rGO-based supercapacitor is 2.45 F which is still in the category of supercapacitive although the optimization of rGO and PVA composition is still required. Our result shows the exciting potential of rGO based supercapacitor as electrical energy storage. © 2017, Trans Tech Publications Ltd.

A robust sliding mode control scheme is proposed to ensure system stability in the presence of CPL and the desired DC bus voltage regulation. Furthermore, a charging/discharging algorithm is implemented in the control loops of BDC to facilitate three mode charging of the battery bank. The test system consists of solar PV arrays interfaced to dc bus through dc/dc boost converters, energy storage system (lead-acid batteries) interfaced through a BDC, and a mixed load (Resistive, voltage regulator and a speed controlled drive). Tightly regulated voltage regulator and a speed controlled dc/dc drive, both represent CPLs in the system. The proposed theory is validated through simulation studies and experimental results. It is shown through simulation studies and experimental results that the proposed control scheme ensures stabilized dc bus voltage, i.e. it does not show any destabilizing effect of CPLs, under different operating conditions. It has been found that the proposed control ensures voltage regulation of less than 5 % and is robust to changes in the load. © The Author(s) 2017.","Bidirectional DC/DC buck-boost converter (BDC); Boost converter; CPL; DC microgrid; SMC; Stability","Charging (batteries); Convergence of numerical methods; Electric batteries; Lead acid batteries; Photovoltaic cells; Robust control; Secondary batteries; Sliding mode control; System stability; Voltage regulators; DC-DC converters; Energy storage; Microgrids; Speed regulators; Bidirectional DC/DC; BOOST converter; Charging/discharging; Dc micro-grid; Dc-bus voltage regulations; Destabilizing effect; Different operating conditions; Energy storage systems; Robust sliding mode; Simulation studies; Solar PV arrays; DC-DC converters; Electric machine control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026884003

Fog networking is an emerging paradigm of computing. Advances in neural networks research and their benefits in accurate classification make them best candidate for application to prognostics. Ubiquity of smartphones, wearables and sensors is giving rise to tremendous amount of data necessitating intelligent data analytics at the data center. Various researches have focused on compression of large deep models for inferencing on smart devices in order to seek answers to issues like reducing the enormity of computation, decreasing the power and memory requirements on these devices. At this point in time, state of the art in inference such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) seem impossible to be implemented on resource constrained devices. Cloud based inference incurs cost in terms of power as more energy is depleted to access infrastructure via technologies such as 3g/4g networks while also witnessing latency issues due to network congestion. A few real world situations offload inferencing to network edge as it is more beneficial to solve many issues like security, privacy of users, redundancy rather than uploading enormous volume of data on cloud. The paradigm, known as Fog Computing, is a hot topic in research facilitating edge analytics by overcoming constraints and shortcoming of cloud enabling quality of service (QoS) required in some real world applications such as Industrial Internet of Things (IoT). Fog acts as a medium between edge device and cloud. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach of using Fog in conjunction with deep neural nets for inferencing. We propose how neural nets exploited by Fog/Cloudlet can provide computational and storage services to nearby devices and it will also put a barrier by filtering the voluminous data to a reduced form for cloud. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","CNN; Fog computing; LSTM; RNN","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Digital storage; Fog; Industrial research; Internet of things; Quality of service; Recurrent neural networks; Internet of Things (IOT); LSTM; Memory requirements; Network congestions; Real world situations; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Resourceconstrained devices; Storage services; Neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026782873

Considering that the performance of supercapacitors largely depends more on the electrode architectures than on the intrinsic properties of CNTs, especially in the case of hybrid electrodes whose synergetic effect plays a crucial role, the designing (or controlling) of CNT architectures is thus of great importance. Because architectures with suitable design can provide a highly conductive network with highly accessible specific surface area (SSA) and proper pore size distribution (PSD), which are crucial for charge transportation and ion diffusion, a review focusing more on the electrode architectures is necessary. This chapter focuses particularly on the elaboration of designing and controlling the architecture/structure of CNT-based electrodes, as well as their effects on material properties such as effective SSA and PSD as well as the device performance of electrochemical capacitors (ECs).

Insulin resistance (IR)-associated S-nitrosylation of insulin-signaling proteins increases in obesity. In accordance with the inhibition of insulin-mediated anti-lipolytic action, plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels increase. Additionally, endoplasmic reticulum stress stimuli induce lipolysis by activating cyclic adenosine monophosphate/Protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ½ (ERK1/2) signaling in adipocytes. Failure of packaging of excess lipid into lipid droplets causes chronic elevation of circulating fatty acids, which can reach to toxic levels within non-adipose tissues. Deleterious effects of lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues are known as lipotoxicity. In fact, triglycerides may also serve a storage function for long-chain non-esterified fatty acids and their products such as ceramides and diacylglycerols (DAGs).

After washing and peeling, the cassava is grated and then water is added in order to extract the starch. The mixture is filtered such that a rich starch solution and a wet solid residue can be separated. This slurry, known as bagasse, comprises up to 20% of the weight of the processed cassava. In addition, as the extraction of starch from cassava is less efficient than those based on processing of potato or maize, the bagasse contains around 50-70% of starch on a dry basis. As it has no important use, with the exception of animal feed, the bagasse is usually rejected to water courses increasing the environmental pollution. Therefore, several strategies are being studied to find useful applications for this by-product. Pyrolysis of the bagasse and copyrolysis, namely the thermal degradation of mixtures of the bagasse and lignocellulosic biomass in inert atmosphere, could be an appealing possibility to employ this waste in order to generate green energy and/or other value-added products. In particular, growing attention is paid to the liquid products arising from pyrolysis/copyrolysis, commonly known as bio-oils, since they show many of the advantages of liquid fuels, such as inexpensive storage and transportation, and high energy density. In this scenario, the processes of pyrolysis of cassava starch, the major constituent of dry cassava bagasse, and of copyrolyisis of the starch with peanut hulls, an abundant lignocellulosic residue, were studied by performing experiments in a fixed-bed reactor at different process temperatures (400ºC – 600ºC). The pyrolysis of the starch led to a higher maximum yield of bio-oils that took place at a lower temperature than the copyrolysis (57 wt% at 400ºC vs. 49 wt% at 500ºC). Physichochemical characterization of the three kinds of pyrolysis/copyrolysis products with emphasis on the bio-oils was carried out mainly by proximate and ultimate analyses, Karl-Fischer titration, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, N2 adsorption, scanning electronic microscopy, and gas chromatography (GC-TCD and GC-MS). While the pyrolysis of the starch resulted in bio-oils with less nitrogen content, the copyrolysis produced bio-oils with lower content of oxygen and higher carbon percent. Water content of the bio-oils increased with rising process temperatures and it was lower for the liquids resulting from the pyrolysis of the starch. Also, the bio-oils arising from the pyrolysis of the starch presented more sugar compounds and fewer phenols. Besides, the pyrolysis of the starch led to a lower yield of solid products (bio-chars) than the copyrolysis. They showed greater high heating values (up to 35 MJ/kg) than those arising from the latter process in agreement with their larger carbon content and lower presence of ash. In addition, the bio-chars produced at the highest process temperature presented an incipient pore development, suggesting their possible use as rough adsorbents or as intermediary for further upgrading to activated carbons. Furthermore, the pyrolysis of cassava starch and copyrolysis with peanut hulls generated gases, principally CO2, CO, CH4 and H2, that could help to sustain the processes. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Bio-oils; Bioenergy; Cassava bagasse; Cassava starch; Copyrolysis; Pyrolysis",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020128833

It is the (1-4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucan, industrially produced from marine resources with a limited degree of deacetylation. The effect of acetylation degree on the particle and tableting properties of chitin was evaluated. Chitin having different acetylation degrees was attained by hydrolysis with a 10 M sodium hydroxide at 120°C and different reaction times. This dispersion was then neutralized with an 8% HCl solution, vacuum filtered and washed until a conductivity of < 20 μS/cm was reached and filtered. The cake product was dried at 60°C for 24 h and passed through a #100 mesh sieve. The resulting degree of acetylation, particle properties, thermogram, contact angle, surface roughness and surface free energy were evaluated. Moreover, compressibility and compactibility analyses were performed on compacts of ~500 mg made on a single punch tablet machine at compression pressures ranging from 30 to 125 MPa. Lubricant sensitivity was assessed by mixing the powders with magnesium stearate at 99:1 weight ratio and measuring their compact tensile strength. The elastic recovery test was performed on compacts having a 20% porosity. Tablet thickness was measured immediately after ejected and after 7 days of storage. Disintegration profiles were conducted on compacts made at pressures ranging from 30 to 140 MPa in distilled water at 37°C and 30 strokes/min. The alkaline hydrolysis treatment effectively decreased the acetylation degree, degree of crystallinity, thermal event of acetamide groups, powder densification, flow, but increased the surface free energy, roughness index, work of adhesion, porosity, compactibility and particle rearrangement. Further, the plastic deforming character of chitin increased as the acetylation degree decreased. Therefore, the best compactibility was obtained in samples having a low acetylation degree, whereas a larger brittle deforming character was observed for samples having a high acetylation degree (i.e., 100%). However, samples were virtually no sensitive to compaction speed and sensitivity towards magnesium stearate decreased with deacetylation. Further, no relation was found between disintegration time and acetylation degree. All samples released more than 94.5% of metropolol tartrate (highly soluble drug) within 30 minutes. The above results show that chitin having different degrees of acetylation can be used as an excipient for the preparation of solid dosage forms. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Acetylation degree; Chitin; Particle and tableting properties; Surface","Chitin; Chlorine compounds; Compaction; Deformation; Free energy; Hydrolysis; Magnesium; Marine biology; Organic polymers; Porosity; Powders; Surface roughness; Surfaces; Tensile strength; Alkaline hydrolysis treatment; Degree of acetylation; Degree of crystallinity; Degree of deacetylation; Degrees of acetylation; Lubricant sensitivities; Particle rearrangement; Tableting properties; Acetylation",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020084407

However, in order to meet the computing and intelligent networking demands in 5G network and IoT, the cloud alone encounters growing limitations for the requirements such as reduced latency, high mobility, high scalability and real time execution. Fog Computing and Networking, or briefly Fog emerged to resolve these limitations. Fog extends the cloud to the edge of the network and distributes computing, data processing, and networking services closer to end user devices. It is an architecture where distributed edge and user devices collaborate with each other and with the clouds to carry out computing, control, networking, and data management tasks. Fog in 5G network significantly improves the network performance in terms of spectral and energy efficiency, enables direct device-to-device wireless communications, and supports the growing trend of network function virtualization and separation of network control intelligence from radio network hardware. It also effectively addresses a wide range of unique IoT challenges such as security for resource-constrained endpoints or support for local analytics.

One of the major factors that can increase the efficiency of wind turbines (WTs) is the simultaneous control of the different parts in several operating area. A high performance controller can significantly increase the amount and quality of energy that can be captured from wind. The main problem associated with control design in wind generator is the presence of asymmetric in the dynamic model of the system, which makes a generic supervisory control scheme for the power management of WT complicated. Consequently, supervisory controller can be utilized as the main building block of a wind farm controller (offshore), which meets the grid code requirements and can increased the efficiency of WTs, the stability and intermit-tency problems of wind power generation. This Chapter proposes a new robust adaptive supervisory controller for the optimal management of a variable speed turbines (VST) and a battery energy storage system (BESS) in both regions (II and III) simultaneously under wind speed variation and grid demand changes. To this end, the second order sliding mode (SOSMC) with the adaptive gain super-twisting control law and fuzzy logic control (FLC) are used in the machine side, BESS side and grid side converters. The control objectives are fourfold: (i) Control of the rotor speed to track the optimal value; (ii) Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) mode or power limit mode for adaptive control; (iii) Maintain the DC bus voltage close to its nominal value; (iv) Ensure: a smooth regulation of grid active and reactive power quantity, a satisfactory power factor correction and a high harmonic performance in relation to the AC source and eliminating the chattering effect. Results of extensive simulation studies prove that the proposed supervisory control system guarantees to track reference signals with a high harmonic performance despite external disturbance uncertainties. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","A high performance; Fuzzy logic; Power management; Second order sliding mode control, power limit; Supervisory control; Wind turbine",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018900407

The developed model for the hybrid system’s optimal power flow management aims to minimize electricity purchased from the grid while maximizing the energy sold to the grid as well as the production of the renewable sources subject to the power balance, photovoltaic, wind, and battery storage outputs as well as other operational constraints. Relating to demand-side management, a control technique is developed to optimally schedule the power flow from the different components of the hybrid system over 24-h horizon.

As the consequence of the power unbalancing into their distribution networks, under frequency load shedding (UFLS) which leads to life span reduction of various expensive equipment and deteriorating production in general are of much concerns. Thus, proper control system for the load flow in a system like microgrids (MG) with RER in general is the first thing to carry out the assessment with the aim to solve the power balancing problem within the power system networks. Actually, the major problems which many utilities are facing all over the world are how to utilize the available and future energy resource reserves in order to balance between the supply and demand sides within their power distribution networks. Moreover, because of the quick, improvised and unforeseen increasing number of consumers’ power demands and lack of additional macro energy resources plants which can favorably respond to the instantaneous consumer requirements, optimal control strategy (OCS) is inevitable. The OCS is required to maintain the steady-state operations and ensure the reliability of the entire distribution system over a long period. For that case, the OCS is required to principally stabilize parameters such as voltage, frequency, and limit the injection of reactive power into the MG system under stress. Therefore, in this chapter, the OCS is proposed as an approach to be applied in an intelligent way to solve the UFLS and blackout problems (BP) in a typical MG with RER. The proposed control solution is analyzed using emergency power supply reserves integrated with RER. These typical energy resources can be wind and photovoltaic (solar PV) systems associated with the battery energy storage system (BESS), hydro pump storage, biomass power plant and fuel cell systems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Batteries energy storage systems (BESS); Microgrid (MG); Optimal control system (OCS); PV system; Renewable energy resources (RER); Under frequency load shedding (UFLS); Wind turbine","Battery storage; Economics; Electric load flow; Electric power plant loads; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power system control; Facings; Fuel cell power plants; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Microgrids; Optimal control systems; Pumped storage power plants; Renewable energy resources; Solar cells; Solar power plants; Technology transfer; Wind turbines; Energy storage systems; Micro grid; PV system; Renewable energy resource (RER); Underfrequency load-shedding; Electric load shedding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018835626

However, since the associated populations are often scattered among different settlements in remote locations, renewable energy sources (RES) are increasingly meeting their electrical production power demands. Contrary to FF generated power, RES vary with season, time and weather conditions. Consequently, to maintain stability, reliability and power quality, energy storage is a key consideration for a viable RES set-up. Despite, there being many different kinds of energy storage system, a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) appears to be highly suitable for the microgrid (MG), because of their minimal environmental impact (green energy storage) and high cycle life when compared with other storage energy devices such as batteries. This chapter presents a detailed overview of the feasibility, design and control strategy of a FESS for MG applications.

We clearly note here that our investigation pertains the local temporal effects of the cache resizing and how we counteract the negative impact of cache misses in such resizing instances. We propose a novel reconfigurable d-cache framework that can dynamically adapt its least recently used (LRU) replacement policy without much hardware overhead. We demonstrate that using our adaptive d-cache, it ensures a smooth cache performance from one cache size to the other.

At present, the different energy sources (i.e., electricity, gas, district heating) are used separately without any connection to each other. To increase the flexibility of energy supply, the usage of energy hubs is a possible way. Energy hubs are connection points between the energy sources that comprise the key elements of so-called hybrid networks. Using the energy/hub approach, surpluses and power shortages from a specific energy network can be avoided. The hubs offer various technologies of energy conversion and can include electrical and thermal storage. Thus it is possible to convert electrical into thermal energy (heat pump, electric heating), chemical (gas) into thermal (furnace), or electrical energy (micro gas turbine) into, respectively, thermal and electrical energy (combined heat and power) depending on the used technology. The correct operating strategy for these energy hubs is an essential factor in order to minimize CO2 emissions of urban energy systems. Therefore, a simulation model was developed in MATLAB®. The minimization of CO2 emissions is based on a mixed-integer linear optimization of the overall system, consisting of the supplying infrastructure, energy hubs, and thermal/electric loads. First results have been obtained by a case study for an urban region supplied by three different energy carriers (gas, electricity, and district heating). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Energy hub; Hybrid network; MILP; Multi-energy system; Power flow calculations",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017470296

That's why the right choice of material for heat storage directly affects the utilization efficiency of solar thermal energy. Research on heat storage materials nowadays focuses on phase-change materials (PCMs) enabling repeatedly utilize the latent heat of the phase transition between the solid and liquid phase. Most currently used PCMs have low thermal conductivity, which prevents them from the overcoming problem of rapid load changes in the charging and discharging processes. To overcome this obstacle and to obtain excellent heat storage possibility, various techniques have been proposed for enhancing the thermal conductivity of PCMs, such as adding metallic or nonmetallic particles, incorporating of porous or expanded materials, fibrous materials, macro-, micro-, or nano-capsules, etc.The authors of this study report particularly the huge potential of oxide nano-additives, such as titania (TiO2), alumina (Al2O3), silica (SiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO), that are even in small quantities (up to 3 wt.%) able significantly to enhance the heat storage characteristics of conventional PCMs. Moreover, the microstructure of the granules produced by recycling of aluminium scrap refers to the possibility of their utilizing for the purpose of low-cost solutions enabling to increase the thermal conductivity of PCMs. The above-mentioned technical solutions are therefore the important keys to successful commercialization of materials for latent heat storage in the future building industry. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Latent heat; Oxide nano-additives; Phase-change materials (PCMs); Thermal energy storage; Titanium dioxide nanoparticles","Additives; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Construction industry; Heat storage; II-VI semiconductors; Latent heat; Metallography; Microstructure; Nanocapsules; Phase transitions; Scrap metal reprocessing; Silica; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Zinc oxide; Building industry; Discharging process; Low thermal conductivity; Nano additives; Solar thermal energy; Storage characteristic; Technical solutions; Utilization efficiency; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017021851

The crystal structure, microstructure, absorption and reduction performances of the NSR catalyst were characterized and analyzed by X-Ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) and H2 temperature program reduction (H2-TPR). The experimental results show that the Ba and Ce elements mainly exist in the forms of BaCO3and CeO2, respectively, and partial CeO2 is amorphous.

Multifaceted therapeutic approaches are called for to halt the cascade from neonatal adiposity/high birth weight to childhood excessive weight gain/adult obesity with comorbidities. Recent experimental and clinical data provide one new target for interventions aiming to close this vicious circle: the microbiota. An aberrant gut microbiota, dysbiosis, induces immune and metabolic disturbances both locally and, consequent upon impaired gut barrier function, also systemic low-grade inflammation, which is causally linked to insulin resistance. The gut microecology could thus fill the gap between energy intake and expenditure by processing nutrients and regulating their access to and storage in the body, producing chemicals of hormonal nature and controlling the secretion of proinflammatory mediators locally and systemically. Conversely, being highly sensitive to environmental impacts, particularly to early feeding, the compositional development of the gut microbiota may prove the target of choice in efforts to reduce the risk of obesity. It has been demonstrated that a lower number of bifidobacteria precedes the development of obesity, and a dearth of butyrate-producing bacteria and an overall richness of bacteria increase the risk of metabolic disease; moreover, recognition that practices known to disrupt the early gut microbiota, e.g., cesarean section delivery and antibiotic exposure, contribute to obesity, encourages to pursue this line of research. © 2017 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S.

At present, the different energy sources (i.e., electricity, gas, district heating) are used separately without any connection to each other. To increase the flexibility of energy supply, the usage of energy hubs is a possible way. Energy hubs are connection points between the energy sources that comprise the key elements of so-called hybrid networks. Using the energy/hub approach, surpluses and power shortages from a specific energy network can be avoided. The hubs offer various technologies of energy conversion and can include electrical and thermal storage. Thus it is possible to convert electrical into thermal energy (heat pump, electric heating), chemical (gas) into thermal (furnace), or electrical energy (micro gas turbine) into, respectively, thermal and electrical energy (combined heat and power) depending on the used technology. The correct operating strategy for these energy hubs is an essential factor in order to minimize CO2 emissions of urban energy systems. Therefore, a simulation model was developed in MATLAB®. The minimization of CO2 emissions is based on a mixed-integer linear optimization of the overall system, consisting of the supplying infrastructure, energy hubs, and thermal/electric loads. First results have been obtained by a case study for an urban region supplied by three different energy carriers (gas, electricity, and district heating). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Energy hub; Hybrid network; MILP; Multi-energy system; Power flow calculations","Carbon dioxide; District heating; Energy conversion; Heat storage; Integer programming; Linear programming; MATLAB; Energy hubs; Hybrid network; MILP; Multi-energy systems; Power flow calculations; Electric load flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008870810

The heat recovery from high temperature slags (1450–1650 °C) from the metallurgical process represents one of the greatest potential to reduce the carbon emission in the steel industry (460 million tons of blast furnace slags (BFS) and 150 million tons of steel slags (SS) in 2012). The basic constraints of slag heat recovery include the low thermal conductivity and the easy crystallization trend. To meet these constraints and achieve the aim of heat recovery, many methods have been proposed and investigated during the past few decades, which could be divided into physical method, chemical method, and other method based on the working mechanism. The fundamental property of the hot slags that the cooling path of the slags could be composed of three regions, namely the liquid region, the crystallization region and the solid region, determined that a two-step physical method composed of a granulation atomizer and a fluidized bed for heat transfer and a two-stage process combined with physical dry granulation and chemical reaction are theoretically reasonable, which represents the research trend nowadays. The combination of the phase change material (PCM) heat storage and chemical methods could make up another research trend in the future especially when the crystallization behavior of the molten slags could be ignored. Besides, in the integrated system proposed recently, the obtained glassy blast furnace slags could be utilized in the cement industry because of the severe challenge of GHG emission reduction in the cement industry (3.7 billion tons of CO2 in 2013). Only by employing a reasonable and efficient method, could the waste heat in the high temperature slags be effectively recovered and target of the GHG emission reduction in the steel industry be achieved. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Chemical method; Emission reduction; Energy saving; Heat recovery; High temperature slag; Integrated system; Physical method","Blast furnaces; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cements; Crystallization; Emission control; Energy conservation; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Global warming; Granulation; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Integrated control; Phase change materials; Reduction; Slags; Steelmaking; Thermal conductivity; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Chemical method; Emission reduction; High temperature; Integrated systems; Physical methods; Steel metallurgy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994496744

With the large-scale application of soil source coupling heat pump, the influence factors are also appeared. Accordingly, the effect of the groundwater flow on nest of tubes heat transfer performance is especially obvious. This paper simulated the fluid in the tube,the nest of tubes,the surrounding soil under storage conditions, based on the nest of tubes of heat seepage coupling heat transfer model. This paper studied the influences of groundwater seepage to the heat of nest of tubes, at the same time make a comparison to the no seepage condition. It shows that groundwater seepage compared to no seepage condition can effectively reduce the outlet temperature of the buried pipe. In the 80–400 m/y seepage velocity range, unit well depth in heat changes linearly with the seepage flow velocity roughly. If the seepage velocity is 500 m/y, its unit well depth in heat increases about 79.73 %. In the system design; we should consider this influence factor. Otherwise, there will be a great bias. When considering seepage factor, the heat transfer rate of per unit length increase, so we can reduce the design capacity, and thus make the system better and save the resources. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Heat seepage coupling heat transfer; Numerical simulation; Soil source coupling heat pump; The nest of tubes","Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Economic and social effects; Flow velocity; Global warming; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Heat pump systems; Heat transfer; Pumps; Seepage; Soils; Temperature; Tubes (components); Building energy efficiency; Groundwater seepage; Heat pumps; Heat transfer model; Heat transfer performance; Large-scale applications; Low temperature heat sources; Outlet temperature; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994493217

Sensible thermal energy storage and latent thermal energy storage are already in use. However, the drawbacks of bulk size (small energy storage density) and the strict requirement for thermal insulation have hindered their wide applications. Sorption and thermochemical reactions used for thermal energy storage have been considered as a future great potential product for thermal energy storage of solar energy, waste heat. or even electric heating, etc. The market thus needs such a “thermal battery,” which should be with a variety of kWhs capacities. Several key challenges remain in the way of the development of an efficient sorption thermal battery: sorption materials with high storage density and low cost, sorption bed with good heat and mass transfer to ensure charging power and discharging power, being stable after repeated cycles, minimum heat capacity ratio between the inert materials to the sorption thermal energy; control of the output temperature and power to meet the use demand.

One of these is pollution of soil, water and environment by improper storage and usage of manure. The great difficulties create liquid manure generated during water cleaning of the premises. In our country, many livestock farms are left without technology solutions for storage and use of manure, this may lead to environment pollution. Increase of the concentrations of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide—CO2, methane—CH4 and nitrous oxides—N2O) has been observed since the end of the nineteenth century. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global average temperature of the land surface has risen by 0.4–0.8 °C for the last 100 years due to the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (CO2 emissions by 29 %, CH4 emissions by 150 % and N2O emissions by 15 %) (Mitova and Petrova, International symposium INMATEH agricultural engineering, 2013; Thorne, Environ Health Perspect 115:296–297, 2007; Topping, http://www. climate.org/2002/programs/washington_summit_temperature_rise.shtml, 2007) [15, 31, 32]. The FAO found that the animal agriculture sector emits 18 %, or nearly one-fifth, of human-induced GHG emissions, more than the transportation sector (Proorocu et al., Bull USAMV Agric 67(2), 2010; Silverstein, Energy Biz Insider, 2007; Steinfeld et al., Livestock’s long shadow: environmental issues and options.

In order to reduce the pollutant effect of livestock and reduction of greenhouse gases is necessary to carry out properly storage and recovery of waste from animal farming. Waste management from livestock is related to their location, the cleaning of the premises, characteristics, availability of enough space in the area, periods of storage, utilization of manure, etc. The aim of this study is to analyze and evaluate the manure from livestock farms in the region of Veliko Tarnovo and recommend technology solutions for proper utilization, to reduce pollution and gas emissions into the atmosphere. Fourteen farms in Veliko Tarnovo region were surveyed. The comparative agrochemical, chemical and environmental assessment of stayed and fresh manure, found that the greatest nutritional value has poultry manure, followed by pig and cattle manure.

In this study, a new type of SSPCM with increased thermal conductivity is formulated through a self-established experimental device. A model to analyze the thermal performance of the SSPCM floor is developed. The model is used to analyze the thermal performance of the SSPCM floor with two heating positions, one at the bottom and the other in the middle of the SSPCM. Results show that when the heating position is in the middle of the SSPCM, the melting speed is faster and the melting degree of SSPCM is larger than when it is at the bottom. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications.","Computational fluid dynamics (CFD); Shape-stabilized phase change material (SSPCM); Thermal energy storage (TES); Thermal performance","Computational fluid dynamics; Energy utilization; Floors; Heat storage; Heating; Melting; Passive solar buildings; Phase change materials; Technical presentations; Thermal energy; Experimental devices; In-buildings; Melting speed; Reduce energy consumption; Shape stabilized phase change material; Thermal Performance; Thermal conductivity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994335513

Besides, the value invested, the storage space, the energy costs and temperature control must also be considered. It has been shown that the aging process can include a heating step under controlled conditions, which can decrease the time necessary to achieve the characteristics of a typical fortified wine. The temperature control inside the tanks in the Madeira wine storage, mostly carried out manually, is the most important step to achieve a high quality wine. This work describes the procedure developed to implement, at low cost, an automatic temperature control inside the tanks in a pilot scale unit. Five different controllers were tested, where the Direct Inverse Control was the one that shows the best performance. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Artificial neural networks; Automatic control; Direct inverse control; Madeira wine aging process","Automation; Control; Neural networks; Process control; Tanks (containers); Temperature control; Wine; Aging process; Controlled conditions; Direct inverse control; Energy cost; High quality; Madeira wine; Pilot scale; Storage spaces; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988527286

Management decisions in turn depend on whether, what information (volume and quality) comes, how it is processed and used. In the coming decades the relevance of this problem will growsince information becomes themain strategic resource in the competitive struggle. In this regard it becomes topical the problems associated with the unification of territorially distributed facilities power systems into a single information space, which provides: integrated view of the complex control object as a whole; a comprehensive analysis of the collected information about him; the extraction from the huge volume of detailed data some useful information-knowledge about the regularities of its development. Solving these problems is possible by introduction in the practice of modern information and intelligent decision making support technology. In the basis of these technologies are the automated information–analytical systems (IAS) for the collection, storage systematization, processing, analysis and presentation of information. This report is dedicated of the new information–analytical technologies, allowing automating the management of energy efficiency in enterprises.
