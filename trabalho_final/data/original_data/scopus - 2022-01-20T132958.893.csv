Here, we demonstrate for MX@C70 systems that the relative orientation of enclosed MX with respect to a set of electrodes connected to the system can be controlled by application of oriented external electric field(s). We suggest systems with two- and four-terminal electrodes, in which the source and drain electrodes help the current to pass through the device and help the switching between the conductive states of FSD via applied voltage. The gate electrodes then assist the switching by effectively lowering the energy barrier between local minima via stabilizing the transition state of switching process if the applied voltage between the source and drain is insufficient to switch the MX inside the fullerene. Using nonequilibrium Green’s function combined with density functional theory (DFT-NEGF) computations, we further show that conductivity of the studied MX@C70 systems depends on the relative orientation of MX inside the cage with respect to the electrodes. Therefore, the orientation of the MX inside C70 can be both enforced (“written”) and retrieved (“read”) by applied voltage. The studied systems thus behave like voltage-sensitive switching molecular diodes, which is reminiscent of a molecular memristor. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Data handling; Density functional theory; Digital storage; Diodes; Drain current; Electric fields; Electrodes; Fullerenes; Refractory metal compounds; Endohedral fullerene; External electric field; Relative orientation; Source and drain electrodes; Source and drains; Switching diodes; Switching process; Terminal electrodes; Switching; fullerene; metal; nonmetal; Article; chemical analysis; chemical procedures; conductance; data analysis; density functional theory; electric field; electric potential; encapsulation; energy; molecular stability; molecule; phase transition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076278663

Despite generally regarded as being decisive for the ultimate success of these energy storage devices, this surface chemistry has so far only been explored to a rather limited extent in the scientific literature, but constitutes a research area which is currently undergoing rapid progress due to the growing interest in solid-state electrolyte materials and their corresponding battery applications. The review discusses the technical difficulties in performing these interfacial analyses for both ceramic and solid polymer electrolyte systems, and describes ways to overcome them using different methodologies: electrochemical techniques (primarily impedance spectroscopy), photoelectron spectroscopy, microscopy, and other less familiar experimental techniques. Modelling studies of the solid electrolyte–electrode interface are also included. It is concluded that especially the interfacial chemistry of polymer electrolytes has indeed been an understudied area. Furthermore, the review shows that analytical techniques employed so far have been largely complimentary to each other, but that joint studies and the development of novel analytical tools exploiting large-scale facilities will boost this research over the coming years. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Interface; Li-battery; Modelling; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Solid electrolyte; Solid electrolyte interphase; Solid state battery","Chemical analysis; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Interface states; Interfaces (materials); Lithium batteries; Models; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Photoelectrons; Photons; Polyelectrolytes; Solid state devices; Solid-State Batteries; Surface chemistry; Electrochemical techniques; Experimental techniques; Li batteries; Solid electrolyte interphase; Solid polymer electrolytes; Solid-state electrolyte; Solid-state lithium batteries; Technical difficulties; Solid electrolytes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074777741

Noticeably, they need electricity which is often provided by diesel generators. The refueling process is a real economic challenge due to the very remote area distance which makes it very expensive. To overcome this issue, the hybridization is initiated with the renewable solar photovoltaic energy. That marks an excess or a shortage of power; to cope this uncontrolled power a storage system is compulsory. This work is specific to the pumped hydroelectric storage system which is favorable due to its ecological aspects and the subject matter. The proposed management takes into account the solar temporal variation combined to the pumping scheduling time and real-time fuel consumption optimization. This last proves the PSH’s performance dual function in both the irrigation and power restitution; it also reduces the gas emission and saves fuel. As far as this study is concerned, the suggested control is successfully examined through the management strategy in comparison to that of the literature. Consequently, this study could be helpful for similar future studies.

We investigated scallop nutrient (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids) storage and utilization in relation to a reproductive cycle at 2 sites (Hauraki Gulf, Auckland, New Zealand) over 1 yr. Water samples were collected for seston and chlorophyll a analyses, and sediment samples were taken to evaluate the potential for re-suspended nutrients as food sources for scallops. Isotope (carbon and nitrogen) and proximate analyses were conducted for gonad, adductor muscle and digestive gland, seston (1.2.5 and >5 μm) and sediment samples. Isotope analyses revealed different signatures in suspended sediment and scallop tissues, indicating that re-suspended nutrients are unlikely to contribute to their diet. However, seston (particularly small fractions) signatures were closely related to scallop tissues, suggesting a main food source. Scallops from both sites exhibited similar reproductive cycles and utilization of nutrients. Gametogenesis started in winter (increased gonad index and energy content) and used carbohydrates stored in adductor muscles. Spawning events in spring (October.November) and summer (January.March) were associated with a sharp drop in visual gonad index (VGI), gonad index, lipid and energy contents. The energy demand required during spawning was supported by digestive gland protein. Gonad re-maturation was indicated by increases in VGI, gonad index, lipid and energy contents post spring spawning, and gonad recovery was supported by lipids from digestive glands. Results show that P. novaezelandiae utilizes energy reserves from both adductor muscle and digestive gland to cover the full costs of gametogenesis. © Inter-Research 2019.","Biochemical composition; Nutrient utilization; Pectinidae; Proximate analysis; Reproduction","aquaculture; biochemical composition; bivalve; catch statistics; economic activity; native species; nutrient dynamics; nutrient use; protein; reproduction; reproductive biology; reproductive cycle; spawning; wild population; Auckland [North Island]; Hauraki Gulf; New Zealand; North Island; Pecten novaezelandiae; Pectinidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076425176

To maximise the useful life of batteries, it is important to ensure a safe and effective rate in the process of battery charging and discharging. To control these processes, different electronic circuits can be used, of which, the most commonly implemented is the DC–DC buck–boost converter. Two different topologies with their corresponding controllers are needed because the energy transfer is bidirectional. This work develops a unique neural inverse optimal controller with online identification for both charge and discharge processes of the battery bank. The main feature of the proposed controller is that it does not present dependence on the converter parameter variations; for this reason, it can be applied for systems with different power requirements without considerable changes in its application.

These power plants could balance the increasing strain on electricity grids by renewables. The proposed plant in this paper can adapt to these ramps in electricity demand of the power grid by maintaining a constant feed and producing also high purity hydrogen. Dry methane reforming (DMR) is incorporated into a flexible power plant model and the key performance indicators are calculated from a techno-economic perspective. The net output of the plant is 450 MW with the possibility to lower power production and produce hydrogen, maintaining a high CO2 capture rate (72%). Two cases are compared to the base case to quantify: (i) energy and cost penalties for CO2 capture and (ii) advantages of flexible power plant operation. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the base case is 67 Euro/MWh, the addition of a carbon capture unit increases it to 82 Euro/MWh. In the case of flexible operation, both the LCOE and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) are calculated and the two depend on the cost allocation factor.

According to Industrial Development Report, the manufacturing sector contributes one in six jobs globally. Since the financial crisis of 2008, there has been increased debate on maintaining sustained growth (Dubey et al., 2015). Food manufacturers have been shifted into the position whereby they have to deal with recent trends of high and volatile commodity prices, transportation and energy cost. For example, ""transportation systems are essential to sustenance of human life and business growth. At the same time, they are also source of several negative impacts on human life and their environment. Therefore, they should be effectively controlled to achieve the socio-economic environmental objectives of sustainability"" (Sayyadi and Awasthi, 2018a). Consequently, the urge to gain competitive advantages while staying commited to the quality and healthy margins is getting stronger. Demand forecasting can be an advantage or a drawback to a company. Especially, when the products have short-life cycle, it is complicated for transportation, storage and quality management; therefore, an accuracy forecasting would schedule for production planning to avoid later obstacles. Based on the assessment of the financial and logistics information of the Puratos Grand-Place Indochina, five different forecasting techniques including ARIMA, Exponential smoothing, GM(1,1), DGM(1,1) and Verhulst are employed, and their results are evaluated. The results indicate that DGM(1,1) has the best performance with the smallest error. The second best methods were the GM(1,1) and Verhulst. This result strongly supports the claim that Grey Forecasting Models can deal with small, limited and violated sequences of data input. In addition, since the forecast values show small differences from the actual values; if proper investigation can be done on this matter, it would create a huge impact on the company performance for having an accurate prediction of future events. © 2019 KIIE.","Cacao; Forecasting Models; Grey System; Optimizing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085141948

Towards achieving Net Zero Energy Supply, such microgrid is adequate in remote and isolated new communities with AC controllable critical and noncritical loads. The proposed PMRC implies two-levels of control based on Multi-Agent System (MAS). The first level keeps the output power of each source in its maximum available output power by applying maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques. The second level is based on making proper decisions for achieving the power balancing regulation and coordination between the available and the reserve power of the RES and ESS under different operating modes. Valley Filling, Energy Conservation and Load Shifting are applied as DSM strategies to improve loads sustainability during system contingencies.

By focusing on residential scale of rooftop PVs, BESS has been developed and applied in many aspects especially in terms of electricity charge saving. Many papers propose the methodology to control the operation of BESS, while many papers propose the methodology to determine the battery capacity. As for this paper, the proposed methodology will simultaneously determine the operation schedule and battery capacity of BESS for rooftop PVs under a net-metering scheme (NMS). The main objective is to maximize the net present value (NPV) of the prosumers. The battery capacity will be constrained by the period of the NMS compensation which will be effective for only one year of each electricity bill. The numerical results show that, for the TOU tariff structure without demand charge, an appropriate BESS should have CNOM, DC as high as possible to increase the revenue from BESS and have PNOM, DC as low as possible to reduce the total investment cost (TTC). Also, by considering the limit period of the NMS compensation, an appropriate battery capacity should not be higher than monthly residential load consumption. Lastly, the sensitivity analysis of electricity tariff shows that the NPV will increase proportionally by the increment of electricity price, which will reduce the break-even year of the investment. © 2019 International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","Battery energy storage system (BESS); Electricity charge saving; Net present value (NPV); Net-metering scheme (NMS); Operation schedule",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084261278

Alternative energy technologies deliver clean energy to meet the needs of the world in terms of transportation. The integration of alternative energy generators is an interesting perspective to prevent issues at the levels of hydrogen supply and energy balance. Additionally, efficiency, storage, and utilization of energy systems play an important role in the consumption of energy. In the current study, the comparative evaluation addressing energy efficiency between hydrogen production via an electrolytic process and hydrogen utilization in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), was investigated using a simulation model. Hydrogen gas was produced from water via electrolysis using alternative energy resources deriving from wind turbines and solar cells. The produced hydrogen gas was compressed and stored under highpressure conditions, before being supplied to PEMFCs in the frame of electricity production for the purpose of application to an electric vehicle. The hydrogen production and storage solutions derived from wind energy-wind/hydrogen and from solar energy-solar/hydrogen were created on the basis of process simulation models prior to the calculation of both the hydrogen production rate via electrolysis and the energy efficiency value. Subsequently, the utilization of hydrogen energy by PEMFCs was also examined, and the simulation of the fuel cells powered by pressurized hydrogen, was performed to compute the energy efficiency as well. The simulation models of two processes were described in details while the assumptions underlying the calculations appear along. The overall efficiency levels of wind/hydrogen/electricity and solar/hydrogen/electricity systems reported in this work, bestow technical capability for implementation, and the experimental models arguably demonstrate the feasibility of integrating alternative energy technologies to support the growth of modern automotive technologies. © 2019, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","Alternative energy; Electrolyzer; Energy efficiency; PEM fuel cell; Solar energy; Wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084251519

The plant is composed of: a wind turbine, a photovoltaic generator, a battery storage system and a diesel generator combined with a supercapacitor. The DC microgrid is designed and modeled using Matlab/ Simulink/ SimPowSys™ environment. The supercapacitor is utilized to cover the deficiency of power shortage during the start-up of the diesel generator. It is also utilized to compensate the limitations on the charging/discharging current of the battery. Some performance indexes are considered: the frequency-deviation, the stability of the DC bus voltage and the AC voltage total harmonic distortion (THDv). The performances of the proposed strategy are evaluated by simulation in different operating conditions. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed power management strategy: the DC bus voltage keeps almost constant with accepted fluctuations, the normalized frequency deviation is less than 0.01 and THDv is less than 0.04 during all simulation cases. The power flow between the system sources and the load is balanced: the state of charge of batteries and supercapacitors are maintained within the accepted level during all simulation cases.

The computational circuits are implemented on a reconfigurable and programmable signal-processing platform, namely field-programmable analog array (FPAA). The design leverages the core enabling technology of FPAA, namely floating-gate CMOS devices, and an on-chip low-power microcontroller to achieve energy-efficiency while not compromising accuracy. The custom physical-computation-electronics operating in CMOS subthreshold region, performs low-level (i.e., physiologically-relevant feature extraction) and high-level (i.e., detecting arrhythmia) signal processing in an energy-efficient manner. The on-chip microcontroller is used (1) in the programming mode for controlling the charge storage at the analog-memory elements to introduce patient-dependency into the system and (2) in the run mode to quantify the vital signs. The system has been validated against digital computation results from MATLAB using datasets collected from three healthy subjects and datasets from the MIT/BIH open source database. Based on all recordings in the MIT/BIH database, ECG R-peak detection sensitivity is 94.2%. The processor detects arrhythmia in three MIT/BIH recordings with an average sensitivity of 96.2%. The cardiac processor achieves an average percentage mean error bounded by 3.75%, 6.27%, and 7.3% for R-R duration, systolic blood pressure, and oxygen saturation level calculations; respectively. The power consumption of the ECG, blood-pressure and photo-plethysmography processing circuitry are 126 nW, 251 nW and 1.44 μW respectively in a 350 nm process.

This present paper aimed to determine the complementary feeding practices of young children 6–23 mo old, and to assess the micronutrient status of children – with particular reference to hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, zinc, and their determinants. The present paper was part of the randomized community trial (RCT) on micronutrient powder (MNP) supplementation involving four randomly selected barangays in Calauan, Laguna, Philippines, and covering a total of 126 children 6–23 mo old. Baseline and endline assessments were done to determine Hb, ferritin, retinol, zinc, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Child’s breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices, weight, length, and dietary intakes were collected monthly for six months. Stepwise linear regression was performed to determine the biological and environmental factors associated with micronutrient status of the study children. The 24-hour dietary assessment showed that children consumed mainly thin porridge or lugaw – boiled rice mixed with broth of boiled fish, meat, or vegetables – and biscuits/bread as complementary foods. The majority of children had inadequate intake of energy, protein, and key micronutrients based on a single day food recall at endline assessment. Carbohydrates from complementary food remained the major energy contributor among children 6–11 mo (68.0%) and 12–23 mo old (66.9%). The prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting was 10.4%, 13.6%, and 8.0%, respectively. The mean Hb was 11.2 g/dL, of which 35.7% of infants were anemic (Hb<11.0 g/dL). The mean serum ferritin used to indicate storage iron was 23.8 ug/L, of which 27.8% of infants had low iron storage. Hb, ferritin, and zinc concentrations at endline consistently related to the corresponding outcome variables of Hb, ferritin, and zinc at endline, respectively. Adequacy of energy, vitamin A, and iron intake was positively associated with Hb at endline period. Other nutrition factors played a role in the level of Hb, including continued breastfeeding beyond one year and episode of diarrhea. Ferritin level at endline was associated with vitamin C adequacy, breastfeeding practices, child’s length, marker of infection (CRP), and occupation of household head in the expected directions. Stunting was strongly associated with zinc concentration at endline. There is an urgent need to improve the complementary food in terms of energy, protein, and micronutrient adequacy of complementary foods of children in the studied communities through increasing density and bioavailability of macro-and micronutrients. © 2019, Department of Science and Technology.

However, its dynamic storage mechanism requires power-hungry refresh cycles to maintain data. This problem is aggravated due to the impact of process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations at deeply scaled technology nodes and low voltages. In this brief, we present a gain-cell embedded DRAM (GC-eDRAM) with body-bias compensated readout, which is dynamically configured to extend the data retention time (DRT) of the memory under varying operating conditions. The proposed GC-eDRAM exploits the body-biasing capabilities of FD-SOI technology to adjust the switching threshold of the sense inverter under PVT variations. An additional, unbiased, sense inverter is added to provide a dual-sampling mechanism to the readout path, enabling error detection to further reduce design guard bands. An 8-kb GC-eDRAM with integrated body-bias compensated readout and error detection was implemented in 28-nm FD-SOI technology.

Additionally, the process energy consumption was estimated, and the overall process was modeled. UAB was applied at 5- and 10-min exposure times and at 65°C to evaluate the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities. Then, guava slices were freeze-dried and the TPT with and without UAB were compared. Also, the total polyphenol content (TPC), antioxidant activity (AA), and total color change (TCC) of the DGS were measured. TPT decreased significantly for both UAB exposure times. Moreover, at 65°C and 10 min UAB 36.0 ± 2.0% and 99.5 ± 1.0% reduction in PPO and POD, respectively, were observed. UAB samples resulted in lower TPC and AA. A significant reduction of the TCC was achieved with UAB. UAB decreased energy consumption during the process. Practical applications: Freeze-drying preserves the quality of a product to a greater extent than other drying techniques, such as convective drying. However, the use of freeze-drying is limited by the high investment and operating costs. In this work, it is demonstrated that ultrasound-assisted blanching (UAB) can markedly reduce the total lyophilization time during the processing of guava slices relative to that attained without this treatment (control). Additionally, due to the enzymatic inhibition achieved by UAB, the color of the dried material in storage was preserved to a greater extent than it was without this treatment. Although the use of ultrasound (US) entails additional equipment and personnel costs, the significant reduction in operational costs can allow the investment to be recovered. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Blanching; Energy utilization; Investments; Low temperature drying; Operating costs; Ultrasonics; Additional equipment; Anti-oxidant activities; Convective drying; Peroxidase (POD); Physical and chemical characteristics; Polyphenol content; Polyphenol oxidase; Quality parameters; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075075288

As these components are mostly volatile and hydrophobic, achieving their enhanced bioaccessibility and controlled release during processing is of utmost concern to food manufacturers. Emulsions prepared at nanoscale (2–200 nm) not only give the opportunity to protect the flavor ingredients but also enable achieving higher homogeneity in the emulsion system through produced smaller droplet size. Among developed approaches of high and low energy for preparation of flavor nanoemulsions, low-energy approaches give the possibility to develop nanoemulsions in absence of high shear and pressure, and are suitable selections for preparation of nanoemulsions for thermal-sensitive flavor components with the requirement of consuming less energy in comparison to high-energy methods. However, limitation of using synthetic surfactants might limit their applications for food systems and high amount of surfactant might be necessary to produce stable nanoemulsions with small droplet sizes. Preparation of nanoemulsions for encapsulation of food flavors applying low-energy methods is considered as a new emerging approach with potential for further research for development of ingredients applicable in food formulations and production of stable nanoemulsions at large scale. Considering the growing demand for food flavors, this review aims to highlight recent advancements in the application of high- and low-energy approaches for preparation of flavor nanoemulsions with the focus on discussing the main factors influencing stability and particle size of prepared nanoemulsions during development and storage and can provide insights on further production of nanoemulsions at an industrial large scale. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Encapsulation; Flavor ingredient; High-energy approaches; Low-energy approaches; Particle size; Scale-up","Drops; Emulsification; Encapsulation; Food products; Particle size; Surface active agents; Controlled release; Energy approach; Food manufacturers; Low energy emulsification; Low-energy methods; Scale-up; Synthetic surfactants; Thermal-sensitive; Food storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074825358

Available storage technologies such as refrigeration and controlled atmospheres are expensive as these need continuous energy for system operation throughout the whole supply chain. So, the use of drying techniques is being encouraged as it reduces the postharvest losses and provides easiness in storage, transport, and ensures product availability round the year. Drying of fruits and vegetables through conventional approaches such as sun or open-air drying found a slow process and may lead to the inferior quality product due to contamination. Various advanced drying techniques such as solar, microwave, vacuum, infrared, freeze, oven drying, and different hybrid drying technologies have been developed around the globe as being successfully used for various fruits and vegetables.

Practical applications: Dried products are broadly used by the industries related to confectionery, bakery, and sweet and distilling industries in the development of versatile by-products including sauces, teas, puddings, garnishments, and food supplements for infants as well as children. Fruits and vegetables can be dried with suitable retention of nutrients and health-promoting compounds.

Our results indicated that pH and proximate composition of RJ was insignificantly affected by temperature, but °Brix values increased. Microstructural images showed that RJ particles were homogeneous at 10 and 25°C, but swelled at 35°C. RJ samples showed shear thinning behavior with yield stress. The increasing temperature caused the increase of yield stress due to swelling of particles. All samples were characterized as weak gel-like behavior because G′ &gt; G″ at up to 100 rad/s. Three interval thixotropic test (3ITT) showed that RJ samples could partially recover after high shear deformation, but increasing temperature decreased recovery percentage of samples. This study revealed that the temperature of RJ should never exceed to 10°C to obtain better recovery during the processing. Practical applications: Apicultural products such as royal jelly (RJ) have become very important nutritional products in recent times due to bioactive properties and are increasingly attracted by consumers. Bioactive properties of RJ can highly be deteriorated by process temperature and storage conditions. RJ has creamy and milk-like structure and contains high amounts of proteins and carbohydrates. Therefore, the rheological characterization of RJ can provide significant information about structure, freshness, end product quality for consumers, as well as process equipment design and energy consumption for manufacturers. The freshness of RJ is determined with the analysis of 10-HDA, furosine, superoxide dismutase and 57 kDa proteins. This study revealed that the rheological characterization of RJ at different temperatures may be helpful to estimate freshness and process conditions easier than analytical methods. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Energy utilization; Enzymes; Product design; Recovery; Shear thinning; Temperature; Effect of temperature; Increasing temperatures; Micro-structural characterization; Microstructural images; Proximate compositions; Rheological characterization; Shear-thinning behavior; Super oxide dismutase; Yield stress",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074602564

Infrared spectroscopy revealed the ionic interaction between the sulfate groups in iota-carrageenan (i-CRG) and the quaternary amine groups in the copolymer, demonstrating that i-CRG exerts the function as the dopant. Cyclic voltammetry showed redox potentials around 35 mV, indicating that the i-CRG presence does not constrain electroactivity. Additionally, the biocomposites presented ionic and electrical conductivity (in the range of 10−5-10-3 S cm-1) determined respectively by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the four-point technique.

The blast furnace (BF) technology will continue to dominate steel production in the coming decade and the only way to substantially reduce the associated CO2 emissions is to combine it with Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) and/or Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCU options that do not require a lot of hydrogen and with high added value are logical step stones towards production of bulk chemicals and even fuels such as oxymethylene ethers. BF waste gas recycling and conversion will require a multisectoral approach creating new dependencies between the steel, energy, and chemical sectors. Energy efficient, cheap and CO2 free hydrogen production using green electricity is the ultimate solution to drive this transition. This hydrogen could on the long term also open the door to replace blast furnaces by hydrogen-based steel making. However, today it makes economically more sense to use thermally produced hydrogen by (bio)methane pyrolysis or steam reforming, potentially electrified and intensified, rather than from water electrolysis.

A total of 24 silages per batch were prepared from a mixture of organic PBP and C. ensiformis foliage. Pineapple by-products were ensiled either fresh or wilted with 4 levels (0, 100, 200, 300 g/kg DM) of C. ensiformis foliage inclusion at room temperature of 25 ± 3.6 °C. Wilting PBP and increasing inclusion levels of C. ensiformis decreased (P &lt; 0.001) dry matter (DM) losses but increased (P &lt; 0.001) DM and crude protein (CP) content of silages. However, the effect of wilting on DM loss depended (P &lt; 0.05) on inclusion levels of C. ensiformis. In both silages, neutral detergent fibre (NDFom) decreased linearly (P &lt; 0.01) with increasing levels of C. ensiformis. Silage from wilted PBP had less (P &lt; 0.05) ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) compared to silage from fresh PBP. In both silages, lactic acid increased at a decreasing rate (P &lt; 0.01) with increasing levels of C. ensiformis and its optimal level of inclusion was 100 g/kg DM. Although volatile fatty acids were not affected (P &gt; 0.05) by C. ensiformis inclusion, wilting decreased (P &lt; 0.05) acetic acid contents. Cumulative net gas production (GP) of silage from wilted PBP increased following a quadratic trend (P &lt; 0.05) with increasing levels of C. ensiformis. Although polynomial contrasts were able to provide trends based on the apriori fixed inclusion points of C. ensiformis, regression analysis showed that optimal levels for most response parameters overlapped in the range of 100–170 g/kg DM. Consequently, the greatest cumulative GP of silage from wilted PBP was recorded at 150 g/kg DM level of C. ensiformis inclusion. Metabolizable energy (ME) and net energy contents of lactation (NEL) increased at a decreasing rate (P &lt; 0.05) with increasing level of C. ensiformis for the silage from wilted PBP. Maximum value for NEL of silage from wilted PBP was obtained at 170 g/kg DM level of C. ensiformis inclusion. Similarly, in vitro organic matter digestibility for the silage from wilted PBP followed a quadratic trend (P &lt; 0.05) with the greatest recorded at 168 g/kg DM level of C. ensiformis inclusion. Inclusion of C. ensiformis foliage improves in vitro fermentation quality as well as nutritive value of PBP silage, and most parameters showed optimum values, which overlapped within the ranges of 100 to 170 g/kg DM levels of the legume inclusion. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Crop-Livestock integration; Forage legume; Organic agriculture; Silage quality; Smallholder",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073462336

The structural and morphological characterization of the Pd/ERGO nanocomposite was analyzed using several techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), XPS, EDS, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XPS results for the Pd/ERGO composites showed the successful electrochemical reduction of graphite oxide (GO) to ERGO and the presence of metallic Pd in the nanocomposite structure. The electro-oxidation of ethanol on a Pd/ERGO/NiF electrode was then studied using cyclic voltammetry. Electrochemical measurements of the Pd/ERGO composite electrode demonstrated higher electrocatalytic activity (with current density of ~130 mA cm−2) for ethanol electro-oxidation in an alkaline medium, at room temperature, than for either naked NiF or ERGO-modified NiF (ERGO/NiF) under the same conditions. Further, Pd/ERGO nanocomposite had greater chronoamperometric stability for ethanol electro-oxidation compared to both naked NiF and ERGO/NiF electrodes.

This paper aims to study these issues including daily-seasonal operation patterns, uncertainty, and cogeneration of various renewable resources and storage systems. These issues are investigated at net-zero energy building supported by renewable resources (i.e., solar energy, hydro energy, and fuelcell) and energy storage systems (i.e., hydrogen storage system). The uncertain parameters of the model are solar-hydro-load powers. The model minimizes the investment cost on solar system. The plan finds optimal sizing and operation for solar, hydro, hydrogen, and fuel-cell. The cooperation of hydrogen storage and fuelcell is optimized to level the uncertainty. The surplus of energy is fed into water electrolyzer to produce hydrogen and the fuelcell consumes the hydrogen to produce electricity. The seasonal operation is dealt by cogeneration of hydro-solar systems. The proposed plan installs 73 kW solar panel. The hydrogen storage system is charged at hours 7–17.

Here, we perform structural, electronic, vibrational and thermal properties of six transition-metal carbides (Re2C, Tc2C, Mo2C, W2C, Os2C, Ru2C) both 2H and 1T phases by first-principle calculations within density functional theory. Although physical and thermal properties of some pristine MXenes put forward to understanding tunable electronic and magnetic properties, many of 1T-phase and almost never of 2H-phase are not investigated in detailed. Firstly, the atomic structure of six MXenes both 1T and 2H phases are optimized, and their respective dynamical stabilities are discussed. Secondly, electronic band structure calculations reveal that the pristine MXenes are metallic. Finally, phonon calculations of pristine MXenes are computed with the density functional perturbation theory and reported. Raman-active modes are predicted and to assign them to specific atomic motions. Ab-initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) are also performed to check the thermal stability of these MXenes.

Sustainable renewable energy sources must be broadly executed to fulfil the continuous need for energy. Amongst different renewable energy technologies, hydropower generation proved to be the most feasible solution. A portion of small hydropower can be acquired by recovering the energy inside water supply networks. This may lead to a sustainable electrification solution and reduced electricity bills for the water utility companies. Hence, the procedure of energy recovery using conduit hydro technology must be a part of the water cycle. Numerous nations have started with the improvement of this innovative conduit hydro technology. However, very little has been exploited. Hence, this study focuses on developing a simulation tool that can be used to analyse conduit hydropower generation system with a battery storage. Subsequently, this paper exhibits the modelling and performance analysis of a small conduit hydropower system in MATLAB/Simulink software. This will assist the conduit hydropower developers to quantify the available energy and evaluate the viability of the conduit hydropower projects. Furthermore, the performance of the modelled conduit hydropower system is compared to the performance of a prototype setup in a laboratory environment. Inlet water pressure was assessed to observe how the system reacts to the variation of the water pressure. This data was used to simulate the performance of the model in MATLAB/Simulink in comparison with the laboratory prototype. The results revealed that the developed model reacted viably under variable pressure.

However, poor capacity retention, polysulfide shuttle effect, and low electronic conductivity have hindered practical uses of the LSB. The introduction of interlayer has been proven to be a promising strategy to improve the overall performance of the LSB. Herein, the influence of various amine-based functional groups of carbon interlayer on lithium polysulfide (LPS) chemisorption was compared via electrochemical methods and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The functionalized carbon interlayers with 4-aminobenzoic acid, 1,6-diaminohexane, p-phenylenediamine, 4-nitroaniline, and 4-aminothiophenol prepared by an amide coupling reaction show a strong contribution to reduce the polysulfide migration, resulting in the enhancement of overall LSB performances such as a superior capacity and high Coulombic efficiency along with long cyclability of the cells. The LSB with 4-aminobenzoic acid could achieve an initial specific capacity of 1694 mAh g−1 (0.1 C) with an extremely low capacity decay of 0.055% per cycle due to the cooperative interaction of H- and Li-bonds between 4-aminobenzoic acid-functionalized interlayer and polysulfides. © 2019",,"Amides; Density functional theory; Hydrogen bonds; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Polysulfides; Cooperative interactions; Coulombic efficiency; ELectrochemical methods; Electronic conductivity; High specific capacity; P-phenylene diamines; Polysulfide shuttles; Specific capacities; Lithium sulfur batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071982161

Several publications deal recently with the enrichment of different food products with insects. Grain based products seem to be a promising field, due to the wide product range and their popularity. Though buckwheat is healthy, it is less liked by the consumers, because of its characteristic flavour profile. Our aim was to develop a silkworm enriched buckwheat pasta, which merges the advantages of the base materials, and masks the disliked flavour of buckwheat. Three products were created, insect-free, 5 g and 10 g silkworm/100 g pasta, respectively. Our calculations showed that silkworm powder increases the nutritional value of buckwheat pasta; the 5 g and 10 g/100 g enriched products had higher protein content, with reduced energy value. According to technological analyses silkworm reduces optimum cooking time, while increases the acidity of pastas over storage. Consumer sensory analysis proved that 10 g silkworm/100 g pasta product received the highest overall acceptance, while lowest values were assigned to the insect-free product. According to the obtained results, insect powder is a suitable material for enriching less liked, but basically healthy products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dry pasta; Edible insect; Entomophagy; Just-about-right method; Pasta quality","Animals; Crops; Food products; Consumer sensory; Edible insect; Entomophagy; Just-about-right method; Nutritional value; Product ranges; Protein contents; Reduced energy; Sensory analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071581251

Droop-based control methods have been presented for power sharing among DC sources, while the energy management approaches employ communication systems to monitor the demand, renewable generations and energy level of storage units in order to properly operate the energy sources. Employing communication systems may affect the system reliability and introduce infrastructure costs. Moreover, extending energy sources require modifying the energy management system. This paper proposes an autonomous and decentralized power sharing and energy management approach for DC microgrids without utilizing a communication system. Hence, it can be a reliable and economical solution for operation of DC microgrids. Furthermore, in the proposed approach, the energy sources can operate independently by using the local information, and hence, it introduces plug-and-play capability for extending the energy sources.

Evolution and velocity of cracks of woody discs of Eucalyptus grandis and E. camaldulensis clones were investigated. The first set of observations and measurements were taken in 2 h after discs crosscutting. All wood discs presented two cracks developed at opposite directions in the transversal plane RT. The discs of E. grandis have larger values for the length and velocity of cracks and energy liberated than those of E. camaldulensis discs. The second set of observations and measurements were done after 2 weeks of discs cutting. In each disc of E. grandis, the two cracks increased towards the periphery. A third crack was appeared in all discs of E. camaldulensis and extended in a perpendicular direction along the two previous cracks. The cracks size increased, and some of them reach the discs periphery with their side opening. In this stage, the wood discs of E. grandis present lower values for splitting indicators than those of E. camaldulensis wood. So, the good knowledge of the cracks evolution related to the growth stress may help us to take the suitable procedures to reduce their influence in this type of wood during cutting, storage and first transformation.

The binding energies of TM-doped BNNTs reveal that the Mo atom doping exhibits the strongest binding ability with BNNT. In addition, the NO molecule weakly interacts with the pristine BNNT, whereas it has a strong adsorption ability on TM-doped BNNTs. The increase in the adsorption ability of NO molecule onto the TM-doped BNNTs is due to the geometrical deformation on TM doping site and the charge transfer between TM-doped BNNTs and NO molecule. Moreover, a significant decrease in energy gap of the BNNT after TM doping is expected to be an available strategy for improving its electrical conductivity. These observations suggest that NO adsorption and sensing ability of BNNT could be greatly improved by introducing appropriate TM dopant.

But what drives citizens to accept new instruments that will be added to a pre-existing instrument mix? To answer this question, we suggest an innovative combination of sustainability transitions and social acceptance research, and examine the case of Swiss energy turnaround. We rely on data from a representative sample of the Swiss resident population. By estimating logistic multi-response models, we disentangle individual and context-related factors that drive instrument preferences in a instrument mix situation. We conclude that it is mainly individual factors (values in favor of nuclear phasing out and climate mitigation) that positively impact the acceptance of instruments that promote the larger energy transitions through renewables. Additionally, the self-contribution of citizens (energy pro-sumers) seems to shape preferences more than current policies of their own jurisdiction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Citizens’ perspective; Energy transition; Instrument mix; Political science; Social acceptance","Population statistics; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Climate mitigations; Energy transitions; Instrument mix; Political science; Representative sample; Social acceptance; Sustainability policy; Sustainability transition; Digital storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055292202

Likewise, there are various microorganisms that cause serious economic damage, principally during storage of horticultural commodities. Coatings have become increasingly more important as a means to deliver fresh horticultural commodities to the consumer, in safe conditions. Furthermore, studies have confirmed that their applications on agricultural products have a remarkable potential to inhibit microorganisms as compared to the uncoated products. In addition, generally there have been no reports of adverse or side effects on the ripening process of the horticultural products. Currently, the application of nanotechnology has shown great benefits in different fields, such as medicine, energy, the environment, and food. In the latter, the study of food conservation and control of microorganisms that cause decay and disease, through the designing of new materials (nanostructured coatings, among others) has been noteworthy. Regarding this subject, the research group of the Postharvest Technology Laboratory of Agricultural Products of the Center for the Development of Biotic Products (CEPROBI-IPN) has considered the design and application of nanomaterials as the main theme of their research, based on nontoxic and naturally occurring compounds, focusing on the control of the principal postharvest microorganisms. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Chitosan; Edible coatings; Fungi; Horticultural commodities; Nanoemulsions; Nanostructured coatings; Storage periods",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102155525

The purpose of this article is to describe the electrostatic separator that enables to obtain protons with the energy lower than 0.3 MeV. We let the beam of protons with the energy 1.0 MeV impact to tungsten target. The Rutherford scattering take place on the target, scattered protons then enter the electrostatic separator. Applying different high voltage between quarter-circular electrodes of the separator, we selected the energy of protons that pass the separator. We used the electrostatic separation because the control over the high voltage is simple and efficient. For the measurement of proton energy, we used the Silicon Surface Barrier Detector Ortec. We proved that the electrostatic separator can provide protons with adjustable energy from 32 keV to 400 keV, FWHM is in the range 13 keV-19 keV. The separator extends possibilities of the VDG usage.

In literature we have studied various techniques and protocols which focus on energy optimization schemes. These schemes taking into consideration remaining battery power (RBP), but how RBP affected with various environmental factors is not considered. In mobile devices power estimation accuracy is greatly affected by battery ageing which limits its performance and occur all through the life of a device whether it is used or not, which is a chief limitation on actual usage. Moreover, degradations take place in every situation, but with different extent as external conditions and usage interact to aggravate degradations. While designing the energy efficient routing protocols battery aging was not taken into account for estimating RBP. Accurate information regarding battery ageing would be valuable for mobile devices in critical circumstances. To ensure accurate battery measurement and modeling, the influence of the aging effect must also be considered. Existing papers have not considered the impact of ageing while estimating the network lifetime. This paper focus on ageing along with the existing metrics while selecting a route and network lifetime of a node. In this paper the impact of different operating conditions during charging and discharging, high temperature and storage time is analyzed on the aging behavior and we observed that an aged battery will have to be recharged more frequently than when the battery was fresh. This will lead to even more wear-out and the remaining run-times will on the contrary be unacceptably short.

The method exploits the bond between photovoltaic generator static and dynamic conductance, utilizing their sum as the base controller management mutable data of the maximum power point tracking loop. Environmental condition and operating point are the significant variables that influence dynamic and static conductance values, consequently, when using a controller which design to a single nominal operation point a nominal response is un-achievable, thus, system response can vary from overdamped to underdamped. Notwithstanding, dynamic and static conductance sum calculation always yield zero when the photovoltaic generator operates at the maximum power point. Therefore, forcing the sum to zero drives the system to be at maximum power point no matter the states of the environmental conditions. Uneven and variable response time calls for implementing a disturbance observer as a counteraction to the nonlinear maximum power point tracking loop regulation variables, operation point, and environmental condition variations.

Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are synthesized by the hydrolysis of titanium tetrachloride in an alkaline medium, adjusting the pH value with an aqueous solution of ammonia at a temperature of 30 to 60°C. The influence of reaction conditions on the synthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles and the pH of the medium are studied and the optimal synthesis conditions are found. The processing parameters of paper packaging materials with aqueous solutions of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, which give them antimicrobial properties, are determined. Using electron-scanning microscopy and energy dispersive microanalysis, it is shown that untreated packaging paper contains 64.69% of C and 35.31% of O; after modification with a solution of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, titanium dioxide particles, which are distributed quite unevenly depending on the initial concentration of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, form on 16.46–21.14% of the surface of the treated paper. The packaging materials modified by the proposed composition show strong resistance to the action of microorganisms.

It allows placing the devices into lower performance states when the computational demands are lower, opening the possibility for significant power/energy savings. This work presents a GPU power consumption model, used to predict the GPU power consumption of any application at different frequency levels. To obtain this model, an estimation algorithm is proposed, relying on careful benchmarking of the GPU architecture. The model can estimate the contribution of twelve different GPU components (FP32-ADD/MUL/FMA, FP64-ADD/MUL/FMA, INT, SF, CF units, shared memory, L2-cache, and DRAM) to the GPU power consumption. Different model use cases are evaluated (fixed-frequency, DVFS, and scaling-factors), which can obtain both the total or the per-component GPU power consumption. A technique to export models to a distinct GPU from the one it was estimated on is also proposed. These approaches were extensively validated on five different GPUs from the three most recent microarchitectures with a set of 42 standard benchmarks, achieving very accurate predictions. In particular, the scaling-factor power model achieves an average prediction error of 3.5 percent (Titan Xp), 4.6 percent (GTX Titan X), 3.1 percent (GTX 980) and 2.4 percent (Tesla K40c). © 1990-2012 IEEE.","DVFS; GPGPU; power modeling; scaling-factors","Dynamic frequency scaling; Dynamic random access storage; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Graphics processing unit; Memory architecture; Program processors; Voltage scaling; Average prediction error; DVFS; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; GPGPU; High performance computing systems; Power consumption model; Power model; Scaling factors; Green computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077368276

There exist several mathematical models and heuristic rule based policies for microgrid resource management. Mathematical models provide optimal results, while heuristic policies are simple to implement but cannot guarantee optimality. Although both models are used in the literature, studies do not analyze the benefits of using mathematical models over heuristic rule based ones. This study proposes a mixed integer programming based mathematical model and a rule based model and compares their performances for a newly established microgrid at Turkey. Both models aim to minimize the daily cost of the microgrid by planning the use, sale, and storage of the energy obtained from the renewable resources. The results quantify the benefits of using the mathematical model over the rule based model for the case microgrid under different conditions. The analysis shows that the difference between the models' performances changes according to the energy pricing policy and seasons.

As the determination of IM efficiency is becoming mandatory in many countries, there is a need to develop a testing approach that eliminates inaccuracies due to the operator. This paper presents an automated efficiency testing procedure developed to mitigate the adverse effect of varying technical skill and competence levels of testing personnel on efficiency test results. This is a particularly useful development considering the recently proposed IEC/TS 60034-2-3 methodology which specifies identical tests between sinusoidal supply and converter operation. A comparison of several manual and automated efficiency tests on a 55-kW IM highlighted improvements in repeatability, correlation, and temperature variation due to the latter. In addition, the advanced data acquisition and computation capability of the measurement device used in the developed test rig provides an excellent platform to investigate the dynamic operation of IM drives. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Additional harmonic losses; efficiency estimation; induction motors (IM); variable frequency drives (VFD)","Automation; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Frequency estimation; Induction motors; Personnel testing; Variable speed drives; Dynamic operations; Efficiency estimation; Harmonic loss; Industrial process control; Measurement device; Temperature variation; Variable frequency drives; Voltage and current harmonics; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075501874

As a result, this has led to a dramatically increased demand for electricity. In addition, the consumers' increasing demand for a more reliable and uninterrupted energy supply is posing enormous challenge for service providers. This necessitates the development of novel solutions that should be at the system operators' disposal, particularly at distribution levels. One way to partly address this concern is by automating distribution systems and equipping them with intelligent technologies-a transformation to smart distribution systems. Such a transformation should improve system reliability and operational efficiency because such systems will be capable of operating and immediately restoring discontinued service to consumers. To facilitate this, it is necessary to replace manual switches by remotely controlled ones, improving the system restoration capability, which is one of the key features of smart grids. This paper presents a new framework to determine the minimal set of switches that have to be replaced or optimally allocated in order to automate the system. This is supported by a sensitivity analysis. Different topologies are also assessed taking into account various reliability indices and power losses in system operation following the system's automation. Such an optimization work is done under a massive integration of renewable energy sources and energy storage systems.

Stability of compounds are verified by calculating formation energies. Several crucial parameters; elastic constants, bulk, Young, Shear modulus, and Cauchy pressures are computed and analysed in great detail. Mechanical stability evaluation indicated that both compounds are mechanically stable whereas MgTiH3 is ductile whilst CaTiH3 is a brittle material. In addition, mechanical anisotropy is analysed using 2D surfaces. Both compounds showed anisotropic behaviour in all directions except for linear compressibility. Electronic band structures and their corresponding density of states of compounds are obtained. The results indicate that both compounds have metallic nature.

The flame is represented by a solid flame model in which two zones are identified: a lower clear flame layer with high temperatures and a darker upper layer in which the flame carries soot and smoke. Semi-empirical models are used to estimate the geometry of the flame; other models were also adopted to account for wind effects. The emissive power of each layer of the flame was locally evaluated as a function of temperature. A heat transfer process was followed from the flame to the target tank, at which an energy balance is carried out to include radiation from the flame, radiation from target tank surfaces, and convection to air and to fuel stored in the target tank. The results are presented in the form of temperature distributions on the target tank, which are an ingredient to perform structural analysis. Parametric studies are carried out to investigate the influence of the vertical location of the flame, wind speed, level and temperature of the fuel stored in the target tank, size and distance between tanks. Flame location at ground level, wind speed, higher temperatures of stored fluids, and short separation between tanks are identified as crucial elements increasing thermal effects on the target tank, but the results are not so much influenced by tank size. © 2019","Combustible fuels; Finite element modeling; Fire; Heat transfer; Steel tanks","Finite element method; Fires; Fuel storage; Fuels; Heat transfer; Heat transfer coefficients; Smoke; Steel tanks; Thermal effects; Wind effects; Fuel storage tanks; Heat transfer process; High temperature; Parametric study; Quantitative result; Semiempirical models; Short separations; Solid flame models; Fuel tanks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074341822

The increase of rGO decreases the particle size of CMFO. It also results in a decrease in the saturation magnetization of the composites from 37.96 to 13.29 emu/g. The coercivity of composites elucidated higher values than those of the pristine composite due to interface interaction between CMFO and rGO.

Their potential applications for clean energy are promissory. However, the temperatures required for adsorption and desorption are extremely high, which range between 500 and 700 K, making their use impractical. To overcome these difficulties, the following work considers using three hydride alloys: magnesium-aluminum (MgAl), magnesium-nickel (MgNi), and magnesium-zinc (MgZn). The Mg concentrations were set to be between 80 and 100 wt% in order to reduce the temperatures of adsorption and desorption in contrast with the temperatures of pure magnesium. The chemisorption and repulsion energies of the hydrogen molecule on the surface (110) of the different metallic alloys were studied at 0, 200, 400, 600, and 700 K, respectively. The study was based on the density functional theory (DFT), with the module DMol3 of the molecular simulation program Materials Studio, which was used to obtain these energy values. The results confirm that adding aluminum, nickel, or zinc into magnesium matrix increases the chemisorption and decreases the energy repulsion values on surfaces of the metallic alloys, improving the effectiveness of the hydrogen storage. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chemisorption energy; Magnesium alloy; Metal hydride; Temperature dependence","alloy; aluminum; hydrogen; nickel; zinc; adsorption; Article; crystal structure; density functional theory; desorption; electric potential; energy; enthalpy; molecular dynamics; priority journal; surface property; temperature; temperature dependence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074173025

Globally, 2.4 billion tons of grains are produced per annum. Efficient monitoring and control of the environmental factors affecting quality of granaries is therefore important to both farmers and governments. This study designs and develops a distributed low-power, low-cost but effective wireless monitoring system for storing bulk grains. Furthermore, a mini storage facility for grains is also designed and constructed according to standard considerations for a pilot test. The study deployed the developed wireless monitoring system with efficient coverage in the constructed mini bin and monitored the environmental factors affecting the quality of the stored grains over a time period. The entire system was then evaluated. From the obtained results, the developed system achieved optimal trade-offs among coverage efficiency, reduced power consumption, reduced cost, real-time monitoring, and longer node life. The system is appropriate for small and medium scale farmers and marketers. Practical applications: The major application of the developed system resides in modular storage facilities for small scale farmers and middle level marketers of grains. The shortage or inaccessibility of small scale farmers and marketers of grains to resourceful storage bins has been eliminated. Furthermore, the system can possibly be deployed in existing large volume granary storage systems provided by governments in cities and major towns, for effective monitoring purpose. In most developing countries, many of the storage units provided by the governments for bulk grains are poorly managed. The relevance of this study is justified in its contribution to the provision of information on the selection of comparatively resourceful components for wireless monitoring systems. The network system analyses various components, topologies, and technologies based on specific criteria in order to identify the ones with comparative advantages. In summary, the developed wireless sensor network system helps to ensure food security and good economic returns of quality grains through well-monitored, controlled, and affordable storage facilities. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Costs; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Food storage; Food supply; Grain (agricultural product); Grain elevators; Marketing; Quality control; Wireless sensor networks; Comparative advantage; Coverage efficiencies; Efficient monitoring; Environmental factors; Gross domestic products; Real time monitoring; Reduced power consumption; Wireless monitoring system; Monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073997359

The energy conversion is achieved by using a piezoelectric material MFC 8507 P2. The MBT2ML consists of two E-shape aluminum beams linked by a rigid steel beam. The multiple beams have attached masses made in steel at the free ends and a piezoelectric sheet MFC 8507-P2 bonded on one of the beams of the superior multi-beam trident. The MBT2ML is used to power an autonomous sensing system comprised by a storage device, a full bridge rectifier, a power conditioning circuit and a thermal sensor. The design of an energy harvester applied to monitoring the structural health of wind turbines of 30 kW is really a challenge from a physical viewpoint, due to drawbacks associated to extremely low operational frequencies (<3 Hz). For example, the output power is ruled by a cubic dependence on frequency and a linear dependence on mass, displacement and amplitude of excitation. The obtained data from the thermal sensor is transmitted to a notebook by a wireless data acquisition system (WDAS). The proposed harvester is a unique design which presents (i) low natural frequency into a compact size and (ii) the resonant frequency that closely matches the operating frequency to achieve maximum power generation. An experimentally validated nonlinear one-dimensional finite element formulation is used to investigate the effects of rotational motion on the electromechanical response of the harvester. The harvesting performance of the MBT2ML is assessed through varying the load resistance, the hub distances, the rotation speed (from 0 to 3 Hz), the position of the piezoelectric material and the electric connections (series and parallel) between two MFC 8507 P2 patches. The experimental results showed that the proposed harvester provides sufficient energy for supplying electric energy to a thermal sensor LM335Z during an active time of 1.01 s (delivering 200 readings) for each 38.53 s. This clearly indicates that our proposal of energy harvester provides sufficient electric power to a sensing system in a low frequency rotation scenario such as the one of wind turbines of 30 kW. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy harvesting; Low frequency; MFC piezoelectric material; Non linear finite element","Data acquisition; Electric connectors; Energy harvesting; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Natural frequencies; Piezoelectric materials; Piezoelectricity; Rotational flow; Structural health monitoring; Virtual storage; Wind turbines; Electromechanical response; Finite element formulations; Full bridge rectifier; Low-frequency; Non-linear finite elements; Operational frequency; Piezoelectric sheets; Wireless data acquisitions; Electric rectifiers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073704475

If internal insulation is applied, careful hygrothermal assessment has to be carried out to avoid critical moisture conditions in the wall leading to failure modes.

The system reassures electrical energy generation applying a DC buck converter in order to supply a DC motor to pump water. Known for its optimal electrical and physical properties, the super capacitor is integrated into the PV pumping system to allow storing electrical energy and powering the pumping motor at nights and cloudy days. The implementation of the perturbation and observation algorithm in the DC buck converter reassures the system’s operation around the maximum power point produced by the photovoltaic panel. Moving from quantity problem to quality problem, several internal and external factors can infect the stability of the PV pumping system and disrupt its operation around nominal point. On account of this, a pole placement technique is proposed in this paper. This technique is advocated not only for its simple processing and rapid execution, but also for being based on the conversion of the electrical model of the PV pumping system into a mathematical model that comprises matrix equations. This energy conversion process allows variations in output values in proportion to the input evolution along with positioning the system’s poles in the stable points of the S-plane. The equation of this technique applied to the photovoltaic pumping system is indicated in this paper having its program created in Matlab and installed in PLC S7-200 on account of its ability to monitor the inputs instantaneously and modify the outputs in a way proportional to the installed program. Subsequently, the validation of the robustness of this technique is reassured by the comparison between the simulation in Matlab and the experimental tests carried out in sunny periods having the engine powered by photovoltaic panels, and shaded periods where power supply is reassured by the super capacitor. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","DC back converter; DC motor; MPPT technique; P&O algorithm; PLC S7-200; Pole placement controller; PV pumping system; Super capacitor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073263528

However, D-MES typically exhibit high levels of technical complexity and encompass various economic, environmental, and policy-related aspects. Consequently, energy models are needed to optimally design and operate D-MES and to analyze their performance in detail. A multitude of aspects must be considered when developing a D-MES model. A first aspect, for instance, is whether an optimization or a simulation approach is more appropriate for the model's scope. Moreover, it is important to accurately represent all the relevant technical characteristics and performance constraints of the various energy generation, storage and distribution network technologies in the model. Additionally, in many cases, adopting approaches from other domains like urban and building energy simulation might be required to identify building requirements for heating, cooling, and electricity. Additional aspects, such as the uncertainty of a model's parameters, which complicates D-MES design and operation decisions, or the computational burdens imposed by extending these models towards the whole-city scale also need to be considered. Finally, methods that can bridge models that focus on specific sub-dimensions of D-MES and allow for more holistic D-MES modeling need to be developed. This paper aims to address these key challenges and to outline recent developments in the field of modeling of D-MES by answering ten questions about the most relevant D-MES modeling dimensions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy systems; Energy modeling; Energy optimization; Energy simulation; Multi-energy systems; Renewable energy","Energy efficiency; Renewable energy resources; Distributed energy systems; Energy model; Energy optimization; Energy simulation; Multi-energy systems; Renewable energies; Cooling systems; alternative energy; building; computer simulation; electricity supply; numerical model; optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072199403

In the meanwhile, the current irrigation methods that are used in available oases are conventional and implied high water losses which lead to desertification of the oases and consequently destroy agriculture and livestock. Thus, this research aims to protect these oases by proposing an optimized photovoltaic based water irrigation system. Description of adopted oases areas characteristics and solar energy potential in Mauritania are provided. Moreover classifications of pumps, motors, irrigation systems and required PV power are given in this research. After that, a full and detailed design is proposed for water irrigation in Mauritanian's oases. Results show that a photovoltaic power system with a capacity of 142.8 kWp is needed to power eight submersible pumps with a total power of 83.5 kW. The pumps are designed to deliver 80% of the available wells’ capacity for eight zones of date palm trees that are planted in Tawaz oasis which is located in Adrar region. It is also found that 250 storage tanks with capacity of 4 m3 for each are needed so as to maintain the availability of the system. A one year simulation of the proposed system is conducted, Based on the conducted simulation, the average cost of the pumped water by the system of the 8 wells is about 20.71 cent/m3 which is lower than the current pumping cost by 300%.

Here, the basal plane of Fe3GeTe2 is demonstrated to be of high electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) without resorting to any chemical modifications, by means of systematic density functional theory computations. The Fe3GeTe2 nanosheet preserves the metallic character of the bulk, and its 2D layered structure provides abundant exposed active sites to catalyze OER. All these unique characteristics suggest that the Fe3GeTe2 nanosheet may be an excellent catalyst for electrochemical OER. More importantly, it is found that the self-reduction of surface hydroxyl into water can significantly reduce the overpotential for OER, which greatly boosts the OER activity.

However, insulating these valuable masonry facades often increases the risk of moisture-related damage phenomena such as mold growth and frost damage. Therefore, detailed heat, air and moisture simulations are required to quantify and assess these risks. One of the unknown parameters in the simulations for historic masonries is the hygric interface resistance between the bricks and the lime mortars. Consequently, microfocus X-ray scans are performed during a capillary water absorption test on brick–lime mortar–brick samples to increase the insight into the moisture transport over the interface, dependent on the capillary pressure at the interface and the curing conditions of the mortar. The hygric interface resistance is found to be highly dependent on both capillary pressure and the curing conditions of the mortar. For the exact quantification of the interface resistance, highly detailed moisture transport and moisture storage properties of the brick and mortar are a prerequisite. © The Author(s) 2019.","air; and moisture modelling; Heat; hygric interface resistance; masonry walls; natural hydraulic lime mortar; X-ray computed tomography","Air; Capillarity; Capillary tubes; Computerized tomography; Curing; Heat resistance; Heating; Historic preservation; Lime; Lime brick; Mortar; Risk assessment; Walls (structural partitions); Water absorption; X rays; Capillary water absorption; Cultural heritages; Interface resistance; Masonry walls; Moisture simulations; Moisture transport; Natural hydraulic-lime mortars; X-ray computed tomography; Moisture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068342207

The metabolic response of these cells to this polymer, extensively used in bone regeneration strategies, may potentially translate into useful markers indicative of in vivo biomaterial performance. We present preliminary results of multivariate and univariate analysis of NMR spectra, which have shown the complementarity of lysed cells and extracts in terms of information on cell metabolome, and unveil that, irrespective of poling state, PLLA-grown cells seem to experience enhanced oxidative stress and activated energy metabolism, at the cost of storage lipids and glucose. Possible changes in protein and nucleic acid metabolisms were also suggested, as well as enhanced membrane biosynthesis. Therefore, the presence of PLLA seems to trigger cell catabolism and anti-oxidative protective mechanisms in HOb cells, while directing them towards cellular growth. This was not sufficient, however, to lead to a visible cell proliferation enhancement in the presence of PLLA, although a qualitative tendency for negatively poled PLLA to be more effective in sustaining cell growth than non-poled PLLA was suggested. These preliminary results indicate the potential of NMR metabolomics in enlightening cell metabolism in response to biomaterials and their properties, justifying further studies of the fine effects of poled PLLA on these and other cells of significance in tissue regeneration strategies. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","1H; metabolomics; NMR; osteoblasts; piezoelectricity; poling; poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA); tissue regeneration","polyester; polylactide; cell proliferation; chemistry; cytology; human; metabolism; metabolomics; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; osteoblast; Cell Proliferation; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Metabolomics; Osteoblasts; Polyesters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068071478

For this reason, the high CO2 conversion, required by the natural gas grid regulations, can be achieved only with a proper thermal management of the reactor. The model-based optimization of the Sabatier reaction by controlling the heat transfer is developed in this paper. The focus of the study is on small-scale applications, which gives rise to various specific technical limitations for the optimization study. We found that the reactor can be divided into three zones: an initial zone, for reaction activation; a central zone, to remove excess heat; and a final zone, to achieve high conversion reaching the thermodynamic equilibrium curve. The effect of the variation of the heat transfer coefficient along the axial coordinate of the reactor is assessed and the optimal profile is defined. Based on these results, a technical approximation of the optimal reactor is proposed, allowing high CO2 conversion with a simple manufacturing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 methanation; Heat transfer; Reactor design; Small scale energy storage","Carbon dioxide; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Natural gasoline plants; Reactor cores; Axial coordinates; Model based optimization; Optimization studies; Reactor designs; Small scale; Small-scale applications; Technical limitations; Thermodynamic equilibria; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067569004

The considered UMG consists of a photovoltaic generator, an electrochemical storage system, a micro-gas turbine (GT) and a residential loads. A new optimal energy management system (EMS) is designed to perform a day-ahead power flow management (off-line management) in the UMG. The proposed EMS aims at coordinating the active and the reactive power schedule for the distributed energy sources (DES). This EMS is based on 24 h ahead forecast data of the residential loads consumption, the photovoltaic power and the electricity tariffs. Indeed, the EMS predicts hour-by-hour the active/reactive power references for each DES, while ensuring the stability and the reliability of the UMG. Accordingly, the EMS has two objectives: (1) minimizing the production cost of the active/reactive power for each DES (economic criteria); (2) reducing the CO2 equivalent emissions by adjusting the GT operating point (environmental criteria). To meet these objectives, the optimization problem is stated as a discretized economic problem over a 24 h time horizon. This problem is formulated by a multi-objective function (expressed in cash flow) as well as the operating constraints of the DES. To solve the optimization problem, a hybrid optimization technique is adopted based on the dynamic programming (using the Bellman algorithm) combined with the linear programming (using the simplex algorithm). This resolution choice allows an exhaustive and effective exploration of the solutions search area in a relatively fast resolution time (CPU time). The effectiveness of the proposed management strategy is demonstrated using a comparison against a rules-based management. Indeed, a statistical comparison shows that the proposed management provides an optimization around 38% of the energy bill with respect to the rules-based one. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Costs; Digital storage; Dynamic programming; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Gas turbines; Housing; Linear programming; Optical variables measurement; Petroleum prospecting; Photovoltaic cells; Problem solving; Reactive power; Active and Reactive Power; Distributed energy sources; Electrochemical storage system; Management strategies; Multi-objective functions; Operating constraints; Photovoltaic generation; Statistical comparisons; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061704946

The layered host systems of boron-substituted DCV graphene are decorated with Ca metal to increase the number of adsorbed H2 molecules. Storing of H2 applications are performed by using two coordinate algorithms as CLICH (Cap-Like Initial Conditions for Hydrogens) and RICH (Rotational Initial Conditions for Hydrogens). The adsorption properties of (1–14) H2 molecules on the constructed systems are examined. The results for BDDCV-F and BDDCV-S boron-doped systems are compared with each other and those of the pure-DCV graphene. To compare the stabilities of BDDCV-systems, the formation energies are calculated. It is concluded from Mulliken charge analysis, the partial density of states and electron density differences that boron substitution process to different locations of the DCV graphene plays a crucial role on the charge transfer between Ca atom the layered host system, ionic nature and the binding properties of the systems. The herringbone-like anisotropic electron density is transformed to isotropic density with the substitution of the boron atoms. Then, the electric field, which is induced by ionic interactions and governs H2 adsorption processes, is changed and intensified along with the sheet. In this way, it can be achieved more effective H2 adsorption. It is seen from the adsorption energies of single- and double-side Ca-decorated systems that the processes of boron-substitution and Ca-decoration can considerably improve the hydrogen storage capability of pure-DCV graphene system, thus (8 and 10)H2 can be adsorbed per Ca-atom in these-type systems. The high gravimetric density of 5.80% is calculated, although larger cell and empty surface states. Moreover, the average desorption temperatures are calculated by using van't Hoff equation, and it is seen that the DCV including boron-substituted systems have closer desorption temperatures to the room temperature than pure-DCV. To check the H2 desorption of the systems, molecular dynamics simulations are performed at 200 K and 300 K temperatures. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Boron-substitution; Density functional theory; Double carbon vacancy; Graphene; Hydrogen storage","Adsorption; Atoms; Binding energy; Boron; Carrier concentration; Charge transfer; Density functional theory; Desorption; Electric fields; Electron density measurement; Hydrogen storage; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Adsorption properties; Carbon vacancy; Desorption temperatures; First-principle study; Hydrogen storage system; Molecular dynamics simulations; Partial density of state; Van't Hoff equation; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072624719

Agriculture can make a significant contribution to climate mitigation. It can reduce non-CO2 emissions, for example in the livestock sector or in fertilisers and fuels use, and it can make an additional contribution by increasing carbon storage and sequestration.

Interest in the anaerobic treatment of oily wastewaters has increased since it complements aerobic treatment and produces energy in the form of methane. The objectives of this study were to characterise the anaerobic process spontaneously occurring in a full-scale storage tank at a facility treating waste oil and oil-contaminated effluents, and to evaluate the applicability of an anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor (AnMBBR) and an anaerobic contact reactor (ACR) for treating the oil contaminated wastewater feeding the storage tank. Three lab-scale reactors were operated in parallel over 465 days: one mesophilic and one thermophilic AnMBBR, and one thermophilic ACR. The wastewater had a high strength with an average chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 36 g/L with a soluble fraction of 80%. The BOD7/COD ratios varied between 0.1 and 0.5, indicating low aerobic degradability. However, biomethane potential tests indicated some level of anaerobic degradability with methane yields between 150 and 200 NmL/gCOD. The full-scale storage tank operated at low organic loading rates (0.35–0.43 kgCOD/m3d), and long hydraulic retention times (HRT = 83–104 d). In comparison, the AnMBBRs achieved similar COD reductions (60%) as the full-scale tank but at a much shorter HRT of 30 d. Similar efficiency could only be reached at longer HRTs (43 d) in the ACR due to low biomass levels resulting from poor sludge settleability. The methane yield was higher (210 NmLCH4/COD removed) in the AnMBBR operated at 37 °C, compared to the other reactors working at 50 °C (180 NmLCH4/COD removed). This reactor also maintained a higher COD removal (67%) at an increased OLR of 1.1 kgCOD/m3d than the AnMBBR at 50 °C. The microbial composition of the biomass from the full-scale tank and the laboratory reactors provided evidence for the conversion of oil-contaminated wastewater into methane with a relatively high abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. © 2019","Anaerobic MBBR; Biogas; Contact reactor; Oily wastewater; Thermophilic; Toxic compound","Biofilms; Biogas; Bioreactors; Chemical oxygen demand; Contamination; Effluents; Methane; Tanks (containers); Anaerobic MBBR; Anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactors; Biomethane potential (BMP); Hydrogenotrophic methanogens; Oil contaminated wastewater; Oily wastewater; Thermophilic; Toxic compounds; Wastewater treatment; hydrocarbon; methane; oil; phenol derivative; phosphate; phosphorus; sodium hydroxide; volatile fatty acid; anaerobic digestion; biofilm; biogas; chemical oxygen demand; methane; oil spill; storage tank; thermophily; toxin; wastewater treatment; water retention; anaerobic digestion; anaerobic treatment; Article; biodegradability; biological activity; biomass; chemical composition; chemical oxygen demand; clinical evaluation; comparative study; effluent; feeding; hydraulic retention time; mesophilic bacterium; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; sludge; thermophilic bacterium; waste water management; water contamination; anaerobic growth; biofilm; bioreactor; sewage; waste water; Anaerobiosis; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Methane; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068889681

This paper offers a new perspective on the kg oil equivalent per capita energy consumed and real income per capita level nexus for South Africa while controlling for the effect of ecological footprint. Using a time series data from 1973 to 2014, the study employed the Autoregressive Distributive Lag model and Toda-Yamamoto procedure for testing Granger causality. Empirical results revealed the significant role of kg oil equivalent per capita energy usage and real output per capita level towards environmental quality or degradation in South Africa. A 1% increase in kg of oil equivalent per capita energy consumed and real income per capita led to 0.167% decrease and 0.172% increase in environmental quality in the short-run. A 1% increase in kg of oil equivalent per capita energy consumed and real income per capita led to 0.542% decrease and 0.558% increase in environmental quality in the long-run. On the direction of predictive relationship, empirical results showed unidirectional causality running from environmental quality to real income per capita, from kg oil equivalent per capita of energy consumed to environmental quality and from kg oil equivalent per capita of energy consumed to real income per capita. Results indicated that environmental pollution in South Africa is not output driven but depends on the unit of kg oil equivalent per capita energy produced and consumed. Depending on the direction of causality between the variables, the policy implication can be examined from the perspective of economic performance, energy saving, and environmental sustainability in the long-run. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic causality; Ecological footprint; Economic growth; Energy usage; Environmental quality","Climate change; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Public policy; Ecological footprint; Economic growths; Economic performance; Energy usage; Environmental pollutions; Environmental quality; Environmental sustainability; Predictive relationships; Sustainable development; ecological footprint; economic growth; energy use; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental quality; Granger causality test; sustainability; article; economic development; energy conservation; energy consumption; environmental sustainability; running; South Africa; time series analysis; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066863960

However, the behavior of such new stabilizer must be further investigated, especially after a long period of storage of the energetic composition. In this study, the stabilizing effect of the eutectic MENA+DPA on NC stability during artificial aging (at 338.65 K for 120 days), compared to its pure components, has been investigated by conventional stability tests and kinetic modeling. According to Bergmann & Junk (T = 405.15 K) results and over the entire period of aging, the eutectic MENA+DPA exhibits the best stabilizing effect on NC. The vacuum stability test (T = 353.15, 363.15, 373.15, and 383.15 K) results revealed that the amount of the evolved gas of NC containing this eutectic composition is very close to that of DPA, known as the conventional stabilizer. Furthermore, the kinetic modeling on VST data, obtained at four isothermal temperatures, was performed by two different methodologies, viz, fitting and free models to determine the kinetic triplets, which have been subsequently used to predict the storage lifetime for the studied systems. It was found that the NC stabilized by the eutectic MENA+DPA presents the highest value of the activation energy and has the longest storage lifetime during the entire heating period corroborating the stability tests results and affirming the excellent stabilizing effect of this mixture with respect to its pure component even if a long storage period is expected. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","artificial aging; eutectic; kinetics; Nitrocellulose; stability tests; storage lifetime; VST",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066990702

For fossil fuels, it sees carbon capture and storage (CCS) as an important and increasingly affordable technology, as long as governments provide support for its development. The fitting or retrofitting CCS to power plants and industry has almost only ever happened with government intervention. Meanwhile, enhanced oil recovery is the only viable business case of CCS implementation.

In obesity, adipokines released from expanding adipose tissue are implicated in disease progression and metabolic dysfunction. However, mechanisms controlling the progression of adiposity and metabolic complications are not fully understood. It has been suggested that expanding fat mass and sustained release of inflammatory adipokines in adipose tissue lead to hypoxia, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cellular damage. These changes trigger an immune response involving infiltration of adipose tissue with immune cells, complement activation and generation of factors involved in opsonization and clearance of damaged cells. Abundant evidence now indicates that adipose tissue is an active secretory source of complement and complement-related adipokines that, in addition to their inflammatory role, contribute to the regulation of metabolic function. This article highlights advances in knowledge regarding the role of these adipokines in energy regulation of adipose tissue through modulating lipogenic and lipolytic pathways. Several adipokines will be discussed including adipsin, Factor H, properdin, C3a, Acylation-Stimulating Protein, C1q/TNF-related proteins, and response gene to complement-32 (RGC-32). Interactions between these factors will be described considering their immune-metabolic roles in the adipose tissue microenvironment and their potential contribution to progression of adiposity and metabolic dysfunction. The differential expression and the role of complement factors in gender-related fat partitioning will also be addressed.

Morocco characterized by its important solar potential, promote use of this alternative energy in agriculture. Photovoltaic water pumping systems (PVWPS) coupled directly to drip irrigation network represents an affordable technique that can be promoted without use of any capacitive device for electric or hydraulic energy storage. This paper aims to study performances of a standalone photovoltaic pumping system confronted to actual behaviour of incident irradiance. The system is based on a photovoltaic generator, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and direct curent (DC) converter, and a DC diaphragm pump connected to calibrated (Flow versus Pressure) orifices to simulate small drip irrigation network, mounted in parallel scheme to vary the pump operating point according to timely varied irradiance. The result showedthat daily trend of solar irradiance influence considerably operating behaviour of the pump, consequently the performance of the standalone PV system is affected as there is inadequation between charges of the PV generator and the DC pump. The hydraulic efficiency trends showed a dispersion and varying performances according to irradiance change and to hydraulic system unstability. A method of governing hydraulic performance is proposed to improve the system efficiency and pressure stability as requirements for water distribution uniformity in drip irrigation network supplied by a standalone PV pumping system. © 2019, Int.

In this paper, we analyze, model, and design a 2.45-GHz RF energy harvesting (RFEH) system based on a discrete-component matching network (MN), a custom 65-nm CMOS cross-coupled rectifier, and an off-the-shelf storage-charging power management unit (PMU), which regulates the rectifier output voltage with maximum power point tracking (MPPT). We propose a reverse global analysis to model the RFEH. It allows an accurate prediction of the power harvesting efficiency (PHE) to directly size the MN and select the RFEH MPPT regulation ratio, at different incident RF power levels. We perform parasitic-aware RFEH design to take advantage of printed circuit board (PCB)/package capacitive parasitics at the rectifier input for optimizing the π-MN with the help of the proposed RFEH modeling results. We show that this parasitic capacitance introduces a maximum bound on the real impedance at the rectifier input to ensure good impedance matching in practice. MPPT is used to help reach this target real impedance at given incident RF power, as the rectifier equivalent input impedance is a function of both its input and output voltages. Measurement results show a sensitivity as low as-17.1 dBm with a peak PHE of 48.3% at-3-dBm incident RF power. Global modeling, simulation, and measurement results demonstrate that the PHE is limited by PCB/package parasitic capacitance and that PCB/packaging technology improvement to reduce parasitic capacitance by 150 fF could boost the PHE up to 45% for a low incident RF power level of-10 dBm. © 1966-2012 IEEE.","Cross-coupled rectifier; impedance matching; maximum power point tracking (MPPT); power harvester efficiency (PHE); RF energy harvesting (RFEH); simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)","Capacitance; Energy harvesting; Energy transfer; Impedance matching (electric); Internet of things; Maximum power point trackers; Printed circuit boards; Printed circuit design; Rectifying circuits; Smart sensors; Cross-coupled; Information and power transfers; Maximum Power Point Tracking; power harvester efficiency (PHE); RF energy harvesting; Electric rectifiers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072776390

The compact sensor dimensions allow integration into smart wearable devices for mobile spirometry without a dedicated hand-held component. The sensor is composed of a turbine with embedded magnets, which is surrounded by two stators with micro coils in a PMMA package. Tangential gas flow actuates the turbine on ball bearings and results in voltage generation due to electromagnetic induction. The sensor was initially characterized with pressurized nitrogen in the range of breathing flow rates. Sensitivity values up to 0.35 V/lpm were demonstrated. The device was then tested with actual breathing by a healthy subject. Sensor output voltages sampled under varying breath strengths ranged from 0.68 to 2.94 V, corresponding to breathing flow rates of 3.5 and 22.4 lpm, respectively. The device was also tested for power generation for a potential self-powered operation. A maximum output power of 67μ W was achieved on a resistive load. Energy storage tests using a 1-mF capacitor showed that normal breathing can raise the capacitor voltage to 0.2 V, while a deep breath resulted in 0.6 V.

The glass is doped with different ErCl3 contents. A vibrating-sample magnetometer was used to characterize the magnetic properties. Increasing the additive concentration led to an increase in the saturation magnetization without significant effects on the coercivity. Optical reflectance spectra of the doped glasses revealed the development of absorption bands as a result of Er3+ intra-configurational (f–f) transitions. The calculated allowed direct energy gap was found to increase monotonically with increasing dopant concentration. The results of the ac conductivity showed a decrease in the activation energy values with increasing frequency and an increase in the ac conductivity values with increasing temperature, which mimics the semiconducting behavior. The incorporation of the rare earth ion (Er3+) facilitated the electronic conduction due to the increase of the non-bridging oxygen units. Increasing the dopant concentration led also to the participation of the ionic conductions. However, further increase of ErCl3 (above 1 mol.%) caused a decrease in the conductivity. Samples with dopant content up to 1 mol.% ErCl3 are accompanied by a high dielectric constant value of about 40. It can be concluded that samples doped with 1 mol.% ErCl3 or less can be used as energy storage material in electronic devices, whereas glass samples with higher dopant content can be used for magnetic applications. © 2019, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","A.C. conductivity; electrical properties; Lead borate glasses; magnetic properties; optical properties; rare earth elements","Activation energy; Chlorine compounds; Electric properties; Electronic structure; Erbium compounds; Glass; Lead compounds; Magnetic properties; Magnetic storage; Metal ions; Optical properties; Rare earth elements; Rare earths; Saturation magnetization; Semiconductor doping; A.c. conductivity; Additive concentrations; Electrical and optical properties; High dielectric constants; Lead borate glass; Optical reflectance spectra; Semiconducting behavior; Vibrating sample magnetometer; Boron compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071996157

Determining the true value of storage requires the aggregation of applications while accounting for the interdependence between revenue streams. Individual applications cannot simply be added together, but need to be co-optimized since they can interfere with each other. This article's contributions are threefold. First, we provide model formulations to aggregate multiple arbitrage opportunities, and to quantify the accompanying potential arbitrage value. Whereas the storage arbitrage literature focuses on the capturing of price differences over time for the day-ahead market, we consider all three short-term markets, i.e., the day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time markets, and we consider the opportunity to capture three types of price differences: (1) over time in each individual market, (2) over the three markets for the same time step, and (3) over time over the three markets. Second, an important assumption in arbitrage models is related to whether storage operators recognize that their actions may affect those prices. This price-effect of storage actions has been considered before for the day-ahead market, but not for the intra-day and real-time markets. We study the price-effect with high detail for all three short-term markets, based on real-world price and volume data. Third, we apply the developed models to the four market zones of the Central Western European region, i.e., the Belgian, French, German, and Dutch market zones, while elaborating on the price-effect for the Belgian zone. As such, this article provides insight in the extent to which the three short-term markets, and their combination, in these market zones are potentially interesting for storage arbitrage. This assists improved decision-making of market participants in storage investment and operation, and informs policy-makers about the impact of market design on the potential storage value. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Arbitrage; CWE region; Electricity storage; Price-based unit commitment; Price-effect; Short-term electricity markets","Commerce; Decision making; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Power markets; Arbitrage; CWE region; Electricity storages; Price effect; Price-based unit commitments; Short term; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071399940

Power-to-gas technology can be used to convert the offshore wind power into synthetic natural gas that can be transported through the existing network of offshore gas pipelines. The novel method has the capability to significantly reduce GHG emissions, solve the power dispatch problems of offshore wind farms, as well as reduce the oceanic environmental degradation. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","carbon utilization; offshore wind; power-to-gas","Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Ecosystems; Electric load dispatching; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas substitutes; Natural resources exploration; Oceanography; Offshore gas fields; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Offshore pipelines; Offshore technology; Carbon utilization; Global environment; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Off-shore wind energy; Off-shore wind power; Offshore winds; Oil and gas exploration; Synthetic natural gas; Offshore wind farms; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; emission control; gas pipeline; greenhouse gas; natural gas; offshore structure; oil industry; wind farm; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071338258

A mixed-integer non-linear programming model is proposed to formulate the problem. In this model, the minimization of energy loss in the DS is selected as an objective function. As constraints are considered: the active and reactive energy balance, voltage regulation, the total number energy storage devices that can be installed into network, as well as the operative bounds associated with the ESS (time of charge-discharge and energy capabilities). Three operating scenarios for the DS are analyzed by adopting the method proposed in this work. The first scenario is an evaluation of the base case (without batteries and CB), in which the initial conditions of the DS are determined. The second scenario considers the location of the ESS composed by redox flow batteries. Finally, the third scenario includes the installation of REDOX flow batteries with CB in parallel to correct operating problems generated by battery charging, and improve their impact on the grid. A master-slave strategy is adopted to solve the problem here discussed, implementing a Chu & Beasley genetic algorithm in both stages as an optimization technique.

One of the concerns for wastewater treatment and reclamation is the presence and distribution of contaminants that are not removed by the wastewater treatment plant in case its effluent is reused, particularly, for irrigation or direct potable reclamation. Radionuclides are contaminants that are not effectively removed by wastewater treatment plants. To address radionuclides in wastewater treatment plants of Kuwait, a survey was planned and conducted in five wastewater treatment plants to investigate the presence and distribution of radioactivity in wastewater. The results of gamma, alpha, and beta surveys indicated that the wastewater treatment plants investigated showed normal level of radioactivity concentrations that were below the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recommended limits for unrestricted use of the treated wastewater. It was found that radionuclides had different fates in treatment plants. Radionuclides like 40K, total 210Pb, 137Cs, 226Ra, 228Ra, 238U, and 235U would likely partition onto sludge and biosolids than be discharged in the liquid effluents. In contrast, 131I would more likely remain in the liquid effluent than partition onto the sludge. Its short half-life of 8 days would, however, mean that it would have limited effects even if the treated wastewater is widely used. Storage to segregate these radionuclides may not be feasible because it will require long periods due to the long half-lives of some of them (e.g., half-life of 137Cs is 30.7 years). © 2019, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.","Gross alpha activity; Gross beta activity; Natural and artificial gamma radionuclides; Wastewater sludge; Wastewater treatment plants",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070221492

A potential reduction could be achieved by transitioning towards more efficient transport modes, optimally powered by renewable energy. Based on mobility (commutes), population, and weather data from Switzerland, we present a model to compute energy savings due to a (hypothetical) widespread deployment of electric bicycles. In different scenarios, we analyze the dependence of the commuting energy demand on users’ preferences about when to take the bike, such as an aversion to biking on cold and rainy days. Our study shows that GHG emission reductions of up to approx. 10% of the total emissions from diesel and gasoline are possible. In combination with a widespread deployment of electric vehicles, further savings of up to 17.5% could be achieved. In particular, the willingness to drive longer commutes by e-bike influences the potential GHG emission reductions, followed by the willingness to use the bicycle at temperatures below 10°C. Using these results, we identify the spatial energy and greenhouse gas savings potential and thus regions that are particularly suited for e-bike use. The identification of regions with high saving potentials allows for targeted marketing, transition-supporting incentives, or infrastructural changes to maximize the reduction of emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electric bicycles; Mobility; Renewable energy","Bicycles; Carrier mobility; Digital storage; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Population statistics; Sporting goods; Electric bicycles; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Potential reduction; Reduction of emissions; Renewable energies; Saving potentials; Targeted marketing; Total emissions; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070194985

Therefore, the utilization of mine tailings in different sectors should be taken into consideration to minimize the storage efforts and environmental pollution problems. In this two-stage study, the alkali activation opportunity of waste clay containing boron (WCB) discarded from boron mine production was investigated. In the first stage of this study, alkali activation of WCB calcined at different temperatures between 500°C and 800°C was investigated under steam-curing conditions. It was found that a calcination temperature of at least 700°C is necessary to initiate the alkali activation of WCB, whereas the maximum compressive strength value was obtained at 800°C. Subsequently, the effects of alkaline activator solution type (sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate) and quantity on the development of engineering properties of alkali-activated WCB mortars, such as compressive and flexural strength, water sorptivity, and drying shrinkage, were investigated by using WCB calcined at 800°C. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTA), and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) analyses were carried out on the hardened paste mixtures. The minimum activator concentration for alkali activation of calcined WCB was 6% Na2O by weight of WCB with a minimum silicate modulus (Ms=SiO2/Na2O) of 1.2. A compressive strength value up to 38 MPa along with acceptable water absorption characteristics and drying shrinkage values can be obtained from alkali activation of calcined WCB at 800°C. NaOH activator was not as effective as sodium silicate activator in activating WCB, even in high dosages. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Alkali-activated cement; Boron; Calcination; Colemanite; Mine tailings; Steam curing","Boron; Calcination; Chemical activation; Curing; Drying; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Mortar; Scanning electron microscopy; Shrinkage; Silica; Silicates; Sodium hydroxide; Tailings; Thermogravimetric analysis; Water absorption; Alkali activated cements; Colemanite; Compressive and flexural strengths; Environmental pollution problem; Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy; Maximum compressive strengths; Mine tailings; Steam curing; Compressive strength; alkaline rock; boron; cement (construction material); compressive strength; concentration (composition); dose-response relationship; mine waste; mortar; shrinkage; tailings; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069759963

Compared with cache, Scratch inspired the programmer having benefits of the small area, as well as low access time and power saving which results in its wide-ranging uses in embedded processors now-a-days. However, existing scratch management methodologies heavily rely on compilers and profiling. It's very difficult to replace embedded applications due to their reliance on compiler. An advanced technique for the management of scratch memory without the support of compiler is presented in this paper to overcome this difficulty. A hardware random sampling unit that depends on the memory reference locality concept is implemented in order to dynamically detect the addresses accessed more often at runtime. By using the support of a memory management unit (MMU), the software operation handled the rerouting of addresses as well as the resultant data movements. The proposed technique is assessed on some typical embedded applications and the outcomes are matched with the cache reference scheme. The small reduction (<1%) in throughput vs. the reference system on average, results 34.2% decrease in energy consumption in the proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Memory management; Microprocessor architecture; Reconfigurable cache; Scratchpad memory","Cache memory; Energy utilization; Physical addresses; Program compilers; Reconfigurable architectures; Static random access storage; Embedded application; Embedded processors; Innovative techniques; Management methodologies; Memory management; Microprocessor architectures; Reconfigurable; Scratch pad memory; Memory management units",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069605358

Recent studies have argued that energy sector transition is both a technological and a social phenomenon that needs to be looked at from more holistic and comparative perspectives. The cognitive construction view of industry shows promise in opening up the role of managerial cognition and social construction in this regard. The cognitive construction view of industry suggests that the collective changes in firms' beliefs about market boundaries drive development of the industry. Drawing on this view, we investigate cleantech firms' shared beliefs about the key technologies to recognize development patterns in the collective strategy frames and propose an approach to capture the emergence and development of the industry. For this purpose, the study analyzes longitudinal data collected from the annual reports of the incumbent firms operating within the cleantech industry. The results of the study found two sequentially developing phases in industry-level belief structures regarding renewable energy, sustainability, and digitalization as the key technology areas among the firms.

However, its conventional storage and distribution, as a high-pressure gas at a very low temperature, consumes high power and presents an explosion hazard in a confined area, especially in buildings. Our study aims to calculate the hydrogen distribution distance in buildings based on safe storage implementation with energy savings, through the pipeline, from activated carbon material for storage to the supply valve. The release of gas is induced by the desorption process at an ambient heating temperature or greater, by free convection or solar energy, respectively. The results show that over more than 1 km distribution distance of hydrogen released at atmospheric pressure can be achieved, under the studied interval of heating temperatures, recommended safe pipeline diameters, flow rates and ambient temperature.

A reduction of these produced isotopes will decrease the volume required for their storage and their total elimination could eventually decrease the storage time. A possible alternative for MA reduction is recycling them into Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) cores. It is proposed that the corresponding BWR fuel assemblies into these cores will contain 4 MA bearing-rods. For this purpose a Uranium Oxide (UO2) fuel assembly or a Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel assembly can be used. For the MOX fuel assembly two types of fuel assemblies are used, the first one only considers the replacement of 4 MOX rods by 4 MA-bearing rods and the last one considers also increasing the fuel-to moderator ratio by the replacement of 8 MOX fuel rods by water rods. The behavior of the designed fuel assemblies is compared against a reference UO2 standard 10x10 BWR fuel assembly. Results show the MA and Pu reduction achieved by the use of each one of the four proposed assemblies. Advantages and disadvantages of the recycling using each one of the fuel assemblies are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fuel management; Minor actinide recycling; Plutonium recycling","Fuel storage; Fuels; Isotopes; Uranium dioxide; Water recycling; Boiling water reactor (BWR); Energy productions; Fuel assembly; Fuel management; Minor actinide; MOX fuel assembly; Plutonium recycling; Uranium oxides; Boiling water reactors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064949844

Several studies have investigated the flexibility hydropower can provide with a particular focus on the Nordic hydropower resources. Of all European countries, Norway has the largest hydropower resources and storage capacity. However, Norway also has a highly electrified heating sector, which means high electricity demand during winter when reservoirs are low. This paper uses EnergyPLAN to analyse how a shift from individual electric heating to district heating affects the flexibility the Norwegian energy system can provide to Europe. The analysis develops a 2015 reference scenario and two scenarios that introduce district heating based on biomass and heat pumps, respectively. Results show that district heating can decrease the maximum load on dammed hydropower facilities, thus freeing up capacity for potential export. Furthermore, the dammed hydropower facilities are able to balance the electricity demands in all hours of the year. However, the shift to district heating also increases forced export to drain reservoirs as domestic electricity demand is reduced. Also, the amount of import the system is able to handle is decreased under the modelled conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","District heating; Flexibility; Green battery; Hydropower; Norway; Smart energy systems","District heating; Electric power utilization; Flexibility; Green battery; Hydropower; Norway; Smart energy systems; Hydroelectric power; demand analysis; electrical power; electricity; energy resource; equipment; heating; reservoir; small scale hydropower; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064505249

Electrochemical energy conversion is the common basis in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) and redox flow batteries (RFBs), although the first technology is not able to promote energy storage. RFBs are an electrochemical storage technology where the energy is stored in soluble redox pairs (electrochemical fuel), and in this form is available for exchange in electrical energy. The fundamental principle for RFB is that power and energy are independent, a great difference over other systems. Several organic active molecules are a great novelty as redox pairs with their energy capacity and higher efficiencies reached in organic RFBs, lowering the cost and toxicity of the system. There are responsible for a new direction of research and applicability for these devices, and this opens the door for their coupling with other technologies. Microbially charged RFBs are an innovative research technology with a potential new approach for the bioconversion of waste biomass energy and the promotion of bioelectrochemical fuels, to combine these with RFBs with the aim to produce and store bioenergy.

It is also frequently suggested that its cathodic stability renders it possible to operate with Li metal anodes in the design of high energy density storage devices. However, little is still known about the true interfacial chemistry between Li metal and PEO and how these two materials interact with each other. We are here exploring this relationship by the means of density functional theory (DFT)-based modeling. Using bulk structures and isolated PEO chains, we have found that there is a strong thermodynamic driving force to oxidize Li metal into lithium oxide (Li2O) when PEO is decomposed into C2H4 and H2, irrespectively of the PEO oligomer length. Explicit modeling of PEO on a Li(100) surface reveals that all steps in the decomposition are exothermic and that the PEO/Li metal system should have a layer of Li2O between the polymer electrolyte and the metal surface. These insights and the computational strategy adopted here could be highly useful to better tailor polymer electrolytes with favorable interfacial properties. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Computation theory; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Electrodes; Ethylene; Glass transition; Lithium compounds; Metals; Polyethylene oxides; Solid-State Batteries; Virtual storage; Computational strategy; Explicit modeling; High energy densities; Interfacial property; Low glass transition temperatures; Poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO); Polymer electrolyte; Thermodynamic driving forces; Polyelectrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072695440

Therefore, reducing those communications necessarily preserves the node limited energy. One successful approach to this end is to reduce both the number of transmissions made by the node and the payload of each transmission. Numerous proposals have recently been made to achieve this reduction by approximating the node data at the sink via forecasting. However, many of these proposals are plagued with one or more of three problems: intensive computations, excessive delays and backtracking. In this study, the authors introduce the lightweight energy-efficient real-time (LEERT) framework, which avoids all three problems while saving considerably on energy consumption. The savings are achieved by both reducing immensely the number of transmissions and reducing the payload of each transmission to only one element. This is actually the minimum any framework would hope for. LEERT is also extremely light, performing only four primitive operations per measurement on average. Its storage requirements are even lighter – only one past measurement needs to be retained in memory. LEERT has passed extensive validation tests using real-world data. Its performance has been evaluated against two recent energy-efficient frameworks and found to have an astounding edge. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.",,"Digital storage; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Energy efficient; Limited energies; Number of transmissions; Primitive operations; Real-time communication; Real-world; Storage requirements; Validation test; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072113084

The solar refrigeration system considered in this research study includes a non-tracking PV power source directly-coupled with a variable speed DC compressor. The operating point of the compressor of the considered solar refrigeration system is determined on the current versus voltage (I-V) plane, by intersecting the I-V curve of the PV panel with the I-V curve of the compressor. The operating speed of the compressor is determined to model the hourly variation of the performance of the refrigeration system. The analysis and simulation result show that the COP of the refrigeration cycle for the selected days is around 2.25 when the compressor runs at low speed, and the COP drops to its lowest value of 1.85 when the compressor operates at the highest speed. Furthermore, the simulation results indicated that an estimated radiation intensity 315 W/m2 is required to be received on the tilted panel to run the considered compressor at its minimum rotational speed of 1800 rpm. To drive the compressor at its maximum rotational speed (4200 rpm), an estimated radiation intensity of 700 W/m2 is required to fall on the PV panel.

This study aimed to develop optimized processing conditions using response surface methodology, for the ultrasonic extraction (UE) of lipids from wet and dried marine Chlorella sp. Integrated process approaches with different extraction and solvent recovery steps were developed for the evaluation of the lipid recovery and process energy consumption. The effects of other processing factors, such as the biomass-to-solvent ratio, solvent type, and solvent-to-solvent ratio were investigated. The biomass and lipids extracted were characterized by scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) and gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) analysis, respectively. With a single extraction and single-solvent recovery (1-1 cycle) process, the LYs from fresh and stored paste were 11.7% and 6%, respectively, while freeze-dried biomass produced an 18.5% LY. The energy consumption was 6000 MJ/kg lipid for the wet route and 8200 MJ/kg lipid for the dry route in the 1-1-cycle process.

According to density functional theory (DFT), the Ti atom adsorbed in the defect protrudes outward from the surface and does not agglomerate. The Ti/BNNT system possesses excellent affinity towards H2 molecules with thermodynamically favorable binding energies. Up to seven H2 molecules can partially attach near Ti in quasi-molecular form due to the cationic functionalized Ti and heteropolar B-N bonds at the surface. MD simulation further reveals that the seven H2 molecules are indeed physisorbed in two distinct regions near to (at ∼2 Å) and far from (at ∼4 Å) the Ti atom. The thermal properties obtained from MD simulations were utilized in the CFD code to quantify thermal energy transfer. According to CFD, the equilibrium pressure distribution for a type III H2 cylinder is initially low within its locality.

As catalyst aging is affecting the catalyst performance, such impact needs to be consider upfront during the design of the fresh catalyst. Until now, the exhaust system design are evaluated based on real tests for each vehicle, using exhaust lines aged on engine test benches or burner benches. This induces major investigation limitations such as: Late evaluation in development cycle, high testing and prototyping cost. The usage of Model Based Development approach can be a powerful way to improve this process by allowing system evaluation under several aging conditions at early development stage. The present study focuses on modelling of the Three Way Catalyst (TWC) aging to predict the mileage impact on tailpipe emissions. The activity was divided in 4 steps: 1-Development of a detailed TWC for 4 different aging levels. The impact of aging is considered by tuning the pre-exponential factors of the reactions Arrhenius laws. The activation energies are not modified, since they are representative of the active site type. 2-Aging model development: Aging laws are extracted from previous calibrated model considering reaction groups (oxidation, NO reduction, Oxygen Storage Capacity (OSC)...) and Platinum Group Metal (PGM) type. 3-Model validation on driving cycle: The tailpipe emissions are predicted with less than 15% deviation on WLTC. 4-Application and validation to another TWC technology (different amount of PGM and OSC): In that case also, the aged TWC emissions prediction is within 15% deviation on WLTC. The proposed aging model provides the possibility to predict aging of any TWC using same washcoat family, based on existing TWC model calibrated in fresh condition. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

This effort resulted in utilization of first generation biofuels. Unfortunately, these fuels brought new dilemmas and challenges in general, such as food production competition and land use and, in case of fatty acid methyl esters for compression ignition engines, also technical challenges such as storage stability and deposit formation. Utilization of particle filters and sensitive fuel systems are driving effort to develop compatible renewable biofuels which can be utilized at higher than current shares. Hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVO), as industrially produced biofuels, exhibit some beneficial properties compared to traditional fatty-acid methyl esters especially in terms of oxidation stability, injector fouling, energy content and cetane number. The aim of this study was to investigate heat release rates when three neat fuels (diesel, RME and HVO) are utilized in a current passenger car with a EURO 6 diesel engine at a wide range of operating regimes extracted from various currently used driving cycles. The results show significant effect on combustion of fuel injected during the pilot injection for HVO, with strongly reduced ignition delay and with higher heat release rate compared to diesel fuel, while the effect of RME is small and ambiguous. Other combustion phases were basically similar with reduced delay between the injection event and the onset of the heat-release. In some cases, carefully orchestrated combustion of fuel injected during first and second injections creating continuous heat release designed for diesel operation was maintained for RME, but broken-up into nearly two separate heat release peaks for HVO. At higher loads, diesel and RME behaved mostly similarly, but HVO exhibited a dramatic reduction of the premixed combustion phase. In some operating points, the ECU seems to be adjusting the injection timing to keep combustion timing unchanged during some combustion events. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

In this study, a new circuit topology is proposed for the electric connection between PZTs in a harvester including a great number of PZTs.

Spoilage and keeping quality of fish especially in the tropics is temperature dependence as high temperature and relative humidity accelerate the process of spoilage and fish keeping quality. Fish dehydration removed moisture and extended the shelf life of dried fish. Drying involves removal of moisture from fish as a result of heat and mass transfer done under controlled conditions. This study delves into various drying techniques and drying kinetics of fish. Design/methodology/approach: The review examines fish drying kinetics and the various drying models applicable to fish drying. Findings: This review showed that moisture content and colour of dried fish are affected by time and power level. It was also found that the moisture content of the dried fish varied according to the drying method used. Also, as drying power and drying rate varied inversely with drying time. Eight different thin layer drying models were examined for evaluation of drying data for all the experimental conditions involving fish drying. It was found that the quality of the dried fish decreased with drying. Higher values of effective moisture diffusivity have been found to increase moisture velocity within fish samples which improve removal of moisture to reach equilibrium moisture content at specified relative humidity. However, based on this, effective moisture diffusivity could be a useful parameter to design an effective drying method in terms of time, energy consumption and cost to prolong the storage life of dried fish samples. Drying kinetics and different drying models were considered and explained. The use of these models was considered to be important in choosing appropriate drying conditions for effective drying and to get good quality dried fish samples. Research limitations/implications: The review considers few available literatures on the subject matter. Practical implications: The review explores the possibility of creating more awareness for more in-depth research on fish drying kinetics and their usefulness in fish preservation. Originality/value: This outcome of this study is important to researchers, policymakers and regulatory agencies in developing countries on fish preservation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Drying; Drying kinetics; Fish; Quality; Shelf life",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071012645

In order to meet stringent safety requirements applicable for radiation protection instrumentation, CROME uses the FPGA section of the SoC for all safety critical functions. Whereas the SoC's dual core ARM processor is running an embedded operating system which is used both for communication with the CERN supervisory system and for data management. Due to the use of an embedded Linux OS without a virtualisation layer, the functional reliability of the SoC's FPGA section is considered much greater than the ARM processing system which can be subject to software crashes due to data corruption. This assumption had a central role in CROME's calculation architecture. In order to confirm the assumption and therefore the reliability and robustness of our design, random faults have been voluntarily induced in the SoC by exposing it to ionising radiation of sufficient energy in the CHARM facility, creating Single Event Upsets (SEU).

HGSs contain two or more renewable energy sources (RESs), such as wind power generators (WPGs), photovoltaic (PV) generation systems and the energy of the tides. Due to the intermittent nature of RESs, power and voltage fluctuations have appeared accordingly at the connection point with the utility power grid. Hence, energy storage technologies can play an effective role in mitigating power and voltage fluctuations caused by hybrid PV–wind generation systems. This paper proposes a robust control strategy for superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) combined with HGS. Fuzzy logic control (FLC) is used to control the chopper circuit of SMES in order to charge/discharge the active power from/to HGS. The proposed FLC strategy considers the fluctuations due to PV and wind power generation systems and the random load power variation. SMES with the proposed FLC method can effectively mitigate the fluctuation of active and reactive powers transfer between HGS and grid, and it can also regulate the voltage profile of the common connection point of SMES with HGS. Moreover, the system line power loss is clearly reduced by using the SMES system. The complete power system including loads is built in MATLAB/Simulink platform. The simulation results indicate that the proposed FLC–SMES can smooth both power and voltage fluctuations due to uncertain climate changes of PV and WPG systems. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Fuzzy logic control; Hybrid PV–wind; Power and voltage fluctuations; Superconducting magnetic energy storage","Choppers (circuits); Climate change; Computer circuits; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Electromagnetic wave emission; Fuzzy logic; Magnetic storage; MATLAB; Mercury compounds; Robust control; Superconducting magnets; Wind power; Active and reactive power; Energy storage technologies; Fuzzy logic control; Hybrid generation system; Photovoltaic generation; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Voltage fluctuations; Wind power generation systems; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074130797

In recent times numerous routing mechanisms have been proposed but LEACH still attracts the most consideration in research area as its architecture provides balanced energy consumption among nodes. But due to long distance communication, LEACH consumes more energy for data transmission and results in early death of WSN.

Employing a speech recognition system in low-resource devices (LRDs) have increased significantly in recent years. Implementing feature extraction, which involves complex computations, in LRD is very challenging because LRD has limited energy, storage, and processing power. The optimum design must carefully balance performance metrics, including speed, area, and energy. The objective of this research is to implement and model speech feature extraction design in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform, and to identify the optimum implementation for low-resource devices (LRDs). The novelty of this research is optimising feature extraction implementations using design options such as word size; and developing accurate performance models to enhance future designs. The authors study extensively examines the effect of fixed-point n-bit word size on the design of Mel frequency cepstral coefficients feature extraction in the FPGA implementation. The results show that the performance metrics (area, power, and energy) increase at a slower pace compared with n because the dependency of some blocks (e.g. logarithm) on n is non-linear. For example, increasing n by 50% increases the resource utilisation by 38%, power by 41% and energy by 41%. Models for resources, power, and energy are developed with accuracies of 5.1, 4.5, and 4.3%, respectively. Furthermore, n has a weak impact on timing results and therefore speed is almost similar across implementations.

According to DFT formalisms, the Ti atom does not form any clusters and protrudes to the external surface of the BNNT. The calculations suggest that the Ti-BNNT assembly can attract up to seven H2 per Ti. The unaltered H–H bond distance along with a poor molecular orbital (HOMO and LUMO) overlap with the Titanium-BN nanotube for succeeding hydrogen adsorption (&gt;7H2 per Ti) precludes that the system is saturated. The MD simulations revealed that the adsorption of H2 can take place on the surface and interstitial sites of the Ti/BNNT with a corresponding gravimetric hydrogen uptake of &gt;7.0 wt%. Further, the resulting pressure of the system is significantly reduced with high H2 uptake. The simulation also suggests that with proper temperature control, the charging and releasing of H2 can be well regulated. Finally, the structure is barely perturbed upon adsorption/desorption and the hydrogen storage capacity is in compliance with the Department of Energy specifications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Density functional theory; Hydrogen storage; Ti-decorated BN nanotube","Adsorption; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen storage; Molecular dynamics; Molecular orbitals; Nanotubes; Titanium compounds; Adsorption/desorption; BN nanotube; Department of Energy; External surfaces; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen storage capacities; Interstitial sites; Molecular dynamics simulations; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072242234

LS is an anionic redox-active polyelectrolyte and is a promising candidate to boost the charge capacity of the positive electrode (positrode) in redox-supercapacitors. Here, the physical-chemical investigation of how this biopolymer incorporates into the conducting polymer PEDOT matrix, of the positrode, by means of counter-ion exchange is reported.

For the PCM, Rubitherm20 (RT-20) in the forms of a paraffin ball and a plastic pack was selected to cool the return air of the evaporator, which directly caused decreases in power consumption of 7.85% and 5.78%, respectively. The R-123 VCHP was integrated with the air conditioner at the condenser to receive and boost rejected heat to the hot water temperature of 60-70 °C. Ultrasonic wave generators at 42kHz frequency were installed at the evaporator to improve heat transfer characteristics and reduce the electrical power usage of the air conditioner by 8%. The R-32 drop-in refrigerant technique was tested in an R-410a air conditioner model. The R-32 unit showed the advantages of a smaller environmental impact and a higher cooling energy efficiency ratio (EER) compared with that of the R-410a unit.

The increment of initial temperature, Tin, in STT-MRAM can achieve low switching energy, ESW. However, this leads to an unavoidable decrease in Δ and switching efficiency. In this paper, SBMTJ and DBMTJ were analyzed in terms of the switching efficiency factor with ESW reduction by increasing the Tin. The switching temperature, TSW, was investigated using a finite-element method simulation. The results show that the DBMTJ(A) and SBMTJ with the same MgO layer thickness of 0.9 nm provide a higher switching current, IC, than the DBMTJ(B) with a MgO layer thickness of 1.3 nm. The TSW in a DBMTJ(A) is higher than that in an SBMTJ, while TSW for a DBMTJ(B) is the smallest because of its low IC. The DBMTJ(A) and DBMTJ(B) can be applied in a higher temperature range than the SBMTJ at a Δ of 40. In addition, the STT efficiency factor, Δ IC0, for a DBMTJ is better than the factor for an SBMTJ. Although the temperature increment would cause an undesirable reduction in Δ, it can reach a low ESW for the requirement of a fast write access time. Therefore, the control device for increasing the Tin in the MTJs is attractive and should be promoted in the advancement of memory technology. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Magnetic properties; magnetic random-access memory (MRAM); magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs); spin-transfer torque (STT); thermal analysis","Cobalt compounds; Energy utilization; Integrated circuits; Magnesia; Magnetic properties; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Magnetism; MRAM devices; Random access storage; Switching; Thermoanalysis; Tin; Double-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions; Finite element method simulation; Low energy consumption; Magnetic random access memory; Magnetic tunnel junction; Spin transfer torque; Switching temperatures; Temperature increment; Tunnel junctions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071321842

The results revealed that Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (2.10 ± 0.02 MDA/kg) and Peroxide value (1.13 ± 0.01 meq peroxide/kg) were higher in aerobic as compared to vacuum in treatment with 3 kGy + 2% MLP.

A recent and versatile process producing nanoporous metals is the dealloying of an initial alloy, i.e. the selective dissolution of the more reactive element of the alloy. In this work, we report on a method of CuZn alloy formation, without the use of furnaces or expensive techniques, and its subsequent chemical dealloying leading to nanoporous copper. Co-electrodeposition of CuZn alloys on a copper substrate is performed using pyrophosphate as a complexing agent in presence of boric acid, copper sulfate and zinc sulfate. The electrochemical behavior of this system is characterized by cyclic voltammetry, showing that a copper-zinc alloy is formed at −1.5 V vs. SCE. Cauliflower-like Zn-rich γ-brass and ε-brass coatings are obtained by co-electrodeposition. The thickness, the structure and the composition of the electrodeposited alloy can be tuned by varying the electrodeposition conditions. Thicker and rougher coatings with a higher zinc content are formed at more cathodic conditions. The electrodeposited CuZn coatings were chemically dealloyed, and a two-step dealloying protocol leads to open-framework nanoporous copper templates, which are a material of interest for energy storage, biosensors, and catalysis applications. © 2019","CuZn electrodeposition; Nanostructured copper; Two-step chemical dealloying","Additives; Binary alloys; Boric acid; Boride coatings; Brass; Cobalt alloys; Copper compounds; Cyclic voltammetry; Dealloying; Electrodeposition; Electrodes; Nanostructured materials; Structural metals; Sulfur compounds; Zinc alloys; Zinc coatings; Zinc compounds; Chemical dealloying; Electrochemical behaviors; Electrodeposited alloys; Electrodeposition conditions; Functional properties; High surface-to-volume ratio; Nanostructured copper; Selective dissolution; Copper alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069971209

It benefits from the data collected within the European Investment Bank Surveys in 2017 and 2018, involving information about energy audits and energy-efficiency investments of some 12,500 signatures from EU28 Member States per year. Our analysis suggests that the decision of firms to conduct an energy audit is driven mainly by their characteristics, such as size, productivity, capital intensity, sector affiliation, and national policies regarding the transposition of relevant EU legislation and policy incentives. Furthermore, our findings indicate that energy audits besides being the first step in realizing energy-efficiency opportunities, most likely lead to the adoption of their recommendations. This is consistent with the view that energy audit is a useful tool in overcoming the information barriers and facilitating investments in energy-efficiency measures (EEMs). In fact, their information is more crucial for small firms and for investments in support processes such as lighting, wall insulation etc. than in production processes such as replacement of machinery and equipment. We also find that the likelihood of investments in EEMs, especially after an energy audit, is higher when combined with external financing and for innovative firms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","EIBIS; Energy audit; Energy efficiency; Propensity score matching","Electric energy storage; Investments; Machinery; EIBIS; Energy audit; Energy efficiency investments; Energy efficiency opportunities; European Investment Bank; External financings; Production process; Propensity score matching; Energy efficiency; energy efficiency; European Union; industrial investment; regression analysis; small and medium-sized enterprise; survey; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069729111

Eskom owns the supply chain of electricity, this includes generation, transmission, distribution and management of the electric grid. The power utility identified the need to understand the operating capabilities of such plants within the South African electric grid. Therefore, to demonstrate the role and value Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) with storage offers to the electric grid, an array of operating strategies was identified during the design phase of Eskom's Solar-1 project. These operating strategies explored in this paper are; Maximising Power Generation, Maximise Plant Revenue, Minimise Energy Dumping and Optimise Electric Grid (base load, peaking and auxiliary services). A Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data set for the case study plant situated in Upington, South Africa is used to obtain the annual performance of the plant. In the ‘Maximise Power Generation’ operating strategy the developed model increases the power block efficiency by 1.8% utilising part-load operational optimisation instead of running the turbine at full load until depletion of the hot storage tank. This is achieved by reducing the total annual turbine stops by 50% to only 176 stops. The thermal energy saved from start-up of the power block is utilised for power generation instead. Results from the ‘Base Load’ operating strategy reduces the turbine stops by 85% to only 52 stops annually. Therefore, increasing the turbine online hours to 94.5%. The results from the ‘Minimise Energy Dumping’ operating strategy shows that it is possible to reduce energy dumping from 4.0% to 2.7% by effectively optimising the dispatch from the hot storage tank at selected times and increasing the power block output to 110%. As a result, an additional 7.4% of electric energy is generated from this saving. Under the ‘Optimise Electric Grid’ operating strategies, the complementary services of CSP to other non-dispatchable power generation technologies such as wind and photovoltaics are investigated. CSP with storage has the potential to increase the utilisation factor of distribution substations in grid constrained areas within the grid. This opportunity greatly increases the market of CSP and emphasises the value of thermal storage. However, plant design optimisation is required for this operating strategy as it greatly affects the plant performance of the case study plant. Although CSP with storage demonstrates continuous reliable power delivery to the electric grid it also provides complementary services to non-dispatchable generating technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068552296

Effective biomass utilization in CLC requires an economical and effective oxygen carrier to achieve high fuel conversion, effective CO2 capture, and management of the harmful effects of biomass alkali release (bed agglomeration, oxygen carrier deactivation, fouling and corrosion). These issues were addressed in 100 kW CLC pilot experiments. Building on previous work, a mixture of a synthetic calcium manganite perovskite and natural ilmenite was used as the oxygen carrier. Four biomass fuels of varied alkali content were tested: black pellets of steam-exploded stem wood (BP), BP impregnated with K2CO3, a mixture of 50% BP with 50% straw pellets, and wood char. Experiments showed high fuel conversion and very high CO2 capture, with overall performance exceeding that of ilmenite and manganese ore. More than 95% gas conversion was achieved with black pellets at around 950 °C. The fate of biomass alkali, previously virtually unknown in CLC research, was explored by implementing online surface-ionization-based measurement of alkali released in the flue gases of the fuel reactor (FR) and air reactor (AR). Release levels were found to correlate with the fuel alkali content. The flue gas measurements and bed material elemental analyses suggest that most of the fuel alkali are accumulated in the oxygen carrier. Unexpectedly, it was found that flue gas alkali release occurs in both the FR and AR, with AR exhibiting an equal or higher rate of release vs. the FR. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Biomass; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Corrosion; Flue gases; Flues; Fuel storage; Ilmenite; Ionization of gases; Manganites; Mixtures; Oxygen; Pelletizing; Perovskite; Potash; Synthetic fuels; Wood fuels; Alkali contents; Bed agglomeration; Biomass utilization; Chemical looping combustion; Fuel conversion; Manganite perovskites; Pilot experiment; Surface ionization; Gas fuel analysis; alkalinity; biomass; carbon sequestration; combustion; ilmenite; oxygen; perovskite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068449642

Two hybrids of sorghum, 82G93 and 81G67 that were low and high in tannins (LT and HT), respectively, were evaluated. Each hybrid had low or high levels of kafirins (LK and HK, respectively). Pigs were fed 4 experimental diets that were formulated with sorghum as the sole source of CP and AAs: LT-LK, LT-HK, HT-LK, and HT-HK. In experiment 1, ileal cannulation was performed in 4 pigs weighing 25 ± 0.60 kg to determine protein, amino acids, and starch digestibility. In experiment 2, internal jugular venous catheterization was performed in 4 pigs weighing 26 ± 0.52 kg to determine glucose and PUN response. Experiment 1 results revealed that starch digestibility was not affected (P > 0.05) by kafirins neither tannins. Kafirins levels negatively affected (P < 0.05) the AID of glutamic acid and histidine; and tended to reduce (P < 0.10) alanine, aspartic acid, and valine AID. A higher level of tannins negatively affected (P < 0.001) the AID of dry matter, energy, lysine, (P < 0.01) cystine, histidine, methionine, (P < 0.05) crude protein, aspartic acid, leucine, and threonine. There was kafirins × tannin interaction effect which decreased (P < 0.05) the AID of glutamic acid and lysine; the AID of glycine and proline were negative in all diets. The SID of alanine, glutamic acid, histidine, and valine showed a tendency (P < 0.10) to be lower in high kafirins sorghums. Tannins level negatively affected the SID of (P < 0.001) lysine, (P < 0.01) cystine, histidine, (P < 0.05) protein, aspartic acid, leucine, methionine, serine, threonine, and valine digestibility. Experiment 2 results revealed that kafirins levels did not affect the glycemia until 300 min postprandial when a tendency (P = 0.08) to increase the glucose response was observed in pigs fed HK sorghums. Tannins level showed a tendency (P < 0.10) to decrease glycemia at 150 and 360 min postprandial. At 300 min postprandial HT sorghums diminished (P = 0.02) glycemia. The PUN level was not affected (P > 0.05) by kafirins but was reduced (P < 0.001) by the HT sorghums. The findings of the present study indicated that kafirins had a minimal but significant effect on the criteria studied; however, sorghum tannins reduced amino acid digestibility, glucose and PUN response in growing pigs. © 2019","Amino acids; Glucose; Ileal digestibility; PUN; Sorghum","alanine; amino acid; aspartic acid; cystine; glucose; glutamic acid; glycine; histidine; kafirin protein; leucine; lysine; methionine; proline; seed storage protein; serine; starch; tannin; threonine; unclassified drug; valine; amino acid analysis; animal experiment; Article; caloric intake; digestion; digestive tract intubation; dry matter intake; experimental diet; glucose assay; glucose blood level; nonhuman; pig; protein determination; protein protein interaction; sorghum; urea nitrogen blood level; vein catheterization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068186161

The production cost for biomass fired CHP and Waste CHP is slightly underestimated in the marginal cost profile used in the heat storage strategy described shown in Figure 7 b. More specifically, the error was that the revenue from electricity produced in CHP plants was not scaled by the electricity-to-heat output ratio. The consequence of this was that within the production cost profile, the costs for these CHP units were calculated as if they would have an electricity-to-heat output ratio equal to 1, which is higher than the general electricity-to-heat output ratio for this kind of production units. It is important to note that the error does not affect the production costs for these units in the optimizations. The error is solely affecting the marginal cost profile used in the storage algorithm, and thus the storing of heat in typical systems II, III, and IV since these have biomass and/or waste fired CHP production. The influence on the results is most clear for typical system IV that has a significant capacity of P2H-production in heat pumps. The deviation in the results for total annual electricity use in P2H is within the range 1.6% and 9%. The P2H potential is reduced for all storage sizes, except for seasonal storages. The differences in P2H potentials are shown in Figure C1 as a comparison of the of the corrected results (right diagram) with the results presented in Figure 10 in the published paper (left diagram). [Figure presented] Figure C1. Left - Figure 10 in the published version, right - results from new simulations. The most significant difference is that the new simulations show that seasonal storages are not viable for any of the cases. This is because the heat loaded into the storages vastly exceeds the heat extracted from the storages. Furthermore, this means that the stored heat is not fully utilized and therefore should be considered wasted. The conclusion from this is that the seasonal storage size investigated here is not viable for the shorter heat storage cycle times that appears more suitable for P2H as a demand side measure to reduce VRE surpluses. The overall conclusions from the study are however not changed, rather do the corrected results give stronger support for these. [Figure presented] Figure C2.

Matured regenerated and original tails were studied with different histological staining’s and immunohistochemistry to highlight the various tissue components. We found differences in the morphological features scalation pattern and pigmentation, as well as in the support structures: muscle organization, collagen and calcification. Vasculature was remodeled. Energy storage was restored with regeneration maintaining therefore the main metabolic function.

Continuous increase in the installation of new HVAC systems and higher penetration of renewables and energy storage in the building energy network require more sophisticated control approaches to realize the full potential of these systems. In this paper, an optimal control framework to coordinate HVAC, battery energy storage and renewable generation in buildings is developed. The controller aims to reduce peak load demand while achieving thermal comfort within industry standards. To facilitate this, a simple lumped mathematical model that describes the zone transient thermal dynamics is structured with a minimal data from the building, and is trained with actual thermal and electrical data. Next, a model predictive control algorithm that takes into account building thermal dynamics, battery state of charge, renewable generation status, and actual operational data and constraints, is formulated to regulate HVAC demand, battery power and building thermal comfort. The controller considers the changes in the outside dry-bulb air temperature, electricity price, required energy amount and comfort conditions simultaneously in order to find the proper optimal zone temperatures guaranteeing occupant comfort. The new controller was tested using data from a real building, and preliminary results indicate that significant reduction in peak electrical power demand can be achieved by the proposed approach. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage; Building energy management; Demand response; HVAC systems; Model predictive control; Optimization; Photovoltaics","Air conditioning; Battery management systems; Battery storage; Buildings; Charging (batteries); Controllers; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Model predictive control; Optimization; Predictive control systems; Secondary batteries; Storage management; Thermal comfort; Battery energy storage; Building energy managements; Demand response; HVAC system; Photovoltaics; HVAC",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067207099

This review starts with an overview on the [M(salen)]complexes and proceeds with a description of the main synthetic protocols developed for the preparation of [M(salen)]-based molecular materials, including their immobilisation onto several solid supports or their integration in supramolecular systems. To finish, several applications of [M(salen)]-based molecular materials are highlighted, which are aligned by four key thematic topics, considering current societal challenges: Heterogeneous Catalysis, Environmental Protection, Chemical Sensors and Sustainable Energy. In the Heterogeneous Catalysis topic is reviewed the application of [M(salen)]-based materials as heterogeneous catalysts in several organic chemical reactions, with high impact at industrial level, such as asymmetric oxidation or cycloaddition reactions. In the Environmental Protection topic is pointed out the importance of [M(salen)]-based materials for gas storage and for CO2 valorisation, through its capture and catalytic transformation into high-value products. In the Chemical Sensors topic is revised the use of [M(salen)]-based materials for ion-selective electrodes or as electrocatalysts for analyte detection. Lastly, in the Sustainable Energy topic, the application of [M(salen)]-based materials in a perspective of energy conversion, storage and saving is presented, considering their use as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction, electrochromic materials, or their incorporation into supercapacitors, batteries or organic light-emitting diodes. We believe that this Review will be of interest for researchers working in any of these fields, especially those interested in [M(salen)]-based materials, as it gives an up-to-date revision of the diversity of [M(salen)]-based materials and related hot-topic applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical sensors; Environmental protection; Heterogeneous catalysis; Sustainable energy; [M(salen)]-based materials",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066333796

Within this context, the aim of the research project M_Key “Management as a key driver of energy performance” is to better understand how large-scale energy consumer (LSEC) companies make energy-efficiency investment decisions. With about 35% of the total Swiss electricity consumption, LSECs are an important target group for energy-efficiency programmes in Switzerland. The goal of this paper is to present and describe the main findings of M_Key (Management as Key for Energy Performance) research project. For the first time, these findings extensively depict large-scale energy consumers in Switzerland. They highlight the low level of energy management in Swiss LSECs and of the resources allocated to tackle energy issues. Due to a lack of monitoring and control tools, companies have difficulty assessing their energy-efficiency investments. Energy issues are not generally a priority for companies, with a few exceptions, mainly in large firms. Requirements from national or cantonal energy policies have a significant role (and in the case of SMEs a key role) in inciting companies to action. When energy efficiency is perceived as strategic, companies tend to have a high level of energy management. The better the energy management system is, the more likely the chances are for a positive decision on energy-efficiency investment. Another important conclusion is that the more strategic a project or investment is considered to be, the less restrictive are the financial criteria applied. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy management; Energy performance; Energy-efficiency investment; Investment decision-making; Multiple benefits; Non-energy benefits","Decision making; Electric energy storage; Energy management; Energy management systems; Investments; Energy efficiency investments; Energy performance; Investment decision making; Multiple benefits; Non-energy; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066139587

Although there has been a remarkable advance on renewable energy technologies, their integration is still difficult for regulators, market designers and system operators due to the high variability and limited predictability of solar and wind resources. Measures can be adopted to ease their integration, among them geographical diversification. There is plenty of literature about the diversification of solar and wind resources and there is a common conclusion: greater dispersion smooths out power production. However, literature on the effects of spatial diversification on the power system, electricity prices and renewable energy market value is much scarcer. This paper studies the effects of spatial diversification and questions whether integration policies are incentivizing the placement of renewable generators where they provide the highest value to the electricity system in Chile. Using real data and a simplified dispatch model the analysis presented shows evidence of the effects of diversification on wind and solar market value in Chile. Results suggest that spatial diversification has a strong positive effect on the market value of renewable energy, especially in scenarios with active transmission and hydro-storage constraints. Wind market value may vary up to US$10/MW h depending on the level of diversification and the spatial and temporal constraints of the system and, given current storage capacity of hydro reservoirs, the solar market value may increase US$5/MW h due to diversification if transmission capacity is enough. Even though these results must be observed with caution, because they depend on the assumptions made, there is an important effect of renewable spatial diversification that should be observed by regulators. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Complementarity; Portfolio; Renewable integration; Solar diversity; Wind diversity","Digital storage; Electric power generation; Finance; Power markets; Wind power; Complementarity; Portfolio; Renewable energy markets; Renewable energy technologies; Renewable generators; Renewable integration; Solar diversity; Transmission capacities; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065912605

Even though the rack structural concept is elementary, due to thin-walled cold formed sections (also punched or slotted) and highly non-linear (often boltless) beam-to- column connections (BCC), the design of steel racks is demanding. This is especially the case when it comes to seismic loading, where hysteretic behaviour with significant pinching of the connections dictates the structural response. Even though several experiments on BCCs were performed in the past, it is difficult to cross-correlate the results because of a wide range of locking systems and geometric diversities. The component method, widely accepted in the design of steel joints, is an anticipated approach to overcome the above mentioned difficulties, even though it has not yet been established for the entire cyclic response of a BCC. The main obstacle to incorporating of the component method in the rack design lies in the fact that the load transfer between a beam-end connector (BEC) and a column has still not been explicitly investigated or mathematically described, e.g. stress in tabs has not been measured and documented. A proper estimation of the seismic response of the whole structure demands non-linear time history (NLTH) analyses with appropriate connection models. Two such models, both developed for concrete joints, have predominantly been used in recent numerical investigation of racks' response to seismic loading: the Pivot model and the Pinching4 model (integrated in OpenSees). In this paper, a new constitutive model is developed. By using only four parameters, the model can simulate both pinching and low-cycle fatigue of a BCC. This constitutive model of joint is based primarily on the Pivot model, which is altered to simulate peculiarities observed in all available documented moment-rotation curves of racks' BCCs, so it can be considered as the model principally developed for steel racks' joints. Results of ten recent experiments on BCCs are used to evaluate the model's capability and accuracy. The model predictions, which are evaluated through a comparison of dissipated energy and resisting moment through cycles, have been proven satisfactory. In the case study, NLTH analyses are performed on three identical racks with different BCC constitutive models, including the proposed one. These analyses validated the proposed model as computationally effective under dynamic loading. The BCC response estimations of three analysed constitutive models were compared in terms of both local (joint) and global (rack) response to seismic input, and the proposed model was found to be acceptable. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Beam-to-column connection; Damage; Hysteresis model; Low-cycle fatigue; Non-linear time-history analysis; Steel storage racks","Constitutive models; Dynamic loads; Energy dissipation; Hysteresis; Hysteresis loops; Locks (fasteners); Materials handling; Seismology; Steel structures; Thin walled structures; Warehouses; Beam-to-column connections; Damage; Hysteresis modeling; Low cycle fatigues; Non linear; Steel storage racks; Fatigue of materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065663608

Specifically, we will discuss the ways by which IR nanospectroscopy techniques, namely photo thermal induced resonance (PTIR) and scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), are utilized in order to identify nanoscale properties and their influence on the functionality of halide-perovskite solar cells and catalytic nanoparticles.

In order to obtain a good compromise between capital investment and system reliability, an optimum sizing of all HRES components is needed. As power reliability, system cost and operation of the system depend on each other, the sizing methodology must be integrated with the energy management strategy (EMS). This paper presents an optimization methodology for sizing the components of a standalone hybrid wind/PV system (with hydrogen storage and battery storage), which integrates an EMS based on an economic model predictive control (EMPC) approach. The integrated problem to be solved is presented as a bi-level optimization framework composed of an outer loop and an inner loop. The outer loop is in charge of the HRES sizing and it is solved using Genetic Algorithms (GA). The inner loop solves the EMS for each candidate solution as a rolling horizon mixed integer linear problem (MILP). The results have shown an investment saving as well as a reduction of the operation costs with the proposed methodology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bilevel mixed integer nonlinear problem; Economic model predictive control; Genetic algorithm; Sizing and EMS integration; Standalone hybrid renewable energy systems","Battery storage; Economics; Energy management; Genetic algorithms; Hydrogen storage; Integer programming; Investments; Model predictive control; Reliability; Renewable energy resources; Bi-level optimization; Economic modeling; Energy management strategies (EMS); Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES); Hybrid renewable energy systems; Hybrid wind/PV systems; Mixed integer nonlinear problems; Optimization methodology; Energy management systems; alternative energy; economic analysis; genetic algorithm; hydrogen; investment; numerical model; optimization; photovoltaic system; reliability analysis; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063227204

The proposed method combines low bit rate robustness and variable-sized quantization benefits of the well-known classified energy and pattern blocks (CEPB) method and quadtree-based (QB) partitioning technique, respectively. In the new method, first, the QB-UCEPB is constructed in the form of variable length block size thanks to the quadtree-based partitioning rather than fixed block size partitioning which was employed in the conventional CEPB method. The QB-UCEPB is then placed to the transmitter side as well as receiver side of the communication channel as a universal codebook manner. Every quadtree-based partitioned block of the input image is encoded using three quantities: image block scaling coefficient, the index number of the QB-UCEB and the index number of the QB-UCPB. These quantities are sent from the transmitter part to the receiver part through the communication channel. Then, the quadtree-based partitioned input image blocks are reconstructed in the receiver part using a decoding algorithm, which exploits the mathematical model that is proposed. Experimental results show that using the new method, the computational complexity of the classical CEPB is substantially reduced. Furthermore, higher compression ratios, PSNR and SSIM levels are achieved even at low bit rates compared to the classical CEPB and conventional methods such as SPIHT, EZW and JPEG2000. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Biomedical image compression; Classified energy and pattern blocks; Computed tomography; CT compression; Quadtree","Communication channels (information theory); Computerized tomography; Digital image storage; Image classification; Image coding; Transmitters; Biomedical images; Classified energy and pattern blocks; Conventional methods; Decoding algorithm; Higher compression ratios; Partitioning techniques; Quad trees; Scaling coefficients; Image compression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063065072

In this paper, a new control method has been presented for the real-time maximization of the power production of PV systems by modifying in real time the duty cycle and switching frequency of the power converter PWM control signal. The proposed method has the advantage that it can be applied in PV systems operating under partial shading conditions. Also, knowledge of either the operational characteristics and configuration of the PV modules within the PV array or the power converter operational characteristics, is not required for its application. The experimental results validated that by using the proposed method, the power production of the PV system is increased significantly compared to the case that only the power production of the PV array is maximized by using a global MPPT technique without tracking the optimal value of the power converter efficiency. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Maximum power point tracking (MPPT); optimization; partial shading; photovoltaic (PV) systems; power converter efficiency","Control systems; Energy efficiency; Interactive computer systems; Maximum power point trackers; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Power control; Production; Radiation effects; Switching frequency; Converter efficiency; Energy productions; Maximum Efficiency; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Operating points; Operational characteristics; Partial shading; Photovoltaic systems; Real time systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057815613

This system intends to use reinforced concrete pile foundations configured with hollowed sections to store renewable energy generated from solar panels attached to building structures in the form of compressed air. However previous research indicates that the compressed air will generate considerable high circumferential tensile stresses in the concrete pile, which requires unrealistic high hoop reinforcement ratio to avoid leakage of the compressed air. One possible solution is to utilize fiber reinforced concrete instead of placing the hoop reinforcement to resist the tensile stress. This paper investigates nonlinear structural responses and post-cracking behavior of the fiber reinforced concrete pile subjected to high air pressure through nonlinear finite element simulations. Concrete damage plasticity models were used in the simulation. Several parameters were considered in the study including concrete grade, fiber content, and thickness of the pile section. The air pressures which the pile can resist at different crack depths along the pile section were identified. Design recommendations were provided for the energy storage pile foundation using the fiber reinforced concrete.

Cellulose derived from wood or bacteria has dominated the industrial cellulose market and has been developed to produce a number of advanced materials for applications in energy storage, environmental, and biotechnology areas. However, Cladophora cellulose (CC) extracted from green algae has unprecedented advantages over those celluloses because of its high crystallinity (>95%), low moisture adsorption capacity, excellent solution processability, high porosity in the mesoporous range, and associated high specific surface area. The unique physical and chemical properties of CC can add new features to and enhance the performance of nanocellulose-based materials, and these attributes have attracted a great deal of research interest over the past decade.This Account summarizes our recent research on the preparation, characterization, functionalization, and versatile applications of CC. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the uniqueness of CC with respect to material structure, properties, and emerging applications. We discuss the potential of CC in energy storage, environmental science, and life science, with emphasis on applications in which its properties are superior to those of other nanocellulose forms. Specifically, we discuss the production of the first-ever paper battery based on CC. This battery has initiated a rising interest in the development of sustainable paper-based energy storage devices, where cellulose is used as a combined building block and binder for paper electrodes of various types in combination with carbon, conducting polymers, and other electroactive materials. High-active-mass and high-mass-loading paper electrodes can be made in which the CC acts as a high-surface-area and porous substrate while a thin layer of electroactive material is coated on individual nanofibrils. We have shown that CC membranes can be used directly as battery separators because of their low moisture content, high mesoporosity, high thermal stability, and good electrolyte wettability. The safety, stability, and capacity of lithium-ion batteries can be enhanced simply by using CC-based separators. Moreover, the high chemical modifiability and adjustable porosity of dried CC papers allow them to be used as advanced membranes for environmental science (water and air purification, pollutant adsorption) and life science (virus isolation, protein recovery, hemodialysis, DNA extraction, bioactive substrates). Finally, we outline some concluding perspectives on the challenges and future directions of CC research with the aim to open up yet unexplored fields of use for this interesting material. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"cellulose; nanofiber; air filter; cell line; chemistry; devices; electrode; filtration; green alga; human; porosity; power supply; procedures; ultrastructure; water management; Air Filters; Cell Line; Cellulose; Chlorophyta; Electric Power Supplies; Electrodes; Filtration; Humans; Nanofibers; Porosity; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071705981

Hydrogen is being turned too as an energy carrier in hopes to wean our current society away from carbon-emitting fossil fuels and to mitigate their effects on the atmosphere. Hydrogen has a gross energy or higher heating value of 142 MJ/kg compared to natural gas or crude oil that register at 52 and 45 MJ/kg, respectively, hydrogen also has demonstrated its ability as fuel for vehicles, electricity storage via fuel cells, and a number of other useful attributes in the chemical and metallurgical industries. Hydrogen can be produced using diverse, domestic resources including fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal (preferentially with carbon capture, utilization, and storage); biomass grown from renewable, nonfood crops; or using nuclear energy and renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, and hydroelectric power to split water. This diversity of potential supply sources is an important reason why hydrogen is such a promising energy carrier.

This research aimed to understand the effect of a heat shock (HS) prior to controlled atmosphere (CA) storage on the reduction of ripening heterogeneity. HS prior to CA storage reduces more drastically the ripening heterogeneity in middle season fruit. Via correlation network analysis we show the different metabolomics networks between HS and CA. High throughput proteomics revealed 135 differentially expressed proteins unique to middle season fruit triggered by HS. Further integration of metabolomics and proteomics data revealed that HS reduced the glycolytic throughput and induced protein degradation to deliver energy for the alternative ripening pathways. L-isoleucine, L-valine, L-aspartic and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase involved in protein degradation were positively correlated to HS samples.

Microporous clays exhibit an intricate atomic structure with different polar species able to interact with H2. However, despite its numerous implications, the binding mechanism of H2 has not been discussed in detail. In this work, a first-principles study of the structure, energetics, and chemical bonding of the H2 in palygorskite clay is addressed. Total energy calculations including van der Waals interactions shown that, depending on water content, the structural channels of palygorskite clays offer different possibilities for the adsorption of H2. The calculated binding energies range between 6 and 24 kJ/mol. The larger H2 binding affinity corresponds to the case where the Mg2+ nearest to the inner surface of the palygorskite channel is exposed due to a partial loss of coordination water. The analysis of net atomic charges predicts a slight charge transfer from H2 to Mg2+. Electronic structure and overlap population analysis reveal orbital interactions between the 3s and 3p states of Mg2+ with the σ orbitals of the H2 molecule, explaining the charge transfer and large binding energy in this system (24 kJ/mol). In contrast, Al3+ does not induce charge transfer from H2, while dispersion forces and electrostatic interactions dominate the binding mechanism. The results of the present study suggest that the controlled dehydration of coordinated water in Mg-rich palygorskite is a potential route to the creation of microporous materials with enhanced gas adsorption. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Density functional theory; Hydrogen storage; Microporous material; Palygorskite clay; Physisorption; Van der waals","Binding energy; Calculations; Charge transfer; Chemical bonds; Density functional theory; Driers (materials); Electronic structure; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen storage; Microporosity; Molecules; Physisorption; Van der Waals forces; Density-functional study; Hydrogen physisorption; Nuclear waste containment; Overlap population analysis; Palygorskite clays; Total energy calculation; Van der waals; Van Der Waals interactions; Microporous materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068837627

This paper compares space and water heating demand at household level in Germany and in the United Kingdom (UK) between 1991 and 2015. The elasticities of consumption of space and water heating with respect to price, income and heating degree days (HDD) are examined using non-parametric models. Domestic heating consumption is highly elastic with HDD in both countries and HDD elasticities are found to be higher in the UK. From a certain income threshold, heating demand decreases as income increases in German households whereas demand rises with higher incomes in the UK. High price elasticities indicate that UK households are very responsive to energy conservation measures, therefore implying that a pricing policy will effectively reduce heating consumption. However, in Germany, the impact of pricing policies is unclear. Thus, the most effective policy measure to decrease domestic heating consumption in Germany in the long-run should be one which targets improvements of building envelope performance levels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Heating degree days; Households; Income elasticities; Price elasticities; Space and water heating","Costs; Economic analysis; Elasticity; Hard disk storage; Heating degree-days; Households; Income elasticities; Price elasticity; Water heating; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064941920

However, connecting devices between the positive or negative pole and the neutral conductor will result in unbalanced currents causing voltage to unbalance. Therefore, power electronic converters with voltage balancing capability are essential. Instead of installing dedicated voltage balancing converters, this study proposes to apply three-level DC-DC converters. These converters can interface battery storage with bipolar DCμGs and balance the pole-to-neutral voltages at the same time. However, high levels of unbalanced currents drive three-level DC-DC converters towards their theoretical unbalanced operating limits. To derive these, a method is presented which decomposes the governing equations in balanced and unbalanced components. Although the method is generally applicable to the three-level converters, the full-bridge three-level converter serves as a comprehensive example. The method enables to derive the unbalanced operating area of three-level DC-DC converters and to appropriately size the filter inductor. Furthermore, a novel modulation strategy is introduced in order to lower the inductor current ripple in unbalanced conditions, supported by experimental results. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019",,"Electric inverters; Energy transfer; Poles; Inductor current ripples; Power electronic converters; Power transfer capability; Three-level converters; Three-level dc-dc converter; Unbalanced component; Unbalanced condition; Unbalanced currents; DC-DC converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072034908

Selecting battery bank terminal voltage to match DC-bus voltage (350-450 V for single-phase AC loads), necessitates employing battery banks with long-string connections along with their attendant shortcomings. To employ short-string battery banks, high-boost-ratio bidirectional interfaces are required between the DC-bus and battery bank. Current literature lacks a single source where high-boost-ratio converters' are categorised and their strengths and weaknesses identified. Comprehensive literature review is hence carried out to determine attributes of various high-boost-ratio DC-DC converters and also categorise them. The key attributes of a topology to interface battery storage to a DC-bus are determined. Based on these a bidirectional tapped-inductor boost converter emerges as the best candidate. Moreover, in order to regulate output voltage, voltage-gain versus duty-ratio characteristics should not be very steep. Since battery terminal voltage varies with state-of-charge, closed-loop control is necessary. Converter's small-signal transfer-functions are derived and a two-loop controller to regulate output voltage and inductor current while allowing bidirectional power flow designed. A novel bidirectional passive lossless snubber circuit is employed to clamp the voltage spikes across the active switches, without altering the normal operation of the converter. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019",,"Battery management systems; Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Economics; Electric inverters; Electric load flow; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Battery energy storage systems; Bidirectional converter (BDC); Bidirectional power flow; Closed-loop control; Literature reviews; Renewable energy systems; Small-signal transfer functions; Two-loop controllers; DC-DC converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072029478

Besides, the potential benefits of implementing LPS are prioritized. Design/methodology/approach: The significant techniques and likely benefits of LPS implementations were identified through comprehensive literature, followed by their verification through a pilot study. The quantitative data were collected using a questionnaire survey from 89 companies, operating in the Gaza Strip construction industry. The relative important index was calculated for prioritizing the significant tools/techniques (16) which support the effective LPS implementation, and highlighting the potential benefits (10) achieved through LPS implementation. Findings: The results showed that the “use of visual devices to spread information in the construction site,” “attendance of key actors” and “look ahead plan” are the most important tools/techniques supporting LPS implementation. The top three potential benefits of implementing LPS include: “allows a better understanding of the program control,” “maximizes the co-operation and confidence among team members” and “allows the manager to better visualize the work program.” To prevent any waste in project time and to ensure the material supply and continuity of works, the study recommends advance supply and storage of demand materials, and early availability of the shop-drawings for acceptance by the superintendent. Practical implications: The study’s findings are expected to guide the key construction stakeholders to prioritize their energies toward effective LPS implementation in the Gaza Strip. Originality/value: Though this study pertains to Palestine, its methodology can be generalized in other countries and regions, having a similar work environment, after making necessary cultural adjustments. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Benefits; Construction industry; Gaza Strip; Last planner system; Stakeholders; Tools/techniques","Developing countries; Digital storage; Human resource management; Surveys; Benefits; Construction stakeholders; Design/methodology/approach; Gaza Strip; Last planner system; Potential benefits; Questionnaire surveys; Stakeholders; Construction industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068036539

However, some challenges must be solved for the integration of renewable clean fuel into daily life and industry for practical applications. At this point, hydrogen (H2) gas as an energy carrier has emerged as a clean-burning option especially for on-board energy demand. H2 can be produced from the-primary energy sources by steam reforming, thermal cracking, gasification, pyrolysis, electrolysis, and photolysis methods. It can be stored as high-pressure gas in cylinders, liquid H2 in cryogenic tanks, adsorbed H2 on materials, absorbed H2 on metals, chemically bonded H2 in covalent/ionic compounds and in oxidation of reactive metals. It can be transported via special design pipelines, via compressed H2 trailer, and via liquid H2 truck. It can be converted into electricity with high efficiency using fuel cells. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has decelerated goals for future applications and for the development of on-board storage materials with low molecular weight and high storage capacity. Boranes can exhibit complex forms by combination with other elements and have attracted much attention as potential H2 storage materials. However, due to their complex structures, reaction mechanisms of different H2 releasing methodologies need to be elucidated in detail. An understanding of these reaction mechanisms will have crucial significance as this will be necessary for the adaptation of H2 gas to sustainable energy systems. Because of the above considerations, the present chapter focuses on the catalytic reaction mechanism of H2 release by solvolysis, hydrothermolysis, and thermolysis reactions of the boranes as mentioned above. It is discuses recent advances in the fabrication of various catalysts, and it is described recent investigations of their internal and external properties.

However, the usage of small turbines usually faces several shortcomings, and the actual yield is often lower than expected, generally because the output power is low when compared with the manufacturer, and the actual wind turbine behavior does not reproduces. In a view of performance evaluation of a small wind turbines using high-accuracy measurement devices to measure wind speed and energy production, this article illustrates an experimental seasonal performance evaluation of a 0.5-kW Hummer small wind turbine, placed in an urban environment. In addition, we study the influence of the height in the energy output and analyze its effect in the system performance, which is another aim in this work. Three cases have been carried out: 4 m in order to protect rotor blades during strong winds and storms in the first scenario and 6 m the manufacturing height in the second scenario while 10 m the third case. A 0.5-kW Hummer wind turbine has been installed in Noagia-Benghazi since 2010 for educational purposes, field studies, training, graduate projects, and research. The wind turbine seasonal performance under different periods was obtained and compared in terms of the wind speed, output power, energy production, and average wind speed. The average wind speed is 6.4, 4, 5.8, and 4 m/s, and the average energy production is 948.24, 172.8, 648, and 172.8 kWh in spring, summer, winter, and autumn, respectively. Spring has the highest wind speed followed by winter and autumn then summer for all height. Improvement is attained if the wind turbine tower height is 6 m, and 10 m where more energy is harvested. But the main problem at 10 m is that the system control needs more improvement because the wind speed exceeds 14 m/s which represents the maximum speed. The system can produce about 1.942 MW yearly and save CO2 emissions. © The Author(s) 2019.","energy production; performance evaluation; power curve; Renewable energy; small wind turbines","Environmental impact; Low power electronics; Manufacture; Speed; Urban planning; Wind; Energy productions; performance evaluation; Power curves; Renewable energies; Small wind turbine; Wind turbines; alternative energy; performance assessment; urban area; wind power; wind turbine; wind velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069774111

Out of the total effect of fat mass on LVMI, 29.0% was mediated by BP and glucose (P = 2.4 × 10-12). The BP pathway was most important, mediating 24.4% of the total effect of fat mass on LVMI (P = 4.6 × 10-7), while the glucose pathway accounted for 4.6% (P = 0.033). The association of VAT with LVMI (0.202, P = 2.4 × 10-4) was slightly weaker than that of SAT with LVMI (0.283, P = 1.0 × 10-6). Of several measured adipokines, leptin was a significant mediator of the effect of fat mass on LVMI (P = 3.0 × 10-3).Conclusion:One-third of the hypothesized association between body fat and LVMI was mediated by BP and glucose in this population-based cohort. Leptin was also an important mediator. Visceral adipose tissue was not more closely related to LVMI than subcutaneous abdominal fat. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The electrochemically modified electrodes were investigated at positive potential regions in alkaline solution. Nickel-based electrode cycled in KOH was NiOOH in the oxidized form and Ni(OH)2 in the reduced form. Compositional, structural and morphological studies of the electrodes were characterized by means of FTIR, XRD and SEM, respectively. The porous NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 electrode with KOH electrolyte can provide a high electrode/electrolyte interface for fast charge transfer reactions. The charge storage mechanism was the mixed surface-controlled and diffusional-controlled processes. The as-prepared binder-free nickel-based electrode illustrates a high specific capacity of 986 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. The cycling stability test gave 86% of initial capacity retained after 550 cycles.

These challenges have prompted research on natural processes for wastewater treatment, such as constructed wetlands (CWs), providing low-energy treatment potential and storage capacity. As the performance of natural treatment processes may be limited by several factors (e.g. climatic conditions, space restrictions), considerable research concentrates on investigating their combination with engineered pre-or post-treatment processes to improve their performance and increase their treatment resilience. The aim of this paper is to assess and demonstrate the advantages of combined natural and engineered systems (cNES) over purely engineered treatment systems with regard to energy savings and reduced environmental impacts. The case of a cNES located in the island of Antiparos in Greece for the treatment and reuse of municipal effluents is investigated, focusing on the energy savings and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the natural treatment process. The performance of the system, which involves CWs for the secondary treatment of effluents, was assessed using an integrated modelling and simulation environment (baseline scenario). An alternative scenario was also built, substituting the CWs with a conventional activated sludge (CAS) process for the secondary treatment of effluents to achieve the same effluent quality as in the baseline scenario. Energy consumption and generation of GHG emissions was assessed for both scenarios, and a comparison between the two systems was conducted, highlighting the significant energy savings and the reduced GHG emissions produced by the cNES: the CAS system consumed about 3,000 times more energy, producing about 50 times more total GHG emissions compared with CWs. The results of the current analysis demonstrated that cNES involving CWs can provide a competitive alternative to purely engineered systems for wastewater treatment and reuse in isolated insular communities and small municipalities, also contributing to water scarcity reduction. © 2019 Desalination Publications.

The recycled and vanadium-doped samples having different V2O5 compositions (x = 0, 1, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 20%) were characterized by the analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM, and spectroscopic investigations: IR, Raman, UV-Vis, PL, and EPR. The electrochemical characterizations of the recycled and vanadium-doped materials as anodic electrodes in a lead acid battery are performed by cyclic voltammetry measurements. The results of this study indicate that the V2O5 addition in the suitable proportion at recycled lead exerts a positive effect on the hydrogen gas evolutions, the passivation phenomena and electrochemical processes of self-discharge, and charge and discharge in lead acid battery. This, in turn, has the most beneficial impact on the life cycle of car batteries. The excellent electrochemical performance of recovered lead material may be attributed to the presence of a PbO2 crystalline phase which can accommodate high amounts of hydrogen and the presence of vanadium ions which increase the residual current and the effective conductive area in the potential range of 0 and 2 V.

The epididymis of camel has a unique structure called the intraepithelial gland. The present work aimed to investigate the structure of the epididymal intraepithelial gland with special references to the seasonal variation. The samples were collected from the distal part of the corpus epididymes of completely healthy mature camels (Camelus dromedarius) in the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Tomato lectin-positive material had been demonstrated within the epididymal spermatozoa. Here, we provide the first transmission electron microscopic study for the intraepithelial gland of camel epididymis detecting the autophagy during the nonbreeding season. The autophagosomes originated from the endoplasmic reticulum, surrounding mitochondria, and located mainly next to the basement membrane. This location is probably valuable for subsequent passing of their contents into the interstitium for possible recycling. The histochemical and ultrastructural characteristics of the gland in the breeding season indicated a hyperactive secretory microenvironment enriched with the glycoprotein-producing machinery, which could be controlled by androgens. The present data suggest that the camel intraepithelial gland has a significant impact on the reproductive activity through their secretory microenvironment during the breeding season. Moreover, it recycles the unused organelles or proteins for reuse or to supply energy under stress conditions in the nonbreeding season.

The SRFC opens an opportunity for simultaneous electrochemical conversion and storage of solar energy in a single device. This work proposes a SRFC which integrates stable hematite (α-Fe2O3) photoanode with a near-neutral organic-inorganic RFB using organic and low-cost redox pair anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonate disodium (AQDS) on the negative side and iodide/iodine (I−/I2) redox couple on the positive side. The AQDS/iodide RFB exhibited a stable battery cycling with a cell voltage of ~0.8 V, a high coulombic efficiency of 99.2% and a peak power density of 0.22 W⋅cm−2. The hematite yielded a stable performance in contact with iodide/iodine solution with pH 5.5, despite known stability issues for pH &lt; 7. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to elucidate the main semiconductor/electrolyte charge transfer mechanisms and rates and energy level alignment of hematite with redox pair voltages. Finally, to photocharge the AQDS/iodide SRFC unbiasedly, a tandem system was used which includes hematite photoelectrode connected in series with a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The tandem photoelectrode provided 1.6 V of photovoltage that is sufficient to fully charge the RFB. © 2019","Anthraquinone; Dye-synthesized solar cell; Hematite; Solar redox flow cell; Tandem system","Aromatic compounds; Charge transfer; Charging (batteries); Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Flow batteries; Hematite; Ketones; Solar cells; Solar energy; Anthraquinone; Charge transfer mechanisms; Coulombic efficiency; Dye-synthesized solar cells; Electrochemical conversion; Energy level alignment; Redox flow cell; Tandem system; Dye-sensitized solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067255353

In order to replace fossil-based polymers, photoautotrophically produced polyhydroxybutryrates (PHBs), which are intracellular carbon storage products of nutrient-deprived microorganisms, seem to be a promising, biobased and biodegradable alternative. Although laboratory and pilot scale experiments have already been performed, no economic evaluation has been carried out so far. Consequently, valid claims on PHB production costs and the influence of different parameters, such as intracellular PHB-content, choice of cultivation system or location, cannot be made. In this study potential demonstration plants, equipped with different photoautotrophic cultivation systems and located at two sites, were designed to identify key parameters for a successful economic realization and implementation. Material and energy balances were determined to reveal specific PHB production costs for four different scenarios. Raw material and operating supply costs, expenditures for plant construction and operation as well as product amounts were determined using literature data for specified results from laboratory and pilot scale experiments. The lowest calculated PHB production price (24 € kg−1) accomplished in a thin-layer-system plant located in Southern Europe with 60% PHB-content of the produced biomass is significantly higher than the current market price of heterotrophically produced PHB. The most important cost factors in all scenarios are cultivation and harvesting costs accounting for 62 to 72% of the total specific production costs, followed by maintenance costs with a cost share of 11 to 14%. Therefore, the choice of a suitable cultivation system is the key driving factor for an economic PHB-production due to the currently high investment costs for photosynthetic biomass production systems. Specific production costs for a Southern compared to a Central European location amount to almost half of the costs. © 2019","Economic evaluation; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Thin-layer system; Tubular photobioreactor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067249635

However, the description of the thermal behaviour of green roofs is very complex since it depends on several variables and relies on intricate phenomena. In this work the authors characterize a green roof system that replaces the conventional drainage and water storage polyethylene membranes with insulation cork boards (ICB). To enable the experimental characterization of this system, a double walk-in bioclimatic chamber was designed and built to recreate indoor and outdoor environmental conditions. Winter and summer environments with steady and unsteady conditions in both dry and wet states were simulated. Thermocouples and heat flux sensors were used to collect data over time from the different layers of the green roof prototypes. Measurements were first performed on a concrete slab insulated with ICB to assess the contribution of the latter to the thermal performance of the system. The effect on the heat transfer was further evaluated for systems of increasing complexity, containing first a substrate layer and then vegetation. It was noted that the substrate and vegetation layers improved the thermal insulation, and reduced heat fluxes and the thermal amplitude within the system. The vegetation layer was found to be of key importance to the overall performance of the green roof.

The method is based on a simulation model that characterizes the PV system including peripheral components like the inverter and the battery. The required input data to carry out the calculations is gathered from simulated household loads, characteristics of system components and measured radiation values. Sizing the grid-connected PV storage system is performed based on technical parameters only, without economic evaluation. The results show significant differences in the ideal system configuration depending on the household types ranging from a PV to battery ratio of 0.76–4.25 kWpeak/kWh. This suggests, that the household type needs to be considered before installing a PV storage system in order to ensure optimal results for the customer and the energy system. After the technical sizing, the results are compared to economic design optima, in order to investigate existing differences. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Households; PV storage system; Sizing battery; Sizing PV; User-Groups","Digital storage; Electric batteries; Households; Sizing battery; Sizing PV; Storage systems; User groups; Silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066938338

This work reports a single-step, simple, fast and inexpensive method for in situ synthesis and deposition of crystalline luminescent Tb2(BDC)3 (Tb = terbium) (BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) MOF films using ultrasonic spray deposition on top of several types of substrates including glass slides, metal oxides films, filter paper, and polyimide sheets. The glass supported films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), profilometry, infrared (IR), and luminescence spectroscopies. As expected, the emission spectra present high-intensity characteristic emission bands of the sensitized terbium luminescence for all the films. Nevertheless, the temperature of the substrate, during deposition, plays a crucial role in the final structural and morphological characteristics of the MOFs, which in turn, dramatically modifies the excitation features. The MOF-film synthesis/deposition method here reported can be extended to other MOF structures and substrates. © 2019","In-situ assembly; Luminescence; MOF films; Ultrasonic spray deposition","Crystalline materials; Deposits; Emission spectroscopy; Energy harvesting; Glass; Organometallics; Scanning electron microscopy; Solar energy; Substrates; Terbium; Characteristic emission; Emission spectrums; In-situ synthesis; Luminescence spectroscopy; Metal organic framework; Morphological characteristic; Situ assembly; Ultrasonic spray deposition; Luminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064966714

Increasing and threatening environmental pollution problems and reduction in limited fuel sources are motivating either industries and academicians to develop alternative power systems to sustain more healthier and economical life in the long term. One innovation that has been researched in the automotive industry is all electric and hybrid electric propulsion concepts. These concepts have also been proposed as alternative solutions for aviation. These novel propulsion technologies are composed of a gas turbine/internal combustion engine structure (necessary for hybrid electric and turboelectric propulsion systems) and/or energy storage components (battery, fuel cell and so on.) with multiple electric motors respectively. In this paper, simulation of a high fidelity turboshaft engine-alternator model for turboelectric propulsion system is derived. To develop an aero-thermal engine model, GE T700 turboshaft engine data is used and constructed model is connected to an alternator model on MATLAB/Simulink environment. Open-loop simulations are carried out and satisfactory results are obtained.Simulation results are compared to the real engine design point data. Results show that there are acceptable differences between the simulation results and the real engine data. The power balances between compressor-high pressure turbine and power turbine-alternator are proven in the mathematical model. It is expected that the proposed model can be easily extended to power system design and power management studies in turboelectric propulsion systems and also in other suitable novel propulsion systems. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","alternator; turboelectric propulsion system; turboshaft engine aero-thermal model","Aerospace industry; Automotive industry; Combustion; Digital storage; Fuel cells; Gas fuel storage; Gas turbines; Jet engines; Machine design; MATLAB; Sustainable development; Synchronous generators; Systems analysis; alternator; Design and application; Energy storage components; Environmental pollution problem; High pressure turbine; MATLAB/Simulink environment; Propulsion system; Thermal model; Propulsion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060817868

Embedded memories, often implemented with six-transistor static random access memory (SRAM) cells, serve as a key component in many of these systems. However, conventional SRAM cells are prone to side-channel PA attacks due to the correlation between their current characteristics and written data. To provide resiliency to these types of attacks, we propose a security-oriented 7T SRAM cell, which incorporates an additional transistor to the original 6T SRAM implementation and a two-phase write operation, which significantly reduces the correlation between the stored data and the power consumption during write operations. The proposed 7T SRAM cell was implemented in a 28 nm technology and demonstrates over 1000 × lower write energy standard deviation between write '1' and '0' operations compared to a conventional 6T SRAM. In addition, the proposed cell has a 39%-53% write energy reduction and a 19%-38% reduced write delay compared to other PA resistant SRAM cells. © 2018 IEEE.","differential power analysis (DPA); side-channel attacks (SCA); Static random access memory (SRAM)","Cells; Correlation methods; Cytology; Electric power utilization; Embedded systems; Energy dissipation; Side channel attack; Transistors; Arrays; Differential power Analysis; Power demands; SRAM Cell; Static random access memory; Static random access storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058630703

Nevertheless, they are still an undeniably fascinating class of compounds, both from the fundamental point of view and as promising task-specific materials. For instance, reliable thermal property data seem to be significantly lacking for pure ionic liquids. In addition, to assess the application potential of any material or process, a reliable analysis of experimental data is of key importance, not only to obtain recommended data, but also to be able to identify patterns in structure–property relationships, even if those may not seem evident at first sight. The aim of this work is to assess the potential application of a series of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium saccharinate ionic liquids (alkyl standing for butyl, hexyl, octyl, and decyl) in thermal energy storage. To this end, heat capacity and energy density were determined experimentally by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and oscillating-tube densitometry. The experimental data were then analyzed by means of advanced data analysis methods based on mathematical gnostics. Based on the thermodynamic data and theory of measurement, mathematical gnostics is a novel non-statistical approach towards data uncertainty.

Currently, there are a range of organic molecules as candidates for the negative side of the RFB: e.g., anthraquinones and alloxazines. However, for the positive side there are no obvious organic molecules mainly because of stability that is too low and to a lesser extent a low standard potential. Currently, a stable performance has been achieved only with inorganic or organo-inorganic species at the positive side: e.g., bromine, ferricyanide, and water-soluble derivatives of ferrocene. Previous attempts to utilize hydroquinones at the positive side, such as 4,5-dibenzoquinone-1,3-benzenedisulfonate, or water-soluble derivations of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy resulted in unstable battery performance. On the basis of the available literature it appears as if unsubstituted and partially unsubstituted hydroquinones are not stable in water. For this reason a new fully substituted hydroquinone was specifically designed and examined for the positive side of the organic RFB in a symmetric RFB setup. It has four fully protonated morpholino groups, a solubility of 2 M (107 Ah/L) in water, and a formal redox potential of 0.89 VNHE; however, its performance is highly dependent on the pH and the electrolyte composition. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","all-organic battery; catholyte; high water solubility; hydroquinone; organic redox species; redox flow battery","Electrolytes; Iron compounds; Ketones; Molecules; Organometallics; Phenols; Redox reactions; Solubility; all-organic battery; catholyte; High water; hydroquinone; Organic redoxes; Flow batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070558977

The increase in its energy and electricity demand is attributed to the growth of population, urbanization, and industrialization parallel to economic and social growth. Instead of fulfilling the obligation to protect the environment arising from international agreements and achieving desired sustainable development, the dependency on imported fossil fuel in electrical energy production and energy-intensive economic growth results in intensified CO 2 emission as well as ironically negative economic output. Therefore, Turkey is forced to exploit its indigenous sources such as coal (which unfortunately increases atmospheric Green House Gas “GHG” emissions) and renewable resources. However, high GHG emission–mainly CO 2 – of Turkey’s coal power plants impairs deployment of indigenous sources for power generation. Indeed, there is a necessity of technical approaches for higher heat extraction efficiencies and mitigation of high concentration of energy-related CO 2 emission. Admittedly, “Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)” employing conventional hydrothermal resources offers highly efficient heat extraction, geological CO 2 sequestration, and utilization of CO 2 for power generation rather than considering CO 2 as an effluent. Although there are research gaps and lack of field scale experiment, the economic and environmental viability of implementing CCUS in Turkey can be improved by pilot or field scale projects whereby the presence of these projects commences technological and experimental advances in capturing CO 2 either from geothermal power plants or indigenous coal power plants, transporting it to the proven geothermal geologic site, and generating power. Apart from this, the “CO 2 – Plume Geothermal Systems (CPG)” compared to unconventional and conventional geothermal systems would commit vigorous potential for continual improvement in economic feasibility of CCUS without a guaranteed return on power generation investments in Turkey. Hence, legislations concerning incentives in CCUS would foster further improvements in the deployment of geothermal resources to pursue sustainable development in Turkey. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","CCUS; CPG; electricity generation in Turkey; Sustainable development of Turkey; Turkey’s geothermal potential",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062669611

Sulfur is a by-product from sour gas and crude oil processing and the precursor of sulfuric acid. As an oversupply is projected for the near-term future, it is prudent to investigate new sulfur applications and market domains that may facilitate a balancing of supply and demand. This consideration is especially relevant for the UAE, and the Middle East in general, due to the requirement to develop sulfur-rich sour gas resources to meet increasing energy needs. The goal of this review is to understand current sulfur oversupply, not as a problem, but as an opportunity to develop more sustainable technologies. Current routes are reviewed, and possible new applications and their potential as a sulfur sink and a sustainable alternative to existing technologies are discussed. Although sulfur is currently in oversupply, less than 5% positive balance according to Harrisson (2016), it must be noted that it is also a critical component in fertilizer production, having a direct impact on the food supply for the world's growing population. Should the world find itself in a sulfur shortage in the future (which could be possible in the long-term (beyond 2030) as a result of growth in renewable energies, shale gas/oil proliferation and population growth), this would be a much greater problem than the current slight oversupply situation, thus making it important to consider sulfur recoverability as a key factor for any sulfur sink technologies explored. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","By-product management; Oversupply; Sulfur; Sulfur sustainable technologies; Sulfur utilization; Sulfuric acid","Economics; Energy resources; Food supply; Gas industry; Oils and fats; Petroleum deposits; Population statistics; Sour gas; Sulfuric acid; Critical component; Fertilizer production; Oil and Gas Industry; Oversupply; Product management; Renewable energies; State-of-the art reviews; Sustainable technology; Sulfur; fertilizer; polymer; sulfur; sulfuric acid; natural gas; byproduct; gas industry; oil industry; recycling; sulfur; sulfuric acid; sustainable development; waste management; catering service; heat transfer; liquid; oil industry; population growth; priority journal; renewable energy; Review; storage; technology; United Arab Emirates; industry; Middle East; United Arab Emirates; Industry; Middle East; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Industry; Sulfur",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066957422

The aim of this paper is to analyze the performance of DHW production in commercial public service, i.e., educational buildings, to subsequently identify frequent inherent shortcomings of centralised DHW installations and to provide measures for optimization or economically more viable solutions. Several buildings of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna have been investigated in terms of DHW consumption and performance of the installed centralised systems. Referring to the investigated university buildings, it can be stated, that in cases of low to medium consumption figures, typical centralized DHW installations with a hot water circulation pipework achieve only poor efficiencies in the range of 2–12%. As for one particular centralized DHW system in operation, focusing on demand controlled DHW supply through adapted flow control, e.g., reducing the runtime of the circulating pumps at specific time intervals, and, if applicable and feasible, decreasing hot water flow- and storage capacities can reduce annual energy consumption for DHW by 15–25% and improve the overall system efficiency significantly as could be evaluated in a detailed case study. A seemingly economical yet ecologically controversial option for improving centralised DHW systems is the partial or complete conversion to electric point-of-use water heaters. This reduces thermal energy losses almost completely, hereby significantly increasing the efficiency of a DHW supply system. Nevertheless, existing hot water supply systems, energized by district heating, usually consume less primary energy and most likely generate fewer CO2 emissions compared to electric DHW heaters. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Centralized circulation system; DHW Energy Efficiency; District heating; Domestic Hot Water (DHW)supply; Electric water heaters; Emission factors; Energy use; Office building; Thermal energy losses","College buildings; District heating; Electric losses; Energy utilization; Flow of water; Hot water distribution systems; Office buildings; Thermal energy; Water heaters; Water supply; Circulation systems; Domestic hot water; Electric water heaters; Emission factors; Energy use; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065193525

These series of nanoparticles are effectively synthesized using the co-precipitation method. The cubic spinel aluminate structure is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic measurements. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis shows the formation of spherical nanoparticles, which are homogeneous in shape and size. The optical properties of the prepared samples have been investigated by means of optical absorbance spectra. The optical band gap Eopti and Urbach energy Eu are estimated. At room temperature, the magnetization of undoped CoAl2O4 reveals a weak ferromagnetic behavior. This ferromagnetism is increased for the sample with x = 0.05, and the samples with higher Cr3+ content have a tendency to be superparamagnetic on account of the formation of single-domain particles as a consequence of small particle size. Real part of dielectric constant (ε′), dielectric loss (tanδ), ac conductivity (σac), real part of impedance (Z′), and imaginary part of impedance (Z″) are analyzed as a function of frequency and Cr3+ content. The results show that the dielectric loss (tanδ), dielectric permittivity (ε′), and ac conductivity (σac) decrease with the increase in Cr3+ content, x = 0.05, and then increase with a further increase in Cr3+ content. The increase in these parameters has been explained on the basis of the hopping mechanism. From the Cole–Cole diagram, the value of the relaxation time τ can be calculated and it has been found to increase with increasing the Cr3+ content.

The SnO2 nanowires have diameters of 50 nm, lengths up to 100 μm, and a tetragonal rutile crystal structure, but they do not contain Pb because of its significant depletion during the temperature ramp and re-evaporation from the surface of the SnO2 nanowires. Consequently, we do not observe a semiconductor to semimetal transition and band gap narrowing. Instead, the Pb reacts with O2, leading to the deposition of PbO directly on Si but not on the SnO2 nanowires, which have carrier densities of ≈1016 cm-3. Furthermore, one-dimensional growth was completely suppressed by increasing the amount of Pb in Sn. As such, Pb doping of SnO2 and the growth of PbxSn1-xO2 nanowires is difficult, if not impossible, because PbO2 nanowires cannot be grown by the vapor-liquid-solid mechanism irrespective of the growth temperature.

Firstly, the Latin hypercube sampling is combined with Cholesky decomposition method to generate different WP scenarios. The simulated scenarios are then reduced using the fast forward selection algorithm.

Ethylene concentrations up to 1000 μL L−1 were applied to dark green ‘Konservolia’ olives harvested shortly before the green maturation and exposed to 20 °C for up to 9 d. Surprisingly, the results indicated a tendency to fruit firmness increases in concentration-dependent manner in a non-climacteric fruit. The highest concentration increased the firmness within 12 h by approximately 1.35-fold, but transiently for approximately up to 5 d; all ethylene inhibitors tested, either of synthesis (ethoxyvinyl glycine or AVG), or perception (1 -methyl-cyclopropene or 1-MCP, and silver nitrate) prevented the firmness increase. Texture was evaluated by firmness and changes in lignin, cellulose (CL), total pectins (TPC), water soluble pectins (WSP) and total non-cellulosic sugars (total sugars) concentrations, and in pectin esterification degree (DE) in the alcohol insoluble residue (AIR) of ‘Konservolia’ fruit pericarp during 1.5-d, 5-d and 10-d treatments with 1000 μL L-1 ethylene at 20 °C. Pectins in AIR were also extracted sequentially with cyclohexane-trans-1,2-diaminetetra-acetate (CDTA), Na2CO3, 1 M and 4 M KOH. The results showed that on day 1.5, the increased firmness was consistent with increased CL (crystalline formation, as observed by microscopy), total sugars and DE levels, but reduced WSP, whereas softening reversed the changes and lowered TPC and CDTA-soluble pectins in all fruit on day 10. However, on day 5 ethylene-treated olives exhibited a transitional phase during softening, characterized by retention of high TPC concentration and energy demand, as indicated by elevated respiration rates. The inhibitor 1-MCP, applied before ethylene, did inhibit the responses to ethylene treatment. Ethylene firming effect and the respective cell wall changes in olives are demonstrated for first time. The experiments could be used for research on perception and transcription responses to ethylene in olive, a non-climacteric fruit.

To better understand combined effects of multiple stressors, bioenergetic responses are important as these inform about the balance between energy input and consumption, and provide a unifying mechanism to integrate the impact of multiple stressors with different modes of action. We studied in Enallagma cyathigerum damselfly larvae the single and combined effects of exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos and predation risk on life history (survival and growth rate)and bioenergetic response variables at the organismal level (assimilation and conversion efficiency)and the cellular level (cellular energy allocation CEA, energy storage Ea, and energy consumption Ec). Chlorpyrifos exposure almost halved the survival of the damselfly larvae, while predation risk had no effect on survival. Both exposure to the pesticide and to predation risk reduced larval growth rates. This was caused by a reduced conversion efficiency under chlorpyrifos exposure, and by a reduced assimilation efficiency under predation risk. Both chlorpyrifos and predation risk reduced the CEA because of a decreased Ea, and for chlorpyrifos also an increased Ec. The lower Ea was driven by reductions in the fat and glycogen contents. Effects of the pesticide and predation risk were consistently additive and for most variables the strongest response was detected when both stressors were present. The absence of any synergisms may be explained by the high mortality and hypometabolism caused by the pesticide. Our results indicate that CEA can be a sensitive biomarker to evaluate effects of not only contaminants but also natural stressors, such as predation risk, and their combined impact on organisms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Digestive physiology; Energy budgets; Multiple stressors; Organophosphates; Predation stress; Stressor interactions","chlorpyrifos; chlorpyrifos; pesticide; chlorpyrifos; damselfly; energy budget; insect; organophosphate; physiology; pollution effect; pollution exposure; predation risk; risk assessment; animal experiment; Article; bioenergy; cell energy; controlled study; damselfly; Enallagma cyathigerum; energy consumption; environmental exposure; growth rate; insect larva; larval development; nonhuman; predation risk; priority journal; survival rate; animal; drug effect; energy metabolism; escape behavior; larva; Odonata; toxicity; water pollutant; Enallagma cyathigerum; Hexapoda; Zygoptera; Animals; Chlorpyrifos; Energy Metabolism; Escape Reaction; Larva; Odonata; Pesticides; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066067800

However, production is currently impeded by the negative effects of reservoir compaction, i.e. induced seismicity and surface subsidence. Fluid injection into producing or depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs is one of the strategies to mitigate compaction, though it may introduce other negative consequences. This study aims to identify lessons and potential knowledge gaps on the causes and mechanisms of consequences of such injection operations. An overview of the environmental and geological hazards and risks is developed by examining literature on four commonly injected fluids, i.e. CO2, methane, nitrogen and wastewater. The well-recognised hazards are leakage, reservoir deformation and induced seismicity, which have consequences for several environmental receptors, e.g. the atmosphere, surface sediments and water, subsurface resources and groundwater. Generally, in defining the risk, there is a consensus on the probability of hazards occurrence, while a lack of knowledge on the hazard impacts exists. The assessment approaches analysis also indicates that consequence magnitude evaluations and comparisons to thresholds are often missing from the risk assessments. For all examined injection fluids, knowledge on hazard occurrence, hazard exposure and receptor affectability is insufficient. Furthermore, in complex subsurface systems with high uncertainty, more insight in the probability of multiple hazards occurrence and the corresponding cumulative risks is needed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 geological storage; Environmental impacts and risks; Fluid injection; Geo-energy exploitation; Risk assessment","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; environmental impact; environmental risk; fluid injection; hydrocarbon reservoir; risk assessment; sustainability; underground storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065923839

These intermediate phases are called “rotator phases” or “plastic phases” (soft solids) because the incorporated alkane molecules possess a long-range positional order while preserving certain mobility to rotate, which results in complex visco-plastic rheological behaviour. The current article presents a brief overview of our current understanding of the main phenomena involved in the formation of rotator phases from single alkanes and their mixtures. In bulk, five rotator phases with different structures were identified and studied in detail. Along with the thermodynamically stable rotator phases, metastable and transient (short living) rotator phases were observed. Bulk rotator phases provided important information about several interfacial phenomena of high scientific interest, such as the energy of crystal nucleation, entropy and enthalpy of alkane freezing, interfacial energy between a crystal and its melt, etc. In alkane mixtures, the region of existence of rotator phases increases significantly, reflecting the disturbed packing of different molecules. All these phenomena are very important in the context of alkane applications as lubricants, in cosmetics, as phase-change materials for energy storage, etc. Significant expansion of the domain of rotator phases was observed also in confinements – in the pores of solid materials impregnated with alkanes, in polymeric microcapsules containing alkanes, and in micrometer sized emulsion droplets. The rotator phases were invoked to explain the mechanisms of two recently discovered phenomena in cooled alkane-in-water emulsions – the spontaneous “self-shaping” and the spontaneous “self-bursting” (fragmentation) of emulsion drops. The so-called “α-phases” formed by fatty acids and alcohols, and the “gel phase” formed in phospholipid and soap systems exhibit structural characteristics similar to those in the alkane rotator phases. The subtle connections between all these diverse systems are outlined, providing a unified outlook of the main phenomena related to the formation of such soft solid materials. The occurrence of alkane rotator phases in natural materials and in several technological applications is also reviewed to illustrate the general importance of these unique materials and the related phenomena. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Phase transition; Plastic phase; Rotator phase; Self-shaping drops; Super-hydrophobicity; Surface freezing","Drops; Emulsification; Emulsions; Fatty acids; Freezing; Hydrophobicity; Lubricants; Metastable phases; Mixtures; Molecules; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Phospholipids; Entropy and enthalpies; Plastic phase; Rotator phase; Structural characteristics; Superhydrophobicity; Surface freezing; Technological applications; Thermodynamically stable; Phase transitions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064913423

However, the efficiency of standalone, low-temperature electrolysis-based power-to-methane (PtM) processes is presently limited. As a way of enhancing the potential of this technology to support the decarbonization of energy systems, this study investigates a high-temperature electrolysis-based PtM process and its integration with oxyfuel combustion to co-generate synthetic methane, heat and power. The system incorporates in-situ heat, oxygen, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water recycling. The energy and exergy-based performance of the compound system and its main structures are investigated using an overpotential-based electrochemical model. Depending on electrolysis operating temperature (800–1000 °C) and pressure (1–10 bar), overall energy and exergy efficiencies range from 75.8% to 79.3% and 64.5% to 67.4%, respectively. In quasi-continuous operation, a 6.4 MWe (AC input) hybrid PtM system would avoid approximately 1.9 GWhe of electricity consumption for oxygen-air separation, and sink 6.6 kt of CO2 from the oxyfuel co-generation plant annually. In parallel, 3.1 MWth of heat could be recovered from the pre-methanation compressor and oxyfuel conversion products for use in external applications. Based on a carbon balance evaluation from initial resource extraction to SNG conversion, the PtM-oxyfuel hybridization investigated could effectively contribute to raise the electricity greenhouse gas (GHG) emission threshold below which SNG could environmentally compete with natural gas, relative to low-temperature electrolysis-based PtM and conventional post-combustion CO2 capture. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon balance; Methanation; Oxycombustion; Power-to-gas; Solid oxide electrolysis; Synthetic natural gas","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Electric energy storage; Electrolysis; Exergy; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Natural gasoline plants; Platinum compounds; Synthetic fuels; Temperature; Water recycling; Carbon balance; Carbon dioxide utilization; Energy and exergy efficiency; High temperature electrolysis; Low-temperature electrolysis; Oxy combustions; Solid oxide; Synthetic natural gas; Gas fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064266881

The continuous GHGs emissions may lead to severe and irreversible consequences in the climate system. The reduction of GHG emissions may be not enough to mitigate climate change. Consequently, besides carbon capture from large emission sources, atmospheric CO 2 capture may be also required. To meet the target defined for climate change mitigation, the removal of 10 Gt·yr −1 of CO 2 globally by mid-century and 20 Gt·yr −1 of CO 2 globally by the end of century.

This paper aims to present the recent research works regarding NETs, focusing the research findings achieved by academic groups and projects. Besides several advantages, NETs present high operational cost and its scale-up should be tested to know the real effect on climate change mitigation. With current knowledge, no single process should be seen as a solution.

European energy initiatives recognize the importance of blue energy and encourage its research and development. The offshore exploitation of hydrocarbons worldwide is entering the final phase, followed by the gradual decommissioning of the production platforms and their removal. Decommissioning usually has an adverse effect on the environment aside from its economic intensity. By proper planning, lifetime of existing offshore infrastructure can be extended as it can be used for blue energy or other activities related to the blue economy. The paper deals with preliminary assessment of natural gas offshore infrastructure applicability for various blue energy options such as the wind power for electricity generation along with hydrogen, methane or ammonia production and other uses to reduce waste, energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Methods used included data gathering from 19 offshore gas facilities including assessment of natural gas production on current offshore fields, reserves and technology use, wind potential and decommissioning. Review of potential for energy production, storage and other activities such as CCS and CCU have also been given. Preliminary results show that there are possibilities for feasible and environmentally friendly blue energy utilisation. Average calculated capacity factors for the wind turbines are at the 32%. To investigate economic feasibility of decommission delay, detailed data gathering of wind potential should be done at specific heights along with load capacity of the gas platforms. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Blue energy; Decommissioning; Hydrocarbon reserves depletion; Hydrogen synthesis; Offshore gas production; Offshore wind; Production platform","Ammonia; Decommissioning (nuclear reactors); Digital storage; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Hydrocarbons; Natural gas; Natural gas fields; Natural gas well production; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Production platforms; Proven reserves; Wind power; Wind turbines; Blue energy; Electricity generation; Gas productions; Hydrocarbon reserves; Offshore infrastructure; Offshore winds; Preliminary assessment; Research and development; Reserves to production ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063625661

Continuous strides are made to explore new and better materials for this purpose. Herein, we report a new and effective strategy to improve the cell voltage and performance of Na-ion batteries where phosphide nanoclusters are doped with endohedral halides. Bare and halide doped boron and aluminum phosphides (BP and AlP) are studied for their applications as electrodes (anodes) in Na-ion batteries. The geometric and electrochemical properties of Na/Na + with both B 12 P 12 and Al 12 P 12 nanocages are investigated. The interaction energies (E int. ) and frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of Na/Na + ion with B 12 P 12 and Al 12 P 12 nanocages are studied to investigate the effect of neutral or ionic Na on the geometric and electrochemical properties. Bare AlP and BP offer cell voltages of 0.56 and 0.61 V, mainly due to small differences in the interaction energies of Na and Na + bound systems. The cell voltage is significantly improved by encapsulation of different halide ions into B 12 P 12 and Al 12 P 12 nanocages. Change in Gibbs free energy is significantly improved by the encapsulation of F − into B 12 P 12 and Al 12 P 12 among all considered halides, which results in increase in cell voltage up to 4.5 and 3.5 V for endo-F@B 12 P 12 and endo-F@Al 12 P 12 , respectively. This value is higher as compare to cell voltage estimated for carbon nanotubes, functionalized BN nanosheets and B40 fullerenes. The cell voltage of 4.5 V is the highest for any such system. The results here are helpful in designing new materials with even better energy storage density. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cell voltage; Halide encapsulation; High energy density; Na-ion battery","Electrochemical properties; Electrodes; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; III-V semiconductors; Ions; Molecular orbitals; Nanoclusters; Phosphorus compounds; Sodium compounds; Sodium-ion batteries; Yarn; Aluminum phosphides; Cell voltages; Energy storage density; Frontier molecular orbitals; High energy densities; High energy density materials; Interaction energies; Na-ion batteries; Aluminum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063057356

To date, the majority of systems studied by DNP were insulating materials including organic and inorganic solids. However, many technologically-relevant materials used in energy conversion and storage systems are electrically conductive to some extent or are employed as composites containing conductive additives. Such materials introduce challenges in their study by DNP-NMR which include microwave absorption and sample heating that were not thoroughly investigated so far. Here we examine several commercial carbon allotropes, commonly employed as electrodes or conductive additives, and consider their effect on the extent of solvent polarization achieved in DNP from nitroxide biradicals. We then address the effect of sample conductivity systematically by studying a series of carbons with increasing electrical conductivity prepared via glucose carbonization. THz spectroscopy measurements are used to determine the extent of μw absorption. Our results show that while the DNP performance significantly drops in samples containing the highly conductive carbons, sufficient signal enhancement can still be achieved with some compromise on conductivity. Furthermore, we show that the deleterious effect of conductive additives on DNP enhancements can be partially overcome through pulse-DNP experiments. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon; Electrical conductivity; MAS-DNP; Pulse DNP; Solid state NMR; THz spectroscopy; μw absorption; μw heating","Additives; Carbon; Carbonization; Conductive materials; Electric conductivity; Energy conversion; Excitons; Light polarization; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Spin polarization; Electrical conductivity; MAS-DNP; Pulse DNP; Solid state NMR; Thz spectroscopy; Terahertz spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062207468

In this paper, a novel real-time monitoring operation model of a microgrid is suggested, where the overall cost is mathematically modeled and included in the proposed model. The operation is achieved by assigning switching procedures of the generation sources situated within the microgrid. A continuous mathematical model is proposed for the cost function of the microgrid containing conventional fuel power plants, wind and solar renewable power generation, and battery storage systems. The inclusion of imported power from neighboring microgrids is implied in the mathematical model as well as the exported power to those grids. The mathematical model needs to be discretized in order to imply the separate time slots of the day in the model; hence the introduction of the discretized model is imperative. A simulation test case is carried on the MATLAB software platform and the simulation results are illustrated taking into consideration different practical cases of wind speed, solar irradiance, and batteries state of charge. The studied system is designed to provide electric power for a highly fluctuating load, which is a steel factory located in Jordan. The simulation test runs indicate the importance of energy storage to increase the penetration of renewable power sources in the microgrids. © 2019","Modelling; Real-time monitoring; Smart grid","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Cost functions; Electric power transmission networks; Fuel storage; MATLAB; Models; Secondary batteries; Simulation platform; Software testing; Wind; Battery storage system; Discretized models; Fluctuating loads; Real time monitoring; Real-time operation; Renewable power generation; Smart grid; Switching procedures; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061605575

In order to do so, we propose a new framework to study the dynamics of dc grids - one that permits the combination of power converter models with those impedances - directly in higher-order terms. This mathematical setting includes a convenient modeling specification that allows one to analyze complex high-gain converter topologies and to develop an energy-based stability analysis for dc grids with potential destabilizers such as loads with negative impedance characteristics (e.g., constant power loads). We show that instability problems arise due to a power imbalance between passive and non-passive loads, hence power balancing is a suitable stabilizing mechanism. Moreover, a low-cost hardware solution that ensures stability is provided in the form of a lossless (H-bridge) stabilizing filter. The new theoretical results, combined with the proposed implementation, offer a low-cost alternative with respect to other (battery/super-capacitor) energy-storage-based existing strategies.

As a contribution to the development of flexible, reliable, and affordable measurement systems for such sea trials, this paper presents and evaluates a portable data acquisition system. The system offers a cheap and flexible option for when and where signal infrastructure at site is not available. It is battery powered and consists of a sensor system and a logger unit. The sensor system is placed inside the object of study, which for this application is a wave power generator standing on the seafloor. The logger unit, which contains a logger with integrated data storage and a battery, is placed outside the object of study in a submersible and retrievable vessel. Sensor output is carried with 4-20-mA current signals between the sensor system and the logger, which makes the system directly compatible with a wide range of industrial sensors. For the specific setup implemented in this paper, the sensor system was used to measure voltage and current inside the generator. Beyond this, the system is designed to be adaptable for a wider range of sensors, with 16 individual signals and a sampling frequency up to 1 kHz. The custom logger is programmable and offers many options to apply different logging schedules and to limit the sensor system power supply accordingly. Evaluations show that the implemented system offers 5-22 weeks of 1-kHz and 16-b monitoring of 16 signals, depending on a chosen logging schedule. Suggestions are also given for how to raise the operation time up to 50 weeks. The system has been tested offshore for the collection of power production data from two wave energy converters, with good results. © 1976-2012 IEEE.","Data acquisition; logger; ocean energy; offshore measurements; wave power","Data acquisition; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Hydroelectric generators; Wave power; Full-scale sea trials; logger; Measurement system; Ocean energy; Offshore applications; Offshore measurements; Portable data acquisition systems; Sampling frequencies; Wave energy conversion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049145582

Since the power system is stepping towards the smart grid system and the use of WSNs provides numerous advantages in terms of economical, reliable and safer transmission of controlling and monitoring signals, with their low cost and easy deployment. This research proposes a new architecture for efficient monitoring, control and proper energy management of smart grid system. The architecture is evolved by taking into account the SCADA system in-conjunction with WSNs as sensor nodes. The data transmission is done though wireless link based on IEEE 802.15.4 security protocol. The WSNs are arranged in multi-hop mesh network for efficient data transmission between sensor and coordinating nodes. A new economical model based on Wireless Switch-yard System is used for integrating RES. Three different scenarios are considered, i.e., with RES, without RES and with both, RES and main grid supply for proper energy management and control strategy. A total of 10.5 kW is connected as smart home load to smart grid system. The State of Charge of battery storage system varies for maintaining the constant DC link voltage at 100 V.

A 1-km2 heliostat field is considered to concentrate the solar light onto a spectrum splitter, where the light spectrum is separated into two portions as reflected and transmitted to be used as the energy source in the concentrated solar power (CSP) and concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) receivers, respectively. As such, CSP and CPV systems are integrated. Wind energy is proposed for generating electricity (146 MW) or thermal energy (138 MW) to compensate the energy need of the multigeneration system when there is insufficient solar energy. In addition, multiple commodities, 46 MW of electricity, 12 m3/h of desalted water, and 69 MW of cooling, are generated using the Rankine cycle and the rejected heat from its condenser. Further, the heat generated on CPV cells is recovered for efficient photovoltaic conversion and utilized in the space heating (34 MW) and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer (239 kg/h) for hydrogen production. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the overall system are calculated as 61.3% and 47.8%, respectively. The exergy destruction rates of the main components are presented to identify the potential improvements of the system. Finally, parametric studies are performed to analyze the effect of changing parameters on the exergy destruction rates, production rates, and efficiencies. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","concentrated solar energy; multigeneration; renewable energy; solar spectrum splitting; wind","Concentration (process); Exergy; Hydrogen production; Plasma diagnostics; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solar energy; Space heating; Thermography (temperature measurement); Wind; Wind power; Concentrated solar energy; Concentrated solar power; Energy and exergy efficiency; Multi generations; Photovoltaic conversion; Proton-exchange membrane; Renewable energies; Solar spectrum; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063293400

Samples of europium tellurium oxide, prepared through the employment of a Pechini sol-gel route and calcined at 400 and 900 °C, were characterized for selective physicochemical properties and comparatively evaluated as an electrocatalyst, photoelectrocatalyst, and photocharged electrocatalyst by employing, as a suitable case study, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. The sample calcined at 400 °C exhibited amorphous characteristics while the sample calcined at 900 °C proved to be Eu2TeO6. The evaluation was conducted in a modified electrochemical cell housing a lamp, with the material deposited onto a glassy carbon electrode support rather than on fluorine- or indium-doped tin oxide glass plates. With a band gap of 4.31 eV, Eu2TeO6 (calcined at 900 °C) exhibited improved OER activity upon continuous UV-light irradiation, with the unexpected result of sustained improved activity for up to 40 min subsequent to the termination of the UV irradiation. At 1.8 V (versus RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode), the photocurrent, after 150 min of irradiation, increased by 107% from 0.44 to 0.91 mA cm-2. Surprisingly, after 150 min of irradiation, the dark current was sustained at 0.86 mA cm-2 for 40 min (at which point measurement was terminated), which represents a sustained increase of 95% compared to the initial unirradiated sample. The phenomenon observed here could contribute toward an improved understanding of photocharging and ultimately to the exploitation of more efficient solar energy conversion and storage. © Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.","europium tellurium oxide; oxygen evolution reaction; Pechini sol-gel method; photocharging; photoelectrocatalyst","Calcination; Dielectric materials; Electrocatalysts; Energy conversion; Energy gap; Glass; Glass membrane electrodes; Indium compounds; Irradiation; Physicochemical properties; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Solar energy; Tellurium compounds; Tin oxides; Oxygen evolution reaction; Pechini; Photocharging; photoelectrocatalyst; Tellurium oxide; Europium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068060875

Redox properties of LnVO4:Eu3+ NPs have been studied in water solutions and lipid suspensions, which mimic a biological environment, at UV and X-ray irradiation and during storage at high temperatures (lipid autoxidation conditions). It was shown that under UV irradiation, NPs increase sufficiently the reactive oxygen species (ROS) amount in the water solutions and lipid suspensions because of NP photocatalytic properties. Energies of valence band (Ev) and conduction band (Ec) edges for LnVO4:Eu3+ NPs were calculated using Portier's empirical equations. Analysis of Ev and Ec values and redox potential for H2O/•OH and O2/O2•- reactions indicates that the generation of these ROS is thermodynamically favorable. For the first time, the ROS scavenging ability of LnVO4:Eu3+ NPs at X-ray irradiation and at high temperature storage has been observed. The mechanism of ROS scavenging has been discussed.

Levelized cost of utility is introduced for valuating the price of power, heat and water supply in an isolated community from Mexico. Besides, levels of subsidies and impacts of social, energy and economic policies are considered for defining the utility price for the end user. Levelized cost of electricity has been used as a common metric for determining the economic impact of implementing energy systems in off-grid systems. Normally, it is defined as a fixed cost associated to energy utilities. However, it is possible to define levelized cost of utilities associated to the design of multi-product systems. The proposed methodology allows determining the levelized cost of utilities using a flat-tariff scheme, as it is used in most of literature, and according to the demand-generation dynamics. For testing these ideas, it is presented the design of a water-energy off-grid system consisting of combined heat and power units fed by natural gas and biogas. The water-energy surplus management is performed using pumping and battery systems. The optimal design considers the size and selection of units according with objective functions as minimizing total annual cost and land usage as well as maximizing the social opportunity of community. The utility cost influence over operational policy is defined by partial load and storage levels of the units. For reaching a trade-off between objective functions, it is used a utopia-tracking approach. Results show the suitable level of subsidies as well as the advantages of implementing dynamic levelized cost of utilities according with the behavior of the water-energy supply system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CHP systems; Levelized cost of utility; Multi-objective optimization; Multi-product systems; Off-grid systems; Water-waste-energy nexus","Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Multiobjective optimization; Power generation; Product design; Water supply; CHP-systems; Levelized costs; Multi-product systems; Off-grid system; Water wastes; Costs; combined heat and power; cost analysis; demand analysis; economic impact; electricity; energy policy; integrated approach; natural gas; policy implementation; power generation; strategic approach; trade-off; water supply; Mexico [North America]; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064879101

A hydrogen-powered car is a promising solution, in which the safe and smooth operation of the car is strongly depended on how an in-tank valve of a fuel-storage-system performs. The present paper introduces the investigations and innovations of structures of the mentioned valve, whose designs can be subjected to fabricate by direct metal laser sintering. Two parts of the valve were taken into considerations, including the largest female-thread and the body. While the threads were investigated in the proposed conditions via fatigue-life assessment, the bodies were only assessed after being built from the concepts, developed by structural optimisations and lattice implementation. The achieved results showed that within the same pre-treated conditions, the optimised valves have considerably higher fatigue life, but lower masses, than those of the original. It was also observed that the applications of pre-treatment by autofrettage could contribute significantly to life prolongation of the valves as compared to the non-treated ones. In addition, those essential features, such as powder-release channels, which make the developed valves compatible with DMLS, were implemented into the valve-designs to be able to ensure their successful prints. Finally, the results suggested that the second innovated structure of the lattice-valve is the best candidate, which could be additively produced for the upcoming experimental-validation phase of the demonstrated works. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Automotive hydrogen valve; Direct metal laser sintering; Free-shape optimisation; Lattice implementation; Sustainable design; Topology optimisation","3D printers; Automobile bodies; Automotive industry; Ecodesign; Fossil fuels; Fuel tanks; Hydrogen storage; Laser heating; Sintering; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Direct metal laser sintering; Experimental validations; Fatigue life assessment; Hydrogen powered car; Lattice implementation; Shape optimisation; Structural optimisations; Topology optimisation; Fatigue of materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059512720

While having several dietary and economic benefits, their production and consumption also have many environmental impacts of various nature. In this study, a comprehensive review of studies that focus on the life cycle environmental impact analysis of dairy products has been conducted. A total of 31 studies that satisfy certain filtering criteria have been analysed, covering 6 different products and 17 different impacts. Cheese was observed as the most widely studied dairy product whereas global warming potential was the most commonly calculated impact, as it appeared in all 31 of the reviewed studies. The contributions of different stages (raw milk production, factory processes, storage and use, transportation, waste treatment) have been investigated. For many impacts, raw milk production was found to be the main contributor regardless of the product type. Fertiliser use, agricultural material production and use and on-site emissions were the main drivers associated with the raw milk production stage, leading to several impacts such as global warming potential, acidification and eutrophication. As far as the production processes are concerned, energy use emerged as the main cause of environmental footprint. Transportation, storage/use and waste treatment were found to have slightly significant to negligible contributions to almost all the impacts except for ozone layer depletion. Butter appeared as the dairy product with the highest environmental footprint, followed by cheese. The most common recommendations in order to reduce the environmental footprint of dairy products were as follows: using more energy-efficient equipment for production, optimising transportation routes and using more environmentally friendly vehicles, modifying the feed content for the farm animals, and using renewable energy sources. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Dairy industry; Energy use; Environmental footprint; Sustainability","Dairies; Dairy products; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Global warming; Ozone layer; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Transportation routes; Waste treatment; Dairy industry; Energy efficient equipment; Energy use; Environmental footprints; Environmental life cycle assessment; Environmentally friendly vehicles; Life-cycle environmental impact; Production and consumption; Life cycle",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061053888

Successful development of hydrogen economy means innumerable advantages for the environment, energy security, economy, and final users. One major key to wholly develop hydrogen economy is safe, compact, light and cost-efficient hydrogen storage. The conventional gaseous state storage system as pressurized hydrogen gas and liquid state storage system pose safety and cost problems to onboard applications; therefore, they do not satisfy the future goals for a hydrogen economy. Fortunately, solid-state storage systems based on metal hydrides have demonstrated great potentials to store hydrogen in large quantities in a quite secure, compact, and repeatedly reversible manner and thus, becoming increasingly attractive option for hydrogen applications. However, techno-economic feasibility of hydrogen storage systems is yet to be realized as none of the current metal hydrides fulfill all the essential criteria for a practical hydrogen economy, mainly because of low hydrogen storage capacity, sluggish kinetics and unacceptable temperatures of hydrogen absorption/desorption. This article gives a brief review of hydrogen as an ideal sustainable energy carrier for the future economy, its storage as the stumbling block as well as the current position of solid-state hydrogen storage in metal hydrides and makes a recommendation based on the most promising novel discoveries made in the field in recent times which suggests a prospective breakthrough towards a hydrogen economy. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Catalysis; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydrides; Nanoconfinement; Nanostructuring","Catalysis; Discovery wells; Energy security; Hydrides; Hydrogen fuels; Metals; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage capacities; Metal hydrides; Nano-structuring; Nanoconfinements; Solid state storage systems; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Techno-economic feasibility; Hydrogen storage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065012566

It is found that interfacial Co spin magnetic moment shows a strong interdependence on Co-O bond lengths and a reasonable spin-polarization of ∼80% is established as a function of Co layers. Our results revealed a saturated positive (out-of-plane) Ki of +2.80 mJ/m2 at ≥12 Co layers (∼1.6 nm Co thickness), which is associated with orbital magnetic moment difference in [100] and [001] direction along with a strong hybridization between dxy and dx2−y2 orbitals through orbital angular momentum operator Lzˆ. Furthermore, it is shown that the Ki magnitude almost remains constant and weakens in the case of under- and over-oxidations in the interfacial MgO and Co layers, respectively. Interestingly, Ki improved for oxygen migrated interface due to enhanced dxy and dx2−y2 orbitals coupling. The disordered interfaces stability is checked by analyzing the formation energy. Hence, the present findings disclose that the higher Co thickness in ordered Co/MgO structure supports to out-of-plane [001] (positive) Ki, which could be useful for its technological implementation in high-density magnetic data storage devices with high thermal stability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DFT; Magnetic anisotropy; Oxidation; Spin-polarization","Calculations; Cobalt; Magnesia; Magnetic moments; Magnetic storage; Oxidation; Oxide minerals; Spin polarization; Virtual storage; Disordered interfaces; Formation energies; High thermal stability; Magnetic anisotropy constant; Orbital angular momentum; Orbital magnetic moment; Oxidation state; Spin magnetic moments; Magnetic anisotropy",Retracted,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063412197

The processed data stream from the detector can be stored on a hard drive and also displayed online using graphical interface with capability to control several number of acquisitions and display measured data using variable modules. Moreover, due to the architecture it can be further extended using external libraries working independently on the software. The architecture of the acquisition package enables online processing and visualization and it is designed as cross-compatible software (supporting Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.).

Small ectotherms with specialized diets are highly susceptible to environmental change, as their life cycle is largely affected by temperature and by the presence of specific resources. This study focuses on two species of rolled-leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae), both present at two different elevations in Costa Rica: Cephaloleia belti Baly, a diet-generalist, and Chelobasis bicolor Gray, a diet-specialist. Body size, energetic condition (lipid storage), muscle mass and immune condition (melanization response) were compared in beetle populations from a tropical rainforest (50 m elevation) and a tropical montane forest (2 000 m elevation). These measurements reflect current and past nutritional condition and hence are good estimators of individual fitness. We analyzed a total of 172 individuals from both species, sexes and elevations.We predicted that beetles at higher elevation would display larger body size, higher energeticcondition and lower immune response associated with metabolic requirements and parasitic pressure in colder temperatures. In general, beetles at high altitude were larger, had more lipids and muscle and showed stronger melanization (i.e., immune response) than beetles at low altitudes. Such differences among populations at different elevations may reflect local adaptation to altitude or phenotypic plasticity. However, the effect of elevation was not equivalent amongst species or sex. Measuring physiological traits in organisms with broad elevational distributions could be useful in understanding possible species responses to climate change. © 2019 by Revista de Biologia Tropical.

The model is run with recent data for Germany's power sector and for different types of gas-fired power plants. The result is twofold. First, the paper achieves a more realistic value by improving on existing models: it models electricity and gas prices as a two-dimensional stochastic process, each component consisting of the sum of a seasonal pattern and a mean-reverting process; it uses high granularity by modelling hourly time-steps; and it incorporates power plant ramping times and costs. Second, it compares two types of power plant models, one with daily and one with hourly operating decisions, and thereby quantifies the value of a plant's intraday flexibility. The hourly model replicates operators' and investors' decision making accurately. This is evidenced by the fact that the results trace current major developments like the recent decline and come-back of gas-fired generation in Germany. The paper contributes to a better understanding of the choices operators and investors face in current electricity markets.

The monopolies characteristic of the utilities sector, and the low incentive to innovate that result from this, will cause these industries to struggle for a market share in a more competitive future environment. Solar power business may emerge as an opportunity for electricity utilities increase earnings, though their burgeoning depends on favourable framework conditions, such as subsidies. The objective of this paper is to study the long-term effects of the deployment from distributed solar on solar companies' generation and electricity utilities. The findings indicate that distributed generation may reduce the domestic energy consumption; however, the development of solar PV (photovoltaic) is limited under the British electricity market's conditions. In addition, the most beneficial option to solar company is a PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) model. Specifically, a PPA business model that promotes solar PV systems plus a battery storage is the most successful business in terms of savings for PV adopters, but the benefit to solar companies is reduced. © 2019, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","Feed-in tariff; Solar power business; Solar PV; System dynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068256611

The most serious of heat-related injuries is exertional heat stroke (EHS). EHS generally occurs when health individual perform physical activity in hot environments and the balance between body heat production and heat dissipation is upset resulting in excessive body heat storage. Blood flow to the skin is increased to assist in dissipating heat while gut blood flow is considerably reduced, and this increases the permeability of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Toxic materials from gut bacteria leak through the gastrointestinal mucosa into the central circulation triggering an inflammatory response, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), multiorgan failure, and vascular collapse. In addition, high heat directly damages cellular proteins resulting in cellular death. In the United States military, the overall incidence of clinically diagnosed heat stroke from 1998 to 2017 was (mean ± standard deviation) 2.7 ± 0.5 cases/10,000 Soldier-years and outpatient rates rose over this period. The cornerstone of EHS diagnosis is recognition of central nervous dysfunction (ataxia, loss of balance, convulsions, irrational behavior, unusual behavior, inappropriate comments, collapse, and loss of consciousness) and a body core temperature (obtained with a rectal thermometer) usually >40.5°C (105°F). The gold standard treatment is whole body cold water immersion. In the field where water immersion is not available it may be necessary to use ice packs or very cold, wet towels placed over as much of the body as possible before transportation of the victim to higher levels of medical care. The key to prevention of EHS and other heat-related injuries is proper heat acclimation, understanding work/rest cycles, proper hydration during activity, and assuring that physical activity is matched to the Soldiers' fitness levels. Also, certain dietary supplements (DSs) may have effects on energy expenditure, gastrointestinal function, and thermoregulation that should be considered and understood. In many cases over-motivation is a major risk factor. Commanders and trainers should be alert to any change in the Soldier's behavior. Proper attention to these factors should considerably reduce the incidence of EHS. 2019.",,"exercise; heat; heat stroke; human; occupational disease; pathophysiology; physiology; soldier; Exercise; Heat Stroke; Hot Temperature; Humans; Military Personnel; Occupational Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068151843

In applications such as superconducting magnetic energy storage, the charge/discharge/persistent switching frequency of the coil, resulting from pulse width modulation control algorithms, is usually in the kilohertz regime. Therefore, a thorough investigation of the losses in the kilohertz regime of AC currents superimposed on large DC currents is essential in order to ensure the device stable operation at a predefined temperature. We describe here a unique experimental setup designed and built for characterizing AC losses in superconducting wires and coils under such special conditions. To minimize the eddy currents induced in the apparatus, a cryostat vacuum vessel was made of Delrin, an insulating synthetic polymer. The measurement setup allows driving DC currents up to 150 A and superimposed AC currents with amplitudes up to 10 Arms and frequencies up to 18 kHz. The system utilizes conduction cooling to reach a wide range of temperatures between 6 and 100 K and allows measurements of 10 cm long superconducting wires and coils with a diameter of 40 cm. The loss is measured by the electrical method, i.e., by direct voltage and current waveform measurement, achieving a resolution better than 100 nW.

The resulting control law is employed not only to enhance transient stability and voltage regulation of the system including SMES device, but also to ensure the overall closed-loop system stability. The developed control law is evaluated on a single-machine infinite bus (SMIB) power system with SMES.

It also analyzes the economics of the system and analyzes the size and cost of the system with the appropriate battery energy storage system. The simulation results show that grid connections (On-Grid) can save cost more than Off-Grid systems. Due to the Off-Grid system, the cost of the battery is large and expensive. So, with the on-grid system, it is more than worth the investment and can sell the electric power back to the electrical system. However, the Off-Grid system also has advantages for remote areas, and it is useful for systems with small loads.

The MRTA has a high energy consumption's cost in which the 50-60 % of energy consumption occurs from the accelerating operation mode of the train.

So, the designed speed profile is designed to be used at the off-peak hours for reducing energy consumption. The second problem of the MRTA is the regenerative braking energy loss which occurs from the braking operation mode of the train. In the present, the regenerative braking energy cannot send to another train. Therefore, all of the regenerative braking energy is converted to heat energy by brake resistor.

In the present experiment we tested the hypothesis that an 8-week-long combined strength and stretch-shortening cycle exercise training is superior to strength training alone in the development of walking and running economy in healthy untrained women. Methods: Twenty untrained female college students (age = 21.5 ± 2.1 years, body mass index = 22.3 ± 2.9)were divided into two experimental groups. Both groups performed own-body resistance exercises three times per week but one group performed additional stretch-shortening cycle exercises. Countermovement jump force as well as maximal voluntary isometric torque and elastic energy storage and re-use in quadriceps muscle were measured. Running and walking economy was quantified by measuring maximal oxygen consumption during a treadmill test. Results: Isometric torque improved uniformly in the two groups (p < 0.05), however countermovement jump force, elastic energy storage and re-use as well as running economy improved selectively after strength and additional stretch-shortening cycle exercise (p < 0.05). Walking economy was unaffected in either of the experimental groups. Conclusion: This study suggests that improved elastic energy storage and re-use rather than maximum muscle contractility may account for the changes in countermovement jump force and running economy after additional stretch-shortening cycle exercise. The present data should be taken into consideration for understanding the favourable effects of stretch-shortening cycle exercise training in the young untrained population. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Mechanical adaptations; Oxygen consumption; Physical fitness; Plyometrics; Resistance training; Stretch shortening training","adult; aerobic capacity; article; body mass; clinical article; college student; controlled study; economic aspect; female; human; human experiment; muscle contractility; oxygen consumption; plyometrics; quadriceps femoris muscle; quantitative analysis; resistance training; running; storage; torque; treadmill test; walking; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065788000

The methods proposed for maximizing the recovered energy are presented together with their theoretical analysis. A novel optimization strategy, based on the linearization of the dc power flow equations, is analytically explained, while a successive approximation method is used.

The growth is especially noticeable in residential systems, and ways to make PV electricity a more competitive choice for Finnish residents are studied. One of these ways is to decrease the solar PV electricity production costs by decreasing the investment costs by undersizing the inverter of the PV system. The objective of undersizing is to find the optimal array-to-inverter sizing ratio (AISR) where the ratio of the economic loss from the clipped energy to the economic gain from the decreased system investment achieved by an undersized inverter is lowest. In this paper, the economically most optimal AISRs are determined for different residential array sizes, orientations, and inclinations when operating in Finnish locations and conditions. Calculations for each inverter size are carried out by using recorded Finnish meteorological data and the current Finnish PV system cost distribution, and by analyzing existing 1-s resolution production measurement data of a Finnish PV system. It is concluded that it is necessary to use 1-s resolution data as the use of 1-h resolution production data would lead to more significant undersizing caused by the power clipping occurring within an hour. The optimal AISRs presented in this study are higher than the optimal ratios reported in previous studies for locations further south than Finland. This can be explained by the northern location of Finland, where the irradiance above Standard Test Conditions (STC) is lower than in central Europe, for example. This allows more significant undersizing as less energy is clipped even at higher ratios. In the case of south-oriented arrays in a 30° installation angle, the optimal AISRs for the 10 kW, 6 kW, and 3 kW inverters were 1.6, 1.8, and 2.08, respectively. Again, the AISRs for the southwest-southeast facade installations were 1.8, 1.9, and 2.17 for the inverters under study. They do not clip the produced energy as much as rooftop systems because their production is more evenly distributed throughout the day, yet they do not achieve as low production costs either. It is pointed out that if the PV self-consumption is optimized by using PV to heat water or batteries as a storage, limitation of the PV generation might not be the correct solution. © 2019 International Solar Energy Society","Inverter; Nordic conditions; Optimization; Photovoltaic power system; PV; System sizing","Digital storage; Electric inverters; Housing; Investments; Location; Losses; Meteorology; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Electricity production costs; Inverter; Levelized cost of electricities; Nordic conditions; Photovoltaic power systems; Production measurement; Standard test condition (STC); System sizings; Costs; cost analysis; electricity; equipment; photovoltaic system; price determination; solar power; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064895345

Extender 2 maintained significantly higher viability values (67.7 ± 2.5%) at 24 h compared to Extenders 3 (59.3 ± 2.1%) and 1 (46.7 ± 4.2%). Normal morphology after 24 h (88.1 ± 3.1% at 4 °C and 85.6 ± 3.1% at 37 °C) fell within the acceptable range for good quality semen. Acceptable quality was maintained within 8 h and up to 24 h from collection for non-frozen goat semen stored at 37 °C and 4 °C temperature, respectively. These results imply that Small East African goat semen diluted in low or non-egg yolk based extenders and stored at refrigerator temperature can be valuable for artificial reproduction of native goats on low resource capacity farms in developing countries. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Motility; Non-frozen semen; Small East African goat; Sperm morphology; viability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064875337

This adds a new dimension to the analysis of storage time shifting revenue and allows for additional insights into the historic value loss of storage assets. We apply this method to stylized pumped hydro and battery storage systems operating on historic European (Swiss and German/Austrian)day-ahead electricity price curves (2007–2017). We find that historic trends of the disaggregated revenue are highly diverse depending on the timescales. Changes in relative revenue shares are primarily driven by the price profile distortion due to increasing photovoltaic electricity generation. In the battery storage case this results in a 1.5 h reduction of charging-discharging time differences between 2008 and 2012. The case of pumped hydro storage plants is more complex: Main revenue losses occur for time differences of 6 to 12 h. Revenues on other timescales are much more stable or even increasing. This especially holds for short transfer times between 0 and 6 h: In the German/Austrian market area, they contribute 17% to total pumped hydro storage revenue in 2016, as compared to 3% in 2008. The disaggregation also enables the analysis of contributions from hours with outlier electricity prices. These are found to be especially significant in the years 2007 and 2008. Overall, we find that storage operation has been increasingly diversified due to the historic price profile evolution. The often discussed revenue erosion offers new opportunities on different timescales. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Historic erosion of storage revenues; Impact of solar power on electricity prices; Swiss and German pumped hydro storage; Wholesale energy storage time-shifting","Charging (batteries); Costs; Erosion; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Battery storage system; Electricity prices; Energy storage time; Photovoltaic electricities; Profile distortion; Profile evolution; Storage operations; Time-differences; Battery storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064749058

The model performance was evaluated using measurements carried out between August and December 2014 in Portugal. Several simulations were performed over two different areas, Porto urban area and Aveiro suburban area, for the entire measurement period. Distinct simulations were performed using different urban parametrizations: (i) the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM); (ii) a single-layer urban canopy model (UCM); and (iii) a modelling system composed by WRF and SUEWS models (WRF-SUEWS). The results showed that both UCM and SUEWS are able to simulate the energy partitioning over the low and high intensity residential. At the low intensity residential area, the majority of energy is partitioned to latent heat flux, accounting on average for 47% and 49% of the daytime available energy, for UCM and SUEWS, respectively. At the high intensity residential area, the greatest share of energy goes to sensible heat flux (42% [UCM] and 50% [SUEWS]), followed by the storage heat flux (33% [UCM] and 43% [SUEWS]). For both areas, a completely different energy partitioning was obtained when the LSM was used. The analysis performed showed that the UCM are able to provide a more accurate turbulent energy partitioning (sensible and latent heat), which contribute to enhance the urban microclimate simulation results; the systematic model biases in the LSM simulation was reduced by 1–2 °C in air temperature and by 0.5–1 m s −1 in wind speeds at near surface layer, on average, depending on the urban density. The overall results suggest that an appropriate representation of urban physical processes are crucial to improve numerical tools suited for the modelling of the urban atmospheric boundary layer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Energy fluxes; Meteorological variables; Numerical modelling; Urban areas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064160855

In this study, a facile spray-coating method is employed for fabrication of a TiO2-coated filter, with fibrous structure allowing for satisfactory airflow, sufficient pollutant-catalyst interactions, and reusability. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that TiO2 nanoparticles were immobilized firmly on the surface of the membrane's fibers. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis reveals a homogeneous layer of TiO2 nanoparticles on the pleated washable synthetic (PWS) fibers. The photocatalytic oxidations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide (CO) are analyzed in both the laboratory and field tests. TiO2-coated PWS filter membrane (60×60×5 cm) shows higher benzene and toluene removal efficiency (approximately 80%-86%) under UV radiation than that in the dark (less than 10%). This result indicates that photocatalytic oxidation on the surface of TiO2-coated PWS filter membrane contributes greatly to benzene and toluene degradation. The corresponding pilot-scale photocatalytic air filtration unit shows ethylene reduction rate of 1.59±0.52 ppm min-1 in a 45 m3 postharvest storage room. In a demonstrative elimination of automotive exhaust gases, the TiO2 coated PWS filter membrane shows a 16% decrease in CO generated from a motorcycle.

Activating immune functions requires the synthesis of many new molecules and the undertaking of numerous cellular tasks and it must happen rapidly. Therefore, immune cells undergo a metabolic switch, which enables the rapid production of ATP and new biomolecules. Such metabolism is very nutrient-demanding, especially of glucose and glutamine, and thus the immune response is associated with a systemic metabolic switch, redirecting nutrient flow towards immunity and away from storage and consumption by non-immune processes. The immune system during its activation becomes privileged in terms of using organismal resources and the activated immune cells usurp nutrients by producing signals which reduce the metabolism of non-immune tissues. The insect fat body plays a dual role in which it is both a metabolic organ, storing energy and providing energy to the rest of the organism, but also an organ important for humoral immunity. Therefore, the internal switch from anabolism to the production of antimicrobial peptides occurs in the fat body during infection. The mechanisms regulating metabolism during the immune response ensure adequate energy for an effective response (resistance) but they must be properly regulated because energy is not unlimited and the energy needs of the immune system thus interfere with the needs of other physiological traits. If not properly regulated, the immune response may in the end decrease fitness via decreasing disease tolerance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adenosine signaling; Disease tolerance; Immunometabolism; Insulin resistance; Privileged immunity; Warburg effect","animal; energy metabolism; immunology; innate immunity; insect; metabolism; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Immunity, Innate; Insecta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064119347

The present study reveals that the new proposal returns values for the convective heat transfer coefficient that are almost three orders of magnitude higher than the base case. Hence, proving that even making such a rather simple alterations to the smooth walls geometry, i.e. adding undulations or semi-circular fins, can result in a significant convective heat transfer enhancement, therefore, further reducing the risks of structural damages caused by the dry-storage system overheating. Before conducting the design optimization study mentioned above, two validation test cases have been considered in order to examine the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models’ capability to predict the flow under buoyancy driven and low turbulence levels such is the case in the passively cooled dry cask system. The test cases considered in the validation study sections are the experimental measurements of Betts and Bokhari for turbulent natural convection in an enclosed tall cavity and the temperature measurements in concrete-shielded spent fuel storage cask system reported by McKinnon. The models selected for the validation study are namely the k-ω SST model, the v 2 -f model, the low-Reynolds k-ε model, and the recently formulated elliptic blending k-ε model. It has been found that out of these models, the low-Reynolds k-ε model was found to provide a good combination in returning both; physically realistic and conservative solution. The present validation using well-resolved RANS simulations has shown that a more quantitative and detailed comparison of the predictions is required in order to clearly highlight the discrepancies between the models’ predictions in terms of velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and, in particular, convective heat transfer coefficient profiles. The commonly adopted methodology in limiting the validation process to temperature profiles comparison only, would cover up these differences as the temperature variation is affected by the combined effects of the convective and the radiation heat transfer modes. © 2019","Mixed convection flow; Nuclear dry-storage; Passive cooling; RANS models V&V; Undulated surface","Blending; Computational fluid dynamics; Computational geometry; Concretes; Fins (heat exchange); Forecasting; Heat convection; Heat transfer coefficients; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Navier Stokes equations; Nuclear fuels; Oceanography; Radiation effects; Temperature measurement; Convective heat transfer Coefficient; Dry storage; Mixed convection flow; Passive cooling; RANS models; Reynolds averaged navier-stokes models; Three dimensional computational fluid dynamics; Turbulent natural convection; Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063739373

FREEDM system integrates distributed renewable energy resources (DRER) and distributed energy storage devices (DESD) with the conventional network. One of the most important problems faced by the modern FREEDM technology is the possibility of communication failure or interruption of the system which may cause malfunction of the protection system operation. In this paper, an overcurrent relay is designed as backup protection by employing the Arduino Uno microcontroller to accurately protect the FREEDM network. A specific software program is designed to simulate the overcurrent relay satisfying the inverse, very inverse, and extremely inverse characteristics and a part of the FREEDM system connected to variable load using the Proteus software package. To satisfy the efficiency of the designed software simulator, the three characteristics are tested and compared with the trusted IEC 60255-151 standard. An electronic circuit board is designed and uploaded with a friendly developed software program particularly formulated to protect the solid-state transformer (SST) connected to DRER, DESD, and loads from one side and the FREEDM system ring at the other side.

Zero emission shipping options rely on the use of electricity or alternative fuels, such as blue hydrogen or ammonia. However, that requires major modifications to the ships and the logistics of fuel distribution. As a transition solution, which can be implemented on much shorter term; this study presents the technical and economic evaluation for ship-based carbon capture (SBCC) on diesel or LNG-fuelled vessels. Two reference ship engines of 1280 kW and 3000 kW were chosen. The process is simulated using Aspen Plus®, with 30 wt% aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) and 30 wt% aqueous piperazine (PZ) as solvents. CAPEX and OPEX were reduced by integrating the thermal energy of the exhaust gas with the stripper reboiler for the diesel and LNG powered ships. For the LNG ships, the cooling capacity from evaporation of LNG was used for liquefying the captured CO2. By using piperazine, which allows CO2 to be desorbed at higher pressure than MEA, the minimal cost of CO2 captured achieved was 98 €/tonne CO2 with a corresponding 1.8 million euros equipment cost for the 3000 kW engine ship. Additionally, the feasibility of SBCC is investigated by adapting an existing cargo ship design (powered by the reference 3000 kW engine) for including the carbon capture process equipment. The capture, compression and storage units are fitted onboard, and the design is modified so that the transport capacity remains the same, while maintaining the ship stability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Maritime carbon capture; Onboard carbon capture; Post-combustion carbon capture; Zero emission ships","Air pollution; Alternative fuels; Ammonia; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Computer software; Diesel engines; Economic analysis; Ethanolamines; Hydrogen fuels; Carbon capture process; Economic evaluations; Fuel distribution; Monoethanolamine; Post-combustion carbon captures; Transition solutions; Transport capacity; Zero emission; Tankers (ships); carbon emission; carbon sequestration; combustion; diesel; engine; liquefied natural gas; vessel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063489249

Bhutan has surplus power for export, while Nepal suffers from a huge domestic power deficit. The reasons for this contrast have been discussed before, but from the policy and geopolitical perspectives without focusing at the project level. This study, therefore, comprehensively examines and compares Nepal's and Bhutan's hydropower projects, including the technical, physical, financial, institutional, social, and environmental aspects. The results indicate that compared to projects in Bhutan, projects in Nepal have systematically higher cost structures. This cost difference has been attributed to different developmental and operational approaches taken by the governments and their agencies, and dissimilar topographic and riparian conditions of their project sites. Bhutan's projects have a more optimal in design when considered from structural and cost perspectives, thus making them more cost-efficient and less risky. They are also intended for power exporting, which allows Bhutan access to attractive funding resources, including carbon finance. In contrast, Nepal's projects are planned primarily to make up for the shortfall in domestic electricity availability. To maximize output generation, Nepal's project facility structures are designed to emphasize greater water volumes in larger reservoir storages, which increases both the project costs and the social and environmental risks. As a result, Nepal's project implementation becomes more challenging and makes funding more difficult. Thus, Nepal's overall hydropower development slows down, being caught in a vicious circle. © 2019 International Energy Initiative","Bhutan; Funding; Hydropower development; Nepal; Project cost; Social and environmental risks","Finance; Reservoirs (water); Bhutan; Funding; Hydro-power development; Nepal; Project cost; Social and environmental; Hydroelectric power; cost analysis; energy planning; hydroelectric power; project assessment; resource development; risk assessment; sustainable development; Bhutan; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063102412

By optimizing temperature set-point and coolant flow, the HVAC system can modify the electrical power consumption at peak hours.

In renewable scenarios non-renewable energy sources are phased out by high tax for year 2050 and letting model find cost-optimal path from 2010 to 2050. Results indicate that high renewable share poses major changes in each energy system sector, especially in power generation, industry and transportation.

The composite of the ILs with complex hydrides decreases the enthalpy and activation energy for the hydrogen desorption.

A case study is presented for an alloy of the type LaNi 5 . The results combine experimental measurements with theoretical modeling. Firstly, the numerical work presented discusses a numerical method for the evaluation of pcI raw data in order to minimize the experimental error. A simple, efficient iterative algorithm is presented to solve for the van der Waals equation of state in order to take into account the compressibility of hydrogen. Secondly, the measurements of dynamic (mass-flow)and quasi-static (Sievert's type)isotherms at different temperatures and different flow rates are presented. The dead volume of the apparatus as well as its experimental error, which is key parameter for the accurate calculation of hydrogen capacity, are also measured. Finally, important thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are deduced from the pcI curves. The kinetics of the absorption and desorption reactions are modelled and the reaction rate constants are found using both dynamic and quasi-static methods. The presented work goes beyond the calculation of the entropy and enthalpy of reaction, as the lattice gas model is also used to determine the critical temperature as well as the interaction energy between hydrogen-metal atoms and hydrogen-hydrogen atoms. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Hydrogen storage; Metal hydrides; Pressure composition isotherms; Sorption-analysis","Atoms; Conductive plastics; Digital storage; Equations of state; Flow rate; Hydrides; Isotherms; Iterative methods; Kinetic parameters; Metals; Numerical methods; Rate constants; Van der Waals forces; Absorption and desorptions; Accurate calculations; Critical temperatures; Entropy and enthalpies; Metal hydrides; Pressure composition isotherms; Theoretical modeling; Van der Waals equation of state; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064531331

Consequently, extensive greener and environmentally benign synthesis techniques that employ natural and readily renewable, low-cost waste materials need to be established. Herein, cellulose is considered as an alternative precursor source for the synthesis of CNMs. In the past decade, ionic liquids (ILs) have exhibited a great potential in a diverse number of applications. However, insignificant attention has been paid to the structure of ILs in relation to their extended application as a media for the dissolution of cellulose to avail carbon for CNMs synthesis. As baseline, a number of ionic liquids were used as carbon sources for CNM production, and distinct differences were found, depending on the type of ionic liquid used and the temperature of synthesis. Furthermore. CNMs were fabricated using a combination of the ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [C4MIM]Cl, and cellulose, in the presence of ferrocene as catalyst precursor, using the floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition technique. Typical spaghetti like, hollow tubular structures with bamboo compartments, resembling N-doped multiwalled tubular carbon nanomaterials were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) respectively. Thermal stability studies showed thermogram profiles with a stability of around 550 °C. The sample synthesised with cellulose was more stable than the sample synthesised from IL and ferrocene only. Characteristic D- and G-bands were observed around 1380 and 1560 cm−1, respectively, for Raman spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed characteristic tubular carbon nanomaterials and or graphitic/N-graphitic diffraction patterns. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon precursor; Cellulose; Ionic liquids; Tubular carbon nanomaterials","Carbon; Catalysts; Chemical vapor deposition; Chlorine compounds; Doping (additives); High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Ionic liquids; Iron compounds; Nanostructured materials; Organometallics; Scanning electron microscopy; 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride; Carbon nano-materials; Carbon nanostructured materials; Carbon precursors; Catalyst precursors; Chemical vapour deposition; Environmentally benign synthesis; Thermal stability studies; Cellulose; Carbon; Catalysts; Cellulose; Chlorine Compounds; Iron Compounds; Scanning Electron Microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067257028

The active defect sites located at the periphery of the lattice may influence certain redox reactions, thus classifying it as an excellent non-noble metal catalyst. One effective approach to synthesize large scale MoS 2 films is through simple thermolysis of (NH 4 ) 2 MoS 4 precursor. Herein, a combined in situ X-ray and Ultra-Violet photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS/UPS) study has been carried out to follow the evolution of atomic composition, the surface chemical species and the electronic properties (Work Function and Ionization Potential) during the thermal decomposition of (NH 4 ) 2 MoS 4 salt in Ultra High Vacuum conditions. It was found that, up to 400C, thermal conversion of (NH 4 ) 2 MoS 4 salt to transient intermediates, across amorphous MoSx phase have been performed towards to MoS 2 out of significant percent of suphur active sites. The active sites have been decreased upon heating at higher temperatures. Assignment of the thermally evolved active species at defect sites and the correlation of surface atomic concentration combined with either the Ionization Potential or the Work Function of annealed MoSx nanoflakes makes this study a knowledgeable factor of awareness through electrocatalytic properties of MoS 2 -based nanostructures.

The purpose of this study was to develop low-cost storage for MFC enrichment culture to enable prompt process recovery after upsets. Anolyte of an operating xylose-fed MFC was stored at different temperatures and for different time periods. Storing the anolyte for 1 week or 1 month at +4°C did not significantly affect power production, but the lag time for power production was increased from 2 days to 3 or 5 days, respectively. One month storing at –20°C increased the lag time to 7 days. The average power density in these MFCs varied between 1.2 and 1.7 W/m3. The share of dead cells (measured by live/dead staining) increased with storing time. After 6-month storage, the power production was insignificant. However, xylose removal remained similar in all cultures (99–100%) while volatile fatty acids production varied. The results indicate that fermentative organisms tolerated the long storage better than the exoelectrogens. As storing at +4°C is less energy intensive compared to freezing, anolyte storage at +4°C for a maximum of 1 month is recommended as start-up seed for MFC after process failure to enable efficient process recovery. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Exoelectrogenic culture; freezing; mixed culture storage; process recovery; refrigerating","bioenergy; electricity; electrode; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Electricity; Electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041094112

A possible way to achieve energy efficiency and therefore sustainability is to preheat the mineral mixture, i.e. the aggregate, before it enters the production process in the asphalt mixing plant, thus resulting in lower energy consumption per ton of asphalt. The main objective of the conducted research was to develop and test an artificial neural network (ANN) model and analyse the influence of three independent variables (hour in the day, season, air temperature) on the one dependent variable (temperature of the mineral mixture). The impact of the observed independent variables on the temperature of the mineral mixture is analysed in a standard uncovered aggregate stockpile and in a solar aggregate stockpile. From the obtained modelling results, it can be concluded that it is possible to successfully use ANN in the process of predicting the temperature of aggregate stockpiles in the processes of aggregate production and storage as part of the whole production process of asphalt mixtures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Asphalt production; Mineral mixture; Prediction; Solar aggregate stockpiles; Sustainable management","Aggregates; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Minerals; Mixtures; Neural networks; Potential energy; Sustainable development; Aggregate production; Artificial neural network models; Asphalt production; Dependent variables; Independent variables; Solar aggregate stockpiles; Sustainable management; Temperature prediction; Asphalt mixtures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062156811

In this study, bio-based PCMs were prepared by using two techniques: encapsulation and UV-curing. Encapsulated–PCM was synthesized by suspension polymerization with stearyl methacrylate (SMA) and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). In encapsulation process, the microcapsules were prepared from poly(stearyl methacrylate-co-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) shell and coconut oil (CO) core. UV-cured form stable PCM was also prepared by radical addition polymerization of stearyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate and coconut oil. In UV-curing process as in the second process, coconut oil was trapped within the polymeric network without covalent bonding. Thermal storage feature of encapsulated-PCM and UV-cured form stable PCM was investigated. The melting enthalpy of encapsulated-PCM is 119 J/g, which is higher than both the melting enthalpy of pure coconut oil (106 J/g) and UV-cured form stable PCM (47 J/g). Moreover, thermal degradation results of PCMs show that the maximum thermal decomposition temperature of encapsulated-PCM increased compared with UV-cured from stable PCM. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The deposition of the electrode materials used in these applications should be as cost effective as possible, while maintaining good device characteristics. Here, a simple low-temperature solution-based deposition method is reported that allows for the growth of high surface area, cobalt-doped ZnO nanorod-arrays decorated with cobaltic over-coatings. Control over the visible light absorption and the nature of the cobaltic over-coating (e. g. Co(OH) 2 and/or Co 3 O 4 ) can be achieved by changing the growth parameters during the one-pot synthesis. Focusing on the evaluation of the underlying growth principles and resulting material properties, the study discusses the crucial role of the organic growth modifier used (monoethanolamine) as a complexing-, growth-directing- and reducing agent. Furthermore, the (solar driven) oxidation of water is taken as an example reaction in order to gain further insight into the functionality of the structures. Accounting for the temperature dependent breakdown of metal-amine complexes, a two-stage growth mechanism is proposed that will allow the optimization of the resulting structures for individual applications, but which could also prove valuable for other metal-oxide/hydroxide material combinations. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The DC applications will increase through the consumer electronics usage, growing in the renewable resources that produce DC power, using the transportation electrification with electric vehicles, progress in the information technology and the internet trough Data centers, the Energy storage technologies systems, and the transmission and distribution infrastructure through HVDC. The medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) concept is a collection platform acting as a layer of infrastructure between transmission and distribution in order to provide integrated renewable generation (wind, photovoltaic, fuel cell, energy storage, etc.). One of the benefits of MVDC is that it facilitates the installation of large- and small-scale wind farms, solar farms, DC loads, electrical vehicles, etc. The efficiency of MVDC is the main feature that tends to minimize power conversion. The future of MVDC should be focused upon-it has many points that require consideration.

In isolated microgrids, the need for ESTs has become more prominent in order to bridge the gap between generated and consumed energies. ESTs naturally supply DC output power making them more compliant with DC microgrids, something that represents a cost saving for the conversion stage.

The system, including electrical and thermal loads, is connected to the upstream network. The bidirectional operation is defined for the system, and the system can buy energy from the grid or sell energy to the grid. A water electrolyzer is applied to produce hydrogen from water and store electricity in the form of hydrogen. The stored hydrogen supplies the thermal loads, as well as the fuel cell. The electrical loads are directly connected to the grid and are supplied by the grid. The electricity is received from the fuel cell at hours 17 to 22. When the price of electricity is high, the electrical loads can receive their power from the fuel cell rather than the grid. Additionally, any excess electricity may be sold to the grid. The uncertainty in the thermal and electrical loads is modeled and formulated as stochastic programming. The hydrogen is fed to the fuel cell and the thermal loads. The proposed model minimizes the daily operational cost of the system. The results demonstrate that the daily operational cost of the system is $22.274 USD/day.

One of the most popular RE sources is wind, where the wind has been installed about 430 GW in 2015. Among wind turbines generator that available in the market niche, Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) is the most popular type. DFIG type dominates the total wind turbine installed capacity by about 17.5% in 2015 according to the report of JRC (Joint Research Center). Although DFIG is capable in extracting 5% more energy if compared to the fixed speed type, it is however, very sensitive to the fault that may violate the Fault Ride Through (FRT) which leads to the disconnecting of the DFIG from the grid. In this paper, a Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) unit is applied to improve the FRT capability of the system with DFIG during a short circuit event in the distribution lines. A Fuzzy Logic Type-2 is employed on the SMES to obtain the most optimum response of the DFIG during the fault. © 2019 Int. J. Mech. Eng. Rob.

The proposed fuzzy expert system is used for automatic decision making regarding energy management in smart microgrids containing renewable sources, storage systems, and controllable loads. The fuzzy expert system optimizes energy consumption and storage in order to utilize renewable energy and maximize the financial gain of a microgrid. In order to enable energy management, the fuzzy expert system uses insolation, price of electrical energy, temperature, wind speed, and power of the controllable and uncontrollable loads as input variables. These input data can be directly measured, imported from grid measurements, or predicted using any data prediction method. This paper presents fuzzification of input variables, defines a set of rules of the expert system, and presents defuzzification of outputs. The outputs of the expert system are decisions, i.e., answers to the question of how to manage energy production and consumption in a microgrid. Three outputs are defined to decide about produced energy, controllable loads, and own consumption. The first output is used to store, sell, or consume produced energy. The second output is used to manage the controllable load. The third output shows how to supply own consumption of the prosumer. The expert system is tested on hourly values of input variables in a single day in Serbia. The proposed approach is compared with other available approaches in order to validate the results. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Decision making; Digital storage; Electric power system control; Energy management; Energy utilization; Expert systems; Renewable energy resources; Storage management; Wind; Automatic decision; Controllable loads; Electrical energy storages; Energy productions; Fuzzy expert systems; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Renewable sources; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065341255

However, a rapid growth of the dynamic and stand-by power due to transistor leakages becomes a pressing issue. A promising way to slow down this trend is to introduce non-volatility in circuits. The development of an electrically addressable non-volatile memory combining high speed and high endurance is essential to achieve these goals. To further reduce the energy consumption, it is essential to replace SRAM in modern hierarchical multi-level processor memory structures with a non-volatile memory technology. The spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) combines non-volatility, high speed, and high endurance and is thus suitable for applications in caches. However, its development is still hindered by relatively high switching currents and the need of an external magnetic field for deterministic switching of perpendicularly magnetized layers. The switching by means of two orthogonal current pulses allows achieving deterministic sub-500 ps and magnetic field-free switching in perpendicularly magnetized rectangular structures. Complementing the two-pulse switching scheme with weak perpendicular interface-induced magnetic anisotropy reduces the switching current significantly for achieving sub-500 ps switching in in-plane structures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","In-plane MTJ; MRAM; Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; Spin-orbit torque; Sub-500ps switching; Switching","Cache memory; CMOS integrated circuits; Energy utilization; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic fields; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Metals; MOS devices; MRAM devices; Nonvolatile storage; Oxide semiconductors; Static random access storage; Switching; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors; External magnetic field; Induced magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic random access memory; MRAM; Non-volatile memory technology; Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; Spin orbits; Spin orbit coupling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064459612

The main objective of this study was to investigate runoff response to land use/land cover change in Aynalem catchment, located in Tigray regional state, northern Ethiopia. The study analyzed the historical land cover changes from 1995 to 2015 that have taken place in the catchment and its effect on the runoff of the catchment. The land cover changes within the catchment were examined through classification of satellite images with integrated use of ERDAS Imagine (Version 9.2) and ArcGIS software. Land cover change analysis between the periods of 1995 and 2015 has shown that the urban area has increased from 1.39% to 7.50%, Cropland from 54.03% to 65.69% and Water bodies from 0.14% to 0.42%, while Planted Forest area has decreased from 3.61% to 2.92%, Grassland 2.22%–1.90% and Open Shrub lands from 38.61% to 21.53%. Further, Water and Energy Transfer between Soil, Plants, and Atmosphere (WetSpa) model was used to investigate the runoff response to a land cover change on the study area. The model was calibrated (1994–1998) and validated (1999–2001) against the observed daily stream flow data. WetSpa model parameters sensitivity analysis result shown that the groundwater recession coefficient (Kg), Initial active groundwater storage (Go) and Surface runoff exponent (K_run) are the most sensitive parameters affecting the hydrology of the catchment. The WetSpa model application in Aynalem catchment performances very good in reproducing the hydrological process of the catchment with coefficient of determination (R 2 ), Nash and Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) values of 0.82 and 0.90 for calibration, 0.78 and 0.88 for validation, respectively.

Retrofitting of their building envelopes aimed at the improvement of thermal performance is often feasible using interior thermal insulation systems only. The effectiveness of systems without vapor barrier depends on the application of modern insulation materials with enhanced water transport properties contributing to fast liquid moisture redistribution and mitigating the risks related to water vapor condensation. In this paper, thermal and hygric properties of several biomaterials potentially applicable as thermal insulation boards on the interior side of historical building envelopes are investigated. The obtained experimental data include all transport and storage parameters necessary for appropriate hygrothermal- and energy-related assessment of buildings provided with interior thermal insulation systems using advanced computer simulation tools. Wood fiberboard, flax fibers, hemp fibers, jute fibers, and sheep wool are found to have, at the same time, low thermal conductivity (∼0.05 W m −1 K −1 ) and high moisture diffusivity (1.1 × 10 −6 – 1.2 × 10 −5 m 2 s −1 ) which can classify them as good candidates for the use in interior thermal insulation systems without water vapor barrier. They exhibit convenient water vapor diffusion parameters and hygroscopic properties as well, which favors their use on the interior side. The natural origin presents another benefit.

For example, the gaps compared with the reference strategy are of 1.88%, 13.61 W/lpm, and 293 lpm for FC system efficiency, fuel consumption efficiency, and fuel economy, if the maximum load is considered. Also, different control methods are proposed at the ESS side to mitigate the load pulses (protecting the FC system) and regulate the DC voltage. The results obtained in this paper are discussed related to other ESS hybridizations and control solutions reported in the literature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; Fuel Cell; Hybridization; Optimization; Solar energy; Space technology; Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage","DC-DC converters; Dynamic loads; Electric energy storage; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Global optimization; Magnetic storage; Optimization; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solar energy; Space applications; Superconducting magnets; Temperature; Battery; Energy storage systems; Hybridization; Performance indicators; Radiation environments; Space technologies; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Very low temperatures; Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060722384

Emulsification techniques can be employed for fuel preparation by selecting suitable surfactants and WCO, diesel and butanol or ethanol ratios using a pseudo-ternary phase diagram. Results indicated that a WCO-diesel fuel blend (WDF) with butanol required no surfactants for homogeneous phase blending compared to WDF with ethanol. Phase behavior of WDF-ethanol blends with hydrophobic surfactants was more suitable than WDF-ethanol blends with more hydrophilic surfactants. Kinematic viscosity of WDF blends depended on the amount of surfactant and its hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) value. WCO content was determined as a significant factor contributing to WDF viscosity (p < 0.05). Biofuel blends containing 70% v/v diesel fuel, 15–20% v/v WCO, and 15–20% v/v ethanol with Dehydol LS1 or Span 80 at ethanol:surfactant ratio of 9:1 were selected for further analysis of relevant fuel properties. All selected WDFs gave emulsion droplet size at 200 nm or less. Other properties such as water content, carbon residue and copper strip corrosion met values specified by diesel and biodiesel fuel standards. Acid value of WDFs exceeded the standard due to high acid content of WCO. WDFs with ethanol/surfactants showed higher oxidative stabilities than WDFs with butanol. In terms of safety, conditions for storage and transport should be applied for WDFs because of their low flash point. WDFs obtained by this technique may be used in unmodified diesel engines but engine performance should be monitored. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alcohols; Diesel fuel; Microemulsion; Surfactants; Waste cooking oil","Alcohols; Biofuels; Blending; Copper corrosion; Diesel fuels; Emulsification; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Microemulsions; Oils and fats; Surface active agents; Viscosity; Diesel fuel blends; Engine performance; Hydrophile-lipophile balance; Hydrophilic surfactants; Hydrophobic surfactant; Oxidative stability; Pseudoternary phase diagrams; Waste cooking oil; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060460626

The analysis is conducted with TRNSYS software and the results are presented in energy and financial terms. Flat plate collectors coupled to a storage tank are used while there is an auxiliary energy system for supplying the extra heating demand when there is not adequate solar potential. The PCM-layer is used on the floor in order to increase the storage capacity and to avoid the operation of the auxiliary heating during the peak electricity demand period. Furthermore, this work presents the auxiliary loads, the indoor temperature and the total cost by changing the situation of the PCM, the volume of the storage tank, the area of the collectors and the thickness of the insulation. The results prove that the PCM-layer under the underfloor tubes reduces the auxiliary load by about 65%. Moreover, a multi-objective procedure proves that the PCM-layer under the underfloor tubes seems to be the most appropriate case due to the low heating consumption and the low total cost. Furthermore, it is found that during the cold winter days, the use of PCM is able to increase the indoor air temperature level about 0.8 °C.

Meyers Vænge 15, Copenhagen, Denmark","When transitioning to a 100% renewable energy system storing electricity becomes a focal point, as the resource flexibility is lost and the design of the energy system needs to provide flexibility and balancing options to integrate intermittent renewable resources. Using technologies such as power-to-gas offers an opportunity to store electricity in chemical form, which can be used as a long-term storage option. This paper develops a spatial modelling method by using a GIS tool to investigate potential generation sites for power-to-gas plants. The method determines the location of the plants by carbon source potential, proximity of the grid, costs of grid transmission and investment costs of the technology itself. By combining these types of data, it is possible to identify the investment costs of the power-to-gas plants. The method focuses on two paths: biogas upgrade and CO2 methanation. The method is applied to a specific case by investigating the power-to-gas potential in Denmark. The potential and spatial deployment is found by examining the investment costs of plants with an annual gas production of 60 GWh. The findings of the analysis indicate that the biogas upgrade path is the cheapest one of the two, at the present cost level, but due to the relatively small number of biogas plants in Denmark, the chosen plant size is limited to around 55 plants. CO2 methanation is a more costly path, but it has a larger potential of around 800 plants. As the analysis is based on the current sources for biogas and CO2, it is important to emphasise that the potential for CO2 methanation plants can be expected to diminish in the future as more renewable energy is introduced, lowering the need for thermal energy producers, while biogas production could see an increase. Nevertheless, the analysis of a specific case shows that the method gives a good indication of the extent of the power-to-gas resources by using a novel approach to the matter. The method can be applied in other countries as well, giving it a wide appeal. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Biogas upgrade; CO2 methanation; GIS; P2G; Power-to-gas","Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Digital storage; Gas industry; Gas plants; Gases; Geographic information systems; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Petroleum deposits; Renewable energy resources; 100% renewable energy systems; Biogas production; Grid transmission; Long-term storage; Renewable energies; Renewable resource; Resource flexibility; Spatial modelling; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054591192

This work aimed to assess the risk of hydrate formation during this transport as evaluated by two different approaches: traditional method based on water dew-point versus evaluation accounting for alternative routes of hydrate formation. The hydrate risk analysis was also conducted for produced natural gas at transport conditions. We have investigated the case study involving using the separated CO 2 for simultaneous safe long-term storage of CO 2 and release of methane for in situ hydrates located at the North Makassar Basin in offshore Indonesia. Utilization of CO 2 will require additive gases to increase gas permeability and reduce the blocking of sediments by new CO 2 -dominated hydrate. This analysis was conducted for variable content of nitrogen and H 2 S. We have concluded that the water dew-point-based method appears to severely underestimate the risk of hydrate formation; the maximum water concentration it allows in gas will be larger by a factor of eighteen than the one permitted by approaches that used water adsorption on hematite (rust) as the criterion. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Energy resources; Gas permeability; Gases; Hematite; Hydration; Natural gas; Natural gas fields; Offshore oil well production; Offshore pipelines; Petroleum deposits; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Transportation routes; Alternative routes; Hydrate formation; Long-term storage; Natural gas resources; Pipeline transport; Variable content; Water adsorption; Water concentrations; Gas hydrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054510081

The problem is presented in two levels. The first level is a minimization programming that minimizes operational cost and CO2 of generators. The CO2 is forwarded to the second level. In the second level, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is designed to capture CO2. The CO2 is combined with Hydrogen and makes Methane (CH4). The required Hydrogen is obtained from water electrolyzer that is supplied by the solar system. The capacity and size of water electrolyzer, solar system, and CCS is designed by the planning in the second level while this programming maximizes profit from selling Methane. As a result, the first level presents minimization programming (i.e., minimizing cost and CO2) and the second level presents maximization programming (i.e., maximizing profit). The programming is developed taking into account solar uncertainty. The stochastic programming is implemented to cope with uncertainties. The problem is formulated as binary mixed integer linear programming and solved by GAMS software.

This fact was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. From the measurements performed by MDR and DSC testing, the induction time (to) was analyzed in the frame of the Claxton–Liska model, whereas the kinetic behavior of the nonirradiated and pre-irradiated compounds were satisfactorily fitted with the Isayev–Deng and Kamal–Ryan models.

The experiments were performed in steady state conditions on a single cylinder research compression ignition engine with a bore of 85 mm and piston stroke of 90 mm, coupled with an electric dynamometer. The diesel engine with optimized compression ratio was equipped with a diesel fuel direct injection common rail system. A homogeneous mixture of air and hydrogen was formed using a port fuel injection. The influence of hydrogen share on total fuel energy was systematically investigated between limits given by the pure diesel operation and up to a maximum hydrogen share, reaching 98% by energy. The tested hydrogen share was constrained by practical limits at various loads between 4 and 16 bar of IMEP with simulation of the real turbocharger performance and at three engine speeds. It was observed that increase in the hydrogen share reduces emissions of CO2 and CO proportionally with decrease in carbon content in the fuel. Simultaneously, PM emissions in raw exhaust gas dropped continuously with increase in hydrogen share. NOx emissions for the highest H2 share dropped only slightly from the level of the diesel engine. The engine efficiency was slightly reduced, when operated with a highest share of hydrogen compared to the pure diesel operation. Based on experimental results a steady state performance and emissions maps of a turbocharged four cylinder hydrogen - diesel dual fueled engine were compiled. A particular implementation of a dual fuel H2 - diesel engine in a passenger van in a WLTP driving cycle was simulated. Two fueling strategies were compared. The simulations showed a potential of almost 70 percent reduction of the driving cycle CO2 emissions for the strategy using the highest hydrogen share, compared to the pure diesel operation.

The conflicting results of the few studies on freezing-induced changes on HM macronutrients led to different storage recommendations. We examined differences in macronutrients content of HM after long-term storage at -20°C compared with -80°C. Materials and Methods: Mature HM samples from 25 mothers of term and preterm infants were collected. Each sample was divided into six aliquots for storage at -20°C and -80°C for 4, 12, and 24 weeks. After thawing and homogenization, energy and macronutrients content were measured using an HM infrared spectroscopy analyzer. Results: A total of 150 HM samples were available for analysis. Thirteen samples were removed due to calibration errors. The final analysis was performed on 137 samples with validated results. Fat and energy content were consistently higher in the -80°C samples compared with the paired -20°C samples at each time point (p < 0.05). Comparison of the differences in macronutrients content over time (4 versus 24 weeks) revealed a significant loss of fat (0.3 g/100 mL [7.9%], p = 0.001) and energy (2.3 kcal/100 mL [3.3%], p = 0.03) in the -20°C group. Fat and protein were also significantly decreased over time in the -80°C group (by 0.14 g/100 mL [3%], p = 0.009, and 0.06 g/100 mL [6.4%], p = 0.02, respectively). Conclusions: Long-term storage of HM at -80°C is associated with better fat and energy preservation compared with storage at -20°C. These results may help construct evidence-based recommendations and guidelines for optimal HM storage. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","freezing; human milk; macronutrients; milk banking; nutrition","carbohydrate; fat; protein; lactose; adult; Article; breast milk; calibration; comparative study; controlled study; energy; evidence based practice; female; food freezing; freeze thawing; human; infant; infrared spectroscopy; low temperature; macronutrient; practice guideline; prematurity; priority journal; term birth; breast milk; caloric intake; chemistry; fat intake; freezing; newborn; protein intake; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Female; Freezing; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Lactose; Milk, Human; Nutrients; Premature Birth; Term Birth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064381647

Studies show that Nigeria has abandoned or depleted oil fields; it has large coal reserves that are potential sites for CO 2 storage. Five power plants with capacities of 1074, 675, 624, 480, and 191 MW were studied using the Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM) 9.5. The IECM 9.5 was calibrated using available data and some default values to model the performance and cost of retrofitting the power plants. The transport and storage system chosen was pipeline and enhance oil recovery (EOR). The results show that net plant efficiency, CO 2 emission rate, quantity of CO 2 captured, and CCS energy penalty are 35.78 ± 1.69%, 0.0668 ± 0.0138 kg MWh −1 , 0.4478 ± 0.0274 kg MWh −1 , and 0.2588 ± 0.0386%, respectively. The results also show that total capital requirement, cost of electricity, and percentage increase in cost of electricity were 1888.2 ± 336.9 $ kW −1 , 114.44 ± 10.15 $ MWh −1 , and 52.04 ± 3.58%, respectively. In the same manner, the cost of CO 2 avoided, cost of capture, and added cost of CCS were 84.442 ± 27.73 $ MWh −1 , 60.02 ± 22.51 $ tonne −1 , and 28.44 ± 10.16 $ MWh −1 , respectively. Further analysis shows that it would be advantageous to retrofit 1074 MW plants because this has a 46.51% increase in cost, which is lower than the cost for the other retrofitted plants. The total CO 2 emission rate dropped from 0.4282 ± 0.014 to 0.0668 ± 0.0138 kg MWh −1 ; this drop is significant as it shows that CCS can reduce the amount of CO 2 emitted from Nigeria. The study recommends that CCS is a viable CO 2 emission-reduction alternative but incentives must be put in place to cushion the high cost of electricity. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","carbon capture and storage (CCS); cost of retrofitting; energy penalty; higher plant capacity; Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM); natural gas-fired power plant; Nigeria","Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Coal; Coal storage; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Digital storage; Emission control; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Natural gasoline plants; Oil fields; Proven reserves; Retrofitting; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Energy penalties; Environmental control; Higher plants; Natural gas fired power plants; Nigeria; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062370218

Although there are several energy estimation models available in the literature, so far integration with Vehicle Routing Problems has been limited and without demonstrated accuracy. This paper introduces the Two-stage Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (2sEVRP) that incorporates improved energy consumption estimation by considering detailed topography and speed profiles. First, a method to calculate energy cost coefficients for the road network is outlined. Since the driving cycle is unknown, the model generates an approximation based on a linear function of mass, as the latter is only determined while routing. These coefficients embed information about topography, speed, powertrain efficiency and the effect of acceleration and braking at traffic lights and intersections. Secondly, an integrated two-stage approach is described, which finds the best paths between pairs of destinations and then finds the best routes including battery and time-window constraints. Energy consumption is used as objective function including payload and auxiliary systems. The road cost coefficients are aggregated to generate the path cost coefficients that are used in the routing problem. In this way it is possible to get a proper approximation of the complete driving cycle for the routes and accurate energy consumption estimation. Lastly, numerical experiments are shown based on the road network from Gothenburg-Sweden. Energy estimation is compared with real consumption data from an all-electric bus from a public transport route and with high-fidelity vehicle simulations. Routing experiments focus on trucks for urban distribution of goods. The results indicate that time and energy estimations are significantly more precise than existing methods. Consequently the planned routes are expected to be feasible in terms of energy demand and that charging stops are properly included when necessary. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","90B06; 90B10; 90B35; 90C11; 90C35; 90C59; Eco-routing; Electric vehicles; Energy consumption; Green logistics; Vehicle routing","Automobiles; Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Distribution of goods; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Logistics; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Vehicle routing; 90B06; 90B10; 90B35; 90C11; 90C35; 90C59; ECO routing; Green logistics; Commercial vehicles; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; energy use; estimation method; integrated approach; logistics; routing; transportation planning; Goteborg; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061356295

While hydrogen is still the most common fuel, hydrocarbon fuels offer several advantages including availability at a lower cost, higher storage density and existing infrastructure. This paper provides an overview for the significant potential benefits of using hydrocarbon fuels directly in a fuel cell system. Their use leads to a reduction in the capital cost due to the elimination of the fuel processor unit. The fundamentals, advantages, types of direct hydrocarbon fuel cells (DHFC), challenges and applications are discussed in this paper. The past and current status of research and development activities are addressed with emphasis on efficiency and exergy analyses. In spite of their high theoretical energy efficiency, technical challenges remain unsolved in DHFC systems. In high temperature hydrocarbon fueled operation, the deposition of carbon-based material leads to fuel cell degradation. In lower temperature fuel cells, electrode (mainly the anode) over-potentials and fuel crossover are still challenging. Therefore, the improvement and commercialization of these types of fuel cells will probably require the development of less or non-noble catalysts and reasonably functioning membranes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Catalysts; Direct hydrocarbon fuel cells; Exergy efficiency; Thermodynamic efficiency","Catalysts; Costs; Electrodes; Energy efficiency; Exergy; Gas fuel purification; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen storage; Carbon based materials; Exergy efficiencies; Fuel cell degradations; High temperature hydrocarbons; Higher storage density; Hydrocarbon fuel; Research and development; Thermodynamic efficiency; Fuel cells; catalyst; cost; energy efficiency; exergy; fuel cell; hydrocarbon; hydrogen; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061329945

Nowadays, research and development efforts are mainly focusing on advanced technologies to separate H2 and CO2 from a synthesis gas of a gasification-based power generation system. In this regard, membrane separation processes are attracting an increasing attention, due to their potential for a more cost-effective and environmental friendly CO2 capture compared to well-established solvent-based processes. A conceptual design and techno-economic analysis is presented of a pre-combustion CO2 capture process based on H2-selective polymeric membranes in an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant, including the water-gas-shift (WGS) system. The design approach is based on the selection of the most effective membrane separation process and economic optimization of operating conditions. The capture process is based on a three-stage membrane separation system, producing a hydrogen stream feeding the power generation unit and a liquid CO2 stream, ready for transport and geological storage. Considering a state-of-the-art polymeric membrane with a H2 to CO2 selectivity of 15 and H2 permeance of 300 GPU, the IGCC efficiency penalty states at around 5% pts when the separation process is operated with a pressure on membrane feed side of 70 bar, corresponding to an estimated cost of CO2 capture of 16.6 €/t CO2. A sensitivity analysis of operating pressure and membrane properties revealed that the cost of CO2 capture can be reduced to less than 15 €/t CO2 by moderately increasing the H2 to CO2 selectivity and adjusting the designed process accordingly. Additionally, a decrease in the feed-side pressure slightly disfavours the economic performance of CO2 capture for H2 permeances greater than 300 GPU. The membrane-based capture process compared most favourably in cost-effectiveness with the well-established solvent based Selexol process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","IGCC power plant; Membrane H2 separation; Pre-combustion CO2 capture; Process economics; Process optimization","Carbon dioxide; Combined cycle power plants; Conceptual design; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Economic analysis; Gas generators; Gasification; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Optimization; Petroleum prospecting; Polymeric membranes; Polymers; Precombustion; Sensitivity analysis; Separation; Water gas shift; CO2 capture; Environmental pollutions; Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle power plants; Membrane separation process; Power generation systems; Process economics; Research and development; Techno-Economic analysis; Coal combustion; carbon dioxide; coal; hydrogen; Article; combustion; desulfurization; electric power plant; energy recovery; gasification; membrane; membrane permeability; partial pressure; pressure; priority journal; process optimization; Carbon Dioxide; Cost Effectiveness; Economic Analysis; Gas Generators; Gasification; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060237827

The Swiss Energy Strategy aims at generating roughly one-third of the current electricity demand through intermittent renewables by 2050. This raises the need for flexible on-demand power production capabilities to balance the fluctuating generation. Next to batteries or pumped-storage hydroelectricity, decentralized gas-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plants have fast ramp-up times and can thus be used to balance the fluctuating production. Using biogas as fuel for the CHP plants minimizes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, biomass is subject to spatio-temporal variation that can limit the available fuel. In this work, a framework of geographic information system (GIS)-based models to assess the spatio-temporal potential of domestic biogas to balance fluctuating renewable energy production is proposed. Using this framework, the spatio-temporal biogas that can be fed into the gas grid is modeled to be 18.4PJ. By comparing this potential with the spatio-temporal residential heat demand and rooftop PV potential, we identify the spatio-temporal balancing potential of decentralized CHP plants in Switzerland. It is found that the balancing potential varies between districts and over the course of a year. During summer, the potential is limited due to lack of local heat demand. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ancillary services; Biogas; Geographic information system (GIS); Potential analysis","Biogas; Electric power generation; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Information systems; Information use; Renewable energy resources; Ancillary service; Combined heat and power; Intermittent energy source; Intermittent renewables; Potential analysis; Pumped-storage hydroelectricities; Renewable electricity production; Spatio-temporal variation; Cogeneration plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059688202

This study evaluated the potential of geothermal energy and heat recovery from residential wastewater to reduce the energy need of building-ventilation in cold climates. The performance of the mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) system in a multi-family building located in central Sweden was studied. The focus of the investigation was on reduction of frosting in the air handling unit during the coldest months. Three configurations of one air preheating system fed by two renewable heat sources, wastewater and geothermal energy, were studied. It was found that compared to building without an air preheating system, the suggested air preheating systems reduced the defrosting time to 25%. By controlling and maintaining the preheated air temperature to slightly above the defrosting start, air heat recovery efficiency of MVHR above 80% was achieved for 90% of the studied time during heating season when frosting occurs. The energy need for the circulation pumps in the suggested air preheating systems was 5% of the recovered thermal energy from wastewater. The simulation results suggested that the air preheating system using wastewater heat recovery with a temperature-stratified storage tank was the most efficient one among the studied systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Balanced mechanical ventilation; Energy saving; Geothermal heating; Renewables; Sustainability; Wastewater heat recovery","Air preheaters; Buildings; Defrosting; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Geothermal heating; Preheating; Sustainable development; Ventilation; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Air handling units; Building ventilations; Circulation pumps; Heat recovery efficiency; Mechanical ventilation; Renewables; Residential wastewaters; Thermal performance of buildings; Geothermal energy; alternative energy; building; energy conservation; geothermal power; heating; sustainability; ventilation; wastewater; air temperature; article; artificial ventilation; cold climate; controlled study; energy conservation; energy recovery; family planning; geothermal energy; heating; season; simulation; storage; Sweden; waste water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058947734

However, some experts and citizens worry about the integrity of carbon dioxide storage sites due to the possibility of future leakage. We introduce a two-period model where two emission mitigation technologies are available to society in the first period: CCS, with a risk of carbon dioxide leakage in the second period, and a riskless mitigation alternative, such as renewable energy. We first solve the model assuming that society does not know what the future rate of leakage will be. We then solve the model assuming that society will eventually learn the actual leakage rate. We find that, in a trading market in period one, reductions of CO2 emissions through CCS should generate a less than proportional amount of CO2 allowances. Estimates from simulations, using a coarse range of parameters, indicate that the discount factor of CCS allowances lies in the range (0.72, 1).

However, the equipment commonly used for these measurements is expensive and bulky, and therefore, it is not possible to have enough spatial resolution. In addition, many of the measurement methods do not provide real-time information to deliver to citizens in a timely manner. In some works, these issues have been handled through the deployment of wireless sensor networks based on low cost technologies. The improvement of the spatial and temporal resolution implies the increase in the amount of information to be transmitted and stored. For this reason, this paper presented a method for data reduction through a dynamic subsampling of the measured variable, data fusion from several sensors for the same variable, and data scaling taking into account the variables range. The reduction of data is implemented to save energy, reduce the transmission time, keep the channel available, and save storage space. The method is validated using a low-cost monitoring station that combines environmental, particulate matter (PM), gas, electromagnetic radiation, and inertial sensors to be transmitted in a 50-byte reduced packet using an LoRa network. The subsampling adjustment was developed for the PM signal. The results show a reduction in the volume of stored data and the relevant information is not affected. The transmitted data packet can be reduced from 96 to 50 bytes, and sampling can be reduced to 4% of the original sampling without affecting the trend of the PM information. © 2014 IEEE.","Data reduction; environmental monitoring; long range; particulate matter (PM); public healthcare; wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Cost reduction; Data fusion; Digital storage; Electromagnetic waves; Gas detectors; Internet of things; Monitoring; Temperature sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Amount of information; Environmental monitoring system; Environmental variables; Long ranges; Particulate Matter; Public healthcares; Real-time information; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Data reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055880610

Our approaches assume the asynchronous communication model and small messages having O(log (n)) bits. These assumptions directly fit the battery powered wireless networks such as wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first distributed weighted matching algorithm which benefits from augmentation of augmenting paths having size larger than 3 for these networks.

Dual energy CT (DECT) allows improved tissue characterization compared to conventional CT. Purpose: To explore whether DECT might aid regional fat density discrimination. Material and Methods: We included patients who had completed a non-enhanced cardiac CT scan, CT coronary angiography (CTCA), and a delayed enhancement CT. Attenuation levels (Hounsfield units [HU]) were assessed at the epicardial, paracardial, visceral, and subcutaneous fat. The number of coronary segments with disease (SIS) was calculated. Results: A total of 36 patients were included in the analysis. Twenty-six (72%) patients had evidence of obstructive disease at CCTA and 25 (69%) patients had evidence of previous myocardial infarction. At non-contrast CT, we did not identify significant attenuation differences between epicardial, paracardial, subcutaneous, and visceral fat depots (−110.8 ± 9 HU, vs. −113.7 ± 9 HU, vs. −114.7 ± 8 HU, vs. −113.8 ± 11 HU, P = 0.36). Significant attenuation differences were detected between fat depots at mid and low energy levels, both at CTCA and delayed-enhancement scans (P < 0.05 for all). Epicardial fat showed the least negative attenuation, irrespective of the acquisition mode; epicardial fat evaluated at 40 keV was related to the SIS (r = 0.37, P = 0.03). Conclusions: In this study, regional fat depots amenable to examination during thoracic CT scans have distinctive regional attenuation values. Furthermore, such differences were better displayed using contrast-enhanced monochromatic imaging at low energy levels. © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2018.","adipose tissue; arteriosclerosis; Cardiac; CT angiography; inflammation; tissue characterization","Angiography; Heart; Pathology; Tissue; Adipose tissue; arteriosclerosis; Cardiac; CT angiography; inflammation; Tissue characterization; Computerized tomography; adipose tissue; adult; artery occlusion; Article; body mass; cardiac imaging; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; carditis; clinical article; contrast enhancement; coronary angiography; coronary artery atherosclerosis; dual energy computed tomography; epicardial fat; female; heart infarction; heart muscle perfusion; human; intra-abdominal fat; lipid storage; male; middle aged; priority journal; retrospective study; subcutaneous fat; tissue characterization; computed tomographic angiography; coronary artery disease; diagnostic imaging; image enhancement; procedures; prospective study; contrast medium; Adipose Tissue; Computed Tomography Angiography; Contrast Media; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Retrospective Studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052224571

Motivated by a recent finding on the role of strained 1T′-MX2 transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers on hydrogen evolution reaction (Putungan et al 2015 Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 17, 21702-21708), we probed methanes's binding properties on three selected sites: S1 (elongated bond lengths with Mo), S2 (shortened bond lengths with Mo) and MoTop. It is found that methane does not bind with S1 and S2, but rather adsorbs on MoTop with relatively weak adsorption energy. Application of isotropic tensile biaxial strain tend to improve methane's adsorption, but not until a seemingly 'turn on' strain is reached (at 10%) that a significant increase in the binding energy is reached. It is suggested that strain reinforces states in the vicinity of the Fermi level, thereby improving states hybridization leading to better adsorbate-substrate interaction. Furthermore, strain helps enhance charge transfer from 1T′-MoS2 to methane, improving ionic interaction between the two.

The bed removal efficiency remained above 96% for all mass loads and COD mass removal rates increased from 6.8 g COD/(m2∙day) for the lowest load to 34.5 g COD/(m2∙day) for the highest load. The percentage of tests with storage evidence decreased from 85% to 10% with increasing mass loads and the responses of the microbial community to the acetate pulse showed an adaptation to the feast-famine conditions, through storage mechanisms, for lower loads, and a metabolic shift to the use of COD for growth for higher loads. Heterotrophic biomass yield values varied from 0.54–0.56 g COD/g COD for low mass loads to 0.69–0.71 for higher mass loads, indicating that greater substrate availably triggers growth and reduces the occurrence of storage. Storage yield values supported this trend varying between 0.89 and 0.94 with increasing mass loads. Given the significant storage evidence obtained in the present study, it is suggested that a modified modelling architecture, which includes storage mechanisms, should be considered in future simulations of CW systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Constructed wetlands; Heterotrophic growth yield; Oxygen uptake rate; Respirometry; Storage mechanisms","Biofilms; Food supply; Constructed wetlands; Heterotrophic growth; Oxygen uptake rates; Respirometry; Storage mechanism; Wetlands; bacterium; biochemistry; chemical oxygen demand; computer simulation; constructed wetland; growth; microbial community; numerical model; oxygen; Article; biofilm; biomass energy; constructed wetland; evolutionary adaptation; heterotrophy; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; respirometry; simulation; storage; storage mechanism; bacterial phenomena and functions; biofilm; biomass; heterotrophy; procedures; sewage; theoretical model; wetland; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Biofilms; Biomass; Heterotrophic Processes; Models, Theoretical; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058802560

The developments in information and communication technology, the new world order and changed dimensions of trade, has revealed the concept of electronic money. This study evaluates virtual currency in line with the attitude of the European Central Bank. An integrated approach to discuss it in terms of energy management, risk management, and technology in real and financial sector transactions is chosen. An overview of attitudes of world countries towards virtual currency shows that it is not possible to make a standard classification yet. It can be deduced that an increase in income level and human development level draws societies away from repressive mindset against virtual money. Increase in electricity usage per capita is parallel with these and as for the relationship between virtual currency transactions and electricity usage, there is a more liberal attitude towards virtual currency in more technological societies. From the perspective of Turkey, electronic money is defined in Article 3 of Law No 6493 on Payment and Security Settlement Systems, Payment Services and Electronic Money Institutions. In Turkey, electronic money and all associated electronic money transactions are subject to regulation. This study examines the electronic money that has not yet been fully integrated to the world financial system and Turkish financial system. As in the example of bitcoin, the concept of electronic money is discussed in terms of adaptation to provide basic functions of money. Within this framework, electronic money and electronic money derivatives are evaluated with examples from the world within the scope of the effects of the derivative and option markets on the uncertainty and predictability. It also evaluates the innovations that can be brought to payment systems if the electronic money provides the basic functions of money. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2019.

Design/methodology/approach: This research emphasised the use of the data acquisition system housing various temperature sensors, power metres, flow metre, ambient temperature and relative humidity sensor to determine electrical energy consumption and useful thermal energy gained by the hot water in a geyser and storage tanks of residential ASHP water heaters. The load factors, average power and electrical energy consumptions for the 150 L high-pressure geyser, a 150 L split and integrated type ASHP water heaters were evaluated based on the controlled volume (150, 50 and 100 L) of daily hot water drawn off. Findings: The results depicted that the average electrical energy consumed and load factors of the summer months for the geyser, split and integrated type ASHP water heaters were 312.3, 111.7 and 121.1 kWh and 17.9, 10.2 and 16.7 per cent, respectively. Finally, the simple payback period for both the split and integrated type ASHP water heaters were determined to be 3.9 and 5.2 years, respectively. By the application of the Eskom’s projected tariff hikes over the years, the payback periods for the split and integrated ASHP water heaters could be reduced to 3.3 and 4.1 years, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The experiments were conducted in a controlled outdoor research facility as it was going to be of great challenge in conducting both experiments simultaneously in a specific home. The category of the different types of ASHP water heaters was limited to one due to the cost implication. The experiment was also conducted at a single location, which is not a full representation of all the ambient conditions of the different regions of South Africa. Practical implications: The experiments were done with a specific controlled volume of hot water drawn off from each of the three hot water heating devices. The experiments was structuring controlled to a specific volume of hot water drawn off and at specific period of the day and hence to not cater for random drawers and intermittent drawn off. Social implications: The findings help to assure homeowners that irrespective of the type of ASHP water heaters installed in their residence, they can be guarantee of year-round performance and a favourable payback period provided their hot water consumption is over 200 L per day. Also, although the split type ASHP water heater performed better than the integrated system the cost of installation and maintenance will be higher in a split type in comparison to the integrated type. Finally, by successful implementation of either of the ASHP water heaters the home owner can substantially save of his hot water bill. Originality/value: The experimental design and methodology is the first of its kind to be conducted in South Africa. The results and interpretation were obtained from original data collected from the set of experiments conducted. Also, the authors are able to show that the introduction of back up element in an ASHP unit to run simultaneously with the vapour compression refrigeration cycles of the ASHP can reduce the COP of the overall system. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Air source heat pump; Geyser; Global warming potential; Load factor; Payback period","Coefficient of performance; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Geysers; Global warming; Hot water distribution systems; Housing; Investments; Pumps; Refrigeration; Water; Water heaters; Air source heat pump water heaters; Coefficient of performances (COP); Electrical energy consumption; Global warming potential; Load factors; Payback periods; Temperature and relative humidity; Vapour compression refrigerations; Air source heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060476660

Biomass energy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is the negative emission technology (NET) given most attention in a number of integrated assessment model studies and in the latest IPCC reports. However, less attention has been given to governance aspects of NETs. This study aims to identify pragmatic ways forward for BECCS, through synthesizing the literature relevant to accounting and rewarding BECCS, and its relation to the Paris Agreement. BECCS is divided into its two elements: biomass and CCS. Calculating net negative emissions requires accounting for sustainability and resource use related to biomass energy production, processing and use, and interactions with the global carbon cycle. Accounting for the CCS element of BECCS foremost relates to the carbon dioxide capture rate and safe underground storage. Rewarding BECCS as a NET depends on the efficiency of biomass production, transport and processing for energy use, global carbon cycle feedbacks, and safe storage of carbon dioxide, which together determine net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. Sustainable biomass production is essential, especially with regard to trade-offs with competing land use. Negative emissions have an added value compared to avoided emissions, which should be reflected in the price of negative emission ‘credits’, but must be discounted due to global carbon cycle feedbacks. BECCS development will depend on linkages to carbon trading mechanisms and biomass trading. Key policy insights A standardized framework for sustainable biomass should be adopted. Countries should agree on a standardized framework for accounting and rewarding BECCS and other negative emission technologies. Early government support is indispensable to enable BECCS development, scale-up and business engagement. BECCS projects should be designed to maximize learning across various applications and across other NETs. BECCS development should be aligned with modalities of the Paris Agreement and market mechanisms. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon capture and storage; emissions accounting; Negative emissions; Paris agreement; rewarding; sustainable biomass","accountability; bioenergy; biomass power; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; emissions trading; environmental economics; governance approach; international agreement; sustainability; technology adoption; trade-off; waste technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055721714

The structural, electronic and binding properties, metal binding and nH 2 (n = 1–10) adsorption states of these systems are studied in detail with the Mulliken analysis, charge density differences, and partial density of states. To enhance the number of the adsorbed H 2 molecules per metal atom, and also to generate the better initial coordinates for reducing the simulation time, we present two masthematical algorithms (CLICH and RICH). The tested results on BC 3 sheet and boron-doped graphene (C 30 B 2 ) show that these algorithms can increase the number of adsorbed hydrogen molecules by minimizing the computational time. It is seen that nH 2 (n = 1–10) adsorbed Li,/Na and/Mg-decorated BC 3 single- and double-sided systems are industrial materials for hydrogen storage technology, their adsorption energies fall into the acceptable adsorption energy range (0.20–0.60 eV/H 2 ). It is concluded from the optimized geometries and charge density differences for the higher number of H 2 adsorbed systems that not only decorated metal atom but also the sheet plays an important role in hydrogen storage process, because the boron atoms in the sheet expand the induced electric field between the adatoms and BC 3 sheet. From Mulliken analysis, there is a charge transfer mechanism between H 2 molecules and metal atoms. Moreover, the resonant peaks for the sheet, metal atoms and H 2 molecules in partial density of states curves indicate the possible hybridizations.

This information is not sufficient to predict the frozen system behavior under a different storage temperature, or under the real, dynamic conditions of the actual cold chain. For this purpose, a systematic kinetic study is essential; additionally, the real uncertainty of model parameters needs to be taken into account, in order to proceed to realistic shelf life estimations. In this review work, published findings on kinetic data of deterioration of frozen food of plant origin were analyzed. Kinetic parameters (e.g., activation energy, shelf life, etc.) were extracted and some of them incorporated to a further investigation. The scope is to provide a critical assessment and a comprehensive meta-analysis of the literature information on quality loss modeling of frozen foods. Therefore, common quality indices for specific systems are reviewed, fundamental methodologies used to build kinetic models are assessed, and alternative approaches to improve practical applications of these models are proposed. Alternative methodologies are described in order to take into account the calculated uncertainty of models’ parameters when assessing the remaining shelf life of the product at any point within the cold chain.

MIL-88 series (abbreviated as MIL-88s) including MIL-88A, B, C, D satisfies high flexibility and stability; it, therefore, may become a suitable candidate for hydrogen storage based on the adsorption. In this work, the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for the pressures below 100 bar showed that in MIL-88 series MIL-88D exhibits the highest absolute and excess gravimetric H2 capacities of 5.15 wt% and 4.03 wt% at 77 K, and 0.69 wt% and 0.23 wt% at 298 K, respectively. Meanwhile, MIL-88A has the highest absolute and excess volumetric H2 uptakes of 50.69 g/L and 44.32 g/L at 77 K, and 6.97 g/L and 2.49 g/L at 298 K. These results are comparable to the best MOFs for hydrogen storage to date. It was shown that the hydrogen uptakes depend on the special surface area and the pore volume of the MIL-88s, apart from depending on the type of the ligand. By utilizing the van der Waals dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidated the interaction between the H2 molecule and the MIL-88 series. The adsorption energy, as well as the isosteric heat of adsorption, revealed that the H2—MIL-88C interaction is strongest despite its lowest storage capacity. This observation implies an implicit role of electronic structure on the H2 adsorption capacities at the considered conditions. However, at the low temperature, the DFT calculations could elucidate the preferred adsorption sites of hydrogen molecule on the surface of MIL-88s.

The most substantial overlap between the electronic density of states (DOS) of the MIL-88C and the DOS of the H2 molecule leads to the most robust interaction between the H2 molecule and the MIL-88C. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Adsorption; Chemical bonds; Density functional theory; Electronic density of states; Electronic structure; Intelligent systems; Molecules; Monte Carlo methods; Temperature; Van der Waals forces; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption energies; Dispersion-corrected density functional; Electronic density; Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; Hydrogen molecule; Isosteric heat of adsorption; Special surface area; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056820650

Orange oil (OrO), peppermint oil (PpO), sucrose esters with mainly sucrose monostearate (S1670), and sucrose esters with mainly sucrose monopalmitate (P1670) were employed. The mean droplet sizes of emulsions were strongly dependent on flavor oil types, flavor oil concentrations, sucrose ester concentrations, and stirring speeds, but were lesser dependent on sucrose ester types. Higher sucrose ester concentrations and stronger convection created smaller oil droplets. The smallest mean droplet size of ~200 nm was achieved by the formulation of OrO emulsions containing 10.0 wt% oil, 7.5 wt% sucrose esters, and < 1 wt% ethanol. OrO emulsions stabilized by sucrose esters exhibited good physical stability over one month storage while PpO emulsions destabilized rapidly, suggested by Ostwald ripening.

For this purpose, Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized and coated by MCM-41. 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane (CPTMS) was used as a surface modifying agent for covalent immobilization of L-ASNase on the magnetic nanoparticles. The chemical structure; thermal, morphological, and magnetic properties; chemical composition; and zeta potential value of Fe 3 O 4 @MCM-41-Cl were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), and zeta-potential measurement. The immobilization efficiency onto Fe 3 O 4 @MCM-41-Cl was detected as 63%. The reusability, storage, pH, and thermal stabilities of the immobilized L-ASNase were investigated and compared to that of soluble one. The immobilized enzyme maintained 42.2% of its original activity after 18 cycles of reuse. Furthermore, it was more stable towards pH and temperature compared with soluble enzyme. The Michaelis–Menten kinetic properties of immobilized L-ASNase showed a lower V max and a similar K m compared to soluble L-ASNase. Immobilized enzyme had around 47 and 32.5% residual activity upon storage a period of 28 days at 4 and 25 °C, respectively.

The safe and efficient operation of these systems is crucial, where digital tools, such as monitoring, hydro-informatics, and optimization algorithms, are key approaches that can play an important role on support decisions. This paper presents a hybrid optimization method to improve the energy efficiency of a water supply system towards a more sustainable water management concerning the water-energy nexus. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the pumping schedule during the day. Knowing the water consumption a priori, it is possible to define the optimal pump status for a specific timeframe (e.g. every 1 h), minimizing the operation costs, and also the energy consumption and associated carbon dioxide emissions. Knowledge-based mechanisms, like introducing known feasible solutions in the population and selective mutation mechanisms, were introduced in order to boost the algorithm convergence. A model of the water network developed in the hydraulic simulator EPANET was used to evaluate the solutions. All the physical constraints of the water supply system (e.g. hydraulic compliances) and water demands must be met for each solution, including the level limits of the water storage tanks. From the obtained solutions, it is found that optimizing the pump scheduling can improve the energy efficiency up to 15% in average (maximum of 25%) comparatively to the real operation, although this value can severely decrease if a conservative approach is assumed of maintaining more water stored in the tanks (low-risk approach). Similar improvements were achieved for cost and carbon dioxide emissions. Besides knowledge-based mechanisms, the analysis of the water storage risk was also an innovative outcome of this paper. Finally, digital tools can be used to optimize the system with minimal investment in equipment or physical intervention, although optimal solutions depend on water availability, water demand, and water storage risk. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO 2 emissions; Cost; Energy; Optimization; Pump scheduling; Water supply systems","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Digital devices; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Hydraulic machinery; Investments; Knowledge based systems; Optimization; Pumps; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Scheduling; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Water supply systems; Water tanks; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emissions; Conservative approaches; Energy; Hybrid optimization method; Optimization algorithms; Pump scheduling; Sustainable water management; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059560365

We label as V n the respective vacancy where n carbon atoms have been removed from the pristine C 39 H 9 structure. The results show that V 2 , V 4 , V 6 and V 9 are the most stable vacancies on the ZTC structure. This result agrees with many other studies. Besides, the most stable vacancy of ZTC structure is when nine carbon atoms are removed (V 9 ) from the ZTC structure. The formation of pentagon rings in the reconstruction of the ZTC vacancy give drastic effect on the energetics stability. Therefore, the formation of pentagon rings eliminates the dangling bonds thus lowering the energy formation. It is also carried out the decoration of ZTC vacancy with Lithium and Calcium atoms, this is the way to use de ZTC vacancy decorated as a medium for hydrogen storage. The results show that the ZTC vacancy decorated with 3 Lithium atoms can adsorb a maximum of nine hydrogen molecules (3 hydrogen molecules per Lithium atom). This gives a gravimetric storage capacity of 4.44 wt percent (wt. %), which is not enough for meeting DOE gravimetric target. On the other hand, to reach DOE gravimetric target, the study of ZTC vacancy decorated with 3 Calcium atoms is carried out, which can adsorb maximum of fifteen hydrogen molecules (5 hydrogen molecules per Calcium atom), this gives gravimetric storage capacity of 5.81 wt %, which meet DOE gravimetric targets, besides the binding energy of hydrogen molecules on ZTC vacancy decorated with 3 Calcium is calculated. These energies are in the range 0.2453–0.2053 eV/H 2 , which are desirable energies for hydrogen adsorption. This is demonstrated by building isotherm adsorption path.

The concentration of diisocyanate induces the hard segment (HS) in the main architecture of PUs which decides the viscoelastic properties of the polymers. A balanced ratio of viscoelastic properties ultimately determines the adhesion strength. The composition of the polymers consists of a blend of macrodiol of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene and polypropylene glycol with different molecular weights. Isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) is used to develop the urethane linkages by maintaining its contribution from 28 to 67% as HS contents. It determines the adhesion strength of the final product. The adhesion strength is evaluated by texture analyzer and 180° peel test. The probe tack analysis shows maximum adhesion energy of 156.2 J cm−2 and 180° peel test shows 18.80 N/25 mm peel force.

However, SCIG is not the best type of WP in which it has a harmful impact on the stability of power systems. Therefore, with increase in the loads especially at transient events, the SCIG will lead to system instability. Hence, it is necessary to increase the penetration level of WP by using more efficient generators, such as the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). At transient events such as increasing in the loads causes fluctuation of frequency and voltage of power systems. So, it is necessary to use controlled energy storage units to improve the stability of WP. The system used for studying consists of a grid connected to 25 kV bus through a step-down transformer and transmission line supplied initially by SCIG-based WP then supported by DFIG to increase penetration level and covers the increase in the loads. The superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) units are proficient in response, efficiency, and lifetime in contrast to another category of energy storage systems, which make it a favored option for renewable energy. If SMES is combined with DFIG and SCIG, it increases the energy capacity of the total system. The SMES-controller is based on fuzzy logic control (FLC). The models of SMES, SCIG-based WP, and DFIG-based WP are demonstrated with MATLAB/SIMULINK, and the results illustrate the success of the proposed control to minimizing the voltage and frequency fluctuations during the transient events. Also, the model illustrates that the performance of DFIG on voltage and frequency stability is better than that of SCIG. © 2019, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","Controlled-energy storage system (CESS); Double fed induction generator (DFIG); Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC); Squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG); Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES); Wind power (WP)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072866637

It further makes possible the introduction of energy conservation, reduction and optimization. To achieve this for an off-grid system, or for numerous research sites, requires the use of remote energy monitoring where various parameters may be visually reviewed from anywhere and anytime using an operational internet connection. Various commercial products exist to fulfil this need that may prove expensive and cumbersome to use. The purpose of this paper is to present a cost-effective remote energy monitoring system using the ESP8266 NodeMCU. The research site was the city of Cape Town that is known for its Mediterranean climate. Results indicate that a simple data logging interface circuit, a ESP8266 NodeMCU, an ADC, a 3.3 V regulator, a LED lamp and a reliable WiFi network is all that is required to monitor the energy yield of a pico-solar system along with the ambient temperature. Watt Hours per day produced over a 6-month period by a 10 W PV module is shown along with the cloud cover percentage. Average Watt hours per day for July and August was 39,3 Wh/day and for October and November it was 51,8 Wh/day. It is recommended that more of these cost-effective remote energy monitoring systems be deployed across a number of research sites to enable the collection of reliable empirical data that can be used to optimize the design of off-grid solar energy systems. © BEIESP.","Cloud storage; Data logging; PV; Renewable",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065239829

Therefore, this paper proposes a method to strengthen the stability of a microgrid system by using planning to control the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). The proposed method aims (i) to forecast power of the system based on the previous information by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), (ii) to analyze the stability and to select the operation mode for BESS by using load flow analysis, and (iii) to control the BESS according to the appropriate process from part (i) and part (ii) for enhancing the system stability. The IEEE 13 node standard test system has been used to evaluate the proposed method, and the system has been modified to the off-grid system which uses hybrid renewable energy resources including wind and solar energy sources. The simulation was performed using MATLAB. By using the proposed method, the simulation results show that the system stability obtaining from the proposed method is better than the conventional controlling method because the proposed method can maintain the voltage in the range belong to the IEEE 1547 standard.

The proposed model includes three levels: the first level is made of the utility grid, and it can send or receive energy from the second level. The second level is formed as a common level that is equipped with a wind turbine, battery energy storage, and a diesel generator. The second level can exchange energy with both the first and third levels. The third level is formed with a set of buildings with different loading patterns, and some of them are also equipped with solar panels. The third level can send or receive energy from the second level. The second level is a common level between two other levels. The proposed planning minimizes the cost of consumed energy by houses in the third level through optimal utilization and management of all levels. The problem optimizes the power between levels 1 and 2, the power between levels 2 and 3, the charging-discharging pattern of the battery in level 2, and the operation pattern of the diesel generator in level 2. The plan optimally utilizes both wind and solar resources (in levels 2 and 3) to minimize the energy cost and deals with their intermittency nature by means of stochastic programming. The plan is also designed to operate under contingency conditions when the utility grid (first level) is out of access. In such a situation, the problem utilizes the available technologies in levels 2 and 3 (i.e., wind, solar, battery, and diesel) to supply the houses in the third level. The diesel generator plays a major role under contingency and emergency conditions to maintain the resiliency of the system. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Energy management; Energy management systems; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Wind turbines; Battery energy storage; Contingency operations; Emergency conditions; Home energy managements; Operation patterns; Optimal utilization; Renewable energies; Storage technology; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062825983

This neutron dose is primarily associated with an increased risk of secondary cancer after treatment. Neutron detection in proton therapy has previously, to a large extent, been based on the use of passive detectors or detectors of large physical size which are not applicable for measurements inside phantoms. In this study, we present the first application of a neutron detector based on registration of radiation induced effects in Static Random Access Memories (SRAMs) which enables in-phantom fast neutron measurements. Measurements were performed in a water phantom irradiated by a 178 MeV proton pencil beam in a setup mimicking internally produced neutrons in pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy. A neutron energy response model was developed for the SRAM detector to increase the accuracy of measurements in radiation fields with a broad range of neutron energies, and thereby make the detector applicable in the proton therapy setting. FLUKA Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and thermal neutron measurements with thermoluminescence detectors (TLDs) were conducted to evaluate the SRAM detector performance. Both experimental results (SRAM detector and TLDs) and MC simulations indicated a steep decrease in the neutron fluence with increasing lateral distance from the beam axis, while less variation was observed with depth. At Bragg peak depth, experimental values of fast neutron dose (H*(10)) were reduced from 1.4 mSv/Gy at 5.2 cm lateral distance to the beam axis to 0.22 mSv/Gy at 13.7 cm lateral distance. The MC simulations also showed that the SRAM detection threshold of 3 MeV was sufficiently low to capture approximately 90% of the neutron dose in PBS proton therapy. The differences in detector response due to variations in the neutron energy spectrum were small (<10%), and may be corrected using position-specific calibration factors. The results demonstrate the potential for estimating spatial out-of-field neutron dose based on the SRAM detector measurements in combination with the neutron energy response model. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Neutron detector; Neutron dose; Neutron fluence; Proton therapy","Dosimetry; Monte Carlo methods; Neutron detectors; Neutron irradiation; Neutrons; Phantoms; Proton beams; Radiation effects; Respiratory mechanics; Static random access storage; Accuracy of measurements; Neutron dose; Neutron energy spectrum; Neutron fluences; Proton therapy; Radiation-induced effects; Static random access memory; Thermoluminescence detectors; Proton beam therapy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060354872

PEDOT:PSS films exhibit anisotropic conductivities originating from the interplay of film deposition processes and chemical structure. The previous studies found that high boiling point solvent treated PEDOT:PSS exhibits an anisotropy of 3–4 orders magnitude. Even though both the in-plane and out-of-plane conductivities are important for the device performance, the out-of-plane conductivity is rarely studied due to the complexity with the experiment procedure. Cellulose-based paper or films can also exhibit anisotropic behavior due to the combination of their intrinsic fibric structure and film formation process. We have previously developed a conductive paper based on PEDOT:PSS and cellulose which could be used as the electrodes in energy storage devices. In this work we developed a novel measurement set-up for studying the anisotropy of the charge transport in such composite materials. A tool with two parallel plates mounted with spring loaded probes was constructed enabling probing both lateral and vertical directions and resistances from in-plane and out-of-plane directions to be obtained. The measurement results were then input and analyzed with a model based on a transformation method developed by Montgomery, and thus the in-plane and out-of-plane conductivities could be detangled and derived. We also investigated how the conductivity anisotropy depends on the microstructure of the cellulose template onto which the conductive polymer self-organizes. We show that there is a relatively small difference between the in-plane and out-of-plane conductivities which is attributed to the unique 3D-structure of the composites. This new knowledge gives a better understanding of the possibilities and limitations for using the material in electronic and electrochemical devices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anisotropic conductivity; Cellulose; Composite material; Four-point probe; PEDOT:PSS","Anisotropy; Cellulose; Cellulose films; Composite materials; Probes; Anisotropic conductivity; Electrochemical devices; Electronic and ionic conductivity; Film-deposition process; Four point probe; PEDOT:PSS; Poly(3 ,4-ethylenedioxythiphene); Poly(styrene sulfonate); Conducting polymers; Anisotropy; Cellulose; Composites; Conductivity; Film; Measurement; Measuring Instruments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060026237

The objective of the current study was to develop a versatile microbial TTI based on the violacein formation, a violet pigment produced by the microorganism Janthinobacterium sp. during early growth, depending on temperature and intrinsic properties of the growth medium. The TTI system consisted of Tryptic Soy Agar enriched with 1% glycerol, spot-inoculated with the bacterium. Input parameters were the storage temperature, the pH of the medium, the initial concentration of the microorganism and the volume of the spot. Image analysis was used to estimate the color change of the spots. Luminosity (L⁎) parameter described the color change adequately. The Baranyi model was used to fit the violacein kinetics data (L⁎ curve) estimating the TTI's endpoint, i.e., the time at which the violet color occurred. Survival analysis was used to analyze the endpoint data assessing the activation energy, Ea TTI, and the TTI's endpoint at a reference temperature (tTTI,ref endpoint). The Ea TTI and tTTI,ref endpoint (Tref = 0 °C) parameters ranged between 65.1–110.3 kJ/mol and 10.1–107.6, respectively. Based on the estimated Ea TTI and tTTI,ref endpoint parameters, a decision can be made on the most suitable combination of pH, initial concentration and spot quantity for monitoring the impact of time-temperature profile of different foods on the occurrence of spoilage. The TTI was validated for spoilage of minced beef meat under isothermal and dynamic storage conditions using data generated in this study.

Consequently, market players might suffer great monetary losses for not being able to follow their day-ahead schedule and/or deliver the scheduled reserves. In order to bridge the gap between very detailed low-level battery charging constraints and high-level battery operation models used in the literature, this paper examines a dependence of battery charging ability on its state of energy. It proposes a laboratory procedure, which can be used for any battery type and technology, to obtain this dependence. It also formulates an accurate linear battery charging model, which closely approximates the real-life battery charging constraints. The proposed battery charging model is compared against the models commonly used in the literature. Battery operation schedules obtained by all the models are compared against experimentally obtained results in order to assess the value of the proposed model in real life. © 2018 IEEE","Battery charging; Battery energy storage; Electricity market; Laboratory verification","Battery storage; Commerce; Investments; Power markets; Secondary batteries; Battery energy storage; Battery operation; Investment models; Laboratory procedures; Laboratory verification; Market clearing; State of the art; System operation; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055021058

Presently, the experimental sorption curves of lyophilized Arbutus unedo L. fruit powder (LP), determined at 20, 30 and 40 °C with the standard static-gravimetric method, were fitted to six isotherm models (Kühn, Caurie, Smith, Halsey, Oswin and GAB).

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation was used to evaluate the net isosteric heat (Qst) of water adsorption through the Halsey model in the studied temperature range. Qst and the differential entropy values decreases trongly as the moisture content increase, varying from 6.771 to 52.337 kJ mol−1and from 18.942 to 151.4 k J mol−1, respectively, and could be well adjusted by an empirical exponential relationship. The value of Gibbs free energy is found to be (−1.251 k J mol−1).

To this end, the drying process is critical in reducing sludge mass and volume, thereby lowering transport and storage costs. Solar energy is an alternative for minimizing costs of the drying process. This study evaluated drying landfill leachate-derived sludge using a solar still with and without peripheral systems to enhance thermal heat input. Sludge drying was most successful when using all peripheral systems (i.e., solar air preheater, extractor, and solar collector), where an accumulated solar energy of 241.6 kJ/kg produced 20 g of sludge mass. When only using the solar air preheater and extractor, 226.1 kJ/kg were needed to achieve 35 g of sludge mass. Results were poorer and took comparatively longer to reach suitable dryness levels when no peripheral systems were used (310 kJ/kg, 28 g) or when drying took place outside of the solar still (751 kJ/kg, 28 g). Notably, the base of the solar drier was hotter (49.6°C peak) when the solar collector was used, and the thermal efficiency of the solar air preheater was 20.7%. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38: 345–353, 2019. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","coagulation; drying; landfill leachate; sludge; solar energy","Air preheaters; Coagulation; Collector efficiency; Distillation; Drying; Leachate treatment; Solar energy; Solar heating; American Institute of Chemical Engineers; Drying process; Dryness levels; Landfill leachates; Minimizing costs; sludge; Sludge management; Thermal efficiency; Sludge disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053843302

The controller determines the optimal control commands of the actuators by minimising a cost function over a receding horizon. With our approach, the velocity-tracking error is minimised while keeping the fuel economy of the system high. The hydrostatic drive transmission system studied in this article is a typical commercial work machine, that is, there is no energy storage or alternative power source in the system (a nonhybrid hydrostatic drive transmission). We evaluate success with a validated simulation model of the hydrostatic drive transmission of a municipal tractor. In our experiments, a detailed system model is used both in the system simulation and in the prediction phase of the nonlinear model predictive control. The use of a detailed model in the nonlinear model predictive control framework places our design as a benchmark for controlling nonhybrid hydrostatic drive transmissions, when compared to solutions using simplified models or computationally less intensive control methods as in earlier work by the authors. Our nonlinear model predictive control approach enables numerically robust optimisation convergence with the utilised complex nonlinear model. Above all, this is accomplished with stabilising terminal constraints and distinctive terminal cost, both based on an optimal steady-state solution. In addition, a simple method to generate initial guesses for optimisation is introduced. When compared with the performance of a controller based on quasi-static models, our results show notable improvement in velocity tracking while maintaining high fuel economy. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that framing energy management as a nonlinear model predictive control provides a flexible and rigorous framework for fast velocity tracking and high energy efficiency. We also compare the results with those of an industrial baseline controller. © IMechE 2018.","energy efficiency; fluid power; hydraulic systems; power management; Power transmission","Controllers; Cost functions; Electric power transmission; Electronics packaging; Energy efficiency; Fuel economy; Hydraulic equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulics; Nonlinear systems; Optimization; Power management; Predictive control systems; Transmissions; Fluid power; High energy efficiency; Hydraulic system; Nonlinear model predictive control; Optimal steady state; Quasi static models; Terminal constraint; Transmission systems; Model predictive control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053336733

We identified plasma metabolites associating with different cardiometabolic risk factors (adiposity, cholesterol, insulin resistance, and inflammation) in monozygotic (MZ) twins. Additionally, we assessed if metabolite profiling can identify subgroups differing by cardiometabolic risk factors. Methods: We quantified 111 plasma metabolites (Acquity UPLC—triple quadrupole mass spectrometry), and measured blood lipids, HOMA index, CRP, and adiposity (BMI, %bodyfat by DEXA, fat distribution by MRI) in 40 MZ twin pairs (mean BMI 27.9 kg/m 2 , age 30.7). We determined associations among individuals (via linear regression) between metabolites and clinical phenotypes, and assessed, with within-twin pair analysis, if these associations were free from genetic confounding. We also performed cluster analysis to identify distinct subgroups based on subjects’ metabolite profiles. Results: We identified 42 metabolite-phenotype associations (FDR &lt; 0.05), 19 remained significant after controlling for shared factors within the twin pairs. Aspartate, propionylcarnitine, tyrosine hexanoylcarnitine, and deoxycytidine associated positively with two or more adiposity measures. HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) associated negatively and BMI positively with the most numbers of metabolites; 12 were unique for HDL-C and 3 for BMI. Metabolites associating with HDL-C had the strongest effect size. Metabolite profiling revealed two distinct subgroups of individuals, differing by 32 metabolites (p &lt; 0.05), and by total and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Forty-two metabolites predicted subgroup membership in correlation with total cholesterol and 45 metabolites predicted subgroup membership in correlation with LDL-C. Conclusions: Different fat depots share metabolites associating with general adiposity. BMI and HDL-C associated with the most pronounced and specific metabolomic signature. Metabolomics profiling can be used to identify distinct subgroups of individuals that differ by cholesterol measures. Most of the observed metabolite-phenotype associations are free of confounding by genetics and environmental factors shared by the co-twins. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"alanine; aspartic acid; C reactive protein; carnitine; carnosine; citrulline; cysteine; deoxycytidine; glucuronic acid; glutamic acid; glycine; hexanoylcarnitine; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; isoleucine; kynurenine; lipid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; lysine; ornithine; phenylalanine; proline; propionylcarnitine; serine; tyrosine; unclassified drug; valine; amino acid; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; Article; bioinformatics; blood biochemistry; body fat distribution; cardiometabolic risk; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; Finland; homeostasis model assessment; human; lipid blood level; lipid storage; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; metabolomics; monozygotic twins; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phenotype; plasma; priority journal; risk factor; ultra performance liquid chromatography; blood; insulin resistance; metabolome; monozygotic twins; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; risk factor; Adiposity; Adult; Amino Acids; Cholesterol, HDL; Female; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Male; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Obesity; Risk Factors; Twins, Monozygotic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048553562

The DSO assumes here the new role of microgrid energy manager. In order to realize the proper choice of LT investments (e.g., in renewable energy system and energy storage system), a short-term (ST) energy management is performed each day of the planning period. For that purpose, a new system of daily operation including industrial load management and allowing peer-to-microgrid as well as external energy exchanges is implemented. The LT investments and ST operational decisions are coupled via two game theoretical frameworks, which also allow the modeling of the different, even conflicting, objectives of the stakeholders.

The MAPbI thin films were grown upon a thin passivation layer of CH 3 NH 3 I (MAI) using conventional two step deposition scheme. The films were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Electroimpedance Spectroscopy, Current–Voltage and DC-Hall effect measurements. The resultant MAPbI thin films demonstrated negligible amount of unreacted PbI 2 because of the sandwich structure where PbI 2 layer was embedded in-between two MAI layers.

This study investigated the susceptibility of three pomegranate (Punica granatum, L.) fruit cultivars (‘Acco’, ‘Herskawitz’ and ‘Wonderful’) to drop impact bruising. Impact threshold required to bruise fruit was investigated by determining the probability of bruise occurrence (PBO) from the population of the fruit of three pomegranate cultivars impacted at minimal drop heights (0.1, 0.15, 0.2 m). The effect of temperature on bruise susceptibility and fruit physiological response was studied by impacting fruit equilibrated at 5 and 20 °C from three higher impact (drop heights) levels above threshold (0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 m) followed by storage for 10 d to monitor fruit weight loss and respiration rate. Minimum drop impact level at which bruising was first observed and the associated PBO were 0.1 m (PBO; 0.44), 0.15 m (PBO; 0.5) and 0.15 m (PBO; 0.75) for ‘Wonderful’, ‘Herskawitz’ and ‘Acco’, respectively. ‘Wonderful’ pomegranate fruit had the lowest impact threshold, with the highest value of PBO (0.44) and lowest impact energy (371.87 mJ). Bruise susceptibility at higher impact levels above threshold (measured in bruise volume and bruise area) was cultivar dependent; in the order of ‘Wonderful’&gt;‘Herskawitz’&gt;‘Acco’. The measure of pomegranate fruit sensitivity to bruising measured as bruise susceptibility (mm3mJ−1) and specific bruise susceptibility (mm3 mJ−1 g−1) that took into account the impact energy and fruit mass suggested that ‘Acco’ was the most sensitive cultivar to impact bruising followed by ‘Herskawitz’. Fruit stored in cold (5 °C) condition had larger bruise size (bruise volume and bruise area) than those stored at ambient (20 °C) temperature. Weight loss and respiratory activity were significantly reduced both in non-bruised control and bruised fruit stored in cold (5 °C) temperature. Conversely, at ambient storage, the highest respiration rate and percentage weight loss were recorded in bruised ‘Herskawitz’ and ‘Acco’ fruit, which increased with the level of impact bruising and storage temperature. These findings provide an evidence-based understanding of the bruise damage susceptibility of pomegranates and could be used to develop a postharvest handling tool for the investigated pomegranate cultivars. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bruise susceptibility; Cultivar; Drop height; Impact energy; Pomegranate fruit","cultivar; fruit; impact; marketing; physiological response; respiration; shrub; temperature; temperature effect; vulnerability; Lythraceae; Punica granatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056807857

Electrodes loaded with the metal/GO composites are prepared by a simple drop-casting technique without any binders or conductive additives. The effect of electrochemical reduction on the structure of the composite electrodes is investigated by Raman spectroscopy, XPS, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). A detailed electrochemical characterization is performed for the utilization of the composite electrodes for electrochemical capacitors and possible oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode measurements. The highest areal capacitance is achieved with the as-deposited Fe/GO composite (38.7 mF cm −2 at 20 mV s −1 ).

More specifically, a building of 100 m2 floor area in Athens (Greece) is simulated and evaluated during the winter. The analysis is conducted with TRNSYS software and the results are presented in energy and financial terms. Solar collectors such as flat-plate, photovoltaic and thermal-photovoltaic are coupled to a tank which feeds a heat pump for space-heating purposes. In order to increase the storage capacity, a PCM-layer is placed on the underfloor heating system and different cases are examined by changing the thickness of the insulation in the floor and the area of the collectors. Moreover, this study presents the capital, variable and total cost, the electricity consumption, the coefficient of performance, the solar cover and the indoor temperature of the building for all the systems. The results prove that the use of the PCM-layer on the underfloor heating system reduces the heating load about 40% and the variable costs up to 20% because the electricity consumption can be reduced between 42% and 67%. Moreover, a multi-objective procedure was performed in order to evaluate all the scenarios and it is found that the thermal-photovoltaics seem to be the most appropriate cases due to the extremely low grid electricity consumption. The simple payback period of the system with flat plate collectors without PCM has been found 10.2 years and with PCM 18.3 years. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","PCM; Solar-assisted heat pump; Total cost; TRNSYS; Underfloor heating system","Coefficient of performance; Electric power utilization; Floors; Heat pump systems; Heating equipment; Investments; Pulse code modulation; Pumps; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Space heating; Electricity-consumption; Flat-plate collector; Grid electricity; Indoor temperature; Solar assisted heat pump; Storage capacity; TRNSYS; Underfloor heating systems; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058505090

In this regard, the key component for such systems is the expander where the overall system efficiency has been affected by the expander performance. Therefore, this work outlines a novel integrated methodology to predict the performance characteristics of the radial-inflow expander for small scale compressed air energy storage CAES system for low mass flow rate applications. The integrated methodology combines the mean-line design and 3D CFD simulations for the expander with thermodynamics analysis for CAES system. The expander mean-line design is verified against the data available in open literature and compared with the delivered results from the CFD simulations using ANSYS-CFX. Moreover, comprehensive parametric studies are carried out based on the CFD analyses under design and off-design conditions in terms of rotational speed, expander inlet temperature and expansion ratio in order to investigate the effect of those conditions beside the geometric parameters on the expander and system performance. The delivered results from CFD simulations and CAES system analyses highlighted that radial-inflow expander with CAES can be used for distributed power generation. The expander performance maps based on CFD analyses exhibited that the maximum power and efficiency were 3.282 kW and 76.70% respectively with CASE system efficiency of 12.46% and the system round trip efficiency of 59.08%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CFD; Compressed air energy storage; Mean-line design; Radial-inflow expander; Small scale; Thermodynamic analysis","Compressed air; Computational fluid dynamics; Digital storage; Distributed power generation; Pressure vessels; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamics; Distributed power generation systems; Mean line; Performance characteristics; Performance improvements; Radial inflow; Small scale; Thermo dynamic analysis; Thermodynamics analysis; Compressed air energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059311277

Kaempferol possesses beneficial biological properties such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Positive energy balance during obesity correlates with a pro-inflammatory chronic state. In this context, we hypothesized that kaempferol might promote anti-obesity effects by modulating adipogenesis and lipolytic pathways. Adipocyte viability at 24, 48, and 72 h was measured by an ATP-based assay. Pre-adipocytes (day 0) or mature adipocytes (day 12) were treated with 60 μM kaempferol until day 21 to evaluate its potential anti-adipogenic and lipolytic effect, respectively. Total lipid accumulation was assessed using Oil Red O staining assay. Gene expression was measured by RT-qPCR to evaluate the effect of kaempferol on adipogenesis and lipolysis gene expression. Our results showed a dose-dependent effect of kaempferol treatment on cell viability promoting cell death at higher than 60 μM concentration. Pre-adipocytes stimulation by 60 μM kaempferol resulted in 62% adipogenesis inhibition whereas in mature adipocytes, it reduced 39% intracellular lipid accumulation. Also, 60 μM kaempferol treatment decreased Cebpa mRNA expression when compared to control cells. In contrast, Pnpla2 and Lipe gene expression were upregulated in 3T3-L1 cells incubated with 60 μM kaempferol. In summary, our results showed that kaempferol modulates adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells by promoting downregulation of Cebpa gene expression and decreasing lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes by its positive effects on Pnpla2 and Lipe mRNA levels. Kaempferol might display an anti-obesity effect. © 2018, University of Navarra.","Adipogenesis; Flavonoids; Kaempferol; Lipolysis; Obesity","Cebpa protein; cell protein; kaempferol; Lipe protein; messenger RNA; Pnpla2 protein; unclassified drug; antiobesity agent; azo compound; CCAAT enhancer binding protein; CEBPA protein, mouse; kaempferol; kaempferol derivative; messenger RNA; oil red O; PNPLA2 protein, mouse; triacylglycerol lipase; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; adipogenesis; animal cell; antiobesity activity; Article; ATPase activity assay; Cebpa gene; cell death; cell differentiation; cell maturation; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; drug mechanism; gene; gene expression; Lipe gene; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipolysis; nonhuman; Pnpla2 gene; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; treatment duration; upregulation; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipogenesis; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cell survival; cytology; dose response; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; lipolysis; metabolism; mouse; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Azo Compounds; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; Cell Differentiation; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Gene Expression Regulation; Kaempferols; Lipase; Lipolysis; Mice; RNA, Messenger",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058402305

The MAA not only regulates the size of the CuO QDs but it also acts as pendent group for further functionalization of QDs. A specific concentration of MAA improves the crystallinity and increases the fluorescence lifetime by decreasing the density of surface trap states. The MAA capped CuO QDs are attached to (E)-5-((4-chlorophenyl) diazenyl)-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (CPDHB) and upon UV irradiation at 300 nm the CPDHB experiences a reversible trans- to cis-isomerization. The absorption band of the cis-isomer of CPDHB overlaps with the fluorescing band of the CuO QDs, as a result the fluorescence of the QDs is strongly quenched. The photoluminescenc (PL) quenching is attributed due to the photoinjected electron transfer from the conduction band (CB) of the CuO QDs to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the cis-isomer of CPDHB. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is also observed but its contribution is minor. The fluorescence quenching of CuO QDs in QDs - CPDHB assembly upon ultra-violet excitation and reversible trans-cis interconversion of CPDHB may potentially suggests to design fluorescent probes for bioimaging and to develop data and energy storage devices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Azobenzene; CuO quantum dots; Fluorescence quenching; Photochrome; Photochromic switch; Time-resolved fluorescence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056181328

Even though hardware technologies have been taken to many advantages, which aim at increasing the battery capacity, people are still facing with the problem of battery shortage. An application that runs functionally correct and has a friendly graphic user interfaces still causes users frustrated if it drains the battery. In parallel with increasing the energy storage capability of mobile device, optimizing the source code to reduce power consumption is an emerging topic. This paper presents a new approach to modeling and evaluating power consumption of mobile applications. First, we introduce new definitions of power states and a power consumption automaton (PCA) for a hardware component. In the next step, we propose algorithms to optimize and merge these into an unified automaton.

As one of the key energy-storage carriers, hydrogen (H2) possesses ultrahigh gravimetric energy density, ecofriendly character, and high renewability during its production and combustion processes. The development of green electricity powered H2 production techniques is a highly competitive solution to meet current energy and environmental challenges. Among different industrial approaches for H2 production, platinum-supported electrocatalytic water splitting via hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a rather mature technique. However, it has been increasingly demanded to explore highperformance, earth-abundant, and cost-effective HER electrocatalysts that can further improve energy efficiency and bring down the production cost. Thanks to their abundant active edge sites, superior electrocatalytic activity, good stability, and low cost, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) based electrocatalysts have been recognized as promising alternatives. This chapter deals with recent advances in the exploration of 2D TMD-based HER catalysts for water-splitting hydrogen generation. We present a brief introduction to the current main techniques for H2 production and the recent development of HER electrocatalysts. The introduction is followed by the description of the basic process of water electrolysis, general working principles of HER electrocatalysts, and main synthetic methods of 2D TMD-based materials.We then highlight some representative 2D TMD materials used as HER electrocatalysts and conclude with the remarks and outlook of the relevant research lines. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

However, its poor ambient stability remains a critical challenge. Evaluation of few-layer liquid-exfoliated BP during ambient exposure using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy allows its surface chemistry to be investigated. Oxidation of liquid-exfoliated few-layer BP initially occurs through nonbridging oxide species, which convert to bridging oxide species after ambient exposure. We demonstrate the instability of these bridging oxide species, which undergo hydrolysis to form volatile phosphorus oxides and evaporate from the BP surface. FTIR spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy were used to confirm the formation of liquid oxides through a continuous oxidation cycle that results in the decomposition of BP. Furthermore, we show that the instability of few-layer BP originates from the formation of bridging oxide species. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Atomic force microscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Liquids; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface chemistry; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Ambient degradation; Ambient stability; Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Critical challenges; Energy storage applications; FTIR spectroscopy; Phosphorus oxide; Scanning transmission electron microscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061359304

The performance and lifetime of energy devices are critically dependent on nanoscale interfacial phenomena. From the viewpoint of materials design, the improvement of current technologies inevitably relies on gaining control over the complex interface between dissimilar materials. In this sense, interfacial nanoarchitectonics with polymer brushes has seen growing interest due to its potential to overcome many of the limitations of energy storage and conversion devices. Polymer brushes offer a broad variety of resources to manipulate interfacial properties and gain molecular control over the synergistic combination of materials. Many recent examples show that the rational integration of polymer brushes in hybrid nanoarchitectures greatly improves the performance of energy devices in terms of power density, lifetime and stability. Seen in this light, polymer brushes provide a new perspective from which to consider the development of hybrid materials and devices with improved functionalities. The aim of this review is therefore to focus on what polymer brush-based solutions can offer and to show how the practical use of surface-grafted polymer layers can improve the performance and efficiency of fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, organic radical batteries, supercapacitors, photoelectrochemical cells and photovoltaic devices. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061028217

Six different sample combinations were studied; 1 wt-% P, 1 wt-% Zn, 1 wt-% P with 1 wt-% Zn, 2 wt-% P, 2 wt-% Zn, 2 wt-% P with 2 wt-% Zn. NOx storage and reduction (NSR) activity and NO2 temperature programmed desorption (TPD) profiles were measured before and after impregnation of P and Zn. Samples containing P performed significantly worse than samples only containing Zn in both NSR activity and TPD measurements. The increased NOx slip during lean phase in activity measurements for P-poisoned samples is mainly related to an increased slip of NO2. This was found for both NO and NO2 in the gas feed during lean phase and suggests that it is mainly the storage component that is poisoned and not the noble metal. Furthermore, the combination (1 wt-% P and 1 wt-% Zn) proved to result in slightly worse performance than only 1 wt-% P, however this was not the case for samples containing 2 wt-%, where the addition of zinc reduced the negative effect of phosphorous. Measurements from NO2-TPD experiments showed that NOx release at low temperature was not affected by the addition of P, while desorption in the temperature range 425–475 °C was significantly reduced. It can therefore be concluded that the poisoning mainly is related to barium NOx storage sites and not to alumina sites. Moreover, X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that some of the barium species are affected by phosphorous. Images from scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping were in line with the results seen in both the activity tests and NO2-TPD experiments. Phosphorous was concentrated at the same position as barium in the observed images, whereas zinc was more evenly distributed over the surface. For the sample with both 2 wt-% P and 2 wt-% Zn, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements indicate that Zn and P have a low interaction and this suggests that most of the zinc and phosphorous are separated. However, STEM-EDX showed agglomerates of some zinc and phosphorous, which could be zinc phosphates. This is a plausible explanation of the decreased deactivation observed after introducing 2 wt-% Zn compared to the sample only containing 2 wt-% P. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Catalyst deactivation; LNT; NOx storage; Phosphorus; Poisoning; Zinc","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Barium; Barium metallography; Catalyst deactivation; Catalyst poisoning; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Impregnation; Nitrogen oxides; Phosphorus; Platinum compounds; Precious metals; Scanning electron microscopy; Temperature; Temperature programmed desorption; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zinc; Zinc metallography; Activity measurements; Ammonium phosphates; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; NOx Storage; NOx storage and reduction; NOx storage catalysts; Scanning transmission electron microscopy; X-ray diffraction measurements; Zinc compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058977156

However, these savings and their associated financial benefits are influenced by the design of the complete heat production system, which typically includes, besides the CHP itself, an auxiliary boiler and a storage tank. Both scientific literature and design guides focus little on the hydronic aspects of that design, although the performance of a heat production system is extremely prone to it. Therefore, this paper evaluates different hydronic designs of a central heat production system with CHP. First, an overview is given of the state-of-the-art hydronic design concepts that are used in the private sector. Two new concepts are proposed as improvements to the existing ones: one to integrate the CHP and one to integrate the boiler. A morphological chart is developed to classify the features of both the conventional and novel designs. Second, the performance of all the design concepts (and their 54 combinations) are evaluated based on a case study of an apartment block with 24 apartments. This evaluation is made by means of dynamic building system simulations. The results show that maximal primary energy can be saved if the CHP is integrated according to the novel CHP design, which allows a variable flow rate through the CHP. This concept should be preferred in a design process. Multiple hydronic configurations of the boiler, of which one is the novel hydronic boiler concept, resulted in a similar performance. Therefore, designers are advised to make a case-specific comparison to decide which one to take. The morphological chart and methodology elaborated in this paper provide a basis to make that decision. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Auxiliary boiler; Building system simulation; CHP; Cogeneration; Hydronic design; Storage tank","Apartment houses; Boilers; Design; Power generation; Tanks (containers); Auxiliary boilers; Building systems; Cogeneration; Morphological chart; Residential building; Residential heating; Scientific literature; Storage tank; Cogeneration plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057608484

Commercial charging solutions are mostly based on unidirectional power flow converters; however, bidirectional power flow converters are an interesting solution when considering smart microgrid applications, with benefits in efficient energy use. In this context, the paper presents a bidirectional power flow converter for grid-to-vehicle (G2V) or vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications. The conversion system is based on a three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI), which assures the grid connection with a unitary power factor. The direct current (DC) bus of the voltage source inverter is connected to a DC/DC converter that controls the battery power flow. This conversion system can operate in G2V mode when charging the battery or in V2G mode when working as an energy storage system and the power flow is from the battery to the power grid. The conversion system model is presented as well as the control strategy proposed.

Here there is a rich database for the horizontal velocity field, and also crustal structure used to derive gravitational potential energy (GPE). We solve the stress balance equations, in the context of a thin sheet model of a viscously deforming lithosphere, for characteristic deviatoric stresses and viscosities, defined as the integral of these with depth (divided by the layer thickness), using the stress method of Flesch et al., where the input parameters are the fields of strain rate and GPE that apply to the sheet. Synthetic tests show that the stress method is able to resolve the stress field even with high (20 per cent) levels of noise in the input strain rates, and the mean stress is a very robust feature of the inversions, regardless of noise levels. We invert for the stress and viscosity fields in New Zealand, calculating the field of GPE from topography/bathymetry and crustal data, and the field of strain rates from either a long-term (multimillennial) velocity field inferred from the rate and pattern of Quaternary faulting or a short-term (decadal) velocity field directly observed with Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. In addition, we consider the effect of shear stresses on the subducted plate interface along the Hikurangi Margin (5-15 MPa), or regionally. We explore the effect of GPE on the inversion results by calculating these for a range of deforming layers (i.e. thin sheet with 35-150 km thickness), in effect sampling the lithospheric strength in the crust and mantle. The results show that the derived stress magnitudes (square root second invariant of the stress deviator) are in the range 0-35 MPa, with mean values of 13 ± 1 MPa for all models, comparable to typical earthquake stress drops.

In this experimental study, the rate of hydrate formation of four refrigerant blends, including R404A, R406A, R408A and R427A have been investigated. The induction time for hydrate formation, apparent rate constant of the hydrate reaction, water to hydrate conversion during hydrate growth, storage capacity, and the rate of hydrate formation of these refrigerants at various pressures and temperatures have been obtained using a kinetic model.

These devices have several practical applications such as smart window of buildings and automobile glazing for energy saving. The main objective of this work was to construct highly homogeneous and uniform e-beam evaporated amorphous WO3-x based films into electrochromic devices, which were fully characterized for switching speed, coloration efficiencies and cycling voltammetry responses. Fabricated devices contain indium doped transparent oxide coated glass as the transparent conductive electrode, ∼200 nm thickness of WO3-x as the cathodically coloring material and a lithium perchlorate based conducting gel electrolyte. X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that all as-deposited films are amorphous. Experimental results showed that both solid and liquid electrolyte electrochromic devices are initially very transparent that exhibit perfect optical modulation and coloration efficiency (up to 68.7 cm2/C and 52.6 cm2/C at 630 nm, respectively) due to easier intercalation of the Li+ within their structure. One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that e-beam coated electrochromic devices based on tungsten oxide thin films showed superior performance among to other coating methods.

In this study, the environmental impact of the core design and magnet material for three electric vehicle traction motors was explored with life cycle assessment (LCA): two permanent magnet synchronous machines with neodymium-dysprosium-iron-boron or samarium-cobalt magnets, and a permanent magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance machine (PM-assisted SynRM) with strontium-ferrite magnets. These combinations of motor types and magnets, although highly relevant for vehicles, are new subjects for LCA. The study included substantial data compilation, machine design and drive-cycle calculations. All motors handle equal take-off, top speed, and driving conditions. The production (except of magnets) and use phases are modeled for two countries – Sweden and the USA – to exemplify the effects of different electricity supply. Impacts on climate change and human toxicity were found to be most important. Complete manufacturing range within 1.7–2.0 g CO2-eq./km for all options. The PM-assisted SynRM has the highest efficiency and lowest emissions of CO2. Copper production is significant for toxicity impacts and effects on human health, with problematic emissions from mining.

The present research aimed to perform an early pharmaceutical assessment of this NK antagonist candidate focusing on the challenging solid-state part of the evaluation. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), hot stage XRPD and microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetrical analysis measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatographic analysis were used to characterize AZ3411. The amorphous, free base form of AZ3411 was transformed to a poorly crystalline material by salt formation using maleic acid. Suspensions of the poorly crystalline form (type A), prepared in various solvents, exhibited phase transformation on storage. Some precipitate was identified as a new, more crystalline form (type B) of the maleate salt of AZ3411. Also, a third crystalline form was observed at high temperatures (type C). AZ3411 maleate type A, maleate type B and amorphous, free base form was stored in 40 °C/75% relative humidity (RH), 60 °C and 80 °C for three months. Form B was found to be the most chemically stable at all conditions. After three months at 40 °C/75%RH, both type A and type B had transformed to the anhydrous type C. Moreover, type B was transformed to form C at 60 °C and 80 °C, while type A remained unchanged. These results, together with the loss of water with temperature, suggest that type B is a hydrate. The relative stability between the hydrate type B and anhydrous type C depend on humidity and temperature. Moreover, the photosensitivity of maleate type A, maleate type B and amorphous free base has been investigated under three different illumination conditions. In similarity to the previous study, Form B was the most chemically stable form. However, after completion the study, at the highest energy conditions (765 W/m2, 250–800 nm), the crystalline type B had transformed to type C, while type A had lost in crystallinity. A similar photostability study was performed on solutions of pH 1 and pH 7. The degradation pattern was similar for the two pHs but appeared different from the unstressed solution stability study performed on different pHs between pH 1 and 7. Neither was there any obvious correlation between the degradation patterns obtained after the stressed thermal- and photostability studies performed on the drug substance in solid-state. The salt of AZ3411 fulfils basic requirements for further development of an oral immediate release (IR) dosage form, although the compound displays signs of light sensitivity and there may be a risk of solid-state transitions during formulation development and long-term storage. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Drug delivery; Drug development; Photostability; Preformulation; Solid-state stability; Stability","az 3411; maleic acid; sodium chloride; tachykinin receptor antagonist; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory agent; Article; chemical structure; crystal structure; degradation; differential scanning calorimetry; high performance liquid chromatography; high temperature; humidity; liquid chromatography; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; phase transition; photodegradation; photosensitivity; preformulation; priority journal; solid state; temperature; thermogravimetry; X ray powder diffraction; chemistry; pH; X ray diffraction; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Molecular Structure; Thermogravimetry; X-Ray Diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057774129

Compared to fuel-based generators, the photovoltaic/Battery (PV/B) system is more suitable to supply domestic loads in sunny, isolated regions. However, given weather disturbances, a storage element is required so as to ensure the load supply autonomy. This work proposes an energy flow scheduling algorithm for a PV/B chalet installation in order to guarantee continuous supply of loads. The aim consists in the satisfaction of the loads demand, the maximization of the PV generation use, the limitation of the battery access time, and the battery protection against deep/over charge. The Timed Hybrid Petri Net (THPN) formalism is used to model the system operation considering the classification of loads into two priority levels. The developed algorithm computes several starting operation times of the secondary load, then selects the optimal one in order to satisfy the criteria cited above and guarantee continuous supply of the primary load. A comparative study of the calculated starting operation times demonstrates the efficiency of the optimal solution for a best PV/B power exploitation with a maximum battery lifetime and safety. The lost PV energy is nearly 26% with respect to an appropriate range of the battery State of Charge (SoC) from 100% to 21.76%.

Suggested hybridization based on a renewable energy with a view to an improved environment is promising. Study results show the performance of PV/diesel system based on solar radiation.

The concept of the heat accumulation unit designed by the authors uses a unique combination of the phase change material (PCM) with sub-cooling effect - sodium acetate trihydrate and the metal foam (MF), which reduces the fundamental disadvantage of commonly used phase change material - low thermal conductivity. The heterogeneous metal foam structure and sodium acetate trihydrate create suitable conditions for increasing thermal conductivity throughout the entire volume of the heat accumulation unit. The research was strictly focused on the mapping of processes related to charging. An experiment that evaluates heat accumulation was performed on a prototype in the Center of Renewable Energy Sources on an experimental device designed and manufactured by the authors.

Theoretical results indicate that the role of image charges is especially important for small widths of a quantum well. In contrast to the ground state, the influence of image charges on the binding energy of excited states is significant only at small values of the electric field.

Fasted animals were compared against two feeding groups: field animals and animals fed ad libitum in the laboratory. We found that intestinal length was larger in feeding and field animals than in fasting fish, while intestine and liver masses were heavier in feeding animals, followed by field animals and then by fasting individuals. Liver and intestine δ15N was higher in fasting fish than in field animals, but δ13C did not differ between both groups. Finally, body condition, C:N ratios and perivisceral fat mass, were greater in feeding and field individuals than in fasting animals.

When lithium is used as intercalating agents, the high energy density is achieved at an expense of non-sustainability. The replacement of Li + with cheaper monovalent ions enables to make greener battery alternatives. The utilization of polyvalent ions instead of Li + permits to multiplying the battery capacity. Contrary to Li + , the realization of quick and reversible intercalation of bigger monovalent and of polyvalent ions is a scientific challenge due to kinetic constraints, polarizing ion effects and Coulomb interactions. Herein we provide a vision how to make the intercalation of these ions feasible. The idea is to perform dual intercalation of ions having different charges, radii, preferred coordination and diffusion pathway topology. All these features are demonstrated by the recent knowledge on selective and non-selective intercalation properties of oxides and polyanion compounds with layered and tunnel structures.

A hybrid system based on renewable sources usually consists of two or more renewable energy sources with the possibility of including storage units so as to enhance the reliability of the system. The hybrid system requires an energy strategy that determines the operation point of each element of the system depending on multiple variables and subjected to the constraints inherent in this kind of systems. In addition, the system needs controllers to command each of these elements in order to reach the operation point established by the energy strategy. Here, we propose a control design via passivity-based control integrated with an energy management strategy for a hybrid generation system based on solar energy and coupled with the grid. The performance of the control methodology is extensively assessed through computer simulation using a comprehensive nonlinear model of the plant.

Both experiments and theory have correlated this effect with superoxide ion formation. In previous studies, density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the PBE+U density functional have been used, and the obtained results were only in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations. One severe problem is the underbinding of the O 2 molecule upon superoxide ion formation, which suggests that such species should not exist above room temperature. In this work, we use hybrid DFT functional to resolve this problem. We find that the discrepancy between theory and experiment originates from an incorrect estimate of the energy associated with the localized f-electrons with respect to the oxygen p-levels. By using average O 2 adsorption energies from hybrid DFT calculations, extrapolated to large nanoparticles (3-10 nm), in conjunction with first-order desorption kinetics, we find that superoxide ions are indeed stable on nanosized ceria well above room temperature, in accordance with experiments. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Cerium oxide; Ions; Nanoparticles; Oxygen; Adsorption energies; Ceria nanoparticles; Density functionals; Desorption kinetics; F-electrons; First order; Oxygen storage capacity; Superoxide ion; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060063837

For the electrochemical characterization of the five steels rotating disk electrodes, 20°C, 30°C and 45°C of experimental temperature and 0, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 rpm of rotation speed were taken into account. The temperature dependence was analyzed using Arrhenius law. Thus, Rct values obtained from EIS data in comparison with the corrosion rate obtained from polarization curves data were taken into account. Hydrodynamic effects were analyzed by Rct and corrosion rate data. Design/methodology/approach: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization techniques were used to assess the electrochemical behavior for five pipe steels steel immersed in a natural solution. Findings: The resistance and corrosion rate taken from electrochemical tests decreased as temperature and hydrodynamic condition also decreased. In addition, the Arrhenius parameter revealed that the natural solution increased the corrosion rate as the activation energy decreased. Typical branches related to reduction-oxidation reaction (dissolution-activation process or corrosion products dissolution) on steel surface were discussed. Optical images analysis shows that corrosion products for X65 steel exposed to oilfield produced water can be attributed to more susceptibility to corrosion damage for this steel grade (Quej-Ake et al., 2018), which is increased with the temperature and rotation speed of the working electrode. Originality/value: Corrosion process of the five steels exposed to oilfield produced water could be perceptive when Arrhenius analysis is taken into account. This is because oilfield produced water is the most aggressive condition (brine reservoir and sour water) for internal pipelines walls and storage tanks (brine tanks). Thus, stagnant condition was considered as a more extreme corrosive condition because produced water is stored in atmospheric stationary tanks as well as it is transported under laminar condition in zones where oilfield produced water is maintaining in the bottom of the pipe during the production, transporting and storing of the crude oil. In addition, a brief operational process for Reynolds number and the flowrate of the stock tank barrel per day (Q in STBD) using field and Reynolds number data is discussed. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corrosion; Impedance; Oilfield produced water; Polarization curves; Reynolds","Activation energy; Atmospheric corrosion; Corrosion; Corrosion rate; Digital storage; Dissolution; Electric impedance; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Geometrical optics; Hydrodynamics; Oil fields; Oil tanks; Petroleum transportation; Pipeline corrosion; Polarization; Produced Water; Reynolds number; Temperature distribution; Design/methodology/approach; Electrochemical behaviors; Electrochemical characterizations; Oilfield produced waters; Polarization curves; Potentiodynamic polarization technique; Reynolds; Rotating disk electrodes; Steel corrosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057593481

It has been found that each element of the natural gas infrastructure has a varying degree of acceptability to hydrogen concentration; however the determinant element affects the overall allowable hydrogen concentration. In the transmission network, compressors are the determinant element and have a limiting value of 10% hydrogen admixture. Distribution network and storage elements allow a 50% concentration of hydrogen. End use appliances have a tolerant range of 20–50%.

Hydrogen has been recognised as one of the best options to satisfy this demand. Utilisation of hydrogen as an energy carrier requires a number of steps especially for on-board applications, namely, production, transportation and storage. Storage of hydrogen brings a great challenge for the researchers among others. Current technologies include high-pressure compression, liquefaction and solid state storage of hydrogen. Solid state storage of hydrogen seems to be more applicable due to being much safer and denser. Metal hydrides are accepted as good candidates for solid state storage of hydrogen. In this regard, this study focuses on revealing dynamical and mechanical properties of new hydrogen reservoirs with high gravimetric hydrogen density, Li-X-H (X = C, N) using first principle calculations. First principle calculations have been proven to be a great tool to reveal extensive physical and chemical properties of the materials as well as mechanical and dynamical stability without synthesising them. Thus, this study adopts this tool to compute several physical and thermodynamic properties of Li-X-H such as bulk modulus, Young Modules, Shear Modulus, elastic constants, Poisson's ratio, Debye Temperature and so on for the first time. Based on the mechanical stability evaluation of compounds using elastic constants, both compounds are found to be mechanically stable. In addition, according to Pugh's criteria, the compounds have ductile nature. The computation of anisotropy revealed that the compounds are anisotropic at all planes. Also, the specific heat capacities of compounds seem to reach to Dulong-Petit limit at high temperatures. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Complex hydrides; DFT; Elastic constant; First-principle; Hydrogen storage","Anisotropy; Chemical stability; Density (specific gravity); Elastic constants; Elastic moduli; Hydrides; Mechanical stability; Specific heat; Complex hydrides; First principle calculations; First principles; High pressure compression; Hydrogen reservoirs; Physical and chemical properties; Storage of hydrogen; Theoretical investigations; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058166782

The associate improved Davydov model is shown to be fully described by a set of modified coupled discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equations, which involve long-range interactions between peptide groups along the protein strands. By means of the modulational instability theory, the competition between nonlinearity and long-range intermolecular interactions are shown to modify the domain of instability of plane waves. The impact of the competition between nonlinearity and long-range interactions, on the process of energy transport and storage, is also addressed numerically. It is shown that nonlinearity and the long-range couplings conspire to the emergence of trains of solitonic structures, when parameters are well chosen within the domain of instability of plane waves. The relevance of the improved model as well as the biological implications of the account of long-range intermolecular interactions, are discussed in the contexts of energy transport and storage in hydrogen-bonded molecular structures in general, and in α-helix proteins in particular. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Energy; Long-range interaction; Solitons; α-helix","Elastic waves; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrogen storage; Nonlinear equations; Solitons; Wave propagation; Biological implications; Dinger equation; Dispersive interactions; Energy; Energy transport; Intermolecular interactions; Long range interactions; Modulational instability; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054067226

Herein, two different layered manganese trichalcogen phosphites, MnPX3 (X = S, Se), are synthetized and submitted to shear force exfoliation. Structural and morphological characterization point to the fact that exfoliated MPX3 (exf-MnPX3) undergo mainly a downsizing process, alongside with delamination. Layered exf-MnPSe3 has the lowest onset potential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both media. In acidic media, a comparative improvement of 350 mV is observed for exf-MnPSe3 relative to the bulk MnPSe3. The materials stability as electrocatalysts is also tested for HER in a wide pH range, in which exf-MnPSe3 has a good stability after 100 cycles. The improved performance of exf-MnPSe3 can be correlated with the lower relative abundance of Mn and P oxides detected in the Mn 2p and P 2p core levels.

The integration of renewable energy (RE) harvesting technology into future mobile networks has the potential to positively cope with environmental contamination and ensure self-energy sustainability as a means to decrease fossil fuel consumption. Diesel generator (DG) in conjunction with on-site RE harvester has emerged as an economic and extent efficient option where commercial grid supply is not viable. This paper is focused on the cost aware energy management framework addressing to least net present cost (NPC) for the envisioned hybrid powered green cellular base stations (BSs) considering tempo-spatial traffic dynamics. In such wireless networks, solar photovoltaic modules are considered as a primary energy source, while the DG and energy storage device are kept as the standby supply in case of inadequate solar energy to ensure zero outage. A comprehensive simulation-based investigation is carried out in the context of downlink Long-Term Evolution (LTE) cellular networks for evaluating cost-efficiency and reliability performance under a wide range of network settings. Particularly, this paper examines the energy yield, greenhouse gas emissions, and cost analysis based on the optimal architecture of Remote Radio Head-enabled LTE BS. Moreover, wireless network performance in terms of throughput, energy efficiency gain, and radio efficiency is thoroughly investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical results demonstrate a substantial reduction of carbon footprints with minimum NPC while satisfying the quality of service requirements. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Energy harvesting; green wireless networks; renewable energy; sustainability; energy efficiency","Carbon footprint; Cost benefit analysis; Energy harvesting; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Monte Carlo methods; Photovoltaic cells; Quality of service; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cellular base stations; Environmental contamination; Green wireless networks; Integration of renewable energies; Management frameworks; Primary energy source; Renewable energies; Solar photovoltaic modules; Energy efficiency; alternative energy; communication network; diesel; electricity supply; energy efficiency; service quality; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055329764

First, an estimate of average daily water requirement for slaughtering and cleaning cattle is obtained for each of the abattoir. This was achieved through oral interviews conducted at the different abattoirs to arrive at a reliable estimate. Thereafter, the total water requirement, the water storage capacity and the electrical load requirement necessary for the sizing of solar PV system that will enhance the smooth operation of the abattoir are determined. Some of the key results revealed that the water requirements of the abattoirs are 208,780, 91,632 and 78,590 l/week, respectively. The most suitable submersible pump for the three abattoirs is 60GS50 (5hp, 60gallon/min Goulds series). The cost of pumping water and providing lighting for smooth operation of the abattoirs are $0.23, $0.21 and $0.19, respectively.

Hence, it is important to have a reliable equation for the dependence of the reaction equilibrium constant on temperature. A number of such equations have been proposed in the literature, but it is unclear which of them is more accurate in representing the equilibrium of methylcyclohexane dehydrogenation to toluene. To resolve this uncertainty, we analyzed their validity based on existing experimental data. Experimentally derived equilibrium constants were found to be generally bigger than those calculated by classical thermodynamics at 300–400 °C and 3, 10, and 15 bar. Equilibrium constants calculated based on tabulated free energy of the reaction, were closer to the experimental values than those based on standard heat capacities of the reacting materials. Part of the deviation is caused by the non-ideality of the reacting components at these conditions, which is reflected by their calculated compressibility factors. The equilibrium conversions calculated based on the proposed equilibrium constants have been compared to those obtained in a set of methylcyclohexane to toluene reactions carried out in continuous flow packed bed and membrane reactors and this comparison revealed that only the experimentally derived equilibrium constants provide reasonable results. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Dehydrogenation; Equilibrium constant; Hydrogen storage; Membrane reactor; Methylcyclohexane; Toluene","Bioreactors; Dehydrogenation; Digital storage; Free energy; Hydrogen storage; Membranes; Packed beds; Toluene; Uncertainty analysis; Classical thermodynamics; Compressibility factor; Equilibrium conversion; Experimental values; Membrane reactor; Methylcyclohexane; Reaction equilibrium constants; Standard heat capacity; Equilibrium constants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047983473

Certain rules have been established to generate electricity using a wide variety of sources, to transmit the generated electrical energy to long distances and to distribute it to the end user. Since the sources to be used for generating electricity are generally located far from the consumption centers, it is economically expensive to conduct transmission over these distances between the place where the electricity is produced and the consumption centers. Due to the difficulties encountered in the storage of electrical energy, it is desirable to consume the amount of energy produced. Transformers and many auxiliary elements are utilized to deliver electricity to the consumers from the centers where electricity is produced. Various losses occur until the generated energy reaches the end user. These losses should be minimized and electrical energy must be delivered to the consumer with high efficiency. All electrical facilities from the point of production of electricity to the consumer are called electricity networks. Conventional electricity networks do not have enough alternative proposals for energy consumption and costing. Often a centralized production from one source is used, but not sufficiently distributed production and storage. These network systems focus on continuous electricity generation rather than energy quality. Conventional electrical networks are highly sensitive to unforeseen failures and natural disasters. In order to eliminate the many disadvantages mentioned here and to meet the expectations of the digital age, it is imperative that smart grid systems be applied very quickly to the national grid system. With the transition to smart grid systems, it will be possible to create systems where detailed pricing is made and different distributed energy generation resources will support central production. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Electric energy; Renewable energy; Smart grid; Smart power distribution networks",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121500881

Systems using secondary batteries for seasonal storage appear, at first glance, to be no different from regular stand-alone PV systems: they have all the same components and operate similarly. The high cost of the large battery banks required for seasonal storage and the considerable expense of maintaining and refuelling a genset at remote locations have stimulated the search for novel solutions to seasonal energy storage and back-up.

Some of the major challenges are to scale the computational and memory resources and the efficiency of the processing devices as per the growing needs. In the past few years, a number of fields have emerged for addressing these challenges. We focus on one of the prominent paradigms that have the potential to improve the resource efficiency regardless of the underlying technology, i.e., approximate computing (AC). AC aims at relaxing the bounds of exact computing to provide new opportunities for achieving gains in terms of energy, power, performance, and/or area efficiency at the cost of reduced output quality, typically within the tolerable range. We first provide an overview of AC and the techniques which are commonly being employed at different abstraction levels for alleviating the resource requirements of computationally intensive applications. Afterwards, a detailed discussion on component-level approximations and their probabilistic behavior by considering approximate adders and multipliers is presented. At the next step, a methodology used to construct efficient accelerators from these components will be discussed. The discussion will then be extended to approximate memories and runtime management systems. Toward the end of the chapter, we present a methodology for designing energy efficient many-core systems based upon approximate components followed by the challenges in adopting a cross-layer approach for designing highly energy, power, and performance-efficient systems. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.","AC; Adders; Approximate adders; Approximate computing; Approximate multipliers; Component-level approximations; Computational resources; Computationally intensive applications; Cross-layer approach; Energy efficient many-core systems; Exact computing; Logic and switching circuits; Memory architecture; Memory resources; Multiplying circuits; Multiprocessing systems; Multiprocessing systems; Operating systems; Output quality; Parallel architecture; Parallel architectures; Power aware computing; Processing devices; Resource allocation; Runtime management systems; Storage system design",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117974669

However, it is more stable than solar and wind power sources. In fact, RF-EH relies on ambient RF signals from communications systems; hence, it presents special characteristics not found in other types of energy sources. The amount of RF energy harvested depends on the schedules of the base stations from the telecommunication service, as well as on the fluctuations caused by multipath fading and shadowing. As such, this work introduces a novel energy-management algorithm whilst proposing a supercapacitor storing system that copes with these issues and allows for storing the energy harvested from the electromagnetic waves by means of N-stage Dickson voltage multiplier printed circuit board (PCB) boards (5 and 7 stages) optimized to guarantee the best conversion efficiency and output voltage. Since the objective is to harvest as much energy as possible from the electromagnetic spectrum, this work proposes an RF-EH prototype to harvest electromagnetic energy from the digital terrestrial television (DTT) frequency band (750-758 MHz). This band is chosen due to the potential arising from the wide/broad deployment of DTT in Portugal, which poses significant interest for EH. Regarding the supercapacitor storing system, the best electronic components as well as the most suitable values for the configuration parameters have been determined through an empirical approach for the RF-EH with supercapacitor storing system. As an ongoing work, we are addressing the possibility of using different RF-EH prototypes gathered in blocks that scavenge energy in the same or different frequency bands, where the sum of all the energy harvested from each prototype is stored in the supercapacitor-based storage system, is also being considered. Preliminary tests are very promising, as in a conference room, densely populated, with circa 300 people, the RF-EH system managed to build up and store energy even when mobile phones were not being used in the close proximity of the harvesting antennas. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.","Ambient RF signals; Circuit board boards; Communications systems; Conversion efficiency; Different frequency bands; Different RF-EH prototypes; Digital terrestrial television frequency band; Electromagnetic waves; Energy harvesting; Energy management systems; Energy sources; Frequency 750.0 MHz to 758.0 MHz; Harvest electromagnetic energy; Harvesting antennas; N-stage dickson voltage; Novel energy-management algorithm; Output voltage; Radio frequency energy; RF energy; RF-EH prototype; RF-EH system; Same frequency bands; Scavenge energy; Solar wind power sources; Supercapacitor storing system; Supercapacitor-based storage system; Supercapacitors; Voltage multipliers",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114967315

Furthermore, the unlimited applications of such materials in different fields and their associated success had added extra value for their importance. The combination between nanomaterials and photocatalytic processes has been recently given a great attention in different applications. It may enhance the viability of the nanotechnology principles. One of these applications is the usage of nanophotocatalytic materials in hydrogen production via water-splitting reaction. This chapter will cover the main concepts of photocatalysis and its associated terms. The main features of efficient photocatalysts and the ways of measuring such properties are illustrated in this chapter. Also, a brief presentation for the current methods that are utilized in the preparation of these catalysts is provided. An overview of the different types of semiconductors that are employed in the domain of photo-based hydrogen generation via splitting of water is introduced through this chapter too. A new approach in the water-splitting process by introducing noble metals attached magnetic nanoparticle (core/shell structure) as promising photomaterials is also described in this chapter. However, these materials are used in different fields such as bio-medical processes, water treatment, and energy storage. They are expected to be of high significance in field of catalysis, since they can be easily separated and recovered, due to their magnetic character, for reuse in further reactions.

It is clear, therefore, that the sustainable development of our society demands a considerable progress in the search for clean and renewable energy sources. In this direction, recent results have demonstrated that the storage of solar energy into suitable fuels can play a central role both in energy production and environmental protection, targeting on global sustainability. Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production from renewables and solar energy is recognized as one of the few suitable approaches on our way to a “carbon-free” society. Among the different photocatalysts developed, two-dimensional (2D) materials and 2D-2D heterojunctions have attracted great attention over the last years.

In this context, it is crucial to determine the required number of generating units of wind turbines and photovoltaic arrays, and the associated storage capacity for standalone and/or grid connected hybrid microgrid. Typically, this is determined using a sizing algorithm based on the observation that the state of charge of battery power system should be periodically invariant in order to keep optimum cost. Given the intermittency of wind speed and solar irradiance, it is very challenging to accurately calibrate power production from wind turbines and photovoltaic arrays, at all times even under varying weather conditions. In this context, the convolution neural network (CNN) can symbolize a practical and reliable tool to precisely monitor and predict the wind speed and solar irradiance outputs and accordingly manage the power transfer switching between areas that have surplus of renewable energies to areas with energy shortage by initiating the energy management system (EMS) to dispatch power according to an anticipated schedule.

Despite its popularity, there are several problems related to instability and non-availability in almost all the Photovoltaic applications. Various parameters cause those problems such as solar irradiation, temperature, the material used in the photovoltaic cells, as well as the battery’s storage capacity, and the connecting cables. For a better understanding of those problems, it is needed to model photovoltaic installations trough Multi-physics modeling, which allows the simulation of photovoltaic installations and the impact quantification of each one of the parameters mentioned above. In this paper, a mathematical model based on graphical methodology (Bond Graph) for a 5 kW Photovoltaic Group is presented. The developed model demonstrates the effect of solar radiation and the ambient temperature on the output voltage, current, and power. This model is possible without going through an iterative process. In this work, all the photovoltaic group parameters are given according to ambient temperature, solar irradiation, materials of photovoltaic cells, and the conducting wires. The expected values for voltage and current have been successfully compared to the actual physical data.

Cloud have the capability to respond to too many requests from consumer side, however, the physical distance between a consumer and cloud is far than the consumer and fog. Fog is limited to a specific location, moreover, fog is meant to deal requests locally and helps out in processing the Consumer’s Requests (CRs) and provide efficient response. A fog holds the consumer’s data temporarily, processes it and provides response then sends it to cloud for permanent storage. Apart from this, it also sends the consumer’s data when Micro Grids (MGs) are not able to fulfill the consumer’s energy demand. Cloud communicates with Macro Grid. Fog and cloud computing concepts are integrated to create an environment for effective energy management of a building in a residential cluster. Fog deals with requests at the consumer’s end, because it is nearer to the consumer than a cloud. The theme of this paper is efficient allocation of Virtual Machines (VMs) in a fog, therefore, Insertion Sort Based Load Balancing Algorithm (ISBLBA) is used for this purpose.

Fog computing assists cloud computing services. It extends the services of cloud computing. The permanent storage of the data is come to pass in cloud. An environment based on fog and cloud is providd to manage the energy demand of the consumers. It deals with the data of buildings which are linked with clusters. To assist cloud, six fogs are deployed in three regions, which are found on three continents of the world. In addition, each fog is connected with clusters of buildings. There are eighty buildings in each cluster. These buildings are Smart Grid (SG) buildings. For the management of consumers energy demand, Micro Grids (MGs) are available near by buildings and reachable by fogs. The central object is to manage the energy requirements, so, fog assists consumers to attain their energy requirements by using MGs and cloud servers that are near to them. However, for balancing the load on cloud the implementation of an algorithm is needed. Virtual Machines (VMs) are also required. Pigeon hole algorithm is used for this purpose.

Crowd-sourced sensor networks monitor energy consumption and traffic jams. Distributed ledgers systems provide unprecedented opportunities to perform secure peer-to-peer transactions using blockchain. However, decentralized systems often show performance bottlenecks that undermine their broader adoption: propagating information in a network is costly and time-consuming. Optimization of cost-effectiveness with supervised machine learning is challenging. Training usually requires privacy-sensitive local data, for instance, adjusting the communication rate based on citizens’ mobility. This paper studies the following research question: How feasible is to train with privacy-preserving aggregate data and test on local data to improve cost-effectiveness of a decentralized system? Centralized machine learning optimization strategies are applied to DIAS, the Dynamic Intelligent Aggregation Service and they are compared to decentralized self-adaptive strategies that use local data instead.

Pretreatment technologies have the potential to enhance AD of lignocellulosic compounds. Four different principles of pretreatment are used: mechanical (e.g., knifes or milling), heat (e.g., steam) chemical (e.g., acids, base or solvents), and biological (e.g., microbiological or enzymatic pretreatment). Some pretreatment technologies combine different principles, such as steam explosion (heat and mechanical), extrusion (heat and mechanical), organosolv (solvents, heat, and mechanical), or thermochemical (acids or bases combined with heat). The effects of most of the pretreatment technologies have been tested using biomethane potential tests but results are often lack rigorous discussion or the advice to carry out continuous fermentation to assess side effects. Many publications also lack information regarding energy balances of the implemented technology and the additional gas yield. The effect of pretreatment on different substrates is very specific to the chemical composition of the substrate, and much more research is needed to understand the principles correctly.

However, fog encompasses small area relatively to cloud by saving the data for shorter amount of time and sending it to cloud for permanent storage. In this paper, a joint cloud and fog centered environment for efficient energy supervision of buildings is proposed. It caters for the data of groups of buildings at buyers’ end. 12 fogs are utilized for 6 different regions in the world which are based on 6 continents. Additionally, each fog is linked to a group of buildings and two fogs are linked to two groups. Each group comprises of multiple smart buildings and these buildings has at least 100 apartments. To manage the energy requirement of consumers, micro grids (MGs) are available near the buildings and accessible by the fogs. Energy is managed for the apartments and fog helps the consumers to fulfill their load demands through nearby MGs and cloud servers’ communication. So, the load on cloud and fog should be balanced and load balancing algorithms are used to manage the load using VMs. These algorithms are round robin (RR) and throttled and Priority Based load balancing and these algorithms are compared for a single service broker policy. Service broker policy considered in this paper is; dynamically reconfigure with load. Priority based load balancing is proposed for balancing the load on fog and results of proposed balancing algorithm are compared with other algorithms.

It is considered to be the next big thing in the evolution of the Internet and an integral part of the future Internet. IoT devices that have their own storage and processing capabilities can process and store data at their end. However, the devices which don’t have storage and processing resources, like sensors attached to the patient’s body, collect data from the physical environment and send to some sink for processing and storage. Such sensors generate a huge amount of data, so there is a need to process and store the data efficiently. However, the cloud computing which is used as a platform for IoT has an inherent problem of latency which can cause bad monitoring and patients which need an immediate treatment can be affected. This problem can be considered in every latency sensitive application which requires real-time monitoring and processing. To solve such problems, we need a new platform for IoT related data which offers the same services as a cloud but do not have problems like a cloud. This study proposes a new solution for IoT patient’s data which utilizes an intermediate layer, fog computing with cloud computing, and accelerates the awareness and response to events by removing a round trip delay to the cloud for analysis. It also offloads the gigabytes of network traffic from the core network to the local edge fog network. This work also proposes how energy efficient sensing will be done. Implementation based analysis is performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution with existing solutions. Results show reduction of the delay and energy efficient sensing. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Fog; Fog computing; Patient treatment; Energy-efficient sensing; Intermediate layers; Internet of thing (IOT); Physical environments; Processing capability; Processing resources; Real time monitoring; Sensitive application; Internet of things",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082312275

Renewable energy systems (RESs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) are widely used around the globe to reduce the pollution produced by traditional power plants and minimize operational energy costs. ESSs help the various forms of renewable distributed generation to be integrated in the MG with a high penetration level. ESSs also develop MG reliability, increase power quality, smooth the uncertainty of RESs, handle load change, change the peak load, develop a control system, and regulate the frequency and voltage systems. This chapter provides an overall description and a comprehensive study of MG energy management strategies, including the objective function of an MG, MG constraints, and mode operation of the MG as well as showing the impact of the optimal allocation of ESS on the MG operation. This chapter begins by presenting a statistical analysis of the research in the field of MGs, renewable energy, ESSs, energy management of MGs, and optimal allocation of ESS. It then discusses energy management-solutions for MGs in isolated mode and interconnected mode, and finally investigates the impact of optimized ESS location and capacity on the energy management for the MGs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The interaction between different types of nonregulated sources and battery energy storage systems (BESS) is analyzed. BESS has been one of the best options in distribution networks to compensate for variations in the power output of renewable energy, such as wind and photovoltaics, since these sources cause fluctuation of voltage and frequency in a microgrid. Likewise, when an electricity distribution system is weak, there is a possibility that this system will become an island mode operation and the energy supply will depend on renewable and nonrenewable sources that are interconnected to the same MG. The connection of the BESS in strategic points will allow the regulation of energy in a system to be improved. The latency times of charge and discharge of batteries and the limit of daily operations are showed like actual considerations in the control of energy of MGs systems. The use of a distribution management system (DMS) with an energy manager offers an alternative for the efficient use of energy. A distribution system must have a good regulation of voltage and frequency with the help of the BESS through a DMS, which will be in charge of controlling the requirements of the network according to the demand, the fluctuations of the renewable systems, and the absence of energy of the utility in case of some failure and weak node. This chapter presents the impact of battery operation dynamics in the frequency control of microgrids. Initial conditions are presented as a predictive energy dispatch to know the requirements of the energy capacity in the batteries and then the location of the BESS is made in the weakest nodes to later perform the charges and discharges of energy as required in each node. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These quality coefficients for the modern bow are only slightly better than those of the historical bows. Materials used in modern working-recurve bows can store more deformation energy per unit of mass than materials used in the past. Moreover the mechanical properties of these materials are more durable and much less sensitive to changing weather conditions.

This chapter provides an overview of different stages of a cool chain and the changes in managing transportation processes in each stage. We also discuss the concepts and technologies for achieving high-quality products as well as sustainability in the agri-food supply chains. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Behaviors by which energy stores are acquired and built up are known as foraging, and this is a very common topic in animal behavior studies. It is especially important for flying organisms to finely tune the level of energy reserves they carry. While most animals will use carbohydrates for high intensity work and fat mainly for long-term storing, birds have the ability to build up and metabolize body fat deposits quickly. As fat is lighter than carbohydrates this is an adaptation to their flight ability. Optimal energy regulation has been especially well studied in two avian systems; small birds in cold environments and birds on migration. Wintering small birds will experience two sources of mortality, starvation and predation, and it is the sum of these that they must minimize. Many of these birds are large-scale food hoarders that depend on stored food for their winter sustenance. As these have reliable access to stored energy supplies they can afford to carry less fat than non-hoarding species. A decrease in body fat level will decrease predation risk. In cold environments body size is very important as small bodies will cool quicker than large ones. During cold nights many small birds will lower their night-time body temperature to a hypothermic state to decrease metabolism and save energy. In this way they can survive cold nights on smaller fuel reserves than needed at their normal body temperature. An extreme example is provided by some hummingbirds that may have a core temperature of 7°C during cold nights. The more fuel a migrating bird carries, the heavier it becomes. This means that the additional distance that a bird can fly non-stop will be described by a curve of diminishing returns when the fuel load increases. Yet some birds are able to make astonishingly long flights. Godwits, for example, can fly directly from Alaska to New Zealand. Some small songbirds seem to know beforehand when they need to load extra-large fuel reserves before passing a geographical obstacle, such as a sea. For this they use cues from the earth magnetic field. Also some mammals, for example large whales, will migrate far between foraging areas in cold seas and warmer reproduction areas. During reproduction, finally, it is important for females of many animal species to build up large fat deposits in order to increase the probability of successful breeding. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.","Allometric effects; Carbohydrates; Energy management; Energy regulation; Energy reserves; Energy storing; Fat; Fuel; Hibernation; Hypothermia; Little bird in winter; Premigratory fattening; Starvation/predation; Torpor",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079264128

I refer to such food storage as hoarding, to distinguish it from internal storage such as in fat deposits. There are two distinct food-hoarding strategies: larder hoarding (all food is stored in one or a few central larders) and scatter hoarding (storage locations are dispersed, frequently one food item in each). Birds provide some of the best-known examples of food hoarding. Species such as nutcrackers may store tens of thousands of nuts per individual and year. They possess spatial memory capacities that enable them to remember precise storage locations and return to these up to a year after storing. Food-hoarding birds have become a popular study system for memory research, and much of this research investigates the role of the hippocampus in food storing, a brain structure that is important for the physical storage of memory. Food hoarding may be important for seed dispersal for plants that form nuts. Food hoarding can be seen as an alternative to the storage of body fat deposits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.","Cache retrieval; Caching; Energy storing; Food hoarding; Food storing; Larder hoarding; Long-term hoarding; Scatter hoarding; Seed dispersal; Short-term hoarding; Spatial memory",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079252164

The applicability of recycled asphalt was tested in laboratory, and asphalt mixtures containing 20%, 40% and 50% of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) were designed. Marshall and Duriez tests have been performed on various formulations using paving grade bitumen and modified bitumen as binders, the latter contains a quantity of Styrene /Butadiene / Styrene (SBS) polymer.

This paper exhibits four case studies for electric vehicles with the grid to exhibit their influence on the electrical network and reduce power loss and voltage fluctuation. Furthermore, the growing load demand matters, management and support of active and reactive power, and load balancing are discussed. Fuzzy logic control is applied to estimate the process of the charging/discharging. Moreover, a controlled superconducting magnetic energy storage system is utilized for the power grid which integrates with electric vehicles to the level of load demand during on-peak load and fast charging. A coordinated control between electric vehicles and superconducting magnetic energy storage unit is applied to level the power required by electric vehicles and improve the power system performance. Electricity price is a common coordination signal for both electric vehicles and superconducting magnetic energy storage, which depends on fuzzy control. The simulation results implemented by the Matlab Simulink tool show the effectiveness of the coordination control technique and superconducting magnetic energy storage in minimizing power loss and voltage fluctuation.

The study analyzes how the chosen species (mandacaru, coroa-de-frade and palma forrageira) survived and evolved over time, adapting to one of the planet’s hardest climatic conditions and regions, the Brazilian Caatinga biome. Considered an important innovation tool, biomimetics transforms the way of thinking and creating new solutions: by doing things as nature does, we can change the way grow food, produce materials, generate energy, heal, store information, and do business, even knowing that biomimetics is not simply a matter of copying or duplicating biological structures. It is based on those principles that we envision the possibility of seeking inspiration to reduce problems related to water scarcity.

The biological nature of cactus shows us several principles, forms and mechanisms that can be applied to solve problems and think about new products and technologies. It is imperative the ability of those plants to develop natural strategies for maintaining life in so extreme climatic conditions as heat and insolation as those of the Brazilian northeastern semi-arid region, resulting in strategies of collection, storage and management of water complemented by a structural defense system against predators and natural weather. © 2019, Luciano Editore.

The development in the dynamics of convective heat and mass transport is significant in understanding diverse engineering and industrial phenomena such as in thermal energy storage material drying process, transpiration cooling process, and many others. Keeping aforementioned usefulness in mind, the current analysis is aimed to demonstrate the convective features in squeezed Sutterby fluid flow through parallel surfaces. Magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) theory is incorporated to describe the squeezing flow phenomenon. The Sutterby fluid model is accounted in order to specify the flow nature in squeezed channel. The top plate is assumed to be squeezed whereas the lower plate is at rest. The convective heating is incorporated at both lower and upper plates. Inspection of mass transfer has been accomplished in the occupancy of solutal convective conditions at the both surfaces. The equations governing the flow, heat and mass transport are first derived under the assumptions of low magnetic Reynolds number and negligible viscous dissipation, and then made non-dimensional by defining the similarity variables. Series solutions representing the flow velocity, temperature and concentration distributions are computed for definite values of power law index by utilizing convergent approach. Results are graphed and physical elucidated is seen for involved flow parameters. Variations in co-efficient of skin friction, Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are reported graphically. Significant findings in this attempt is that higher lower plate thermal and solutal Biot numbers strengthen the both heat and mass fluxes, while larger upper plate thermal and solutal Biot numbers weaken the heat and mass fluxes. © 2019, The Korean Magnetics Society.

On one hand we are facing growing demand for energy driven by the growth of the world population, the global economic development, the emergent countries and markets and the growing needs of a technological society embarking on new cycles of development with the digitalization of the economy and the ‘Internet of the Things’, all of which will impact the global pattern of energy demand. On the other hand we are confronted, as a civilization, with the climatic threat induced by rising CO2 emissions, derived from the consumption of fossil fuels, the bad use of land and the pollution from other industries like cement, chemical and steel industries. Furthermore, the world increased exponentially its consumption of resources that are being depleted at a rate never before seen in history. The dominant paradigm for civilization today is based on the transformation of resources into waste with unparalleled speed in history and this needs to be reversed with the real and not the rhetorical adoption of the principles of ‘Circular Economy’, fighting waste and developing new models of access and distribution of resources. The change of the energy mix and the development of a new model of sustainability in the access and production of resources is a key challenge for the 21st century.

The carnitine-shuttle is responsible for the transfering of long-chain fatty acids from the internal mitochondrial membrane. The role of genetic variants of the enzymes in the carnitine shuttle in coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been studied. Therefore, we performed a case-control study investigating the possible relation between the CPTIA-rs3019613 and CROT-rs2214930 gene variations located carnitine shuttle and CAD risk. Materials and methods: Study groups were comprised of 96 CAD patients and 85 controls. CPTIA-rs3019613 G > A and CROT-rs2214930 T > C polymorphisms were determined by real-time-PCR. Results: The CROT-rs2214930-CC genotype was found to be associated with decreased HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) in controls (p = 0.029). In patients with CPTIA-rs3019613-A allele, body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.016) and BMI threshold- value (p = 0.030) were found be higher compared to those with GG-genotype, while HDL-C threshold-value (HDL-C ≤ 0.90 mmol/L) was found to be lower (p = 0.015). Regression analysis confirmed CPTIA-rs3019613-A allele has a significant relationship with decreased HDL-C (p = 0.009) in patients. Conclusion: Our study indicated that the polymorphisms of the CROT and CPTIA genes related to β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids had an important effect on serum HDL-C levels and may be a potential risk for CAD. © 2019 De Gruyter.

The treatment was accomplished via two consecutive steps, where different concentrations of MnO2 were initially applied by the ultrasound-assisted template method onto the cotton samples to synthesize nanoMnO2. The nano form of the metal oxides and polyaniline inclusion were demonstrated through a transmittance electron microscope. Thereafter, chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline over the nano metal oxide–loaded fabrics was performed. Structure, phase, and purity of as-treated fabrics were determined using X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The thermal properties of the fabricated conductive samples were also tested. The electrical conductivity of the obtained (nano MnO2/polyaniline) modified cotton fabrics showed great enhancement by exposing the modified samples to gamma irradiation, as a posttreatment, to reach an optimum condition at 40 kGy, using 0.2 M MnO2. The recorded increment for electric conductivity was from 5.4 × 10−3 to 1.43 × 10−1 Ω−1. m−1 for both unirradiated and 40 kGy irradiated samples, respectively.

To overcome this problem, nanocomposites were obtained using gelatin as a biopolymer scaffold and silver nanoparticles as a wide spectrum antimicrobial agent. Water and glycerol have been used as solvents for the gelatin hydrogel synthesis. This mixture led to a stable and homogeneous biomaterial with improved mechanical properties. Methods: Silver nanoparticles were characterized using SEM, EDS and TEM. Moreover, the AgNp/gelatin nanocomposite obtained using these nanoparticles was characterized using SEM and FTIR. Moreover, mechanical and swelling properties were studied. Results: The storage modulus was 3000 Pa for gelatin hydrogels and reached 5800 Pa for AgNp/gelatin nanocomposite. Silver nanoparticles have been studied as an alternative to antibiotics. Importantly, the rate of silver release was modulated as a function of the temperature of the nanocomposite. Thus, the silver release from the nanocomposites at 24 °C and 38 °C was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The silver release reached 25% after 24 h at 24 °C, while a 75% release was achieved at 38°C in the same period, showing the material thermoresponsive behavior. AgNp/gelatin nanocomposite showed a deleterious effect over 99.99% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, leading to a material with antimicrobial properties. Conclusion: AgNp/gelatin nanocomposite with improved mechanical properties and silver nanoparticles as a source of silver ions has been synthesized.

In the DES model different tariffs of purchasing and selling the energy in case of energy deficit or surplus are applied. The model considers different tariffs for the different time-frames during a particular day. To increase the DESS cost efficiency, the energy distribution is adapted to the energy demand, demand-meeting and cost depending on time-frames.

Research efforts have proposed methods to decrease the high computational costs of the original kNN by focusing, e.g., on approximate kNN solutions such as the ones relying on Locality-sensitive Hashing (LSH). However, embedded kNN implementations need to address the target device memory constraints and power/energy consumption savings. One of the important aspects is the constraint regarding the maximum number of instances stored in the kNN learning process (being it offline or online and incremental).

In the traditional ad hoc mobile networks, these difficulties have often been overcome by a clustered topology. The clustering in VANETs can reduce the communication problems and makes the network appear smaller and more stable according to the view of each vehicle. In this work, we propose a VANET clustering solution called “QoSCluster”, which aims to maintain the cluster structure while respecting the quality of service requirements as the network involves.

While conceptual design methods to integrate stratified thermal energy storage systems are being developed, the control of the resulting systems is addressed in this paper. The main challenge of the control of heat exchangers in stratified storage systems is the fact that both outlet temperatures of the heat exchanger need to be maintained at their setpoint. A simulation model describing plate heat exchangers and based on this a control strategy are presented. The simulation model is experimentally validated and represents the real heat exchanger with a steady state error within the bounds of ± 0.31 K. The control strategy contains a feed forward path using measured disturbances and a lookup table to set the intermediate loop-sided mass flow rate. Furthermore, one feedback PI controller is used to control one outlet temperature by adjusting the intermediate loop-sided inlet temperature with a mixing valve. As the lookup table is based on a sufficiently accurate description of the heat exchanger characteristics, the second outlet temperature (process-side) is maintained within bounds of ± 0.5 K. For further development, the measurement effort is recommended to be reduced by means of state and disturbance estimation. The rather rigid control algorithm might be replaced with a multivariable control approach such as model predictive control in order to increase the versatility of the system.

Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies are under development to be implemented in fossil fuel-based industrial applications to reduce the carbon footprint. The main aim of this paper is to present, through illustrative coal-based examples, the CO2 capture technologies used to reduce the carbon footprint of energy-intensive processes. The assessments are focused on conceptual design, modelling and simulation, process integration and technical and environmental assessment of CO2 capture with potential applications in industrial sectors with high greenhouse gas emissions e.g. power generation, metallurgy, cement, chemicals. Two reactive gas-liquid and gas-solid carbon capture technologies are evaluated through illustrative industrial size examples. The CO2 capture rate is set to 90 %. Various coal-based processes were considered as illustrative examples e.g. combustion, gasification, cement production, integrated steel mill, coal to chemicals etc. The proposed conceptual designs were modelled and simulated using process flow modelling software ChemCAD. The mass and energy balances as well as the thermal integration tools were used to quantify the key technical and environmental performance indicators (e.g. fuel consumption, overall energy efficiency, carbon capture rate, energy penalty for CO2 capture, specific CO2 emissions etc.). The integrated assessments show that CCUS technologies have significant advantages in reducing the environmental impact of energy-intensive industrial applications e.g. cutting the specific CO2 emissions by about 60 - 90 %.

In a multi-node grid with Renewable Energy Sources (RES), the energy production, storage and consumption might differ significantly from node to node, especially if the distances between the nodes are notably long. Consequently, this might lead to considerable energy surplus in some locations of the grid and energy deficit in others. In order to overcome these undesirable phenomena two tools are developed. The first tool explores the potential of introducing hydrogen production systems in each node of the grid separately by taking into account various parameters such as energy profiles and economic criteria. The second tool determines the optimal operation scheduling for the electrochemical devices (Fuel Cells) that process the produced H2. Indicative results of both tools are presented so as to demonstrate the benefits of introducing hydrogen technologies to the grid.

The gas network already stores and transports energy, and it has the potential to play a significant role for longer term energy storage. In addition, gas and electrical grids are becoming more integrated with fast responding gas-fired power stations, providing the main source of back up for renewable electricity in many systems. In 2017, Ireland’s renewable generation accounted for 19 % of electricity generated and was the second largest source of electricity generation after natural gas and coal with 51 % and 18 % respectively. The percentage of renewable electricity is rising and there is a 40 % target to be met by 2020. Using a simplified version of Ireland's gas network, with 14 nodes and 15 pipes, the objective of this paper is to investigate how hydrogen, generated through power-to-gas (P2G) from curtailed wind power, impacts the operation of the gas network system. A quasi-transient model was constructed in MATLAB to calculate the main characteristics of the gas network. The results show, with an increasing mass fraction of hydrogen in the gas network, that the pipeline flow rate needs to be increased to compensate for reduced energy quality due to the lower energy density of the blended gas. There is significant potential for the gas network to store and transport excess and/or otherwise non-transportable renewable electricity to maximize renewable energy utilization.

However, some specially designed containers are also presented. In this research 2, 3, 4, 5 cylinders are continuously integrated into one vessel to make special storage tanks. The laboratory equipment was a copy of a tank which is used for industrial application. In this work, the effect of the shape of the container was investigated on mixing. Stirring was achieved by an external pump. The residence time was 3 h as in the industrial case. The aim was to examine the influence of special shape on mixing efficiency by using constant residence time. By utilizing lower residence time, the mixing efficiency might be risen however with the lower residence time the flow rate should be increasing consequently the energy consumption of recirculation become greater. Consequently in all experiments the residence time, calculated by the volume and flow rate, was constant. Borax solutions were used as a stratified liquid layer. The density of the upper layer was 1.0022 g/cm3 and the lower layer was 1.0136 g/cm3 density. The inlet was positioned above the liquid level. Concentration changes have been followed by electrical conductivity measurements. Residence time distribution and recirculation measurements were achieved. The data was evaluated by the time request to reach 95 % homogeneity. The concentration differences among the sampling points in time also were examined. The results were compared with the examination with a conventional cylinder tank. The experiments indicate that free convection is more dominant than forced convection. The results show reproducibility. The effect of the shape of the tank on mixing by recirculation is remarkable. Copyright © 2019, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076305144

Up to 10 % of fossil fuel energy input can be displaced by biomass without the need for major retrofits. Co-firing may be done directly or indirectly. However, direct co-firing has the disadvantage of being less flexible with the use of different types of biomass. Indirect co-firing, on the other hand, overcomes this limitation by using a gasifier which converts the biomass into syngas and biochar. The syngas can then be used for co-firing, while biochar can be applied to soil as a form of carbon sequestration. This process stores the carbon initially fixed by biomass through photosynthesis in the soil, and results in the net transfer of part of the carbon in biomass from the atmosphere to the soil. Biochar thus acts as a negative emissions technology with potential for scale-up in the near future. The utilization of biomass for co-firing in a fleet of thermal power plants can be optimized as a carbon management network, subject to biomass availability and the presence of suitable biochar sinks. In this work, a fuzzy mixed integer linear programming model is developed to minimize net carbon emissions in such a system, taking into account parametric uncertainties in the storage capacities of the biochar sinks. It is assumed that there is the option to use direct, indirect or no co-firing in each power plant in the system. The model is illustrated using a case study.

Current studies focus only on levelized costs on predicting the best-fit technology for specific applications. The study addresses this limitation by considering multiple factors on the selection process among technologies for specific applications. A systematic approach on the selection of energy storage technologies based on multiple and possible conflicting factors was proposed in this study for two specific applications: frequency regulation and load levelling. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process was utilized to generate the relative importance of each criterion. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to reflect the effect of battery characteristics and operating parameters uncertainties on the resulting scores of technologies. Grey Relational Analysis was used to aggregate the performance attributes of alternatives into a single score reflecting the desirability of alternatives. The levelized costs dominated all other criteria for both applications. Lithium ion battery dominated all technologies for both applications resulting from its well-rounded performance across all considered attributes. Results emphasized the importance of considering socio-economic indicators alongside techno-economic parameters on selecting the technology for future deployment. Thorough analysis on the results is important not only for decision-makers but for developers and innovators as well to direct future research.

The FSM offers a systematic way to develop a flexible decision-making algorithm that is combined with propositional-based logic in order to describe the transitions between the different operating states of the integrated system’s components. Easy extension of the EMS to larger and more complex systems without compromising the operational objectives is the major contribution of the developed algorithm. The proposed approach is implemented in an off-grid demonstration site located in Ginostra, Italy. At this site, the only source of power is a photovoltaic (PV) installation array that supports the specified residential loads. An operation analysis is conducted accompanied by an assessment of the site’s environmental footprint. The results indicate that power is supplied without interruption to the load, and CO2 emissions are decreased by 95.6 % in comparison with the former energy solution applied (diesel generators – DSG).

The impact of such renewable energy application could be boosted when an integration scheme is formulated by considering the changing meteorological conditions and periodic variabilities in the profile of heat demand. The efficiency of such networks could be enhanced by incorporating heat storage technology and backup utility system to form an integrated design. In this paper, a new approach based on multi-period Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) which captures such features is developed for integrating solar thermal with the space heat and hot water supply network of a cluster of buildings. The integration scheme is implemented and solved in GAMS and considers the hourly changes in solar irradiation and ambient temperatures, together with the effects of these changes on integration variables across different time horizons. Two scenarios are considered, the first involves four winter months while the second entails four summer months. The results obtained show that solar thermal satisfies 7.4 % of the total heat required in the winter months, while it fully supplies the total heat demand in the winter months.

Battery prices, however, still hinder massive deployment. One of the energy storage technologies being developed for microgrid applications are flywheels, which stores energy through rotational kinetic energy and are typically suited for high power applications. With the advent of long-discharge flywheels, such as those being marketed by Amber Kinetics® and Beacon Power®, they can be used in microgrids, which are dominated by batteries. This study provides a techno-economic comparison with sensitivity analysis between long-discharge flywheel and utility-scale lithium-ion battery for microgrid applications. The results show lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for flywheel-based hybrid energy system with 0.345 USD/kWh and renewable share of 62.4 % among tested configurations. The competitiveness of long-discharge flywheel over lithium-ion battery in the microgrid market depends on the diesel prices, expected reduction in lithium-ion battery prices, and improvements in lithium-ion battery lifespan.

Integration of renewable electricity enables efficient electricity storage as well as an increased utilization of the biomass carbon, which lowers the biomass demand. This paper presents a flexible system for the conversion of biomass and electricity to methanol. The system is based on the deep integration of a Two-Stage gasifier and solid oxide cells (SOC). The integration enables efficient production of a nitrogen-free high-quality syngas, suitable for methanol production. This study focuses on the system in electrolysis mode, and analyzes the effects of recirculating CO2 from the gas conditioning and methanol synthesis process back to the SOC, as well as the effects of pressurized operation of the gasifier and increased H2O content in the gasifier. Thermodynamic modeling shows that CO2-recirculation allows an increase in conversion of the carbon in the biomass to methanol from 80 % up to 92 %, with an energy efficiency of 71 %. Only a slight pressurization seems feasible, as an increase in pressure beyond ~3 bar results in significant methane formation inside the SOC.

Each node of the microgrid comprises various Renewable Energy Sources (RES), miscellaneous types of energy storage (batteries and/or hydrogen) and the capability of energy exchange through a DC bus interconnection. Prioritising the usage of energy sources (RES, batteries and hydrogen) at each node in order to achieve sustainability is only a partial and local solution. Supervisory control is crucial so as to achieve optimal energy exchange between the nodes which will ensure the maximum renewable energy exploitation and minimum usage of auxiliary power sources. A Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) is developed in order to coordinate the energy exchange between the nodes and determine the amount of energy that each node will receive or dispatch, taking into account various parameters such as forecasted power production and consumption profiles and system’s physical constraints. Indicative results are presented so as to demonstrate the capability of the NMPC to improve the efficiency of the microgrid by applying energy exchange between the nodes.

In this work, a model-based approach of the very fast carbonation reaction (CaO (s)+CO2 (g)→CaCO3 (s)) is employed to simulate a drop-tube as the carbonator reactor. A one-dimensional (1D) heterogeneous plug flow reactor (PFR) model for gas and solid phase is developed at steady state conditions. The model handles gas and solids as two distinct phases characterized by individual physical properties each. Model simulations export useful information about crucial process variables variation along the reactor. A case study of carbonator operation is examined through process simulation subjected to different CO2/CaO molar ratios at the inlet of the reactor. In this way, the capabilities of the model are demonstrated related to different operating conditions providing insights for preliminary designs of similar reactors.

In this work, a tool was developed that produces a network of plants that can decrease emissions, maximize energy reuse and select products that maximize profit of an industrial cluster. The tool can integrate various plants and/or processes, such as industrial production plants, power plants etc., to enhance the potential of making financial profits. Recently, a focus has been put on integrating natural gas, energy, and CO2 to reduce emissions or energy demand, which fall within end-of-pipe carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) solutions. This work designs an industrial cluster on the utilization of key materials including emissions. This approach introduces a new representation of resources management in a cluster that systematically integrates H2O, N2, O2, CO2 and energy (power and heat) converting them to value added products under a reduction target. The approach develops a Linear Program (LP), which can be easily applied to explore different combinations of plants. The method was applied on an illustrative example where several scenarios were investigated. The industrial cluster converts CO2 by 76% and produces methanol, while making profit.

Such processes may have brief peaks in energy demand, necessitating high storage capacity within short time periods. However, practical space constraints often limit maximal storage volumes, restricting the potential capacity to recover process heat. Consequently, the required utility costs of storage-limited integration solutions are increased, influencing their economic viability. Given increasing importance in the industry to utilize thermal energy efficiently, process operators may want to explore what is maximally possible energetically, within current space constraints, before contemplating expansion and further capital expenditure. Therefore, linear programming is utilized to determine storage integration solutions which maximize heat recovery per batch for volume-limited sensible stratified storage, specified by an insight-based approach from Pinch Analysis. The results produce a process-specific capacity limitation chart of batch-wise maximal heat recovery as a function of limited capacity, allowing generation of optimal storage loading and unloading profiles. Total batch costs (investment and operating cost per batch) are used to estimate the influence of limited capacity. The methodology is demonstrated in a case study. The resulting capacity limitation chart shows that for a stratified storage with four VSUs, which would require a volume of 97.4 m3 to achieve 100 % of the indirect heat recovery potential, approximately 60 % can be covered by an 8 m3 storage.

We see these points of tension as opportunities for change in designing experiments in a bounded space and time where practices can be performed differently – towards disconnecting, washing less, or sharing meal preparation and storage, for example.

The description of the studied system is based on a battery energy storage system based (lithium-ion technology), a DC-DC bidirectional power converter in order to connect the battery to the DC bus, DC-DC converter, voltage source inverter and finally the load and the micro-grid. Consequently, the main contribution of the proposed control methods lies in the coordination between the different controls methods proposed: battery control at the PV side and V-f/P-Q control algorithm at the inverter side.

In the article a model is proposed that describes the kinetics of the formation of hydrate in disperse systems, which are characteristic for real conditions of operation of gas-hydrate installations, on the basis of a stochastic approach using Markov chains. An example of numerical calculations is presented on the basis of the proposed model of the dynamics of the total mass of gas hydrates, and changes in the velocity of their formation and size distribution at different values of the nucleation constants and growth rate of the gas hydrates, and results of these calculations are analyzed. It is shown that the rate of formation of hydrate has a maximum value in half the time period of the whole process. The obtained results of the calculations of the dynamics the total mass of gas hydrates are in good agreement with the results of calculations by the equation of kinetics Kolmogorov-Avrami. The proposed model can be applied to the inverse problem: the determination of the nucleation constants and the rate of growth of gas hydrates by the results of the dynamics of the formation of hydrate and the changes in the fractional composition of the generated gas hydrates. © 2019 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.","Crystallization; Gas hydrate; Kinetics; Kolmogorov-Avrami equation; Markov chains; Nucleation and growth rate of gas hydrates; Stochastic model","Computational complexity; Crystallization; Desalination; Energy efficiency; Enzyme kinetics; Gases; Growth kinetics; Growth rate; Hydration; Inverse problems; Kinetics; Markov processes; Natural gas deposits; Natural gas transportation; Nucleation; Rate constants; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Avrami equations; Fractional composition; Gas hydrates formation; Nucleation and growth; Nucleation constants; Numerical calculation; Stochastic approach; Technological installation; Gas hydrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075737191

The results show that the mechanisms of hydrogen detachment/attachment are energetically more favorable when the two involved hydrogen atoms are related to different metals in each system. The hydrogenation of M3AlH8Na occurs very easily at relatively low temperatures. The most convenient values of temperature and rate constants for thermal dehydrogenation are reached for the Be3AlH10Na system in tetrahedral geometry. These factors, together with the fact that this structure is quite symmetrical, make the tetrahedral Be3AlH10Na a good candidate as an assembly unit for suprastructures. However, our results indicate that the dehydrogenation temperature is rather high; so, future studies about ways to facilitate Be3AlH10Na dehydrogenation, such as its catalysis or its support on some surface, are necessary for energy-based uses.

Yb:YAG was chosen as active medium due to its simple energy level scheme, long upper laser level lifetime (951 μs) which is suitable for storing energy, low quantum defects, large emission cross section, and large absorption cross-section for InGaAs laser emission. The combination of Cr4+: YAG and a doped-YAG gain medium, such as Yb:YAG, is particularly attractive from the point of view of an extremely robust device. Since both materials use the same host crystal, YAG, they can be diffusion-bonded to each other in a way that blurs the distinction between a monolithic and a composite-cavity device. Both materials have the same thermal and mechanical properties and the same refractive index, and the bond between them can be sufficiently strong that the composite device acts in all ways as if it were a single crystal.

TL along the river significantly impacts EWR flows, as it is often the case that specified EWR releases are not adequately received further downstream. Due to the limited understanding of the magnitude of TL, as well as the dominant contributing processes to TL within the region, it remains a challenge to operate the river using downstream targets far from the source of operations. In an attempt to address this knowledge gap, detailed characterizations of hydrological processes were performed along the lower reaches of the river, which centred around the estimation of riparian total evaporation and quantifying the rapport between surface and subsurface water flow processes. Riparian total evaporation was estimated using the satellite-based surface energy balance system model, soil water evaporation measurements and open water evaporation estimates. Losses from the river to the adjacent aquifer were determined from the continuous monitoring of the groundwater phreatic surface and characterization of aquifer hydraulic properties. The results of these investigations indicated that present flows within the system are likely to be insufficient to satisfy gazetted median and extreme low flow targets. Overall, the study details key hydrological processes influencing TL along the river. It should, however, be noted that these observations only provide an understanding of the system over a limited observation period. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental water requirements; Riparian total evaporation; SEBS; Subsurface water storage; Transmission loss","Aquifers; Evaporation; Groundwater resources; Soil moisture; Stream flow; Wave transmission; Aquifer hydraulic properties; Continuous monitoring; Environmental water requirements; SEBS; Soil water evaporation; Subsurface waters; Surface energy balance systems; Transmission loss; Rivers",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075423039

New generation technologies such as computer-server virtualization technology and cloud technology are being developed in order to minimize this trail in data centers. In recent years, in order to reduce the carbon footprint, the Hitit University data center has aimed to reduce the carbon footprint by adopting environmentally sensitive technologies.

However, the aforementioned materials would be more auspicious, especially for photoelectrocatalysis, if their optical properties fell within the range of the solar spectrum. These properties could be attained by either doping or by creating a specific crystal structure. In this study nickel(II) tellurium oxide was synthesized by employing the Pechini sol-gel synthesis route and calcined at 400 °C (NTO-400), 600 °C (NTO-600), and 800 °C (NTO-800). It was physically characterized and (photo)electrochemically tested for the OER in alkaline medium. Under electrocatalytic (EC) conditions, NTO-600 displayed the lowest overpotential, 353 mV, to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and exhibited the lowest charge transfer resistance of 20.75 ω. Under photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) conditions, NTO-600 (with a bandgap of 2.50 eV) realized a current density increase of 55% compared to pure EC conditions. Remarkably, this current density gain is (to a greater extent) maintained, subsequent to the termination of illumination, which points to photocharging of the material and the subsequent utilization of the stored charge to drive the OER (in the dark). Solar energy conversion, storage, and subsequent utilization is therefore realized through the use of nickel(II) tellurium oxide. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","nickel tellurium oxide; oxygen evolution reaction; Pechini sol-gel route; photocharging; photoelectrocatalyst","Charge transfer; Crystal structure; Current density; Doping (additives); Electrocatalysis; Energy conversion; Nickel oxide; Optical properties; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Solar energy; Oxygen evolution reaction; Photocharging; photoelectrocatalyst; Sol-gel routes; Tellurium oxide; Tellurium compounds",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075173225

Because the domain wall motion is probabilistic, Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes have been applied to such devices due to their ability to correct single-bit deletion and insertion. The complexity of the VT encoder and decoder is largely because of a sequential syndrome calculator that employs modulo-additions. Previous implementations avoided this complexity by restricting the racetrack size to a specific number of magnetic domains. In this letter, we describe an efficient implementation of the syndrome calculator with a novel steering algorithm, which not only alleviates the above-mentioned restrictions but also reduces adder size and the required number of operations, exploiting modulo-arithmetic symmetries in VT codes. We synthesize the syndrome calculator with varying number of domains to show that the algorithm is scalable, increases areal efficiency, slashes processing time, and lowers the power consumption of a VT encoder and decoder. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","domain wall memory; Information storage; nonvolatile memory; sequential encoder; systematic encoder","Data storage equipment; Decoding; Domain walls; Energy efficiency; Mathematical instruments; Nonvolatile storage; Signal encoding; Binary information; Domain wall motion; Efficient implementation; Modulo arithmetic; Non-volatile memory; sequential encoder; Steering algorithms; Systematic encoder; Magnetic domains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075077447

However, such nanocomposites often faced challenges of high energy dissipation and low voltage endurance due to direct contact of graphene nanosheets and localized electric field concentration. Various efforts have been made to address these shortcomings such as the insulative coating of graphene nanosheets in a polymer matrix. In this study, we simulated (using COMSOL Multiphysics) the effects of such insulative coatings on localized voltage concentration around graphene nanosheet in a polymer matrix. The simulation was done by consideration of various insulative materials with different dielectric constant and coating thickness on graphene nanosheets. It was noted that insulative coating can reduce localized voltage concentration around a graphene nanosheet in a polymer matrix, thereby improve the breakdown strength. Further increase in the coating thickness with low dielectric constant coating materials can further enhance breakdown strength. However, high coating thickness resulted in lowering the microcapacitance of the microcapacitor in the polymer matrix. Therefore, for the optimal energy density of such nanocomposites, a compromise dielectric constant of a coating material and coating thickness on graphene nanosheet must be reached. This study showcased the influence of insulative coatings on graphene nanosheets. It will be a guide for further studies on the selection of coating materials for graphene nanosheets for high breakdown strength nanocomposites. © The Author(s) 2019.","COMOSL; Graphene; localized voltage; microcapacitance; polymer","Dielectric materials; Electric breakdown; Energy dissipation; Graphene; Nanocomposites; Nanosheets; Plating; Polymer matrix; Polymers; Strength of materials; Thickness measurement; Breakdown strengths; COMOSL; Electrostatic energies; Field concentrations; High dielectric constants; Low dielectric constants; microcapacitance; Polymer nanocomposite; Plastic coatings",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075076930

The energy consumption and cost of a DCN are growing sharply with the extensions of network bandwidth and network size. The energy consumption, complexity and cost of a DCN depend on some design factors such as the topology structure, addressing scheme and routing mechanism. A novel addressing and routing architecture for cloud-service DCNs with regular topologies is proposed in this paper. First of all, we propose a port-based source-routing addressing (PSRA) scheme, which makes the table-lookup operation unnecessary and decreases the switch complexity. Next, leveraging the characteristics of PSRA and the regularity of DCN topologies, an extremely simple routing mechanism is designed, without switch involvement, control message interaction and topology information storage. Lastly, a high-efficiency fault-tolerance mechanism is proposed for the addressing and routing architecture. The analysis, implementation and simulation results indicate that the proposed architecture not only decreases the energy consumption and thus the cost of a DCN, but also enhances the routing performance and solves the fault-tolerance problem in a very efficient way.

However, they tend to experience higher thermal losses which adversely affect their thermal cycles. This paper focuses on heat loss estimation from a TES system operating at 800 ℃, insulated in a cylindrical ceramic crucible, and the determination of the optimal insulation thickness of the crucible. Parameters affecting heat loss such as thermal conductivity of the ceramic material and convective heat transfer coefficient were simulated. It was observed that the thermal conductivity of the crucible had a greater effect on the rate of heat loss than the convective heat transfer coefficient. Furthermore, an increase in the length of the crucible increased the thermal mass of the crucible causing it to lose heat at higher rate. The deduced optimal radial thickness for the operating temperature range was 0.075 m. In conclusion, addition of more refractories beyond the optimal radius will not significantly reduce the rate of heat loss and will make the insulating crucible bulkier. © International Research Publication House.","Cylindrical ceramic crucible; Heat loss estimation; Keyword: Thermal energy storage; Optimal insulation thickness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074762937

Thus, the need for a locally manufactured machine that is accessible and easy to operate. Therefore, a piston-type briquetting machine was designed and fabricated in this study. The performance of the machine was also evaluated by compacting sawdust and rice husks into briquettes in which the efficiency and capacity of the machine were 85.7% and 68.56 kg/h, respectively. Sawdust and rice husk were mixed in the ratios 100:0, 94:6, 92:8, 90:10 by weight and was bonded using an organic binder at constant proportion for all the samples. From the result, the density (820 - 870 kg/m3), moisture content (5.76 – 12.09 %), drop to fracture (8 – 20 times) and water resistance (93.75 – 94.24 %) increased as the rice husk particles increased in the briquette while porosity decreased with increased rice husk particles in the briquette. More so, volatile matter, ash content, fixed carbon content and heating values decreased as the rice husk particles increased and sawdust particles decreased in the briquettes. It could be concluded that the machine would be useful to compact quality solid fuels that would be able to withstand handling, transportation and storage challenges. © International Research Publication House","Briquette; Piston-type briquetting machine; Proximate analysis; Rice husk; Sawdust; Ultimate analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074761063

The use of bis(bidentate) tetraphosphines for dyads is shown. These tetraphosphines can be tailored in order to exploit five-membered ring effects upon chelation, leading to very stable dyads. The aim is to design photocatalytically active systems for sunlight-induced hydrogen production as a sustainable energy harvesting and storage technology of the future, with the help of suitable phosphine ligands. Phosphines play a major role in homogeneous catalysis and the purpose of this review is to show that this is valid for artificial photosynthesis as well. The focus is mainly on originals such as the monophosphine PPh3, the diphosphine xantphos and typical tetraphosphines, e.g. cis,trans,cis-1,2,3,4-tetrakis-(diphenylphosphanyl)cyclobutane (dppcb). Since the phosphorus atom in phosphines is a soft donor within the HSAB concept, especially complexes of soft metals and low oxidation states can be stabilized. Their development and application in a broad range of metal complexes in homogeneous catalysis, as well as their combination in phosphine-based dyads, will be discussed. Due to the creation of a rigid phosphine backbone, several metal complexes could be designed and optimized in respect of their application as chromophores or water reduction catalysts (WRCs). Therefore, in the case of WRCs, the phosphine ligand mainly serves as a stabilizer to improve the catalytic stability, while chromophoric units favour sterically demanding ligands for the advancement of photophysical properties, such as broad absorption spectra, longer-lived excited states and better charge separation, which are desirable for AP. Thus, the photophysical and reduction behaviours during excitation and catalysis were improved steadily. Though the oxophilicity of phosphines is obviously a problem, their possible application in the field of water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) is presented. Metal complexes for AP, incorporating both noble and earth abundant metals, showed long excited state lifetimes and high quantum yields and charge separation when combined with a suitable phosphine ligand. Additionally, higher turnovers and stable systems over more than 240 h could be obtained. This advantage of phosphine ligands over nitrogen containing ligands typically used in artificial photosynthesis is certainly a consequence of enhanced back bonding in phosphine complexes.

Hydrogen-magnesium oxide systems presented adsorption energy values in accordance with the previously reported studies of physisorption processes; additionally negative values of ΔGads were found describing adsorption as a favorable process. Here, the (MgO)7 cluster presented the highest adsorption energy. The storage capacity by weight of the magnesium oxide clusters was greater than the recommended percentage (7.5%) by the U.S. Department of Energy. QTAIM analysis and non-covalent index plots highlighted the weak nature of the interaction between the MgO clusters and hydrogen molecules, and the fundamental role of the Mg-O bonds' polarity in the systems' storage capacity.

In this context, we proposed in this paper a new cryptographic solution based on grouping a modified AES in CTR mode and a new key management protocol. The originality of our solution is to obtain a high security level with regard to a minimal resources use (storage only three keys whatever the network density). Our goal is to secure communications between nodes. Simulations are executed by OMNet++ and Visual C++ Studio. Compared to existing protocols, our cryptographic solution presents better results in WSN metrics: It achieves lower energy consumption (the energy cost does not exceed 0.512 μj), loss of packets and control overhead and higher average throughput (it achieves 45,177 bps), data freshness and better packets send ratio. Also, it resists against several attacks: Jamming, node capture, etc. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","AES; CTR mode; Efficient and scalable key management scheme; ESKMS; Integrity; Mobile WSN; OMNet++; Privacy; Resistance to attacks; Symmetric cryptography","Computer software; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Wireless sensor networks; CTR mode; ESKMS; Integrity; Key management schemes; Mobile WSN; OMNet; Symmetric cryptography; Network security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074089757

For this purpose, five scenarios of system’s renewable energy fractions (namely 0% renewable energy, 25% renewable energy, 50% renewable energy, 75% renewable energy and 100% renewable energy) were modeled, simulated, optimized and analyzed. The results obtained using the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)/USA showed that the hybrid system with 50% renewable energy fraction is the optimal one in terms of both its technical performance and the cost of generated electricity which was found to be $0.202/kWh. It was also proved that deploying this system for electricity generation reduces the emissions by 49% compared to the conventional system comprising only diesel generator sets. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to reveal the impact of diesel prices, solar radiation and wind speed on the cost of generated–by this optimal system–electricity. The obtained results indicated that diesel price is the most influential factor in the cost of generated electricity. It changes from $0.168/kWh to $0.0.237/kWh for a variation in diesel prices from −30% to +30% of its current prices. The effect of battery bank’s storage capacity on the performance and cost of electricity, generated by the optimal system was investigated as well. The results showed that varying the storage capacity from −30% to +30% (from the base case value of 2971 kWh) increases the hybrid system’s capital cost, but reduces each of the excess electricity, diesel generators operation hours, the annual diesel consumption and consequently the CO2 emissions. However, increasing the storage capacity from −30% till 0% (the base case), reduces the cost of electricity, while increasing the storage capacity from the base case of 0% to +30% does not affect the cost of generated electricity. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","HOMER; Hybrid PV-wind-diesel-battery system; renewable energy fraction; sensitivity analysis; storage capacity; techno-economic analysis","Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Diesel engines; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Energy resources; Hybrid systems; Optimal systems; Power quality; Sensitivity analysis; Wind; HOMER; Renewable energy fractions; Storage capacity; Techno-Economic analysis; Wind-diesel-battery systems; Electric power generation",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074017035

Electrochemical storage is the most used solution but it suffers from several problems e.g. deep discharges, cost, cycles, oxidation, etc. To avoid these problems caused by this type of storage system, this paper proposes and analyzes the efficiency of the replacement of electrochemical storage by a hydraulic energy storage system by performing two Integrated Optimal Design (IOD) followed by a sensitivity analysis versus environmental data changes.

PHAs are polyesters of high molecular weight and can be isolated by solvent extraction and precipitation in antisolvents. The material properties of PHAs are of great interest due to the inherent biodegradability and excellent biocompatibility. To date, more than 150 different PHA monomers have been described in literature and it has been found that the monomeric unit composition significantly influences the physico-chemical properties of PHAs. The monomer composition may be controlled to some extent by the choice of the PHA production strain but also by the cultivation conditions and the carbon substrate/PHA precursor supply. In previous studies, it has been shown that the most reproducible production method of PHA is the chemostat cultivation of suitable bacteria under multiple nutrient limited growth conditions. This chapter is dedicated to provide step-by step instructions to produce PHAs in a chemostat culture and specifically describes how the composition of PHA copolymers can be tailored during biosynthesis, as well as a set of analytical tools and methods to characterize PHAs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Biocompatibility; Biodegradation; Bioplastics; Biopolymer; Chemostat; Continuous culture; Polyester; Polyhydroxyalkanoates","monomer; phytohemagglutinin; polyester; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; bacterium culture; biocompatibility; biodegradability; bioprocess; biosynthesis; carbon source; Cupriavidus necator; differential scanning calorimetry; flow cytometry; gas chromatography; gel permeation chromatography; growth rate; instrument sterilization; molecular weight; nonhuman; nutrient limitation; pH; precipitation; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; Pseudomonas putida; solvent extraction; steady state; bacterium; bioreactor; biosynthesis; cell culture technique; metabolism; procedures; Bacteria; Bioreactors; Biosynthetic Pathways; Cell Culture Techniques; Polyhydroxyalkanoates",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073259325

Cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge/discharge (CC/CD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and constant power discharging methods have been applied to establish the electrochemical characteristics of EDLCs completed.

However, the design of IoT systems is challenging, due to the multiple design aspects that need to be considered. Connectivity and storage aspects are amongst the most significant ones, as IoT devices are resource-constrained and in many cases battery-powered. On top of them, it is also essential to consider privacy and security aspects that are linked to the protection of the IoT system, as well as of the data exchanged through its connectivity interfaces. Ensuring security in an IoT system, though, is an evident need and a complex challenge, due to its impact in the battery lifetime. In this paper, we propose a methodology to manage energy consumption through a model-based approach for the energy characterization of IoT design aspects using the BIP (Behavior, Interaction, Priority) component framework. Our approach is exemplified based on an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) that uses Zolertia Zoul devices placed in traffic lights and road signs to broadcast environmental and road hazard information to crossing vehicles.

This paper proposes a computerized tool for collaborative authoring of revitalized reusable teaching modules (so-called learning objects – LO) for blended learning. The tool will orchestrate the timing of various classroom activities (e.g. multimedia presentations, team activities, case studies, etc.) and can assist with the way how a learning management system (e.g. Moodle) interact with students. The tool also addresses the need for collaboration when several teachers work on the development of the same course offered at more than one branch of the college. While trying to fill up the gap between objects storage and retrieval standards and the object’s usage in the class context under given learning theory based on constructivism and connectionism, the paper also presents visual metaphors for the described authoring tool.

Long regarded merely as inert fat reservoirs, they are now emerging as major regulators of cellular metabolism. They act as hubs that coordinate the pathways of lipid uptake, distribution, storage, and use in the cell. Recent studies have revealed that they are also essential components of the cellular stress response. One of the hallmark characteristics of lipid droplets is their capacity to buffer excess lipids and to finely tune their subsequent release based on specific cellular requirements. This simple feature of lipid droplet biology, buffering and delayed release of lipids, forms the basis for their pleiotropic roles in the cellular stress response. In stressed cells, lipid droplets maintain energy and redox homeostasis and protect against lipotoxicity by sequestering toxic lipids into their neutral lipid core. Their mobility and dynamic interactions with mitochondria enable an efficient delivery of fatty acids for optimal energy production. Lipid droplets are also involved in the maintenance of membrane and organelle homeostasis by regulating membrane composition, preventing lipid peroxidation and removing damaged proteins and lipids. Finally, they also engage in a symbiotic relationship with autophagy and act as reservoirs of bioactive lipids that regulate inflammation and immunity. Thus, lipid droplets are central managers of lipid metabolism that function as safeguards against various types of cellular stress. © 2019, Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine Inc..

Experimental (thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction) and computational studies (lattice, intermolecular and stability energy calculations) were undertaken to rationalise and understand (hemi)solvate formation, stability and phase transitions occurring during the desolvation of the solvates. It was found that DDS⋯solvent interactions and the shape/size of the solvent molecules are critical for solvate formation. Careful control of the experimental crystallisation and storage conditions were required for identifying and characterising solvates that are unstable at ambient conditions. The solvent molecules of the hemisolvates are located at isolated-sites and form strong hydrogen bonds and/or interactions involving dispersion forces.

As a potential strategy to mitigate its negative impacts, the reduction of CO2 is environmentally critical, economically meaningful and scientifically challenging. Concerns regarding anthropogenic emissions have recently sparked interest in the CO2 chemical transformation techniques. Being both thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable, CO2 conversion generally requires efficient metal-based catalysts although they have multiple competitive disadvantages such as high costs, low availability and detrimental effects on the environment. A new class of catalysts based on earth-abundant carbon materials has been considered as an efficient, low-cost, metal-free alternative for both the capture and catalytic or electrocatalytic conversion of CO2. CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2RR) offers a new and important pathway towards renewable energy storage and production of fuels, and CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides to cyclic or polymeric carbonates opens up new prospects for the production of polymers and fine chemicals. This review provides an overview of the progresses made in nitrogen-doped metal-free carbon catalysts for CO2 electrochemical conversion and CO2 conversion into cyclic carbonates into useful fuels and chemicals with a focus on the results underlying their mechanistic behavior, advantages and/or limitations of this metal-free N-doped carbon catalysts on CO2 conversion and valorisation. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbonates; Catalysts; Doping (additives); Electrolytic reduction; Fuel storage; Greenhouse effect; Metals; Nitrogen; Polymers; Anthropogenic emissions; Chemical transformations; Cyclic carbonates; Electrocatalytic; Electrochemical conversion; Electrochemical reductions; Metal-based catalysts; Renewable energy storages; Carbon dioxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072326361

This multifunctional carbon fiber reinforced structural supercapacitors are fabricated by using carbon fiber and glass fiber/filter paper as reinforcements and cross-linked polymer electrolyte as a matrix. Carbon fiber mats also simultaneously serve the role of electrodes in addition to reinforcements whereas the glass fiber mat/filter paper also acts as an insulator to avoid the short-circuiting of the carbon fiber electrodes. A polymer epoxy matrix is modified by introducing ions within the cross-linked structure in order to develop an optimized polymer electrolyte. Flexural tests of structural supercapacitor are conducted to evaluate the structural performance while charge/discharge tests are conducted to evaluate the electrochemical performance. Multifunctional structural supercapacitors are tested mechanically as well as electrochemically. A structural supercapacitor is fabricated showing simultaneously an energy density of 0.11 mWh m-3, a specific capacitance of 0.8 mF.cm-3 and a flexural modulus of 26.6 GPa simultaneously. © 2019 Chemical Society of Pakistan.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Zn methionine (Zn-Met) and (or) Zn oxide (ZnO) addition in the diet of Katahdin × Dorper lambs on performance, carcass traits, and meat quality characteristics. Forty non-castrated Katahdin × Dorper F1 lambs were randomly assigned to the following experimental groups: (1) Zn-Met (65 ppm), (2) ZnO (65 ppm), (3) Zn-Met + ZnO (32.5 + 32.5 ppm), and (4) basal diet (BD, without Zn). The duration of experiment was 93 d. Treatment Zn-Met + ZnO vs. control improved (P ≤ 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion (FC); ZnO increased leg perimeter and decreased visceral fat. Intramuscular fat (IMF) and marbling of chop with Zn-Met + ZnO vs. control were higher (P ≤ 0.05). Oxidative stability of cooked meat was delayed (P ≤ 0.05) with Zn-Met + ZnO. Myristic acid was lowest (P ≤ 0.05) with ZnO, and arachidonic acid was higher (P ≤ 0.05) in Zn-Met. Therefore, compared with the BD, Zn-Met + ZnO improved the ADG and FC, decreased the shear force, and delayed the stability oxidative in cooked meat; Zn-Met and ZnO increased the IMF and marbling; additionally, Zn-Met increased arachidonic acid and ZnO decreased visceral fat and myristic acid. © 2019, Agricultural Institute of Canada.

Forage fish were regularly provided at four feeding stations where cod formed distinct “herds” (herd cod) that did not mingle much with the rest of the unconditioned cod in the fjord (wild cod). Several parameters (stomach fullness, liver index (fat reserves), condition factor, and growth rate) indicated that food intake was much greater in herd cod than in wild cod. In August, when the thermocline was well established, the herd cod remained in shallow (15–35 m) and warm water (8–10 °C), whereas the wild cod stayed in deep (80–90 m) and cold water (3–4 °C), but occasionally both groups explored depths and temperatures outside their preferred range.

The concept of Zero-Energy Buildings is gaining a constant increasing focus. The use of Advanced Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (AFCMs) as a new modelling methodology to provide energy performance indicators in a quantified manner that will drive the appropriate integration of required renewable energy generation, in order to design a (nearly) Zero-Energy Building (nZEB) is considered. The new approach is used to calculate the energy balance of buildings in alternative climate contexts and thus to explore their energy efficiency in six use cases.

Nine different power-degradation cases were considered, including a low-gain ideal four-level operation, ground-state reabsorption, pump excited-state absorption with and without storage, laser excited-state absorption with and without storage, intermediate storage, and Auger-type energy transfer upconversion with and without storage. There were three distinct types of laser performance identified, in terms of how the output power varies as a function of the pump power. Explicit analytical expressions were derived for the threshold pump power Pth, slope efficiency η, and the product Pthη∕T as a function of output coupler transmission T and other physical parameters that describe the power degradation mechanism. The analytical approach developed here provides valuable insight about the role of major power degradation mechanisms in lasers, and it should be applicable to the analysis of a wide range of low-power, optically pumped laser media, including solid-state, fiber, and ceramic lasers. © 2019 Optical Society of America.",,"Degradation; Energy transfer; Excited states; Ground state; Pumping (laser); Solid state lasers; Wave power; Analytical expressions; Continuous-wave power; Degrading mechanism; Energy transfer upconversion; Excited state absorption; Intermediate storage; Physical parameters; Threshold pump power; Optically pumped lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071398444

Taro tubers are important sources of carbohydrates as an energy source. Taro tubers provide a number of desirable nutritional and health benefits such as anticancer activity, phenolic acid and phytochemicals. Taro deteriorates rapidly as a result of its high moisture. The high perishability of taro during storage remains a major constraint. It is widely cooked by deep frying and consumed in forms of French fries and chips. The major challenge for the food industry is to produce low fat fried product with desirable texture, color and flavor. This research has been focused on different parameters of blanching, drying for minimum oil absorption and sensory palatability while maintaining the most phytochemical components such as total phenolic, total flavonoid and anthocyanin; extending product shelf life during packaging and preservation. Results revealed that blanching 95oC in 30 seconds with ascorbic acid of 0.15 g/100g taro, frying 2.0 cm of taro chip in soybean oil heating at 155oC in 2 minutes was appropriated. Fried taro chip could be preserved for 12 weeks under vaccum at 4oC. Moisture and oil content, as well as colour and texture are important quality attributes of fried taro products. Frying of taro chips is carried out to convert the tubers to value added products. Frying method brings out unique flavor and texture to the products that improve their overall acceptability. © 2009-2019, JGPT.

To rationalise and understand solvate formation, solvate stability and desolvation reactions a careful control of the experimental crystallisation and storage conditions, a range of thermoanalytical methods and crystal structure prediction were required. Six of the eight DDS monosolvates are reported and characterised for the first time. Structural similarity and diversity of the at ambient conditions unstable monosolvates were apparent from the computed crystal energy landscapes, which had the experimental packings as lowest energy structures. The computed structures were used as input for Rietveld refinements and isostructurality of four of the monosolvates was confirmed. Packing comparisons of the solvate structures and molecular properties of the solvent molecules indicated that both size/shape of the solvent molecule and the possible DDS⋯solvent interactions are the important factors for DDS solvate formation.

These nodes will sense, and gather various types of information from the environment or system and transmit the data to the base station for monitoring a system or an environment. However, they are characterized by limited resources (like battery, CPU and memory storage) because, they are small in size. Among those battery is a crucial issue, since they are deployed in remote locations. Most battery is consumed when a node sends data and when it routes where to send the data. Hence, energy efficient routing protocols have received significant research attention. This paper focuses on modifying LEACH protocol, which is a well-known energy efficient protocol for minimizing energy and overheads. On the first-round clusters will be formed as in the original LEACH protocol, then nodes will be scheduled for serving as a cluster head on each round turn by turn sequentially. The scheduled node will automatically be cluster head until two-third of its total energy is consumed. After two-third of the total energy has elapsed, re-clustering will be held in order to remove low powered nodes and dead nodes from the schedule. If the scheduled node dies before it serves as a cluster head, the successor scheduled node will serve. The proposed work has been evaluated comparatively using Castalia 3.3 simulator and it out performs the existing LEACH protocol. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cluster-head selection; LEACH; Scheduling; WSN; WSN routing","Digital storage; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Leaching; Low power electronics; Power management (telecommunication); Scheduling; Cluster-head selections; Energy efficient protocols; Energy efficient routing protocol; Low power sensor; Low powered nodes; Minimizing energy; Remote location; WSN routing; Sensor nodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070640463

Møllers Allé 8, Aarhus CDK-8000, Denmark","Available measured temperatures and thermal conductivities covering Danish onshore areas to a depth of about 300 m have been compiled and analysed. Temperature data from 236 borehole sites, including 56 boreholes with detailed temperature profiles, are applied together with thermal conductivities measured on samples collected at 34 well-characterised outcrops and on core material from 20 boreholes. Significant thermal variations in the shallow subsurface are observed. At a depth of 50 m, a mean temperature of 8.9 ± 0.8°C is found, close to the mean annual surface temperature. Higher mean values of 9.7 ± 1.1°C found at 100 m and 11.6 ± 2.2°C at 200 m reflect a general increase of temperatures with depth. In contrast to the assumption commonly held, we observe significant lateral variations both locally and regionally. At a depth of 100 m, temperatures vary between 7.3 and 13.0°C across Denmark, and at 250 m between 9.6 and 17.9°C. Mean values of the thermal conductivities lie within a range of 0.6–6 W/(m·K) measured water-saturated at laboratory conditions. The majority of values are within the interval of 1–3 W/(m·K) and show a strong correlation with lithology. The content of quartz and the rock porosity (the content of water) are found to be two main factors controlling the observed variations. Characteristic temperature gradients are in the range 1–4°C/100 m. Following Fourier’s law of heat conduction, a clear correlation is observed between temperature gradients and thermal conductivities of different lithologies. Intervals of quartz-rich sand deposits with high thermal conductivity show low temperature gradients, chalk and limestone intervals with intermediate conductivity display intermediate gradients, while sections with fine grained clay deposits of low thermal conductivity show high gradient values. A correlation analysis provides an estimate of regional shallow heat flow of 37 ± 5 mW/m2, consistent with local, classically determined heat-flow values from shallow borehole data. However, it is significantly below deep background heat flow, and this is believed to be caused by long-term paleoclimatic effects. The shallow subsurface thermal regime across the Danish area is largely controlled by thermal conduction. Only locally, and in rare cases, do we observe temperature perturbations due to groundwater migration. In addition to general geoscientific purposes, our results are important for several applications including exploitation of shallow geothermal energy and the use of the subsurface for heat storage and cooling purposes. © 2019 by Bulletin of the Geological Society of Denmark,.","Denmark; Heat flow; Shallow depth; Subsurface temperature; Thermal conductivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070368953

Paraffin is a phase change material (PCM) and is used as a heat storage medium in this PPH unit. The charging or melting process of the PCM in PPH unit happens in the day time. The hot water of temperature about 70 O C which is produced from 2 m2 vacuum tube solar collector is used for charging process. The temperature of PPH unit was increased until the PCM reaches to liquid state. The discharging process of Paraffin PCM will start when the hot water is used during off sunshine hours. The cold water at ambient temperature will be allowed to the storage tank through the PPH unit which automatically initiates the discharging process of paraffin. From the results of performance analysis of PPH unit, it is observed that the efficiencies of PPH unit during charging and discharging processes are 65% and 76% respectively. It can be concluded that the PPH unit can increase the performance of the hot water storage tank and it can also reduce the difference temperature mixing between hot and cold water. The PPH unit can be used to preheat the boiler feed water and for other heat requirement processes in small, medium and large (SML) business sectors. This concept can promisingly reduce the cost of hot water production in the SML industries. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

Incretins exert their actions though binding to and activation of specific GIP and GLP-1 receptors which are present in several target tissues. Incretin receptor activation in the pancreas leads to the incretin effect and other significant non-insulinotropic effects. Extra-pancreatic effects of incretin hormones in several other target tissues, such as their role in the pathophysiology of obesity and their potential relation with cardiovascular function, cognitive function, triglyceride storage in adipose tissue and bone metabolism, have attracted scientific interest. In the current review we intend to summarize existing knowledge on specific effects of GIP and GLP-1 in bone cells and bone metabolism. Starting from the identification of GIP receptor and GLP-1 receptor in animal and human bone cells, continuing with the skeletal effects of incretin deficiency or overexpression in animals, ending to the latest data on incretin and incretin agonists administration in cells, animals and humans, incretins play a significant yet complex role in the pathophysiology of bone metabolism affecting both formation and resorption.

A common method for saving energy while still guaranteeing the real-time constraints is to embed dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) mechanisms and dynamic power management (DPM) mechanisms within a real-time scheduling algorithm such as EDF. This paper proposes a new extension to the EDF scheduler, termed energy oriented EDF (EO-EDF). The new scheduler makes it possible to change the original EDF task execution order to better utilise the slack time and thus decrease the energy consumption, while still meeting the task deadlines. The new task order is defined according to a novel criterion we invented, termed task prediction order (TPO). The paper introduces two new versions of the EO-EDF scheduler, termed TPO-EDF and STPO-EDF. While STPO-EDF applies the TPO criterion in a static manner, TPO-EDF allows it to be used dynamically. We simulate the new proposed algorithms using both synthetic workloads and real-time benchmarks. The evaluations show that integrating both the TPO-EDF and STPO-EDF scheduling algorithms with DVFS and DPM mechanisms achieves an energy savings of 30% on average, in comparison with current known EDF based scheduling utilising DVFS and DPM mechanisms.

In the last decades, direct energy conversion devices received particular attention because of the need to develop flexible systems, autonomous and self-powered. The energy harvesting aims to make the systems, autonomous in terms of energy and to contribute to sustainable development by the total respect of the environment. In this paper, our aim is to use thermal energy and show that it's an important source for producing the electrical energy through pyroelectric effect: first, elaborate charged polyurethane (PU) with different proportions (20%, 30% and 40%) of lead zirconate titanate (PZT), then to use those PZT/PU composites as a pyroelectric energy harvesting systems. Secondly, the optimization of energy harvesting and storage. The PZT/PU composite prepared is considered as one of the most promising composites for energy harvesting systems, due its various advantages, such as mechanical flexibility, high temperature sensitivity, low cost as well as its high electro-active functional properties. The current generated by all samples for temperature fluctuations over a period of time in the order of 140 s have been rectified and stored in a charge capacitor of 1mF. The stored energy can reach a maximum value in the order of 14mW for a composite loaded with 40% PZT. Therefore, these composites show an interesting potential to be used in various applications. These results shed light on the thermoelectric energy conversion by a new composite of PZT/PU having the pyroelectric property. © EDP Sciences, 2019",,"Lead zirconate titanate; Sustainable development; Thermal energy; Thermoelectric energy conversion; Different proportions; Energy conversion devices; Energy harvesting systems; Functional properties; High temperature sensitivity; Mechanical flexibility; Pyroelectric properties; Temperature fluctuation; Energy harvesting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069566585

However, a major challenge for (but not limited to) nuclear power generation is the maximisation of the power plant efficiency. Operating power plants with high to maximum efficiency has a profound effect on energy prices and environmental conditions for obvious reasons. One proposed strategy is to utilise energy storage systems for later discharge of power. However, this option entails transmission losses and a considerable capital cost. Therefore, this work explores the potential of water desalination as a proxy for energy storage systems in nuclear power plants. The current work explores various water desalination technologies and compares their performance in terms of the economics, water quality and production capacity. Three case studies have been adapted including APR1400, SMART and NuScale technologies. On the desalination side, Reverse Osmosis (RO), Multi-Stage Flash (MSF), Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) and hybrid combinations were studied. Results indicate that various desalination techniques can replace energy storage systems with justifiable capital cost and yet provide fresh water with acceptable quality. Specifically, RO can use the excess power produced via nuclear reactors during low demand periods with relatively low costs, without introducing new radiation release pathways. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","APR-1400; Energy storage systems; Nuclear power; Nuclear water desalination; NuScale; SMART; Water desalination","Costs; Distillation; Electric energy storage; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactors; Water filtration; Water quality; APR-1400; Energy storage systems; NuScale; SMART; Water desalination; Desalination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069532750

This research investigated visible feedback mechanisms, including factual and social displays, in a limited industrial experiment in a manufacturing SME to demonstrate potential energy savings from changes in practice. Factual feedback on a set of milling machines is shown to provide savings of 2.9% of total energy consumption, and social feedback based on machine threshold levels is shown to deliver savings of 5.1% of total energy consumption.

In terms of electricity consumption, the building sector was the largest electricity consuming sector, and it accounted for 57.4% of total electricity consumption in 2017. The objective of this paper is to assess the long-term energy policy in the building and the industrial sectors during 2005-2050 through a perspective of energy saving potentials and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation by using the Long-range Energy Alternative Planning system (LEAP). Results indicate that energy labeling and monetary incentive in the energy efficiency plan (EEP2015) and renewable energy plan (AEDP2015) are the most effective measures in the building and industrial sectors. This study discloses that plans are effective policies to reduce not only energy demand but also GHG emissions. Therefore, such reduction potentials can meet Thailand's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) target. In 2050, the deployment of biogas will significantly reduce GHG emissions in the residential sector. The GHG emission reduction from the non-metallic, papers and pulps, and chemical industries will be diminished by the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology in 2030 onwards.

In this topic, the characteristic curve of the energy storage system is the key to control the system to reach optimum power to the load. In previous research, mathematical equations were used to get the characteristic curve. This paper proposes the polynomial regression based on the actual output data from the prototype to model the characteristic curve of the SS-CAES prototype. The authors have compared the use of mathematical models and polynomial regression in modeling the power curve with actual observational data and determining the level of accuracy of modeling. The results showed that by using polynomial regression, the characteristics of the SS-CAES prototype power curve could only be obtained by using the sample data from the system output with accuracy value 0.967 for R-square.

The system has the following elements: battery-based storage systems, hybrid renewable systems (wind and solar generators with controllable dispatch), traditional generators and electric vehicle aggregators for demand management. In order to reach economic and reliable operation of the system, a multi-objective optimization model considering battery life extension, in a side; and energy generation costs, and recharge price for electric vehicles, on the other side, is established. To address the variability and inherent stochastic nature of renewables, uncertainty cost functions for the hybrid renewable systems are used through probability density functions of the available resources. Additionally, in order to allow balancing the uncertainty and variability of renewable generation, Demand side management (DSM) is introduced into the optimization problem through controllable resources in the grid like plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). A coordinated charging strategy is developed for PEVs through aggregators to obtain the most economic power dispatch scheme and the lowest charging price. The optimal set of operation parameters of the micro-grid is obtained using the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Results show that the proposed methodology is useful to obtain a market environment able to handle the scheduling of generation resources and operation parameters of the micro-grid system. © 2019 World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

This review presents feature of solar energy and their applications in different agricultural Production are of substantial importance and a contestation to researchers and scientific research, one of the main problems of using solar energy is that the sun available in large quantities on the day and ends when the sun sets so you must store the solar energy during the day and then be-used during the night. In order to take advantage of solar energy during the night has been adopted several ways to store solar energy during daylight hours and the most important of these methods are using different types of solid materials, for example Basalt, Sand and Gravel. The effect of solid materials treatments on storability of solar energy is reviewed herewith, which may help to the researchers in planning their experiments abut “solar energy” more useful and in right direction to get more accurate results.

This algorithm evolved from the Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) by adjusting the shuffling process of the SFLA. The simulations focused on a 16-bus distribution system. The simulation results achieved by the proposed algorithm were compared to those of well-known algorithms such as conventional SFLA, Genetic Algorithm and Combined Heuristic Constructive Algorithm. It was found that the power loss of the system reconfigured simultaneously with installing the DG is better than the system with only network reconfiguration or installing DG. While considering the best case after network reconfiguration with DG placement, the power loss of the system using this adaptive SFLA was significantly better than that of other algorithms. Thus, the proposed adaptive SFLA becomes another outstanding method for power loss reduction and can be utilized for network reconfiguration or DG placement.

This structure, called super-twisting algorithm predictive current control (STA-PCC), was introduced for a three-phase voltage source converter (VSC) connected to the grid. The VSC was interfaced with two renewable energy systems (Photovoltaic (PV), Wind Turbine (WT)) and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to satisfy the energy needs of a micro-grid. Then, the STA-PCC was applied to the VSC to regulate the DC bus voltage and current for the purpose of enhancing dynamic tracking behavior of the power and improving the quality of the energy of the hybrid renewable energy system (HRES). Innovative control was also developed for DC-DC boost converter to maximize the available energy of the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and that of bi-directional DC-DC converter in order to provide BESS with the necessary incoming power. In addition, the performance of the STA-PCC method suggested for the VSC was compared with that of the classical controls such as standard Proportional Integral (PI)- PCC control, first order PWM (Pulse-With Modulation) sliding mode control (SMC), Hysteresis Current Control (HCC), Voltage Oriented Control (VOC) and the traditional Direct Power Control (DPC).

Specifically, autonomous driving systems are extremely complex; they tightly integrate many technologies, including sensing, localization, perception, decision making, as well as the smooth interactions with cloud platforms for high-definition (HD) map generation and data storage. These complexities impose numerous challenges for the design of autonomous driving edge computing systems. First, edge computing systems for autonomous driving need to process an enormous amount of data in real time, and often the incoming data from different sensors are highly heterogeneous. Since autonomous driving edge computing systems are mobile, they often have very strict energy consumption restrictions. Thus, it is imperative to deliver sufficient computing power with reasonable energy consumption, to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles, even at high speed. Second, in addition to the edge system design, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) provides redundancy for autonomous driving workloads and alleviates stringent performance and energy constraints on the edge side. With V2X, more research is required to define how vehicles cooperate with each other and the infrastructure. Last, safety cannot be guaranteed when security is compromised. Thus, protecting autonomous driving edge computing systems against attacks at different layers of the sensing and computing stack is of paramount concern. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art approaches in these areas as well as explore potential solutions to address these challenges.

This kind of control method could lead to cost savings if the power-based distribution tariff of distribution system operators (DSO) includes a price component based on monthly peak power. Some Finnish DSOs have also launched this kind of power-based distribution tariff for small-scale customers. Simulations indicate that EVs can likely be charged without increasing the monthly peak powers of real estate when EV penetration is relatively small. Higher EV penetration would lead to a higher risk of some EVs to not fully charge.

The plant is fed by a hybrid renewable energy source. The frequency of the high-pressure pump motor is changed from 35 to 50 Hz using a variable frequency drive. In addition, the feed water temperature and the reject control valve are controlled. This article investigates the effects of SEC, Cw, permeate salt concentration, and plant productivity. The results show that both SEC and Cw are reduced by increasing the frequency up to 45 Hz before rising thereafter. Also, SEC and Cw decrease with increasing feed temperature and reduced reject valve opening. As a result, the optimum values of SEC and Cw are found at 45 Hz and 40 °C with 25% valve opening, representing 4.5 kWh/m3 and 0.55 $/m3, respectively.

The obtained amorphous activated carbon with three dimensional interconnected porous structure exhibited high specific surface area of about 1520 m2/g. Furthermore, polyaniline (PANI) conductive polymer were grown on the porous carbon surface to promote its capacitance for preliminary test as the anode for lithium battery. The SEM characterization revealed the homogeneous longitudinal growth of polyaniline crystalline at the applied concentration of 0.03M aniline monomers on the surface of targeted porous carbon. The pineapple leaf fiber derived activated porous carbon could exhibit high capacity density as 320 mAh/g for the initial charge-discharge test and then substantially dropped to the reversible capacity of about 63 mAh/g at a current density of 0.5C. After composited with polyaniline, the porous carbon/polyaniline composite showed the superior initial capacity density of 425 mAh/g with the following improved revesible capacity by 27% relative to that of the bared porous carbon material. Moreover, the conducted porous carbon/polyaniline composite could also sustain higher cycle stability after 50 cycling tests. © 2019 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Lithium battery anode material; Pineapple Leaf Fiber (PALF); Porous carbon material","Activated carbon; Aniline; Anodes; Chemical activation; Electric discharges; Fibers; Lithium batteries; Polyaniline; Potassium hydroxide; Waste treatment; Charge discharge tests; Electrochemical energy storage devices; High specific surface area; Hydrothermal techniques; Interconnected porous structure; Lithium battery anode; Pineapple leaf fiber; Porous carbon materials; Porous materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067672984

One of the shortcomings of several bio oils and first generation biodiesels has been their cold properties. Still, the need for alternative fuels is also present in arctic areas where the storing of the fuels may become problematic. The main aim of the current study was to determine how the storage related properties of fuel blends change if the fuels first freeze and then melt again. The samples were analyzed three times: as fresh, and after the first and second freezing-melting phase transitions. The share of renewables within the blends was 20 vol-%. Rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and animal-fat based methyl ester (AFME) were blended with LFO in a ratio of 80 vol-% of LFO and 20-vol% of RME or AFME. The investigated and compared properties were the FAME content of the neat FAMEs, and kinematic viscosity, density, oxidation stability index, and acid number of the blends. Cold filter plugging point was measured for AFME and its blend. According to the results, the quality of the FAMEs and their blends did not change significantly during the freezing over. The freezing-melting phase transition seems, thus, not to be as big a threat to the fuel quality as the high temperatures are. According to the results of this study, the studied fuels were feasible after the freezing-melting phase transition. © 2019, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

The solution techniques that have been used are programming techniques and heuristic approaches. In both cases, it is important to have a well-defined target function to be optimized. Nowadays, the power systems are more complex with the introduction of the renewable sources of energy with highly stochastic behavior. For this as follows it was pretended to obtain a model for the penalty costs in a photovoltaic generator. This paper shows a mathematical analysis with probabilistic methods contrasted with an analytic development for controllable renewable systems to be included in the target functions of economic dispatch problems. In order to validate the mathematical approach, Monte Carlo simulation was used to obtain the underestimation and overestimation penalty values of the scheduled power for the uncertainty cost of photo-voltaic (PV) generation in an instance of energy storage. Developed under a model with a uniform distribution of power, the document presents the validation for the uncertainty cost factor (UCF) comparing the Monte Carlo simulation with the analytic proposal where the low error in the results proved the advantages of using the analytic model due to its quadratic form and its coherence with the simulations that were performed. © 2019 World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

High quality feed for livestock is alfalfa, which has a very high nutritional value and its cultivation is also important for crop production in terms of improving the soil structure and nitrogen enrichment. The aim of this paper is to inform about the experimental investigations of alfalfa drying and colour changes under different drying conditions. The results of natural convection at 27.5 °C and 40% relative air humidity are compared with forced convection at 1.2 m s-1 air flow velocity at the same air temperature and with results of drying by natural convection at 50 °C. The dry matter content was measured gravimetrically after drying in a hot air dryer at 105 °C. Higher drying rates shorten the time required for drying and earlier preservation and storage in the hayloft or in the hay bales. This reduces the risk of wetting of feed such by rain and degradation by fungi, etc. A shorter drying time is also important in terms of energy savings. The precise knowledge of the drying process and drying curves allows also to determine the appropriate time for storage and conservation for production of another type of fodder e.g. haylage or silage. The measurement results show a positive effect of higher drying speeds as well as increased air temperature. Higher drying air temperature during convection led to the partial lightening and greater yellowing of the feed. © 2019, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

This study addresses the lack of studies on automation and control of systems that produce electricity, heating, cooling, and potable water. Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization of the annualized total cost is used to select and size the plant components. The final layout consists of solar photovoltaic (PV) and thermal, an absorption chiller and a multi-effect desalination for electricity, heating, cooling and water, respectively. As auxiliary sources, boiler, gas turbine and grid connection are present. Storage units for electricity, heating, and water are also included in the proposed layout. The control and automation system are implemented using ladder logic. Sufficient supply, efficient resource use, financial gain, and real-world factors such as equipment degradation and response delay are considered in the control scheme design. Applying the methodology to a mixed industrial, commercial and residential zone in Southern Luzon, Philippines, the simulation results show successful implementation of all control scenarios.

Wet walls are very common problem of old buildings, but it can appears also in new buildings as well. The moisture in the wall influence the insulation quality; bigger heat losses continuously cause problems of worse heat balance, higher consumption of energy for heating and it can result in not sufficient indoor conditions in such a room or building. Old rural residential buildings and also agricultural buildings for housing of animals, storage of different materials, workshops etc. could be repaired and reconstructed by the used of some special methods. The application of special plaster can reduce the walls moisture as well as improve the thermal properties of the buildings by reduction of thermal conductivity. This paper includes the results of laboratory experiments focused on research of plaster properties (temperature, moisture and thermal conductivity) and tests provided in the real building. Different measuring principles, enabling mutual comparison of results were used for this research. The measurement results showed a significant effect of high wall moisture on the heat losses. Differences between the walls improved by new tested plaster and old untreated walls are discussed in this paper. Obtained results from this measurements and findings may be useful for further research in this issue as well as for the practical solutions for similar problems in many old buildings. © 2019, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

The exercise allows students to acquire hands-on learning and visualize central concepts of the Nernst equation, battery technology and components, half-cell reactions, charging/discharging tests, and performance analysis. Additionally, students are required to operate a range of key electronic instruments, including multimeters, power supplies, and electronic loads.

Materials and Methods: Powders of presintered and isostatically pressed 5Y-TZP, 4Y-TZP and 3Y-TZP were mixed with a 10-MDP-based cement (Panavia F 2.0), then stored in deionized water for 48 h at 37°C or thermocycled 10,000 times. Raman spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy were used to assess the presence of a functional group (PO32-) that could indicate bonding before and after thermocycling. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to identify the presence of the suspected Zr-O-P bond in the same specimens. A shearbond strength (SBS) test was conducted based on ISO 29022:2013. Results: Marked peaks assigned to the asymmetric vibrations of the PO32- functional group were observed in both zirconias before and after thermocycling. The binding energy corresponding to Zr-O-P interactions (531.5 eV) was masked by the aluminosilicate in the filler of the cement.

Apart from the thermal energy available mainly from the exhaust system, electromagnetic and solar energy sources can be exploited, in combination with a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) converter. Since the thermal efficiency of the internal combustion engines (ICEs) is pretty low (below 40 %) for both petrol and Diesel powered vehicles, a part of the wasted energy can be recovered, stored for a certain amount of time and then used for different purposes. © 2019 Editura Academiei Romane.

With the rapid growth in population, the conventional energy are shrinking due to depletion in the raw materials. Hence, it is the need of the hour to turn towards renewable energy systems to meet the demand of energy. An attempt has been made to integrate the present e-bike with a cost effective hybrid renewable energy system consisting of Solar panels(PV) and rotational energy system provided by the DC generator. The system consists of power sources – PV module 30Wp,DC generator (30W),different units such as microcontroller unit and energy storage device i.e battery (2x12Ah). A micro contoller unit for energy management has been developed to control power flow to be drawn from the battery fully charged/To switch over to the battery fully charged, stored in 12Ah battery module, and optimizes the sharing of power from hybrid energy. The practical study on a prototype module has resulted in an optimal yield leading to a cost effective system and saving of more than 50% power from conventional source. Due to generation of green electricity by the hybrid system, it has a very little impact of pollution on our life.

The surface area increased with Fe 2 O 3 content increasing up to 60 wt% in the composite. However, with further increase in Fe 2 O 3 content, the surface area began to decrease. The reduction processes of the CeO 2 –Fe 2 O 3 nanocomposites were studied in a hydrogen atmosphere at 300–600 °C. The reduction rates increased by increasing both the temperature and Fe 2 O 3 content in the nanocomposites. The microstructure of the reduced composites at 500 °C illustrated the presence of a considerable number of macro- and micro-pores. The activation energy values were calculated which were in the range of 3.56–5.37 kJ·mol −1 at the initial stages (up to 35% reduction) and 5.21–10.2 kJ·mol −1 at the final stages (up to 80% reduction) of reduction. The rate-controlling mechanisms in both the initial and final reduction stages were determined, and the initial reaction stage was controlled by combined gaseous diffusion and interfacial chemical reaction mechanisms for all the composites except for pure CeO 2 , which was controlled by a chemical reaction mechanism. The final reaction stage was controlled by a gaseous diffusion mechanism for some composites, while for the others it was controlled by combined gaseous diffusion and interfacial chemical reaction mechanisms. The hydrogen sorption properties of the nanocomposites were studied by pressure composition isotherms using a volumetric method. Hydrogen storage in the nanocomposites increased by increasing the temperature because of the formation of oxygen vacancies which enhance atomic H adsorption and function as strong adsorption sites forming more metal hydride covalent bonds. © 2019, The Nonferrous Metals Society of China and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CeO 2 –Fe 2 O 3 nanocomposite; Hydrogen storage; Oxygen vacancies; Reduction kinetics; Reduction mechanism","Activation energy; Cerium oxide; Diffusion; Hematite; Hydrides; Hydrogen bonds; Molar ratio; Nanocomposites; Oxygen vacancies; Reduction; Hydrogen atmosphere; Interfacial chemical reactions; Pressure composition isotherms; Rate-controlling mechanism; Reaction mechanism; Reduction kinetics; Reduction mechanisms; Volumetric methods; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066051985

Ti-doped WO 3 thin films with different Ti doping contents (5 wt%, 10 wt%, and 20 wt%) are fabricated on F-doped tin oxide substrates using the spin coating technique. Tungsten powders and titanium butoxide are used as starting sources of the W and Ti ions, respectively. After the coating process, as-deposited films are annealed at 500°C for 2 h in ambient air. The effects of the dopant on the crystal structure, surface morphologies, chemical bonding, and optical properties of the films are investigated by the X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry. The XRD results indicate the monoclinic structure of the prepared films with a significant alteration in the crystalline size when the film was incorporated with the Ti dopant. The FTIR results reveal the deterioration in the W and O bonding as the film is doped with the Ti dopant.

This paper investigates the optimal power scheduling of a hybrid energy system connected to the grid in the presence of demand response strategy and inconvenience cost. Methods: A new proposed method of calculating the inconvenience cost which is dependent on total home appliance load, Customer Interruption Cost (CIC) and delay time operation of home appliances is proposed. The hybrid energy system consists of solar photovoltaic (PV) module and battery bank storage system. The home appliance scheduling is formulated as a non-convex mixed integer programming with a binary decision variable to switch ON/OFF the home appliances. The optimization objective is to minimize both the total daily electricity cost and inconvenience cost of a residential customer with different time-shiftable, power shiftable home appliances and customer time preference constraints. Results: The results show that it is important to schedule home appliances and include their inconvenience cost so that home appliances are not only shifted to the lower electricity tariff periods but can also start at their customer preferred operation times. Conclusion: The results also show that the hybrid energy system is able to cater for all the energy requirements of home appliances during the day, reducing power demand from the grid by a significant percentage and thus, relieve the power system network and afford electricity consumers significant monetary savings. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","Battery bank storage; Customer interruption cost; Demand response; Electricity cost/bill; Home appliance scheduling; Solar PV module system","Battery storage; Domestic appliances; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Integer programming; Photovoltaic cells; Power control; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Scheduling; Solar power generation; Battery banks; Customer interruption costs; Demand response; Electricity costs; Solar PVs; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065997395

The specific difference of this approach is that, for determination of the energy release and erosion of electrodes in an air HCS, it is necessary to have the data on the electrical and thermal and physical characteristics of metal of the electrodes, specific conductivity of the low-temperature plasma in the flash channel and peak and time parameters of the pulse current in the discharge circuit of an HVEP with a CS. The concept of equivalent active impedance of the plasma channel of a high-current flash stable within the whole CS discharge period on the electric load was introduced and determined mathematically. The electrophysical transference process of the ionized atoms of the melted metal of the switchboard electrodes on the cathode of the studied HCS was approximately considered. The proposed approach allows making a quick evaluation of the electrical energy balance in the HVEP discharge circuit with a CS taking into account the thermal losses in the switchboard.

To realise these applications, the devices are required to adhere and conform to soft curvilinear surfaces, while be able to bend, compress, stretch and even self-heal, much like the human skin. Organic materials, particularly, conjugated polymers possess a unique molecular structure, which enables their optical, electrical, and electrochemical properties. In fact, one of the main features that make these materials highly suitable for stretchable electronics is the chemically-Tunable mechanical properties that allow structural deformation without significantly affecting the electronic function. In this review, we discuss ours and others' recent attempts in designing and engineering conjugated polymers and their composites to incorporate new mechanical and physical characteristics that are not intrinsic to these organic materials, such as stretchability and self-healing abilities. We discuss such approaches from a molecular design perspective. In particular, the focus is on the molecular parameters, such as material choices, synthetic approaches and molecular interactions that play a crucial role in enabling such new characteristics. Furthermore, we highlight recent progress in their applications and discuss the future prospects of stretchable organic electronics. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.",,"Flexible electronics; Industrial research; Mechanical properties; Molecular structure; Electronic functions; Emerging applications; Human Machine Interface; Industrial communities; Physical characteristics; Self-healing abilities; Stretchable electronics; Structural deformation; Conjugated polymers",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065862187

However, FG is specified to a comparatively small area and stores data temporarily. A cloud-fog based model is proposed for efficient allocation of resources from different buildings on fog. FG provides low latency hence, makes the system more efficient and reliable for consumer’s to access available resources. This paper proposes an cloud and fog based environment for management of energy. Six fogs are considered for six different regions around the globe. Moreover, one fog is interconnected with two clusters and each cluster contains fifteen numbers of buildings. All the fogs are connected to a centralized cloud for the permanent storage of data. To manage the energy requirements of consumers, Microgrids (MGs) are available near the buildings and are accessible by the fogs. So, the load on fog should be balanced and hence, a bio-inspired Bat Algorithm (BA) is proposed which is used to manage the load using Virtual Machines (VMs). Service broker policy considered in this paper is closest data center.

The support management system is modeled by stochastic mixed integer linear programming approach. The charge and discharge of the batteries of the fleet of vehicles are brought about to a convenient contribution for the maximization of the expected profit of the aggregator. The optimization takes into consideration the profiles of usage of the vehicle owners and the battery degradation of the vehicles. The vehicles are assumed as bidirectional energy flow units: allowing grid-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-grid operation modes. A strong interaction of information exchange is assumed between the aggregator and vehicle owners. A set of scenarios is created by a scenario generation method based on the Kernel Density Estimation technique and are subjected to a reduction by a K-means clustering technique.

However, fog covers the small geographical area by storing data temporarily and send furnished data to the cloud for long-term storage. In this paper, a fog and cloud base platform integrated is proposed for the effective management of energy in the smart buildings. A request generated from a cluster of building at demand side end is to be managed by Fog. For this purpose six fogs are considered for three different regions including Europe, Africa an North America. Moreover, each cluster is connected to fog, comprises of the multiple number of buildings. Each cluster contains thirty buildings and these buildings consisted 10 homes with multiple smart appliances. To fulfill the energy demand of consumer, Microgrids (MGs) are used through fog. These MGs are placed nearby the buildings. For effective energy utilization in smart buildings, the load on fog and cloud is managed by load balancing techniques using Virtual Machines (VMs). Different algorithms are used, such as Throttled, Round Robin (RR) and First Fit (FF) for load balancing techniques. These techniques are compared for closest data center service broker policy. This service broker policy is used for best fog selection. Although using the proposed policy, three load balancing algorithms are used to compare the result among them.

In this chapter, the Lebanese power system is used as a case in point to showcase the importance of shifting the foundations of conventional thinking in power system planning into a new paradigm where renewable energy is adopted as priority choice. The technical and economic feasibility of wind farms, solar PV, and battery energy storage systems is studied. Simulations are run using Homer pro to optimize for the lowest cost of electricity. Results show that incorporating utility-scale renewable energy systems and battery energy storage can decrease the overall levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to $c7/kWh. Furthermore, without the integration of considerable storage capacity, an economic limit of approximately 20–25% renewable energy penetration is reached. Sensitivity analysis is undertaken while adopting various values for the cost of natural gas and internalizing the social cost of carbon. Results confirmed a positive correlation between the cost of carbon and the price of natural gas on the one hand and system renewable energy fraction on the other hand. Introducing demand side management and increased grid flexibility also showed a high level of sensitivity to both system LCOE and the renewable energy fraction. Based on these results, the research strongly recommends that power system planning in the Middle East integrates modeling of renewable energy systems and the stacked benefits of utility-scale storage with the objective to achieve the highest combined technical, economic, and environmental benefits. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Battery storage value streams; Capacity value; Economic carrying capacity; Grid flexibility; Integrated energy system; Renewable penetration; Sustainable energy transitioning; Utility-scale battery storage; Utility-scale solar PV farm; Utility-scale wind farm",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064667058

For the power system, this energy transition implies (1) a larger share of electricity from variable renewable energy (VRE), in particular from sun and wind; (2) a larger share of electricity in total energy use, i.e. a higher rate of electrification of the energy system by means of electric vehicles, heat pumps, power-to-products, etc.; and-as a result of these two trends-(3) a higher need for flexibility and system integration. This chapter analyses the implications of the Dutch energy transition for the integration and flexibility needs of the Dutch power system within an EU electricity market and trading context. In particular, by means of the EU28+ electricity market model COMPETES, we assess the potential of EU power trading as one of the options to meet these needs besides other domestic flexibility options such as flexible power generation, VRE curtailment, demand response and energy storage. The modelling results show that the flexible power trade potential is rather substantial-and even dominant-depending on the level of interconnection capacity and market integration across EU member states. In addition, we briefly discuss complementary results by means of the NL energy system model OPERA, notably on demand response as a potentially large domestic flexibility option. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Demand and supply of flexibility; Demand response; EU electricity market; Integration of variable renewable energy (VRE); Power system; The netherlands; Trade",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064371862

As with the rapid increase in demand, there is a great need to design new solutions for effective energy management. With the advent of new Information Communication Technologies (ICT) traditional electricity grids, meters, buildings and appliances became Smart Grids (SGs), Smart Meters (SMs), Smart Buildings (SBs) and Smart Appliances (SAs). The SBs consists of a large number of SAs. These smart appliances are constantly sharing, their data with SGs, SMs and SBs. So a huge amount of data is generated every day. This data requires complex computations, faster retrievals and larger storage facilities [1]. Keeping this in view, a new energy management system is designed with the help of Cloud and Fog computing. As the Cloud Computing (CC) provides large number of data computation and permanent storage facilities however, it has limitations in fast data retrieval and causes response delays. On the other hand, Fog Computing (FC) offers faster information retrieval with less response delays with only limitation of temporary storage. The proposed system architecture integrates the qualities of both CC and FC by combining their services. To manage the load between different Virtual Machines (VMs) on Fog servers a new load balancing algorithm Modified Shortest Job First (MSJF) is the proposed. The performance of proposed algorithm is evaluated through different performance parameters. e.g. Processing Time (PT), Response Time (RT) and cost. To validate the performance of proposed scheme simulations are carried out in the Cloud Analyst tool. From the results it is assumed that the proposed technique can not outperforms the Round Robin (RR) and Throttled algorithms, due to its limitations in network delays and RT. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cloud Computing (CC); Demand Side Management (DSM); Fog Computing (FC); Smart Buildings (SBs); Smart Grids (SGs)","Balancing; Demand side management; Digital storage; Electric power measurement; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Energy management systems; Fog; Intelligent buildings; Search engines; Smart power grids; Complex computation; Electricity-consumption; Information communication technology; Load balancing algorithms; Performance parameters; Smart grid; Storage facilities; System architectures; Fog computing",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063896575

The wind system adopted in the study is of the low starting speed that meets the criteria of low winds in the selected region under study unlike the adequate solar resource, which will lead to an examination of its feasibility and profitability to compensate for the inactivity of photovoltaic panels in periods of no sunlight. That is a system with fewer photovoltaic panels and storage batteries whereby these should return a full day of autonomy. Two configurations are selected and discussed. The first is composed of photovoltaic panels and storage batteries and the other includes the addition of a wind system in combination with the photovoltaic system with storage but at a higher investment cost than the first. Consequently, this result proves that is preferable to opt for a purely photovoltaic system supported by the storage in this type of site and invalidates the interest of adding micro wind turbines adapted to sites with low wind resources. © 2019 Polish Academy of Sciences.

A MG is often defined as a low voltage (LV) distribution grid that encompasses distributed energy resources and loads that operate in a coordinated way, either connected to the upstream distribution grid or autonomously (islanded from the main grid). Considering the islanded operation of the MG during a given period, it is necessary to develop proper tools that allow the effective coordination of the existing resources. Such tools should be incorporated in the MG control system hierarchy in order to assure proper conditions for the operation of the autonomous MG in terms of active power, voltage and reactive power management. Energy storage devices are essential components for the successful operation of islanded MG. These devices have a very fast response and are able to absorb/inject the right amount of power. For the operation of the MG in islanding conditions during a longer period, it is necessary to integrate information related to the forecasting of loads and PV-based generation for the upcoming hours for which is intended to maintain MG in islanded operation. Therefore, this paper presents a tool to be integrated in the Microgrid Central Controller (MGCC) that is responsible to perform a multi-temporal optimal power flow (OPF) in order to schedule the active and reactive power within the MG for the next time intervals. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Autonomous operation; Microgrid; Renewable energy integration; Storage dispatch; Voltage/var control","Electric load flow; Energy policy; Energy resources; Reactive power; Scheduling; Active and Reactive Power; Autonomous operations; Distributed Energy Resources; Low-voltage distributions; Micro grid; Photovoltaic generation; Renewable energy integrations; Voltage/var controls; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063543130

We investigated the effects of different environmental stressors on the lipid content of the Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras) from spawning ground samples that were collected annually in the northern Baltic Sea. During 1987–2014, the average lipid content of herring muscle decreased from 5%–6% (wet mass) to 1.5% (wet mass). Generalized linear mixed models indicated that sea water salinity and the size of the herring stock explained best the declining trend of lipid content. We estimated that the amount of the lipid storage incorporated in the spawning stock decreased by approximately 45% during the study, with respective energy content decreases. Fatty acid composition analysis revealed that herring lipids contained a high proportion of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid; 20:5n-3) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid; 22:6n-3), which likely originated from its main summertime prey, Limnocalanus macrurus.

New composite materials with good thermal storage capacities have become important in the last few decades. The role of these materials is reflected in their ability to store energy and allow it to be reused in some other thermal systems. The aim of this study was to create a new material based on the basically activated bentonite clay. First, the clay was basically activated, resulting in a thick gel. Afterwards, stearic acid, Glauber’s salt and active carbon were added, and a heterogeneous gel was obtained as a finished final product. In order to obtain the best heterogeneous gel with satisfactory storage properties, the amount of stearic acid and Glauber’s salt was varied. The characterization of the resulting heterogeneous gel was performed by measuring the cooling rate of the gel samples. Compared with stearic acid, Glauber’s proved to be more effective. Heterogeneous gel cooling tests have shown that there was a certain proportional dependence between the concentration of stearic acid and the Glauber salt. However, it has been noticed the reduction in the cooling rate. Namely, the increase in stearic acid and Glauber’s salt concentration lead to slowing down the cooling rate of the gel. Adding active carbon to the heterogeneous gel also reduced the cooling rate, which indicated that the presence of active carbon in the heterogeneous gel should not be excluded in the future. The advantage of this system is the improvement of the gel thermal characteristics by the presence of water and clay. The gel was reversibly cooled and heated up to 100Â °C without changing the homogeneous structure. This system can be used as a heat recovery pad, due to its flexible body pillow. It can be very quickly warmed up in a microwave oven if it is packaged in polyethylene packaging. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Activated carbon; Bentonite clay; Glauber’s salt; Paraffin; Stearic acid; Thermal storage",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063210991

The results of the study show that R&amp;D expenditures for energy efficiency and fossil energy have an increasing effect on CO 2 emissions. Contrary to expectations, there is no significant relationship between renewable energy R&amp;D expenditures and CO 2 emissions. Remarkably, there is strong evidence that the power and storage R&amp;D expenditures have a reducing effect on CO 2 emissions.

It is an attempt to reduce these emissions and satisfy electricity demand. Its emerging potential is feasible by implementing microgrids. Higher cost and stochastic nature of intermittent RES are complications for the implementation and operation of such solutions. This paper analyzes economic feasibility and sustainability of implementation of hybrid power system (HPS) consisting of wind generator (WG), photovoltaic system (PVS), diesel generator unit and batteries as storage of energy. Technical analysis of the grid integration and parallel operation of the system and the grid are presented in the paper with an example of a real medium-voltage distribution network operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is shown that implementing such HPS would be beneficial in terms of economy, ecology, as well as in reducing energy losses. Besides, it will reduce power supplying costs and secure better exploitation and utilization of natural renewable energy sources. These technologies positively affect power network by decreasing the risk of network-components overloading, need for network expansions, better exploiting the power-generation facilities based on renewable resources and positively impacting voltage profiles. Moreover, it is shown that the microgrid can operate in island mode with autonomous power supply for consumers. The microgrid could serve as an example to similar remote locations in order to reduce their costs of electricity, acquire more reliable and sustainable power supply, and embrace green future.

The anodic passivity of iron in the aqueous solutions is known since the beginning of the past century due to formation of extremely thin iron oxides or salt layer. Ten years ago the discovery of the formation of thick and self-ordered nanoporous and nanotubular iron anodic films in organic solutions containing some fluorides and water opened a new pathway for investigation and application of these materials and stimulated a still growing interest. Therefore, the purpose of this review paper is to provide a better insight in the processes of iron anodizing for nanoporous and nanotubular film formation, their composition, and possible application trends in the view of the latest and our advances in this field. Apart from the formation of nanostructured films in well-known ethylene glycol electrolytes, the peculiarities of iron anodizing in other organic electrolytes, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, are presented herein. Since earlier published papers are almost forgotten, but they could give the basic knowledge on nanostructured anodic film formation in other electrolytes, we briefly introduce the behavior of iron in aqueous solutions resulted from the active dissolution of iron and polarization-dependent the passive film formation.

The detected mismatched words are deactivated in the second step to reduce energy consumption. In the second step, the charge stored in a matched ML first segment is shared with second ML segment. Use of positive feedback in this step makes the MLSA circuit simple. Post-layout simulations implemented using 180nm 1.8V CMOS logic have been performed. In addition to lower scheme complexity and 16.5% reduction in circuit area, the proposed scheme provides dynamic energy saving up to 5.5% and peak power reduction of 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art charge-sharing technique. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","charge-sharing; Content addressable memory; energy consumption; feedback; match line; sensing scheme","Associative storage; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Logic gates; Memory architecture; Routers; Table lookup; Ternary content adressable memory; Charge sharing; Dynamic energy reduction; Match line; Peak power reduction; Post layout simulation; Reduce energy consumption; Sensing schemes; Ternary content addressable memory; Feedback",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062244463

To model the microgrid, a Multi-Agent System is proposed based on Extreme Learning Machine algorithm to estimate the wind and photovoltaic power output from weather data. In this study a microgrid, with different generation units and storage units is considered. Provision of utility grid insertion is also given if the total energy produced by microgrid falls short of supplying the total load or if there is an excess of energy produced instead of to be wasted. Thus the goal of our Multi-Agent System is to control the amount of power delivered or taken from the main grid in order to reduce the electricity bill and make profit by selling the surplus in the energy market. After supplying the load requirements, Extreme Learning Machine algorithm for classification is used to make decision about selling/purchasing electricity from the main grid, and charging/discharging batteries.

This paper presents an unconventional redesign of a double skin façade (DSF), based on Trombe wall principles, to enlarge solar gains in heating seasons and avoid overheating issues in summertime. The DSF variant is equipped with a thermal storage mass in the DSF cavity and interior insulation. The thermal mass, in this case concrete, is of a dark colour for high solar absorption, whereas the shading device is highly reflective. In contrast to traditional Trombe wall systems, this TCW is not supposed to actively heat interior space or transfer thermal energy. Instead, the TCW aims to regulate heat flux within the façade level by the management of solar thermal energy fluxes. The potential to reduce buildings’ heat losses through solar energy use is shown and compared to a traditional external thermal insulation composite system (ETICS) with an appropriate insulation thickness for renovation purposes in Switzerland. The U-Value is therefore considerably lower, 0.25 instead of 0.41 for the TCW. Due to the innovative design and fully transient operation, a highly detailed and flexible simulation tool is needed to analyse and assess the façade performance. The decision to simulate the novel system was made for Modelica-Dymola, with its object-oriented, equation-based simulation language. The simulations of both TCW and ETICS show potential for heat loss reduction due to solar energy storage on every orientation. However, the TCW shows a high solar energy usage due to its ‘natural’ overheating tendency. Furthermore, heat losses are significantly lower than the U-Value predicts and, in some cases, even lower than the ETICS heat losses. In addition, due to its lower use of material and lower weight, the system can be used as a curtain wall system instead of traditional DSFs, which have higher heat losses in winter and higher solar gains in summer. © 2019 TU Delft.

For this strategy to mature the absorption maximum of N has to be moved from the UV to the visible region. Here we show that functionalization of the system with dithiafulvene (DTF) electron donors causes remarkable redshifts of various N derivatives. Thus, some derivatives were found to absorb light with an absorption onset up to 556 nm. The incorporation of DTF units comes, however, with a drawback with regard to achieving reversible N-to-Q and Q-to-N isomerizations. For some derivatives, the photoisomerization was completely quenched. The compounds were subjected to a computational study to shed light on the underlying reason for this reluctance to undergo photoisomerization. The computational study revealed that in these systems, the first excited state (S1) is positioned close to or lower than the transition state for photoconversion, effectively blocking a possible conversion to Q, thus revealing a practical challenge for the future design of N-Q energy storage systems with an improved solar spectrum match. © 2019 the Owner Societies.",,"Excited states; Isomers; Solar energy; Absorption maxima; Computational studies; Energy storage systems; First excited state; Functionalizations; Metastable isomers; Redshifted absorption; Transition state; Red Shift",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061113831

The aim of this research was to examine the effect of the above ground parts of different seagrass and seaweed species on the deposition, retention, physical (dry bulk density and grain size), and chemical properties (organic carbon content and organic carbon density) of sediment. Six seagrass and seaweed communities with different above ground morphologies were studied between the dry (April 2015) and wet seasons (August 2015). The results suggested that the highest canopy complexity index was in the green alga, Halimeda macroloba Decaisne patches, which had the highest canopy score. High canopy complexity patches were likely to retain more sediment and store more organic carbon than lower canopy complexity patches and bare sand, respectively. The sediment retention and percent of organic carbon content were also affected by seasons. The wave action in the wet season affected the sediment through higher sediment deposition and movement, which caused increased sediment instability and led to changes in sediment properties. In addition, shoot density in the dry season was lower than that in the wet season, most likely due to damage from long exposure during low tide. Our results indicate that the canopy complexity of marine macrophytes and seasons influenced both sediment retention and properties of the sediment. © 2019 The Ecological Society of Japan","canopy complexity; carbon storage; marine macrophytes; sediment movement; sediment properties","carbon sequestration; coastal zone; complexity; dry season; macrophyte; marine environment; meadow; morphology; organic carbon; seagrass; seaweed; sediment analysis; sediment transport; wave action; Phuket [Southern Region]; Southern Region; Thailand; Chlorophyta; Halimeda macroloba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060779810

Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) could play a relevant role in facing these challenges, as the technologies have passed the demo and prototype phases to a wide market implementation phase. The only remaining barrier for their implementation is their cost, but even this barrier is quickly disappearing. In this paper, we address the financial feasibility of storage technologies in electricity systems. In particular, we evaluate whether such technologies are economically sustainable and how far they are from becoming viable. For this purpose, we consider the Chilean electricity system and evaluate the maximum possible arbitrage revenues that could be achieved under ESS through benefiting from energy time shift, diminishing of transmission losses, and transmission upgrade deferral. The results show that the arbitrage revenues are still below the cost of storage systems. Further improvement in storage efficiency or a decrease in the cost of storage systems is still needed to make this type of investment financially viable in the near future. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Economics; Investments; Economic viability; Electricity system; Empirical analysis; Energy generations; Energy storage systems; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Market implementation; Renewable energies; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060476090

OWE simultaneously helps the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, an increase in energy security and diversity, creates jobs, and promotes sustainable development. Various enterprise opportunities and jobs will be created from the development of the supply chain, surveying and assessment of resource and environment and from maritime ports and logistics. These opportunities have been themselves challenges for the OWE industry. A number of measures to overcome those challenges are discussed in this paper. Offshore wind resources, marine ecology and seabed habitats urgently need to be surveyed and assessed at nationwide scales in order to plan zones for windfarm development, ecological conservation and maritime logistics. Advanced tools including LIDAR, coupled atmosphere-ocean models, surface heat flux models among others, and the use of Marine Spatial Planning and the study of the existing frameworks in other countries are recommended. Identifying the larger contribution areas of the supply chain and their bottlenecking challenges, detail costs breakdown, and the use of integrated and coupled models for analysis and design and control measures can effectively enable cost reduction. The supply chain and projects should be designed for the different offshore environment. Operational policies and technologies and energy storage can mitigate the dispatch-down of wind energy. A multi-contracting strategy is suggested for large utilities and the EPCI contracting for the independent or less experienced developers. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Cost reduction; Marine spatial planning; Offshore wind energy; Opportunities; Supply chain; Technical challenges","Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Ecology; Energy security; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat flux; Offshore oil well production; Supply chains; Surveys; Sustainable development; Wind power; Ecological conservation; Marine Spatial Planning; Off-shore wind energy; Offshore wind resources; Opportunities; Resource and environment; Technical challenges; Technology opportunities; Offshore technology",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060346892

In Vietnam, as well in other emerging and developing countries such as in ASEAN, there are considerable problems to realize a safe drinking water supply in rural, removed and island areas. Such regions are characterized by insufficient infrastructure, e.g. there are often no drinking water connection, no wastewater treatment and an unreliable energy supply. As a main problem in water quality, the available surface water is often polluted with germs and coliforms. For an efficient drinking water treatment or disinfection at present and in the medium-term, the needed equipment and requirements for a comprehensive improvement of water quality are not available (e.g., missing chemicals, financial resources, energy capacities). With regard to germ load problem, there are additional difficulties due to microbial recontamination, as well as biofilm formation during water storage at the given climate conditions. The idea for carrying this study is to develop a Safety Drinking Water Disinfection System for rural areas in Vietnam as such as in ASEAN developing countries where the national electric grids may be lacked. The study will focus to develop two main parts: development an energy-efficient UV treatment technology (e.g. LED-lamp irradiation) as main disinfection step with a small-scale electrolysis cell (using MOX electrodes) and development a small Mixture Axis Wind Turbines (MAWT) for supporting the electric to the UV treatment and MOX electrodes. The MAWT wind turbine will works with both horizontal and vertical axis principles of wind turbines. Research found that the safety drinking water disinfection system that powered by wind energy is very suitable with the life standard condition in rural and removed areas in Vietnam. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Disinfection; MAWT; Removed area; Water; Wind energy","Chemical water treatment; Developing countries; Disinfection; Electrodes; Energy efficiency; Potable water; Surface waters; Ultraviolet radiation; Wastewater treatment; Water; Water quality; Water supply; Wind power; Wind turbines; Climate condition; Drinking water disinfection; Financial resources; MAWT; Removed area; Safe drinking water; Small wind turbine; Standard conditions; Rural areas",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060332809

Unlike the classical solid electrode film containing capacitors, where the electrode material is fixed to the current collectors and capacitance is therefore limited with an active surface area of porous electrode, the flow electrodes offer new design opportunities which enable fully continuous charging/discharging processes as well as easily scalable systems. Here we describe the successful incorporation of the carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na) assisted carbonaceous suspension electrode in aqueous media for the electrochemical flow capacitor concept and demonstrate the electrochemical charge storage in flowable electrodes using a cation conductive membrane as separator in a double-pipe flow-electrode module. Experimental results were combined with computer simulations (FEM) to specify limiting processes EFC charging. The flow-electrode slurry is based on 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 , 3 wt% CMC-Na and activated carbon powder suspended in water. During continuous operation of the system, the capacitance of the flow electrode reached to 0.3 F/L providing the energy and current densities of 7 mWh/kg and 56 mW/L, respectively. Additionally, we report a 70% round trip efficiency calculated during charging and discharging of the cell between 0 V and +0.75 V, while applying the current density of 1.6 mA/kg. The double-pipe flow-electrode module is easily expandable for transportation of large volumes of electrode material. © 2019, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Topical issue: Flowing Matter, Problems and Applications","Activated carbon; Capacitance; Cellulose; Materials handling; Pipe flow; Sodium sulfate; Suspensions (fluids); Activated carbon powder; Active surface area; Carboxy-methyl cellulose; Conductive membranes; Continuous charging; Continuous operation; Electrochemical charge; Electrode material; Electrochemical electrodes; Activated Carbon; Capacitance; Cellulose; Materials Handling; Pipe Flow; Sodium Sulfate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060142092

Many of the world’s freshwater sources are being drained faster than they are being replenished. To solve this problem, new techniques are developed to improve and optimise renewable groundwater sources, which are an increasingly important water supply source globally. One of this emerging techniques is rainwater storage in the subsurface. In this paper, different methods for rainwater infiltration are presented. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations are performed to quantify the impact of variation in the soil characteristics and the infiltration parameters on the infiltration rate.

Sensor nodes are inherently a cheap piece of hardware - due to the common need to use many of them over a large area - and usually contain a small amount of RAM and flash memory, which are insufficient in case of high degree of data sampling. An overloaded sensor can harm the data integrity, or even completely reject incoming messages. The problem gets even worse when data should be received from many nodes, as missing data becomes a more common phenomenon as deployed WSNs grow in scale. In cases of an overflow, our Distributed Adaptive Clustering algorithm (D-ACR) reconfigures the network, by adaptively and hierarchically re-clustering parts of it, based on the rate of incoming data packages in order to minimize the energy-consumption, and prevent premature death of nodes. However, the re-clustering cannot prevent data loss caused by the nature of the sensors. We suggest to address this problem by an efficient distributed backup-placement algorithm named DBP-ACR, performed on the D-ACR refined clusters. The DBP-ACR algorithm re-directs packages from overloaded sensors to more efficient placements outside of the overloaded areas in the WSN cluster, thus increasing the fault-tolerance of the network and reducing the data loss. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2019.","Data loss; Distributed backup-placement; Networks connectivity; Wireless sensor networks","Broadband networks; Energy utilization; Fault tolerance; Flash memory; Random access storage; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Adaptive clustering algorithms; Data integrity; Data loss; Distributed backup-placement; Fault-tolerant; Placement algorithm; Premature death; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Clustering algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059752004

The reaction CO2 + 4H2 ↔ CH4 + 2H2O is performed on a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst and is strongly exothermal. For this reason, the reactor design must take into account an efficient thermal management system to limit the maximal temperature and guarantee high CO2 conversion. Additionally, the methanation reactor is subject to parameter sensitivity. This phenomenon can generate instability in the operation of a power to gas plant, due to the variability in the hydrogen production rate. Here we present a parametric study of the thermal properties of the reaction and determine the minimal feed temperature for the normal operation of a reactor. The minimal temperature required is determined by several parameters, such as pressure, space velocity and properties of the cooling system. For adiabatic reactors, the required feed temperature is 210 °C for a space velocity of 3000 h-1 and a pressure of 10 bar. The space velocity strongly affects the positioning of the ignition point, causing a large variability of the feed temperature required. At the same time, the optimal working point of the reactor is at the minimal activation temperature. The properties of cooled reactors are elucidated, showing how the interrelationship between cooling and feed temperature makes the management of this class of reactors more challenging. On the base of the modelling results, we propose a reactor configuration that adjusts the thermodynamic limitations and respects the minimal requirements for reaction ignition, allowing a more stable operation and avoiding the functioning at excessive temperature. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aluminum compounds; Carbon dioxide; Chemical activation; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen production; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Ruthenium compounds; Activation temperatures; Adiabatic reactors; High energy densities; Hydrogen production rate; Parameter sensitivities; Parametric sensitivity; Reactor configuration; Thermal management systems; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058889199

In this study, hyaluronic acid (HA)-coated PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating lutein were fabricated by a solvent displacement method to improve the physicochemical properties and the stability of lutein. A biphasic release profile of lutein was observed, following zero-order release kinetics. The physical stability of lutein stored at 4°C, 30°C, and 40°C for 30 days was enhanced when lutein was encapsulated in the nanoparticles. The degradation of lutein in PLGA NPs coated with HA was fitted to a second-order kinetic model. The rate constant increased with increasing storage temperature. The activation energy of lutein-NPs was 63.26 kJ/mol. The half-lives of lutein in PLGA-NPs were about 49, 4, and 2 days at a storage temperature of 4°C, 30°C, and 40°C, respectively. The results suggested that lutein-NPs should be stored at 4°C to prevent physical and chemical degradation. The photodegradation of lutein in NPs followed a second-order kinetic model. The rate constant was 0.0155 mg -1  ml day -1 . Cell viability study revealed that HA-coated PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating lutein did not show toxicity against retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19). The NPs bound ARPE-19 cells in a time- and a dose-dependent manner. The binding efficiency of lutein-NPs decreased at higher concentrations, suggesting that the NPs might reach binding saturation capacity. In conclusion, HA-coated PLGA nanoparticles could be used to deliver lutein and improved physicochemical property of lutein.

Cotton stalks are a typical agricultural residue with little economic value and there is no direct competition to food or feed provision. Currently, the stalks are often burnt on the fields. The investigated rotary kiln pyrolysis process has already been successfully applied at industrial scale before. In the investigated scenario, the pyrolysis char is returned to the soil for long-term carbon storage while the volatile pyrolysis products are used energetically. The steady-state process simulation environment IPSEpro was used to assess a virtual conversion plant. The mass- and energy flows are determined based on earlier measurements at a 500 kg/h test plant. The results show that 52.8% of the carbon contained in the biomass accumulate in the biochar, whereas 38% of the input energy can be exported as heat energy at temperature levels suitable for electricity generation or industrial heat supply. The pyrolysis char shows a low molecular O/C ratio of 0.07 and an H/C ratio of 0.26. The expected half-lives of biochar in soil are in the order of 1000 years for O/C ratios below 0.2. This makes the presented approach an interesting low-tech negative emission option. The predicted net negative emissions through stored carbon amount to 2.42 t CO2 per hectare and year. The overall CO2 emission avoidance effect can be increased if fossil fuel is substituted by the energy exported from the pyrolysis process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Cotton stalks; Mass and energy balances; Negative emission; Pyrolysis; Simulation","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Carbon dioxide; Cotton; Energy balance; Fossil fuels; Soils; Bio chars; Cotton stalk; Electricity generation; Emission technology; Mass and energy balance; Simulation; Steady state process; Thermal conversion; Pyrolysis; bioenergetics; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; crop residue; electricity generation; energy balance; environmental technology; mass balance; numerical model; pyrolysis; simulation; soil improvement; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057489692

The operation of hydropower reservoirs in Nigeria does not take into cognizance the ecological situation of the reservoir as it may affect aquatic life that depend on it. This study is sought to model energy generation at Kainji hydropower reservoir, Nigeria considering ecological flow release (EFR) scenarios. Two neural network (NN) approaches were used to optimize the energy generation at the station using the current operating rule and incorporation of EFR scenarios. The study revealed that the correlation coefficients (r) for energy generation without considering EFR using multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and radial basis neural network (RBFNN) were 0.94 and 0.84, respectively. Average annual energy generation at the station using MLPNN and RBFNN approaches, without considering EFR were 223930 and 222926 MWh, respectively. The two NN modeling approaches were found to perform well in simulating energy generation. The appropriate reservoir operation rule stipulated that the EFR that will not negatively affect energy generation should range between 10 to 25% of reservoir storage. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Energy generation; Kainji; Neural network; Reservoir operation","Ecology; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Hydrogeology; Intelligent computing; Neural networks; Artificial neural network models; Correlation coefficient; Energy generations; Hydropower reservoirs; Kainji; Multi layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN); Radial basis neural networks; Reservoir operation; Reservoirs (water)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057070102

Many image compression standards, such as JPEG and JPEG2000, are unsuitable for implementation in WISNs because of their high energy consumption. In this paper, a solution to this problem is proposed. It consists of a region-of-interest (ROI) based image compression using the discrete Tchebichef transform (DTT).The main idea is about compressing only the ROI instead of the whole image. The DTT is used as an alternative to the discrete cosine transform (DCT) due to its low complexity and good energy compaction. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method reduces the number of arithmetic operations, the processing/transmission energy consumption and the amount of transmitted data. The savings obtained generally exceed 50%. Furthermore, it has a competitive compression efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art image compression techniques. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete cosine transform; Discrete Tchebichef transform; Energy consumption; Image compression; Region-of-interest coding; WISNs","Complex networks; Computational complexity; Digital image storage; Discrete cosine transforms; Energy utilization; Image coding; Image segmentation; Parallel processing systems; Wireless sensor networks; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Discrete tchebichef transforms; High energy consumption; Image compression standards; Image compression techniques; Region-of-interest coding; Wireless visual sensor networks; WISNs; Image compression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056874583

This is particularly the case with the Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE), which may occur if such a tank is exposed to fire for a prolonged period. Therefore, the local Dutch LPG transport sector adopted a thermally insulating tank coating as a ‘standard outfit’ for their tank trailers, with the aim to delay a BLEVE for a sufficiently long period for emergency services to take appropriate measures and for people near the accident location to be evacuated. On a European scale however, no consensus has been reached on the cost-benefit of such measures. With the current drive towards “greener” and renewable energy sources, this issue has regained attention with alternative fuels such as LNG, CNG and Hydrogen and a need was felt for (better) theoretical models and experimental data concerning the behavior of transport tanks carrying these substances. In this paper a new tank thermal (equilibrium) model is described to predict pressure and temperature behavior of a multi layered, thermally insulated tank containing a compressed liquified gas exposed to heat. Results are compared with data of three bonfire experiments, in which 3 m3 tanks, filled for ca. 50% with LPG were exposed to fire. A good match between modelled and experimental pressure and temperature evolution in time could be obtained using a constant value for the thermal conductivity of the insulation layer. The modelling showed that the thermal insulation value is crucial for an accurate prediction of these parameters as well as the opening time for a pressure safety valve. As relevant temperatures may cover a very wide range (from cryogenic in LNG-tanks to over 1000 °C in a fire) knowledge of the thermal (and physical) behavior of the insulating layer over a large temperature range is essential. The same holds for the behavior of the PRV when subjected to fire. Extreme temperatures may also lead to deviating behavior from what is expected based on the initial settings. © 2018","Bonfire test; Compressed liquified gas; Equilibrium model; Pressure valve; Thermal coating; Thermal conductivity","Alternative fuels; Coatings; Cost benefit analysis; Digital storage; Emergency services; Fires; Liquefied petroleum gas; Natural gas transportation; Renewable energy resources; Tanks (containers); Thermal conductivity; Thermal conductivity of gases; Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosions; Equilibrium modeling; Extreme temperatures; Pressure and temperature; Pressure safety valve; Pressure valves; Renewable energy source; Thermal coatings; Thermal insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056670347

Since the on-off control depends on the flow rate of the collector fluid, while the proportional control depends on the temperature of the fluid exiting the collector, a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the parameters that control fluid flow, i.e. the values of collector flow rate and collector fluid temperature that maximize the solar fraction using both on-off and proportional control schemes, respectively. Simulated results showed that for very low collector areas, the on-off control scheme is more effective, but for medium to high areas (comprising the range of usable collector areas), the proportional control scheme is more effective.

First, pin fins heat sink (PF) is embedded inside the PCM to act as a thermal conductivity enhancer. Second, black steel mesh fibers (SWF) are employed in the solar still basin with PCM. In this regard, four cases of the solar stills are studied and compared conventional still: conventional solar still (without PCM), still with PCM (With PCM), still with PCM and pin fins heat sink embedded in the PCM (With PCM-PF) and still with PCM and SWF in the basin (With PCM-SWF). The energetic and exergetic performance of the four cases is evaluated and compared under the meteorological conditions of New Borg El-Arab City, Egypt. The results show that the total daily cumulative yield of distilled water of still with PCM, still with PCM-PF, and still with PCM-SWF are greater than of conventional still by 9.5%, 16.8%, and 13%, respectively. Additionally, the inclusion of the fins heat sink in the PCM increases the average daily energy and exergy efficiencies by 17.9, and 13.2%, respectively compared to conventional one. Likewise, the energy and exergy efficiencies of still with PCM-PF are higher than those of solar still with PCM by 7.7 and, 6.8%, respectively. Furthermore, placing SWF in the basin of still with PCM significantly enhances the daytime energy and exergy efficiencies with a considerable reduction of these values in the nighttime. The total daily evaporative exergy for still with PCM-SWF is greater than those of conventional still, still with PCM, and still with PCM-PF by 13, 8, and 2%, respectively. Also, still with PCM, still with PCM-PF, and still with PCM-SWF exhibit an increment of the daily exergy efficiency 5.9, 13.2, and 17.3%, respectively compared to still without PCM.

In the short term, water inflow to the Aswan High Dam (AHD) reservoir will be reduced as water is abstracted during GERD’s first impoundment. In the long-term, the inflow to AHD will be affected due to flow regulation and additional evaporation losses from GERD. This chapter presents a stochastic analysis of the impacts of GERD on AHD. Synthetic Nile flow series that preserve the Hurst exponent of the flow are generated using a Fractional Gaussian Noise (FGN) model. Results from the simulation of 1,000 equally probable Nile flow series using a simplified GERD-AHD system model are analyzed. The results indicate a very high downstream risk when GERD is operated as an annual storage reservoir, which questions the economic attractiveness of GERD in a regional context when operated solely for hydropower energy maximization. Operating GERD as a long-term storage reservoir results in reduced, yet still considerable impacts. Optimal GERD filling and operation policies aimed at minimizing downstream risks through a comprehensive regional economic, environmental, and social analysis are urgently needed. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Aswan high dam; Extended drought; Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam; Hurst phenomenon; Impact assessment; Stochastic simulation; Water deficiency",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055667032

Ethiopia unilaterally announced its plan to build the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Blue Nile at the very same location of the Border Dam. It increased the storage capacity from 11.1 to 74 billion cubic meter (BCM), which represents 1.5 times the annual flow of the Blue Nile at the Sudanese border and produces 6,450 MW of hydropower. The dam will have negative impacts on the downstream countries, especially shortage in water supply and hydropower generation during filling and operation. The main purpose of this chapter is to develop a methodology using the GERD-AHD SIM model to determine the best operating policy for the Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile that achieves minimum impact on the Aswan High Dam (AHD). The main objectives should be achieving a minimum water deficit in the downstream and a maximum power generation from both GERD and AHD. The results of the model were tabulated and analyzed using the mentioned criteria to obtain the best long-term regulation policies for GERD. The main two factors that affect the management of AHD due to the regulation policy of GERD are the annual total water deficit downstream AHD and the generated energy from AHD. Those two evaluating factors were taken as the most critical criteria for arranging and choosing the best scenarios based on the results of the model. Different scenarios were selected and tested. Each scenario has the following inputs: the initial levels of both GERD and AHD, the average AHD level, the average inflow to AHD, the annual evaporation of AHD and GERD, the energy produced from the two dams, the maximum water deficit downstream AHD, the number of water deficit downstream AHD, the number of shutdowns of AHD hydropower station, and the total water deficit. It is clear that the cooperative management scenarios which preserve water storage in GERD for the need of the downstream countries represent the best regulation scenarios. Comparing cooperative and noncooperative scenarios shows this fact explicitly. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Blue Nile; GERD; High Aswan Dam; Optimization; Renaissance Dam; Simulation model",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055659586

This dam will have many impacts on the water supply of downstream countries like Egypt and Sudan. The objective of this chapter is to model the impacts of GERD on AHD. Illustration of the model constructed to simulate impacts of filling options for the GERD reservoir is provided. Many scenarios were conducted using the developed model to predict the optimum filling scenario to minimize these impacts on downstream countries. Simulating results show that the live water storage in AHD will reach its minimum with the minimum water level of 147 m by the end of 5 years filling period of the full storage capacity of GERD (74 BCM). Scenarios of changing GERD’s filling period and GERD filling storage capacity have been conducted, and their effect on agriculture has been sesed. Scenario results show that decreasing the water supply required for agriculture will cause a high loss in income especially in case of 5Â years filling period of GERD. Therefore, increasing filling period is a solution, or the other solution is the changing of the GERD storage capacity to minimize downstream impacts on AHD. However, this will not eliminate the impacts but will just relief them. The net loss in the return of each crop was computed for all scenarios to enable the decision takers to plan for the future for the different scenarios. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; AHD; Filling scenarios; GERD; Impacts; Loss; Modeling; Storage",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055341468

Ecohydrogeological challenges are dominant in the territory of Ethiopia. According to the 1959 treaty with Sudan, the annual water share of Egypt is 55.5Â km3. The main controlling factor on water resources in East Africa is the East African Rift that is the largest continental rift on Earth, resulting in crustal mobility between the Arabian and African plates. Ethiopia is characterized by rugged topography, a unique regime of the short intense rainy season, high evaporation, flooding, drought, dominant basaltic rocks, an abundance of geologic faults and fractures, active volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, severe erosion and land degradation, siltation, and lack of major groundwater aquifers. The Nile basin countries suffer from lack of electrical energy. By the end of the last twentieth century and the beginning of the new twenty-first century, the demand for hydropower energy has been increased for development in the Nile basin countries especially Ethiopia, resulting in political tension between the upstream and downstream countries. Egypt has almost completely relied on the Nile River water for irrigation since the pharaohs. The Egyptian government signed about 15 agreements with some Nile basin countries for utilization of the Nile water. The construction of water projects in the Nile basin region in Ethiopia has produced political tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia over the construction of Tekeze in 2009, the Tana-Beles diversion in 2010, and the under-construction Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) that has started in April 2011. The present chapter deals with the geological characteristics of the Nile region in Ethiopia. It also discusses the environmental challenges in the region of Tekeze River (Atbara) in Ethiopia and its impacts on downstream countries Egypt and Sudan. Analysis of ASTER DEM of Tekeze River basin showed that it has a dendritic pattern. Tekeze reservoir area is 155 km2 at 1,140 m asl with a volume of 9.3 km3. Egypt and Sudan lost 4 km3 in 2008 and 2009 due to dead storage in addition to an annual loss estimated at 200–700 Mm3 from evaporation and irrigation. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Aswan High Dam; Blue Nile; Ecohydrogeology; Geological challenges; GERD; Tekeze River",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055313320

As it is known they need electrical energy, generally provided by diesel generators. Because of the far and remote distance, the refuelling process is very expensive. So, sustainable development needs hybridization with a local renewable energy (solar energy in this case). Accordingly, the PV panels produce sometimes an excess of power and in other times a lack of power. To overcome this uncontrolled power production, storage device is mandatory. In this work a pump storage hydroelectric system is preferred for its ecological aspect and the subject context. The energy management of this hybridization type requires a specific control. The proposed energy management takes into account the temporal solar energy availability and link it to the online diesel fuel consumption optimization and the pumping constraints.

In this regard, the development of new energy-saving technologies is a top priority. Analyzing the state of modern energy saving technologies, one can conclude that there is a lack of effective solutions for utilizing waste low-temperature and cryogenic heat resources (450–132) K. Thermoacoustic heat machines (TAHM), can effectively use such energy sources. TAHM are characterized by high reliability, relative low cost and environmental safety. The introduction of thermoacoustic technologies is hampered by the low power of TAHM and the difficulty of directly obtaining mechanical work from acoustic waves. There is the possibility of using bi-directional turbines as a converter of acoustic energy in mechanical work. Such approach will enable the creation of thermoacoustic turbine generators of high power. To determine the optimal design parameters of bidirectional thermoacoustic turbines it is necessary to conduct a complex of experimental and theoretical studies. Article presents the results of experimental research of the working processes of the “bi-directional turbine—electric generator—TAHM” complex. For the registration and analysis of experimental information, a special computer based control system was created. System includes MCU-based pulse-phase control subsystem for thermoacoustic engine heater, data acquisition subsystem and SCADA-based PC software for data storage and analysis. Designed with green IT approach paradigm control system is described in detail. Initial processing of measurement results was carried out in real time with the help of special software. The results of physical experiments allowed determining the boundary conditions for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of work processes in the bi-directional turbine. The peculiarities of the medium hydrodynamics in the TAHM resonator during the work of the bi-directional turbine at various load conditions were studied. Based on the results of CFD modeling the structural optimization of turbine is proposed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","CFD modelling; Green IT approach; Specialized computer system; Thermoacoustic processes; Waste-heat utilization",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054192278

A mixture of broken fuel rods, pellets, and parts of the cladding were repacked into 72 canisters, whose nuclear material content was to be determined.

The effect of mixed burn-up and the irregular fuel geometry was taken into account by using the so-called infinite energy method.

However, the biological mechanisms that induce these stresses and the immunological responses to stressors are not currently understood. In this study, a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS based) metabolomics approach was used along with flow cytometry to characterize the responses of clams during aerial exposure in two different storage conditions (ice and no ice) and storage periods (1 h and 6 h). The results showed a significant increase in haemocyte mortality and ROS production in clams exposed to room temperature (no ice) and after 6 h compared to low temperature (with ice) and 1 h, respectively. The metabolite profiles of clam haemolymph in all groups revealed changes of many metabolites between the different temperatures and sampling times. Among them, lactic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid and glutamic acid were identified as significantly affected by both storage condition and period. These results indicate that clam storage stresses produced biological disturbances related to energy metabolism, which was switched from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. These findings provide insights regarding the specific metabolic consequences of bivalve live storage and transport, which may lead to improved product handling along the supply chain. In addition, this study demonstrates the effective use of metabolomics and flow cytometric approaches on bivalve haemolymph as a non-destructive shelf life assessment method. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bivalve live storage; Clams; Energy metabolism; Flow cytometry; GC–MS-based metabolomics; Oxidative stress","bioenergetics; bivalve; environmental stress; flow cytometry; gas chromatography; immune response; mass spectrometry; metabolism; metabolite; mortality; oxidative stress; reactive oxygen species; storage; temperature; New Zealand; Bivalvia; Crassula; Pseudocardium sachalinensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054104815

Harsh climate and the water deficit are obstacles to all year round cultivation. The greenhouse design should provide adequate control of its microclimate, such as temperature, relative humidity, CO2 concentration, and lightning depending on ambient conditions and the type of cultivation. This paper provides a thorough review of previous research on greenhouses design features, deemed important for efficient operation in hot and arid environments, such as dimensions, orientation, shapes, covering and shading materials. Effective greenhouse cooling methodologies and operation strategies to achieve and maintain satisfactory climate conditions in hot and arid conditions are investigated. Namely, natural and forced ventilation, evaporative cooling and fogging systems. Furthermore, the paper discusses the greenhouse control methods (field, remote, direct and combined) to monitor and regulate the indoor climatic parameters. Finally, the paper focuses on current greenhouse sustainable technologies and clean energy applications that contribute towards minimizing dependency on fossil fuels and leading to efficient water management.

Cracking and rutting are the main types of damages in asphalt mixtures from extreme low and high temperatures. Recently, in building construction, phase change materials (PCM) are efficiently used as a source of thermal energy preservation by storing thermal energy in a latent form. The use of microencapsulated phase change material (µPCM) enables thermal energy storage and release inside bitumen. The PCM’s crystallization/melting temperature define the temperature at which thermal energy can be stored/released. In this study, a low temperature µPCM was incorporated in bitumen and its rheological and thermal properties were evaluated using dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) respectively. It was observed that upon cooling, the addition of 25% µPCM by mass of bitumen crystallizes and releases the stored thermal energy. The surface temperature variations captured by means of thermal infra-red camera illustrate that compared to controlled specimen, in modified bitumen a delaying effect of cooling was found during the crystallization temperature of µPCM. © 2019, RILEM.","Crystallization; Infra-red image; Phase change material; Thermal energy",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053418392

Transition metal halides provide catalytic effects for de/rehydrogenation kinetics, while ACNF benefits thermal conductivity and hydrogen permeability as well as prevents particle agglomeration during cycling. Significant reduction of onset and main dehydrogenation temperatures of MgH2 (ΔT = 243 and 158 °C, respectively) are achieved by doping with 5–10 wt % of NbF5, ACNF-TiF4 and ACNF-NbF5. During the 1st cycle, the latter samples liberate 4.7–5.0 wt % H2 within 1 h 30 min, whereas MgH2 doped with ACNF reaches only 1.5 wt % H2. The reaction between MgF2 and NbHx (x &lt; 1) (MgH2-NbF5 and MgH2-ACNF-NbF5) during dehydrogenation results in the formation of new catalytic active species of Nb-F-Mg favoring kinetics.

However, these improvements come at the cost of critical design challenges for the hardware implementation due to the huge amount of data that has to be processed immediately, especially the storage of large channel state information (CSI) matrices. This paper presents an on-chip memory system equipped with CSI which provides high area efficiency, while supporting flexible accesses and high bandwidths. Optimization across system-algorithm-hardware is used to develop hardware-friendly compression algorithms exploring propagation characteristics and large antenna-array features. More specifically, group-based and spatial-angular transform algorithms are implemented in a heterogeneous memory system, which consists of an unified memory for storing compressed CSI and a parallel memory for flexible access. Up to 75% memory can be saved for a 128-antenna system, at a less than 0.8dB performance loss. Implemented in ST 28nm FD-SOI technology, the capacity of designed system is 1.06Mb, which is equivalent to 4Mb uncompressed memory and can store 100 128 × 10 channel matrices. The area is 0.47 mm2, demonstrating a 58% reduction compared with a memory system without CSI compression.

For this purpose, magnetic nanostructures such as patterned arrays with magnetic characteristics having high uniaxial magnetic anisotropy are the new contestants in the field of ultrahigh storage media. In this context, we focus on the synthesis of nano-dimensional magnetic media consisting of Dy and Fe bilayer structured arrays, fashioned in patterned magnetic nanostructures. The dimensional characteristics of these nanostructures were illustrated using field emission electron microscopy and energy dispersive elemental mapping. Room temperature magnetic properties of these nanostructures were first determined through atomistic spin model simulations which led us to configure the experimental hysteresis loop for DyFe bilayer. The deposition of crystalline Dy and Fe through DC and RF sputtering resulted in a soft magnetic behavior as revealed by the characteristic shape of the hysteresis loops exhibiting anisotropic features. Reflection spectra for these DyFe bilayers reveal a decrease in reflectance from ultraviolet to visible region demonstrating high absorption in visible region. The variation in reflectance spectra and squareness of the hysteresis loop reveals that these nanostructures as a viable candidate for magneto-optical devices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","DyFe nanostructures; Electron beam lithography; Magnetic recording media; Magnetron sputtering","Binary alloys; Dysprosium; Electron beam lithography; Hysteresis; Hysteresis loops; Iron; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Magnetism; Magnetron sputtering; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Reflection; Absorption in visible region; Field emission electron microscopy; Magnetic characteristic; Magnetic nanostructures; Magnetic recording media; Magneto-optical applications; Patterned magnetic nanostructure; Uniaxial magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052540957

In such sense, the aim of this work is deal with the reaction environment characterization of a parallel plate flow reactor having a net-like spacer, by the employment of original experimental and theoretical techniques in order to evaluate the influence of transport phenomena on overall reactor performance. Flow distribution is analyzed by the use of automatic measurement of flow paths using image processing techniques, based on mathematical morphology theory. On the other hand, a theoretical model of current-potential distribution under intermediate kinetics control (tertiary current-potential distribution) based on numerical solution of turbulent diffusion-convection and binary electrolyte theory is proposed. In this case, concentration at electrode surface was determined in terms of dimensionless Damkhöler number, obtained from a mass balance at electrode-electrolyte interface in steady state. RTD curves obtained by image processing techniques describes correctly the fluid dynamics behavior in electrochemical reactor. Meanwhile, correspondence between calculated and experimental polarization curves using the oxidation of chloride ions to chlorine as model electrochemical reaction was made with an error values lesser than 7%, indicating a good agreement between theoretical model and experimental tests. Results founded in the parallel plate flow electrochemical reactor used here, evidenced that the methodology proposed to analyze the hydrodynamic and electrochemical behavior are adequate to its use in other electrochemical devices, particularly, when they work under intermediate kinetic and limiting current conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Experimental RTD validation; Flow electrochemical reactor; Mass transport analysis; Numerical simulation and experimental validation; Tertiary potential and current distribution","Chlorine compounds; Electrochemistry; Electrolytes; Electrolytic analysis; Hydrodynamics; Image processing; Interface states; Kinetics; Mathematical morphology; Numerical models; Parallel flow; Current distribution; Experimental RTD validation; Experimental validations; Flow electrochemical reactor; Transport analysis; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052516288

The evaluation of different forms of ESTs' integration into the existing EPS, especially those with higher potential for solving issues related to the optimization of the power supply and high demands at peak loads, was carried out. Two interactive programs-ESCT and ES-Select-were utilized in the feasibility study that allowed evaluating various ESTs with regard to their characteristics, costs, benefits, which was carried out for the first time in this region. The study analyzed a variety of power ranges within the power system components including bulk generation, transmission, distribution, commercial and industrial, and residential users. These programs were used to address the price and cost components assuming a normal distribution, as well as the cycle life, size, efficiency, cash flow, payback, benefits range, and market potential of 19 important ESTs about the arid region. The obtained data were all combined to verify the appropriateness of these ESTs, which has been followed by determining the optimal use and best probable physical placement of these ESTs within the EPS, by allowing for the economic, environmental, and technical feasibility. The study showed that the compressed air energy storage (CAES) is the most promising option followed by pumped hydro storage (PHS) and sodium-sulfur battery (NaS), based on the technical and economic evaluations of the different ESTs in arid regions.

The system is equipped with an own storage device which simulates in this study the absorption of any excess energy provided by the PV system in an electrolysis. On the other hand, when the AC load requires a power greater than that provided by the PV, it is the electrical grid that compensates for this energy deficit. This system is built around a varied architecture of converters (DC/DC converters, AC/DC and DC/AC converters). The DC/DC buck converters are used to extract the maximum energy from the PV panels. The AC/DC rectifier and the DC/DC boost converter allow the voltage to be adapted to the DC bus supplying a central inverter. Whether the energy comes from the PV or from the electrical grid, it is always supplied to the load by means of this inverter. This architecture ensures the supply to the load in all circumstances and stores the excess of photovoltaic by a clean process.

The new electrolysis is build with two coaxial cylindrical electrodes which have a radial electrical field with a very low edge effect. The method is based on electrical field confinement which exists in the thin space between the two cylindrical electrodes. The electrical field polarizes water molecules and defeats their enthalpy of formation. A comparative study between a new design and a classical one is made. This study shows that using the same electrical power for the two designs, flat and cylindrical electrodes; hydrogen production for the new design is higher.

Beside the production of energy from traditional and renewable energy sources, the energy management is also required to control the consumption of energy in commercial, industrial and residential houses. Improvement in technologies while reduction in cost has enabled consumers to interconnect the smart devices for reducing cost and energy consumption, this is called internet of things (IoTs). Such increase in the number of smart systems and energy management systems cause a huge amount of data which cannot be processed on traditional system. It requires high computing power and high storage which may be provided by cloud computing. Cloud computing provide resources to customers on demand with low investment and operational cost. The cloud resources are flexible, efficient, scalable and secure. In this paper we simulate the use of cloud computing in smart grid. The datacenters in cloud collect the building’s data, process it and send the results to the building. In this study, we calculate the total response time to each building, the number of requests coming from each building per our, the processing time of each datacenter and the cost of each datacenter (CRRP).

In our proposed scheme, a smart home decides to buy or sell electricity from/to the commercial grid for minimizing electricity costs and PAR with earning maximization. It makes a decision on the basis of electricity prices, demand and generation from its own microgrid. The microgrid consists of a wind turbine and solar panel. Electricity generation from the solar panel and wind turbine is intermittent in nature. Therefore, an energy storage system (ESS) is also considered for stable and reliable power system operation. We test our proposed scheme on a set of different case studies. The simulation results affirm our proposed scheme in terms of electricity cost and PAR reduction with profit maximization. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Energy management; Heuristic algorithms; Power trading; Smart grid","Automation; Commerce; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Intelligent buildings; Optimization; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Ubiquitous computing; Web services; Wind turbines; Cuckoo search algorithms; Electricity generation; Energy storage systems; Home energy managements; Peak to average ratios; Power system operations; Power trading; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048601372

Nevertheless, they can be converted to energy-dense bio-oils by pyrolysis, in an oxygen deficient atmosphere. These bio-oils may be used in combustion or upgraded to yield liquid biofuels for internal combustion engines although their chemical stability still creates some limitations during storage. This work aimed at the evaluation of biochar production by pyrolysis of mixtures of lipid wastes and pine sawdust. For this purpose, thermal conversion was performed with initial vacuum, at temperatures between 573.15 and 673.15 K and a reaction time of 60 min. Biomass incorporation varied between 0 and 38% (w/w). Biochar formation was favored by biomass incorporation and by the increase in temperature. The biochar yield varied from 1–28% and its high calorific value ranged between 24.3 to 36.6 MJ/kg. For incorporations of pine sawdust higher than 23% the carbon content and the calorific value of the biochar decreased due to a higher oxygen content in the raw materials. Highly calorific bio-oils were also produced in these conditions with yields from 24 to 83% (w/w), and high calorific values from 37.8 to 43.4 MJ/kg. These bio-oils have a carbon content higher than 75% and contain high molecular weight components. As such, they could be used in direct combustion in boilers, or as pellet additives. This approach contributes to the implementation of the renewed hierarchy for wastes as defined in the Directive 2008/98/EC namely by identifying alternatives to the deposition of the used cooking oils in landfills. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Biochar; Pine sawdust; Used cooking oil","Biomass; Calorific value; Carbon; Chemical stability; Engineering research; Internal combustion engines; Low temperature production; Oxygen; Pyrolysis; Temperature; Waste incineration; Water recycling; Bio chars; Biodiesel production; High molecular weight; High-calorific-value; Lignocellulosic biomass; Low-temperature pyrolysis; Pine sawdust; Used cooking oil; Oils and fats",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048528569

Hence, this study proposes a new fuzzy Proportional Derivative + Integral (PD+I) controller based on a non-integer system for the robust speed control of highly nonlinear hybrid electric vehicles. In order to have an optimal and adaptive controller, the controller coefficients are tuned online by a novel optimization algorithm, which is called Adaptive Black Hole. In addition, the performance and robustness of the proposed method are tested by the experimental data, the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP - US06). In order to prove the superiority and effectiveness of the suggested novel smart controller, a valid comparison is conducted between the results of the proposed method and recent studies on the same topic like the Model Predictive Control and the conventional online fuzzy PD+I (OFPD+I) controllers. Finally, extensive studies and hardware-in-the-loop simulations are presented to prove that the proposed controller can track a desired reference signal with lower deviation and show that the performance of suggested method is more robust in comparison with the prior-art controllers for all the case studies. © The Author(s) 2019.","electric vehicles (EVs); Fractional calculus; fuzzy fractional-order PDμ+Iλ controller; black hole search algorithm (MBSA); stochastic optimization","Automotive industry; Braking; Calculations; Climate change; Controllers; Digital storage; Gravitation; Hardware; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Hybrid vehicles; Interplanetary spacecraft; Model predictive control; Optimization; Speed control; Stars; Synthetic apertures; Testing; Traction (friction); Black hole search; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Federal test procedures; Fractional calculus; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Optimization algorithms; Proportional derivatives; Stochastic optimizations; Electric machine control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047412324

Also, it is recognized both the amount and quality of BMAT are relevant to preserve the functional relationships between BMAT, bone, and blood cell production. In this article we ponder the information supporting the tenet that the quality of BMAT is relevant to bone health. In the human adult the distribution of BMAT is heterogeneous over the entire skeleton, and both BMAT accumulation and bone loss come about with aging in healthy populations. But some pathological conditions which increase BMAT formation lead to bone impairment and fragility. Analysis in vivo of the relative content of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (FA) in BMAT indicates site-related bone marrow fat composition and an association between increased unsaturation index (UI) and bone health. With aging some impairment ensues in the regulation of bone marrow cells and systemic signals leading to local chronic inflammation. Most of the bone loss diseases which evolve altered BMAT composition have as common factors aging and/or chronic inflammation. Both saturated and unsaturated FAs originate lipid species which are active mediators in the inflammation process. Increased free saturated FAs may lead to lipotoxicity of bone marrow cells. The pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory or resolving actions of compounds derived from long chain poly unsaturated FAs (PUFA) on bone cells is varied, and depending on the metabolism of the parent n:3 or n:6 PUFAs series. Taking together the evidence substantiate that marrow adipocyte function is fundamental for an efficient link between systemic and marrow fatty acids to accomplish specific energy or regulatory needs of skeletal and marrow cells. Further, they reveal marrow requirements of PUFAs. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Bone diseases; Bone marrow adipose tissue; Marrow fatty acids; Saturated fatty acids; Unsaturated fatty acids","fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; saturated fatty acid; fatty acid; adipocyte; adipose tissue; aging; Article; bone cell; bone disease; bone marrow; bone marrow adipose tissue; bone marrow cell; human; inflammation; lipid composition; lipid diet; lipotoxicity; mesenchymal stroma cell; nonhuman; signal transduction; adipose tissue; bone; bone marrow; diseases; health; metabolism; Adipose Tissue; Bone and Bones; Bone Marrow; Disease; Fatty Acids; Health; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039993789
