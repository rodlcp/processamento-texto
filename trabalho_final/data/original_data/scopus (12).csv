Such phenomena do not always appear for a given set of conditions. An investigation has been conducted of the conditions giving rise to grid passivation. As a result, it has been concluded that high potential and low acid concentration are the major factors promoting an increase in impedance. In addition, cell design variables such as the acid/active-material ratio and operational conditions such as over-discharge and squeeze discharge with a very low-rate current may also give rise to passivation. It has been found that a new surface-treatment technology involving application of tin-rich and/or an antimony-rich, thin layer on the grid surface is very effective in overcoming this disadvantageous characteristic of calciumalloy grids. © 1991.",,"Electrochemistry--Energy Resources; Calcium-alloy Grids; Lead-acid Batteries; Storage Batteries; Electric Batteries, Secondary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026394097

Box 124, Port Melbourne, Vic. 3207, Australia","The delivery and storage of electrical energy in lead/acid batteries via the conversion of lead dioxide and lead to, and from, lead sulphate is deceptively simple. In fact, battery performance depends upon the cell design, the materials of construction, a complex interplay between the multitudinous parameters involved in plate preparation, the chemical composition/structure of the active materials, and the duty/conditions of battery operation. It is not surprising, therefore, that the factors responsible for the degradation of battery performance, and eventual failure, are many and varied. Apart from occasional field surveys of automotive batteries in the U.S.A., comprehensive failure analyses of units removed from service are rarely published. In general, the information is kept proprietary, or appears as a post mortem report that is subsidiary to some other topic of interest. By contrast, the literature abounds with detailed laboratory investigations of phenomena that are likely to contribute, wholly or in part, to the demise of batteries. In broad terms, this review draws together the fragmented and scattered data presently available on the failure mechanisms of lead/acid batteries in order to provide a platform for further exploration of the phenomena, and for the planning of remedial strategies. The approach taken is to classify, first, the different lead/acid technologies in terms of required duty (i.e., float, cycling and automotive applications), unit design (i.e., flat or tubular plate, flooded or immobilized electrolyte), and grid alloy (i.e., leadantimony or leadcalcium system). A distinction is then made between catastrophic failure, as characterized by a sudden inability of the battery to function, and progressive failure, as demonstrated by some more subtle deviation from optimum performance. Catastrophic failure is attributed to incorrect cell design, poor manufacturing practice, abuse, or misuse. These problems are obvious and, accordingly, have been afforded little discussion. Progressive life-limiting factors encountered with flooded-electrolyte batteries are discussed in detail. These are mainly associated with degradation of the positive plate, the negative plate and the separator. The technology of valve-regulated (i.e., immobilized-electrolyte) batteries is still at an early stage compared with that of flooded designs and, consequently, published information on failure modes is very limited. Nevertheless, based on the reports that are available and the authors' own knowledge, it is possible to make estimates of the major and minor causes of failure (note, these will also occur in flooded systems, but with shifted emphasis). Grid corrosion and growth are generally considered to be of major importance. Both negative-plate sulphation and water loss are also of concern, particularly in cycling applications. By contrast, the traditional problems associated mossing and dendritic growth of the active material should be reduced in valve-regulated batteries. © 1991.",,"Electrochemistry--Energy Resources; Cycling Duty; Grid Alloys; Lead-acid Batteries; Plate Materials; Electric Batteries, Secondary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026371304

Many countries have contributed to this effort. The market is growing. Some 300 MWe from solar thermal parabolic trough power plants are being fed into electric grids and doing peaking/intermediate load duty under commercial conditions. It is reported that several hundred additional megawatts are under contract or being planned. Approxomately 3-5 billion DM have been spent worldwide on R&amp;D. Only the parabolic trouh power plants have managed to get beyond the R&amp;D stage. Here the accumulated experience is about 1000 MWe × a (1989) power plant operating years. Solar tower and parabolic dish technologies still have to demonstrate their market readiness or are not yet at the pilot project stage. A consortium of European and USA companies is preparing an air-colled 30 MWe solar tower power plant, PHOEBUS, for Jordan. The foundations are being laid for high-temperature solar chemistry. Fifteen years after the initiation of research activities, the international community of scientists and engineers at work on solar thermal energy conversion needs a nwe perspective for the next 15 years in order to avoid technological gaps. There are even more incentives for this work than before: &amp;#x02022; {music flat sign} Over five billion people live on earth; six billion are likely in 2000. The population doubles in only 30 years now! All need to be fed and clothed, all of them need a roof over their head. Since by far the majority lives in or near the highly insolated parts of the world, solar energy utilization is a natural choice. &amp;#x02022; {music flat sign} Investments for energy supply are a significant economic factor. In 1986 they amounted to 320 billion US$ (not including countries with centrally planned economies), which is equivalent to 11% of the world's capital investments. In the future, the greatest demand for energy supply projects will be in the developing countries, most of which are located in the earth's sun belt. For these countries the World Bank estimates a need for annual power plant investments of over 100 billion US$ for the next 20 years. At present about 20 billion US$/a is being invested by the energy utilities, by development banks, and as a result of bilateral agreements. This leaves a balance of over 50 billion US$ for which new financing has to be found. &amp;#x02022; {music flat sign} The use of solar energy contributes only very marginaly, if at all, to environmental damage. Solar energy does not require energy raw materials and as a consequence does not prodcue any associated pollutants. Those aspects of solar energy technologies having effects on teh environment, such as land area, material and eneryg intensities, are becoming less and less relevant because of progress in R&amp;D. &amp;#x02022; {music flat sign} By contrast, the finite nature of the fossil energy raw materials and their irreversible for quasi-irreversible damage to the environment are becoming ever more obvious. The atmosphere is burdened with 22.5 × 109 tons of anthropogenic CO2 annually (198). There is no containment technology yet nor is an economically applicable one likely. Research and development for the third generation of solar thermal high-temperature technologies has to be started and carried out with perseverance, in international cooperation. It is hoped that the International Energy Agency (IEA) can once again provide the necessary protective climate. Examples for future projects are: &amp;#x02022; {music flat sign} lightweigth membrane heliostats, troughs and dishes; &amp;#x02022; {music flat sign} industrialized solarized prime movers in the several hundred kilowatt to a few hundred megawatt range; &amp;#x02022; {music flat sign} receiver-reactors for dishes; &amp;#x02022; {music flat sign} thermal/latent heat storage for intermediate-load duty solar thermal plants; &amp;#x02022; {music flat sign} advanced air-cooled or direct particle absorption receivers; &amp;#x02022; {music flat sign} direct solar water vaporization receivers/loops.

As a result of our activities in the field of High Temperature Solar Technology at PSI we selected the decomposition process of calcite as a representative model reaction. This endothermic reaction has been selected in order to demonstrate the design and feasibility of a solar reactor. By reviewing the relevant literature we found that the rotary kiln and the fluidized bed reactor have already been investigated in detail. Furthermore, it seems that the solution of the technical problems associated with quartz windows is rather difficult. Therefore, an atmospheric open solar reactor has been suggested. This paper deals with the basic idea, the design and the required experimental setup for this new solar reactor concept. The aim of this investigation is not only to demonstrate the feasibility of the decomposition process of calcite carried out in an atmospheric open solar reactor but also a closer understanding of solar driven thermochemical processes using different sizes of solid particles. The investigation at the PSI test facility will start next year (1991). © 1991.",,"Calcite--Pyrolysis; Chemical Reactors; Kilns; Thermodynamics; Atmospheric Open Solar Reactor; High Temperature Solar Technology; Rotary Kiln Reactor; Solar Cyclone Reactor; Furnaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026414601

Subsequently, a mathematical model describing the thermal behavior of such a storage system was developed. This one-phase dynamic model solves analytically the one-dimensional linear nonhomogeneous boundary-value problem for the heat transfer between air and particles, leading to a computer code called PACKBEDA. Recently, this program has been improved and modified in order to include the temperature dependent thermophysical properties of air (density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity), as well as the heat losses through the insulated walls. Moreover, the program keeps track of the amount of pressure drop across the solid bed. To validate this model, an experimental store called ARIANE was built. Measurements of the transient behavior of the rock bed during the charging process show a fairly well stratified temperature distribution. Due to the somewhat unfavorable shape of the storage vessel with its high surface-to-volume ratio, the heat losses through the wall are considerable. These features are well reproduced by the modified computer program PACKBEDA which seems to be a reliable and useful tool for the analysis of large scale air/rock bed storage systems. © 1991.",,"Air; Energy Storage--Computer Simulation; Heat Transfer; Rock; Solar Power Plants--Energy Storage; Experimental Store ARIANE; High Temperature Rock Bed Storage; High Temperature Thermal Storage; METAROZ Solar Power Plant; Software Package PACKBEDA; Solar Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026414594

Solar and wind resources are intermittent, and the best sites are often remote from the energy end-use. Electricity is presently the dominant secondary carrier of renewable energy to end-use markets. However, electricity is relatively expensive to store in large quantities and to deliver over long distances. Hydrogen systems potentially offer storage and long-distance delivery advantages. The analysis indicated that hydrogen systems could be competitive with electricity as an energy carrier for thermal end-uses, particularly over longer distances. Development of cheaper bulk electric storage technologies, e.g. superconducting magnetic energy storage, could erode this advantage. Hydrogen energy systems do not appear to be competitive when the end-use is electric or automotive. The increased cost of the larger solar and wind capture and generation requirements, due to the overall lower efficiency of the hydrogen systems, more than offsets the energy storage and delivery savings. The economics of hydrogen as an energy carrier would significantly improve in electric end-use applications if cogeneration value were considered or if fuel cell and other efficiencies were improved beyond expected levels. The wind energy systems examined had overall lower cost than solar energy systems for hydrogen production. Further comparisons of hydrogen and electric systems would benefit from site-specific analyses. Sensitivity studies for transportation distance, electric transmission costs, capacity factor, storage time, cogeneration, time-dependent end-use value, hydrogen water requirements and costs, and aerospace applications would be valuable areas for further investigation. © 1991.",,"Automotive Fuels--Economics; Energy Storage; Hydrogen Fuels--Economics; Wind Power--Economics; Renewable Energy Sources; Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage; Solar Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026414593

Two lots of commercially pure nickel (both with chemistries corresponding to Ni-201) have been exposed to molten LiOH, its vapor, and vacuum at 775 K for periods ranging from 50 to 5000 hr, and simple mechanical property measurements (77 to 900 K tensile and 750 K creep rupture) of exposed materials have been undertaken. Comparison of the weight gain data, microstructures, and tensile and creep rupture properties indicates that little, if any, difference in behavior can be ascribed to exposure to any of the three environments.

Comparison of the shapes of the porphyrin-to-FeIII charge-transfer (c.t.) bands and the magnitudes of the MCD C terms in the near-infrared region show that the electronic spectra of low-spin iron(III) complexes of oep, and hence of protoporphyrin IX (3,7,12,17-tetramethyl-8,13-divinylporphyrin-2,18-dipropanoic acid), have only one transition, namely, a1u(π) → eg(d) whereas the spectra of complexes of tpp contain two one-electron transitions a1u, a2u(π) → eg(d). Substitution of a phenyl group for a hydrogen atom at the porphyrin methine bridge causes a large energy shift of the a2u → eg(d) transition but leaves the other one unaffected. On changing the axial ligation of [Fe(oep)]+ from bis(imidazole) to bis(tht) the energy of the a1u(π) → eg(d) c.t. band shifts from 6330 (1580) to 4700 cm-1 (2130 nm). The energy shift is twice that observed when bis(imidazole)ligation is changed to imidazole-thioether ligation showing that the shifts of the c.t. bands obey an approximate additivity rule. The EPR and MCD spectra of the complex [Fe(oep)(tht)2]+ match well the spectra of the haem group in the bacterial iron storage protein, bacterioferritin, and hence provide strong support for the assignment of bis(methionine) co-ordination of the haem in this protein, a ligation scheme not previously reported for haem in any protein.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37049081551

The former are carried out with ArF excimer laser pulses whereas the latter are performed in micron-sized areas irradiated with Ar+ laser pulses by means of a novel experimental setup. It is the first time that TRR measurements in the nanosecond regime are performed in micron-sized irradiated areas although they are very suitable to characterize processes in phase change optical storage and microelectronics applications. The energy density melting thresholds at both Ar+ and ArF laser wavelengths are determined. The reflectivity values obtained for pulse fluences just above the melting threshold show that melting proceeds inhomogeneously being the near-surface region formed by a mixture of solid and liquid phases without a well-defined interface. The comparison of the results obtained with uv and visible irradiation indicates that inhomogeneous melting is a general phenomenon which does not depend on the irradiation wavelength. It is present in the early stages of the melting process and its origin is related to the phase nucleation process itself. As the laser fluence is increased, the evolution of the melt duration exhibits a ""different"" behavior which is related to the formation of a homogeneous molten layer on top of the surface.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36449005097

Geological data on underground storage of radioactive elements indicate that this problem is solvable in principle. Therefore, development scientifically based solutions requires a whole program of research, and combining the strengths of specialists in various fields of knowledge: geologists, physicists, chemists, mathematicians, radiobiologists, etc. Developing a program of radiogeoecological research, however, depends on an overall concept of safety in working with radioactive wastes. Such a concept should consolidate legislative safety standards and incorporate regulations on the whole effort of storing radioactive wastes as a condition of safely developing nuclear energy [26]. An example is a U.S. law, adopted by Congress in 1982 [17], on policy in the field of nuclear wastes, which defines a strategy for working with wastes, and sets out responsibility, organization, and financial efforts. The absence of an analogous law in our country cannot be considered normal. In some cases it leads to ignoring hazard factors and unwarranted risks; in others to overcaution and disbelief in the validity of adopted solutions. Therefore development of a law on working with radioactive wastes and their actual storage is now one of the important problems of radiogeoecology. © 1992 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249830551

The state of the ionic subsystem can be changed persistently and reversibly by an external stimulus (current, light). The pertinent ion-controlled phenomena in the solids (solid electrolytes or mixed conductors) causes the ions to be inserted, extracted, transfered or absorbed or transforms the states of the ions by redox reactions in the bulk or on the surface of the solid or on the interface of a (laminar or planar) solid ionic heterosystem. Several functions can be accomplished: (1) the optical response function of the solid or heterosystem can be controlled (variable optics) by ionic processes (redox reactions); (2) the external stimulus (current, light) or absorbed surface molecules, atoms or ions from a gas or liquid-like environment can be detected by a corresponding optical response (physical or chemical sensing); (3) the ion insertion, extraction, transfer and storage in a solid ionic heterosystem implies energy conversion and accumulation. Redox reactions create colour centers and are related to chromogenics (chemi-, thermo-, photo-, cathodo- A nd electrochromic phenomena). Solid ionic systems are sensitive to the chemical composition of the environment. Solid ionic heterosystems (electrode-electrolyte) form a three-phase interface together with the environment.

A combination of laminar and planar heterosystems can be used for integrated optics and for special opto-electrochemical ""smart sensors"".

Modifications to a traditional RCE classifier improve average generalization from 83.2% to 90.7% with comparable computational cost. For comparison, a nearest-neighbor classifier performs at 93% and a feedforward network at 88.4% on the same data.

The composite electrode structures are bonded to opposite sides of a thin sheet of a solid proton-conducting ionomer membrane and form an integrally bonded membrane and electrode assembly (MEA).

To investigate the role of elastic energy storage when humans perform countermovements, we have used a detailed musculoskeletal model for vertical jumping to find the optimal controls for a maximum-height, countermovement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ). In the CMJ, our model and subjects began in a relaxed, standing posture, and were free to countermove to any position prior to upward propulsion. In the SJ, the initial body-segmental angles of our model and subjects were selected to be the same as those attained at the bottom-most position of the CMJ; and from this initial configuration, no further countermovement was permitted. The model reproduced the major features of an actual CMJ and SJ (i.e., body-segmental angles, ground reaction forces, muscle activation patterns, and jump height). We found that all the muscles delivered nearly the same amount of energy to the skeleton during both jumps, which explains why the difference in jump height predicted by our model is only 1 cm. The contractile elements (CE's) dominate the work done on the skeleton. These structures contribute almost 65% of the total energy, while the elastic tissues account for the remaining 35%. Only through a detailed analysis of our optimal control solutions were we able to reconcile the minor difference in jump height between the CMJ and SJ predicted by our model. The reasons are that: firstly, energy losses in the CE's during the CMJ far outweigh those which occur in the SJ; and secondly, the CE's deliver much more energy to the elastic tissues in the SJ, and this energy is then delivered to the skeleton.",,"Biological Materials - Muscle; Biological Materials - Tendons; Abstract Form Only; Elastic Strain Energy; Ground Reaction Forces; Jumping; Muscle Avtivation Patterns; Biomechanics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026403509

If the current drops abruptly to zero, the magnetic field stored inside the material decays, thereby generating an accelerating electric field. A high-current electron beam with relatively low energy propagates through a hole along the axis of a cylindrical field-storage device, sustaining an azimuthal magnetic field in the field-storage material. A theory of the magnetic field diffusion is developed in order to estimate the accelerating gradient whenever the sustaining electric current drops to zero. According to a theoretical calculation, a high-accelerating electric field occurs at the axis, which can be a substantial fraction of megavolt per centimeters for optimized values of the magnetic permeability and conductivity of the field-storage material.",,"Electric Fields; Electron Beams; Magnetic Fields; High Accelerating Gradient Accelerators; Accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026402799

This flow is frequently encountered in many practical problems of interest, such as heat rejection, energy storage and enclosure fires. However, not much work has been done on such penetrative convection problems. In the present study, an isothermal vertical plate is exposed to an extensive two-layer thermally stable environment, resulting in a natural convection flow adjacent to the surface due to the temperature differences that exist. Detailed measurements of the thermal field are carried out for several surface temperatures and the corresponding isotherms obtained to characterize the penetration of the wall flow. The surface temperature is taken as lower than the upper layer temperature in this study so that a downward natural convection flow is generated adjacent to the surface in the upper zone. If the wall temperature is equal to the lower layer temperature, it is found that the natural convective wall flow penetrates into the lower cooler region, becomes negatively buoyant and then rises toward the interface between the two layers. It again becomes negatively buoyant in the upper zone, drops down toward the interface and finally flows outward, away from the vertical surface, staying close to the interface. Velocity and temperature profiles are measured at the interface of the two-layer environment and the mass flow rate penetrating downward across the interface as well as that penetrating into the upper zone are estimated.",,"Flow of Fluids--Thermal Effects; Fluids--Thermal Properties; Heat Transfer--Testing; Surfaces--Heat Transfer; Isothermal Surfaces; Natural Convection; Penetrative Flows; Two Layer Environments; Vertical Surfaces; Heat Transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026402005

Synchrotron radiation has also been proposed as a source for microlithography and the efficient production of integrated circuits, using energies of 0.5-2.5 keV 5-20 A). This application, although not yet carried out in earnest, appeared promising enough so that a number of synchrotron sources dedicated to this purpose are now being set up worldwide. Such applications require storage rings for GeV electrons, costing 20 to 60 million each. Less expensive, lower energy linacs, affordable by individual hospitals or smaller institutions, can produce key channeling radiation suitable for microlithography and angiography. Channeling-radiation intensities, especially for x-ray energies of some tens of keV and higher will surpass synchrotron-radiation intensities. We have carried out quantitative studies confirming the above conclusions regarding the comparison of channeling radiation and synchrotron radiation. We found that < 5MeV electron linacs costing less than 1 million can generate few-keV channeling radiation intensities comparable to that of synchrotron radiation, suitable for microlithography and calcium-based angiography, as well as x-ray diffraction structure analysis and elemental analysis by x-ray fluorescence.

From the perspective of the electric utility, the power plant and distribution network are significant investments, which yield the maximum return on investment when continuously used at or near full capacity. Diverse loads such as air conditioning when treated as instantaneous loads violate sound economic practice for the utility. One way of addressing load management for the air conditioning load is through cool thermal storage. The dynamic ice harvester is one technique for producing latent storage with ice. With the dynamic ice harvester ice is built on the exterior of a heat transfer surface and periodically removed from the heat transfer surface by means of a defrost cycle.

Their performance has been very encouraging and prompted a detailed fundamental study on these cathodes here at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A brief review of our studies on these new cathode materials is presented here. The initial efforts focussed on the methods of fabrication of the electrodes and their electrochemical characterization. Subsequent studies were aimed at establishing the reaction mechanism, determining the kinetics and identifying the rate-limiting processes in the reduction of metal chloride cathodes. Nickel chloride emerged from these studies as the most promising candidate material and was taken up for further detailed study on its passivation - a rate limiting process - under different experimental conditions. Also, the feasibility of using copper chloride, which is expected to have higher energy density, has been assessed. Based on the criteria established from the voltammetric response of FeCl2, NiCl2 and CuCl2, several other transition metal chlorides were screened.

To account for this attribute, as well as for the elastic energy storage, the parenchyma is characterized by complex clastic moduli such as the Young's modulus E* = E (1 + ie), where E is the real modulus and c the tissual hysteresitivity. This modulus, for a given cyclic stress, σ(t) = Real[σoexp(iwt)] and strain ε(t) = Real[εoexp(iwt)], is defined as E* = σo/εo, where σo and εo denote the complex amplitudes and w is the frequency. A variational statement of non-linear structural mechanics is formulated for an individual lung element, in the shape of a regular dodecahedron. Tension members that lump together fibers and alveolar walls, form the dodecahedron edges; surface tension is incorporated to its pentagonal surfaces; and the transpulmonary pressure is simulated by an externally applied hydrostatic pressure. Tension T and length L are related, for each member, by the complex constitutive relation: B* = B(1 + ib) = (σT/T) approximately (σL/L), where B is the incremental stiffness and b is the member hysteresitivity, Similarly, variations of surface tension, T with total surface area of the dodecahedron, S, are given by C* = C(1 + ie) = (δΓ/Γ)/(δS/S). The results show how parenchymal mechanics (e.g., E and e) depend on the mechanical parameters of the microstructural elements (B, b, C and c) and on the inflating pressure.",,"Biological Materials - Tissue; Mathematical Models; Abstract Form Only; Dodechahedron Model; Force-Displacement Hysteresis; Parenchymal Mechanics; Transpulmonary Pressure; Biomedical Engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026391265

These had been cycled under double-time LEO conditions at 80% DOD to failure. Cell life ranged from about 1000 to 40 000 cycles. After cycling ten times to reduce possible changes due to storage, impedances were measured at five voltages corresponding to low states of charge. The results were analyzed using a standard circuit model including a Warburg impedance term. Lower kinetic resistances and Warburg slopes were found for several electrodes which had been cycled in 26% KOH even though they had been cycled for a much longer time than the others. Interpretation of the data is complicated by the fact that the cycle lives, storage times and failure mechanisms varied. Several other circuit models have also been examined, but the best correlations with life were found with parameters obtained from the simple model. © 1991.",,"Aerospace Engineering--Energy Storage; Electrodes, Electrochemical--Chemical Modification; Cycle Life; Cyclic Voltammetry; Electrolyte Concentration; Nickel Electrodes; Electric Batteries, Secondary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026390150

Whether tin- or gold-plated tape is used, the bonding process can cause damage to the underlying structure of the device which results in device failures. The use of a laser source for inner lead bonding (ILB) has the advantage of providing a very localized temperature input to the bonding site with minimal contact force. The resulting mechanical stresses on the device are consequently low and the overall temperature extreme to which the device is subjected is similarly low. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., has undertaken a program to qualify a gold/tin laser bonded ILB process as a viable manufacturing alternative to thermo-compression bonding. The initial evaluation has defined thresholds for laser input energy necessary to produce a good fillet around the TAB beam and a void-free interface. This is the first necessary step to provide the degree of gold/tin alloying necessary to prevent Kirkendall voiding during subsequent high temperature storage. Among the parameters critical to the bonding process is the wafer bump surface topography. The quality of the bonding process has been monitored using bond strength data and visual examination before and after high temperature storage and temperature cycling tests.

Every cycle of this process requires the assessment of the extent to which functional specifications have been satisfied. It is hypothesized that an automatic modeling and analysis tool which relates individual component characteristics to device behavior would aid the conceptual designer by facilitating the consideration of more varied alternatives. In this paper we discuss automated modelling in support of design including issues of modeling relevance and model simplification. We propose a framework for automatic modeling based on the modular aggregation of bond graph fragments corresponding to components and connections. Although a component based modeling paradigm is convenient for the designer, a simplistic application of this approach leads to bond graph models which are difficult to analyze and comprehend due to the presence of redundant, irrelevant and circuitous structure and due to a high degree of dependency among energy storage elements. Bond graph simplification methods have been developed that mitigate these problems. These techniques make it possible to identify and eliminate, via junction structure characteristics, assemblies which are kinematically constrained to remain motionless and to greatly reduce dependency among energy storage elements by employing Lagrangian invariance. The application of these methods makes it possible to apply standard equation formulation techniques and results in simple bond graph models which can more easily be interpreted by the designer.",,"Mathematical Models; Automated Modeling; Bond Graphs; Design Techniques; Lagrangian Invariance; Mathematical Techniques",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026387161

This capability is analogous to that of the rotating synchronous condenser and it can be used in a similar way for the dynamic compensation of power transmission systems, providing voltage support, increased transient stability, and improved damping. The dynamic behaviour of the ASVC has been studied in depth. This paper presents a simiplified mathematical model of the ASVC that has made it possible to derive the transfer functions needed for control system synthesis. The resulting control system designs are briefly outlined and further analysis is presented to show the behaviour of the ASVC when the line voltage is unbalanced or distorted.

At this time, it is important to consider the new design issues associated with utilizing such brittle superconducting materials at 77 K. On the positive side: liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling would significantly reduce the daily refrigeration energy requirements as a percent of stored energy; and the high specific heats at 77 K (compared to 4.2 K) provide more intrinsic stability against normalizing heat pulses. Negative factors are: the conductor is extremely brittle and requires special structural considerations to limit tensile stresses; the high stabilizer resistivity at 77 K (compared to 4.2 K) increases conductor heating during normalities and makes full stability an expensive cooling option; and the propagation velocity of normal zones is significantly small at 77 K.

The positive plates in the cell were analyzed in terms of chemical composition, active material utilization, charge efficiency and thickness increase. The microstructure of a cross section of the positive plate was determined by backscattered electron image analysis. The results suggest that the capacity loss in the cell is caused by low charge acceptance and low active material utilization at the positive plate. The oxidized nickel species content of the positive plate increased due to corrosion of the nickel sintered skeleton. This appears to circumvent the orderly reaction of the active material.

Energy turnover was examined through measurements of heat production rates via indirect calorimetry and heat loss rates via direct calorimetry. Heat storage rates were calculated as the difference between heat production and heat loss rates. Predicted heat storage rates were also calculated as the product of the change in core temperature and the calculated specific heat of the animal based on body composition (carcass) analysis. A minimal heat loss rate was determined for each animal representing a period of least activity. Various comparisons were made: between groups (lean/obese), temperature (30, 15? 5°C), calorimetry method (indirect/direct), period (light/dark), heat storage (experimental/predicted), and minimal heat loss. Immediately before a test, pretest weight and colonic temperature were obtained. Then, the animal was placed into the calorimeter chamber and remained there unrestrained for 24h. Normal light/dark periods were maintained. On removal from the calorimeter, core temperature and body weight measurements were again obtained. Upon completion of all tests, body composition was analyzed and surface area determined. Energy turnover, i.e. both heat production and heat loss in the lean and obese animals differed among the 30, 15 and 5°C exposures. The obese animals had relatively greater heat production rate and heat loss rate (kcal/day or kcal/kg(FFM)/day than the lean animals at 30, 15 and 5°C. But, on a relative basis, the increments in heat production in the cold environments were greater for the lean animals. Both the lean and obese animals tended to be more active during the dark period when at 30°C, but the difference was less at 15°C and even less at 5°C. Experimental heat storage rates did not differ significantly from predicted values at any of the temperatures with the possible exception of the obese animals at 5°C. It was concluded that the mature obese Zucker rats had no major discernible defect in thermoregulation as revealed by rates of heat production and loss, although three of the obese rats did elicit a drop in colonic temperature during exposure to 5°C, i.e. their excessive subcutaneous adiposity and thermal insulation did not prevent a fall in colonic temperature.

Studies on long-term survival after blood replacement with blood substitutes in conscious rats revealed that the animals showed pathobiochemical changes and died after 6-12 hours despite a high intraarterial oxygen pressure. These changes indicate a disturbance of intracellular energy generation, which is characterized by a decrease in ATP, and an increase in ADP, inorganic phosphate and lactate. Impurities in the perfluorocarbons and surfactant effects were excluded as causes of this disturbance. The authors propose the following two hypotheses: 1. storage of perfluorocarbons in mitochondrial membranes, which leads to an increased permeability of these membranes to protons, reduces the electrochemical potential necessary for synthesizing ATP by the proton-transporting ATPase; and 2. formation of free radicals by blood substitutes inhibits electron transport by cytochromes within the respiratory chain and leads to an increase in NADH and lactate despite increased oxygen concentration in the blood.",,"Biochemistry--Metabolism; Drug Products--Toxicity; Fluorohydrocarbons--Electrochemistry; Fluorohydrocarbons--Medical Applications; Electrochemical Metabolism; Fluorocarbon-Based Blood Substitutes; Free Radical Formation; Intracellular Energy Generation Inhibitors; Perfluorocarbon Emulsion Toxicity; Biomaterials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026376892

Interfacial pressure between the plate and surface is redistributed, after tenting, into a concentrated load at the 'tent pole' and a line load along the contour separating contact and noncontact.

The longest transfer line (1.5 GeV) with a length of 103 m needs 30 quadrupoles, 7 bending magnets and 34 steerer magnets. The largest beam size obtained throughout the transfer line is ±12 mm for electrons and ±17 mm for positrons. To get 95% of the particles (2 GeV-positrons) through the transfer line and considering misalignment errors, the aperture of the magnetic elements has to be ±25 mm.",,"Accelerators - Beam Injection; Accelerators, Linear; Beam Sizes; ELETTRA Linac; Lattice Functions; Storage Ring Transfer Line; Transfer Line Magnetic Structure; Accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026373889

MPTP, a lipophilic molecule, enters the brain rapidly where it is converted to the pyridinium metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), by a two-step reaction that requires the enzyme monoamine oxidase. Following this conversion, which occurs primarily in astrocytes, MPP+ is sequestered within monoaminergic neurons by the energy-requiring monoaminergic transporters. Inside the neuron, MPP+ is thought to act as a mitochondrial toxin, slowly sapping the neuron of its energy-producing potential by blocking the action of NADH dehydrogenase. Much attention has been focused on cell death after MPTP administration, but little attention has been paid to the effects of small subtoxic doses of MPTP (i.e., doses that do not produce overt neuropathologic changes), which might occur during environmental exposure to a nigrostriatal toxin. Low doses of MPTP (as little as 1/25th of a toxic dose) produce long-term (&gt; 6 weeks) but reversible changes in catecholamine metabolism. These changes are characterized by a decrease in the products of enzymatic oxidative deamination without a concomitant decrease in the amine concentrations (apparent MAO inhibition). Striatal concentrations of MPP+, which is retained in catecholaminergic terminals for similarly long periods, parallel the metabolic changes. Thus, the long-term storage of the MPTP metabolite, MPP+, correlates with altered catecholamine metabolism. The data on the effects of MPTP have been combined into a working model of how MPP+ exerts its effects following subtoxic or toxic doses. The site of this long-term neuronal storage of MPP+ after exposure to subtoxic doses of MPTP is as yet undetermined, but several studies suggest that monoaminergic vesicles may be the primary site, with mitochondria contributing some storage capacity. This vesicular site could represent a potential brain site for the accumulation of toxins during continual or repeated exposure to low levels of MPTP. Induced release from this site might accelerate the toxic interactions with cellular components such as mitochondria.","Environmental; Monoamine Oxidase; MPP+; MPTP; Parkinsonism; Vesicle","1 methyl 4 phenylpyridinium; 1,2,3,6 tetrahydro 1 methyl 4 phenylpyridine; amine oxidase (flavin containing); article; bioaccumulation; catecholamine nerve cell; chronic toxicity; corpus striatum; environmental exposure; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; parkinsonism; priority journal; 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium; Animal; Basal Ganglia Diseases; Catecholamines; Corpus Striatum; Human; Models, Neurological; MPTP Poisoning; Neurons; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026352710

At 12° C, hearts arrested and preserved with University of Wisconsin solution showed a rapid decrease in phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate. With St. Thomas' solution, phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate decreased slowly. Functional recovery was poorer with University of Wisconsin solution than with St. Thomas' solution.

Canfield, Detroit, MI 48201, United States","The 'wringing,' twisting, or rotary motion of the left ventricle during contraction has been described since early times. Nevertheless, this aspect of heart movement has, and continues to remain, largely unknown to the physician and life scientist. The extent of twisting, the regional variation in this phenomenon, and the effects on it of inotropic state, load conditions, disease state, etc., are just beginning to be understood. New noninvasive methodology, including echocardiography, MR scanning, and ballistocardiography have opened this area to study, allowing the clinical implications of altered heart torsion to be appreciated. Rotary motion of the heart appears to be a function of the opposing spirally oriented muscle layers of the ventricle. It is conjectured that twist induced by contraction of one layer may result in energy storage in another layer, which can be recovered in diastole, recoil operating as in a torsional pendulum. Whether it is a function of ventricular wall morphology, ventricular torsional deformation, or events occurring in the large arteries, rotary blood flow has recently been detected by several noninvasive methods at various sites in the ascending and descending aorta, and in the carotid arteries.

Therefore we investigated the efficacy of myocardial protection in adult rat hearts subjected to single-dose infusion (3 minutes) of nonoxygenated cardioplegic solutions (UW or St. Thomas' Hospital solution No. 2 [STH]) and stored at 4° C by immersion in the same solution or in saline solution. Isolated working-heart preparations (n = 8 per group) were used to assess the prearrest (20 minutes' normothermic perfusion) and postischemic left ventricular functions. Four groups of hearts underwent 5, 8, 10, and 20 hours of cold ischemia (4° C) in UW solution. Hearts stored for 8 to 20 hours showed no postischemic recovery of cardiac pump function (aortic flow, 0%), had decreased levels of myocardial high-energy phosphates, and were highly edematous (50% to 70% increased). After 5 hours of storage there was also poor recovery of aortic flow, coronary flow, and aortic pressure (55.0% ± 19.4%, 67.1% ± 5.1%, and 58.1% ± 11.7%, respectively) but good recovery of adenosine triphosphate, creatine phosphate, and guanosine triphosphate (18.54 ± 1.42, 29.99 ± 2.05, and 1.64 ± 0.14 μmol/gm dry weight, respectively). In contrast, hearts arrested and stored in STH solution for 5 hours rapidly established normal left ventricular functions (aortic flow, 111.5% ± 2.5%; cardiac output, 99.1% ± 1.2%; coronary flow, 85.0% ± 3.4%; heart rate, 95.8% ± 2.7%; and aortic pressure, 94.6%). A group of hearts arrested with STH solution but stored in saline solution recovered more slowly, had only partial return of function (aortic flow, 73.6% ± 14.8%; p < 0.01 vs STH/STH group), and had significantly greater tissue water content (8.020 ± 0.080 vs 6.870 ± 0.126 ml/gm dry wt; p < 0.01).

Nuclear devices, renewable and solar resources, will finally close the fossil era, but the dominant primary fossil energy in the next 100 years will be natural gas. This shift will not prevent the increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Nuclear energy is able to alleviate the problem of CO2 emissions through steam reforming of natural gas. With this chemical reaction, carried out in large chemical-nuclear power centres, all the energy of the original methane, plus about 30 per cent deriving from nuclear heat, appears in the form of hydrogen. CO2 gas, produced on an industrial scale, could be easily recovered for injection underground, instead of the usual release into the atmosphere. But nuclear energy has to solve its own problems which are the supply of fissile resources, flexibility versus power size and demand, safety, proliferation and terrorism, waste, economics and public acceptance. All these topics may find a global solution only through a deep change in the philosophical approach to nuclear fission energy.

Mid-70s saw the beginnings of the regulatory reforms that have, to this date, continued to prompt the local distribution companies, central power producers, and large industrial (and certain commercial) gas customers to participate directly in the purchase and transportation of gas rather than relying on the interstate pipelines. Unbundling of utility services and rates and pricing of energy based on its market value (rather than cost-of- service) are becoming more common. Operating procedures are being revised to improve efficiency and increase throughput. As this restructuring moves the natural gas industry towards a deregulated, competitive environment, gas storage is becoming a vital, strategic component of the energy service market in the United States (U.S.). Recent forecasts of steady growth in gas demand - and prospects for improved gas supplies - will further enhance opportunities for new storage projects in coming years. The Gas Research Institute (GRI), as a research arm of the natural gas industry, has an important role in developing technologies and techniques that increase the value of various gas storage options to its members as well as current and potential gas consumers. In the near term, GRI is focusing its R&D efforts primarily on the development of technologies that would enhance the deliverability of gas from existing underground gas storage facilities. In the long term, GRI's Gas Storage R&D Program will address expanded development of natural gas storage technology to provide new capabilities for storage near demand centers and at powerplant sites.

They have evolved to provide power with large central station plants tied to customers through complex transmission and distribution (T&D) systems. However, significant changes have taken place in the last twenty years, which well result in a much different utility structure in the future. The major changes include: an exhaustion of economies of scale of central generation, flattening of thermal efficiencies of thermal central station generating plants, an increase in T & D expenditures such that the by 1989 these expenditures equaled generation capital investments in the U.S. utility industry, and declining prices of renewable and other modular technologies. Most of these changes increase the relative advantages of modular renewable technologies, which included substantial localized benefits if placed in the distribution system very close to well-marched loads. This paper is a preliminary assessment in which case studies are evaluated, and the findings suggest that dispersed generation, storage and localized utility demand-side management programs could be a cost effective utility strategy. In a case study , for example the energy and capacity of photovoltaics (PV) were calculated to equal $ 260 per KW-year without regard site. Site-specific benefits , however, could, however increase the total benefits to $ 700 per KW-year. Site specific benefits included lower transmission line losses, kVAR support, reliability enhancements, delayed T&D expenditures , and lower emissions. Utility customers will be beneficiaries of distributed resources, if they realize improved and improved and broader utility services, and lower costs due to more efficient T&D asset utilization. The Distributed Utility has several hurdles to overcome: the technologies themselves must achieve lower costs and broader utility acceptance; the sensors and communications software and hardware must be more highly refined; utility planing models must be adapted to evaluate properly simultaneous integration of projects into the generation, transmission, and distribution system in an integrated cost of service planing method; and regulations should be adopted to provide incentives for utilities top adopt the distributed utility structure when it fits in the least-cost planning. While much quantitative and modelling research remains to be completed before a precise evaluation can be made, it is hypothesized that utilities in the future will evolve into distributed utilities.",,"Electric load management; Energy management; Energy policy; Planning; Distributed utilities; United States; Electric utilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026263562

The results indicated (i) that the in-vivo responses of the two photosystems to high-temperature pretreatments were markedly different and in some respects opposite, with photosystem (PS) II activity being inhibited (or down-regulated) and PSI function being stimulated; and (ii) that light strongly interacts with the response of the photosystems, acting as an efficient protector of the photochemical activity against its inactivation by heat. When imposed in the dark, heat provoked a drastic inhibition of photosynthetic oxygen evolution and photochemical energy storage, correlated with a marked loss of variable PSII-chlorophyll fluorescence emission. None of the above changes were observed in leaves which were illuminated during heating. This photoprotection was saturated at rather low light fluence rates (around 10 W · m-2). Heat stress in darkness appeared to increase the capacity for cyclic electron flow around PSI, as indicated by the enhanced photochemical energy storage in far-red light and the faster decay of P700+(oxidized reaction center of PSI) monitored upon sudded interruption of the far-red light. The presence of light during heat stress reduced somewhat this PSI-driven cyclic electron transport. It was also observed that heat stress in darkness resulted in the progressive closure of the PSI reaction centers in leaves under steady illumination whereas PSII traps remained largely open, possibly reflecting the adjustment of the photochemical efficiency of undamaged PSI to the reduced rate of photochemistry in PSII. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Heat stress; Leaf (light absorbance); Photoprotection; Photosystem I, II; Pisum (photosynthesis)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002018472

The Cu coverage on the Si wafers was varied from 1012 cm-2 to about half a monolayer by adding Cu to aqueous HF in the ppm range. Immediately after the HF treatment no SiO2-x component (chemical shift ≳3.4 eV) can be measured by XPS. The chemical surface composition as characterized by HREELS is practically the same as for noncontaminated HF. A short additional water rinse of 2 min changes the chemical surface state of the Si wafers significantly. For Cu coverages more than about 1% of a monolayer, a pronounced initial oxide growth was noticed already after a 2-min water rinse with the oxide thickness depending on the amount of Cu coverage present on the Si surface. The oxide growth kinetics after storage of Cu-contaminated Si surfaces in air was studied for storage times up to 1 year. With almost no change in the chemical surface state visible directly after the HF treatment, however, an enhanced roughness of the Si wafer was noticed. The copper-induced enhancement of the oxidation of the silicon surface in combination with the oxide removal of the HF leads to an etching of the Si wafer.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001622707

ES, determined with a modulated (80 Hz) monochromatic light beam in the presence of saturating intensity of background non-modulated white light, indicated the total energy stored by both photosystems (EST). Using background far-red light, ES of PS I (ESPS I) was quantified. ESPS II was derived from EST-ESPS I. EST dependence on intensity and wavelength of modulated light was studied at 470, 560, 640 and 680 nm. EST was maximum in red light and minimum in blue light. It decreased with an increase in modulated light intensity. The ratio ESPS II/ESPS I, measured at 640 nm, remained nearly constant with an increase in modulated light intensity. The relative quantum yield of EST spectrum showed two peaks around 610 and 660 nm, and declined sharply after 680 nm, revealing a clear red drop. ESPS I spectrum presented peaks around 610 and 670 nm, and a minimum between 440 and 470 nm. ESPS I was observed beyond 700 nm up to 720 nm, indicating the energy stored by cyclic electron transport.

The results on depth profiles of these traps and carriers suggested the donor character of the traps, but they hardly exhibited the Poole-Frenkel effect. From their correlations with carbon and oxygen, we propose a tentative identification that E1 and E2 traps arise from two kinds of hydrogen-oxygen-carbon complexes and the E3 trap arises from a hydrogen-carbon complex. Hydrogen is assumed to be adsorbed on the silicon surface during chemical etching and diffuse into the interior of the crystal during the subsequent evaporation and sample storage processes to be trapped at two kinds of oxygen-carbon complexes and substitutional carbon to form the traps. The annealing behavior of E2 and E3 traps in the dark were studied in detail. Their densities were increased at temperatures of 70-90 °C and subsequently were decreased at higher temperatures obeying first-order kinetics. The increase in trap densities is interpreted to be due to the further formation of the traps by capturing mobile hydrogen by oxygen-carbon complexes and substitutional carbon. This hydrogen is assumed to be released at temperatures of 70-90 °C by the dissociation of the hydrogen-phosphorus complex that was also formed by in-diffusing hydrogen during the evaporation and sample storage processes. The subsequent decrease in trap densities is attributed to the thermal dissociation of the traps at higher annealing temperatures and the subsequent loss of hydrogen at sinks. The illumination of band-gap light above 230 K annihilated the traps. The annihilation of the traps occurred only outside the depletion region of the Schottky structure. This effect is ascribed to the recombination-enhanced reaction, in which the electronic energy released by the electron-hole recombination at a trap level is converted into local vibrational energy to induce the thermal dissociation of the traps.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001304465

The numerical model combines a solution of the compressible equations of fluid dynamics with a phenomenological chemical induction model for species conversion and energy release. The purpose of the simulations is to study the mechanism of the ignition and detonation processes due to shock reflections from the wall boundaries. Nonreactive simulations show how the obstacle partially blocks the flow such that one portion of the shock front reflects off of the obstacle and another portion is transmitted. Reactive-flow simulations of stoichiometric propane-air show spontaneous ignition behind the shock reflected from the obstacle and later transition to detonation in the direction of the transmitted wave. A series of computations performed to study the effect of obstacle height show the various mechanisms responsible for the transition to detonation for the different obstacle sizes considered. Simulations in a mixture with variable stoichiometry around the obstacle, a more realistic picture of the physical scenario, show decay of the transmitted shock and then re-ignition as the shock reaches the stoichiometric region. Two separate areas of ignition eventually combine and transition to detonation. As this detonation propagates into the lean region far from the obstacle, it decays into a shock wave followed by a decaying flame front. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We then developed a simple carbohydrate monitoring tool. To validate the instrument, we compared each athlete's carbohydrate intake as estimated using the instrument with the athlete's actual carbohydrate intake from the 3-day diet records. Mean estimated percents of energy from carbohydrate using the carbohydrate monitoring tool were not significantly different from the actual mean carbohydrate intakes. Examination of individual diets showed that the estimated carbohydrate was always within 2% of the actual carbohydrate. Therefore, the instrument did a good job of estimating the percent of energy from carbohydrate in the diets of endurance runners.

Neonatal piglet hearts were arrested and stored in University of Wisconsin solution (UW) at 4 degrees C for 24 hours and reperfused on a blood-perfused, adult animal-supported isolated circuit. Results were compared with nonischemic continuously perfused control hearts (group 1, n = 5). The initial 10 minutes of reperfusion in groups 2-4 was modified by aspartate/glutamate-enriched leukocyte-depleted blood cardioplegia (group 2, n = 7), leukocyte depletion alone (group 3, n = 9), and aspartate/glutamate-enriched blood cardioplegia alone (group 4, n = 6). After 10 minutes, perfusion was continued with unmodified whole blood. In group 5 (n = 9), unmodified whole blood was used for initial reperfusion as well as subsequent perfusion. The stroke work index was determined 60 minutes after reperfusion. Biopsies for high-energy phosphates, myocardial water content, and electron microscopy were obtained after functional assessment. The stroke work index at left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 9 mm Hg did not differ between groups 1 and 2 (19.0 +/- 1.4 x 10(3) and 19.0 +/- 1.5 x 10(3) [mean +/- SEM] erg/g, respectively). These were both different from group 5 (13.3 +/- 0.8 x 10(3) erg/g, p less than 0.05).

Such capacitance can be 10 to 100 times the double-layer capacitance of the same electrode area. An essential fundamental difference from battery behavior arises because, in such systems, the chemical and associated electrode potentials are a continuous function of degree of charge, unlike the thermodynamic behavior of single-phase battery reactants.

In paired experiments the sensitivity of rat atria to high K+ exceeded that of vasa deferentia. In the rat vas deferens the releasing effect of high K+ was enhanced by drugs or procedures which induce a carrier-mediated outward transport of 3H-noradrenaline, i.e., by ouabain, by glucose deprivation and by hypoxia. - In the presence of extracellular calcium desipramine failed to affect the releasing effect of high K+ (except in the absence of glucose or during hypox1a), but in the absence of calcium desipramine reduced it. Apparently, whenever the axoplasmic levels of 3H-noradrenaline are increased, high K+ is able to induce some carrier-mediated outward transport of the 3H-amine. It is suggested that ""organ differences"" with respect to the sensitivity to high K+ may well be due to hypoxia (plus some lack of glucose) of those varicosities that had been loaded with 3H-noradrenaline.

Contact angles changed markedly within short plasma treatment times, and XPS demonstrated the incorporation of oxygen-containing chemical groups on the FEP surface. The contact angles, measured after various storage times in air to assess the long-term stability of the modified surfaces, increased markedly within a 3-week period whereas the changes in XPS were considerably less pronounced. Surface recontamination appeared unlikely on the basis of XPS analysis and the surface reversal was attributed to FEP chain dynamics, which causes rearrangement toward a lower energy surface. The surface reorientation of plasma-treated FEP samples did not proceed to completion; some of the polar groups are believed to be attached to immobile sites on the surface. The observation that the surface energy decreases while the oxygen content as measured by XPS increases on storage is proposed to be related to two factors. First, the driving force for reorientational movement of treated polymer chains in FEP acts over a depth smaller than the XPS signal depth; the mobile oxygen-containing groups thus move away from the immediate surface but stay within the XPS analysis depth. Second, oxidative reactions are believed to continue for extended periods of time following plasma treatment; these reactions, which originate from radicals, cause uptake of oxygen over entended periods of time. © Copyright 1991 American Chemical Society. © 1991, American Chemical Society.

Consumer interaction could either improve or lower this figure depending upon circumstances. 2)Symmetrical CPC reflectors always gave the best annual output performance per unit of mirror area, and allowed the lowest receiver area for situations of constant annual load. 3)Asymmetrical fixed concentrators are most cost-effective for seasonally asymmetrical load patterns. 4)Fixed parabolic systems were not competitive. 5)The concentration levels utilizable in fixed systems are much higher than previously supposed, with approximately 3.1:1 in an asymmetrical reflector being optimal for the domestic load pattern used. 6)With seasonal load matching, the storage required to achieve solar fractions above 90% appears to be approximately one day of typical load. © 1991 SPIE.

Box 660246, Dallas, TX  75266, United States","Motion of the image presented to an electro-optical imaging system blurs the incoming energy and degrades the systems ability to detect or recognize distant targets. The motion that occurs during a sensor integration period or frame generally produces the most significant effect, although, frame-to-frame motion can also be important depending on the application and the image processing involved. Thus, line-of-sight stabilization specifications that limit only the amplitude of image motion without regard for frequency may be conservative and over-constrain the design in some cases. This paper addresses the effects of image motion on the performance of electro-optical imaging systems and investigates alternate methods of specifying the allowable image motion for the stabilization system. Specifically, the effects of both the spatial and temporal frequency content of the motion spectrum on the system MTF (Modulation Transfer Function) and on the systems ability to recognize and detect distant targets are discussed. Types of image stabilization specifications considered include RMS jitter amplitude, maximum allowable motion amplitude during an integration interval, allowable MTF degradation and allowable motion versus temporal frequency. These are then compared according to (1) whether or not they can be readily measured, (2) whether they can be easily understood and converted to meaningful design parameters and (3) whether they inadvertently over-constrain or under-constrain the design. © 1991 SPIE.

These values are used in calculations to estimate the body content of radionuclides from their urinary excretion rates. Unfortunately, creatinine in urine concentrations gradually decrease with sample age due to pseudo first order hydrolysis of creatinine to give creatine in the presence of ammonia. This reaction may be arrested or reversed by mineral acid. After storage at ambient temperatures for several weeks the creatinine in urine concentration falls by around 20%, so it is good practice to analyse samples soon after provision. The activation energy for the hydrolysis of creatinine in urine is around 60 KJ/mol over the range 20–70 °C. Hence, raising the temperature by 10 °C approximately doubles the reaction rate. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Our data supported the hypothesis that phloem is unloaded without the use of metabolic energy, since several metabolic inhibitors applied to one half of a split root system reduced respiratory oxygen uptake without altering import of C-11. The hypothesis that rate of import C-11 is directly related to metabolic activity in the root was rejected, since (a) certain inhibitors reduced respiration but not import and (b) exogenous sucrose reduced import into the root half to which it was supplied. Our data were consistent with the hypothesis that import is related to the total ability (metabolism plus storage) of the sink to use sucrose. Treatments that would have led to greatly decreased use of sucrose (iodoacetate inhibition) decreased import before those which would have led to a smaller decrease in sucrose use (FCCP inhibition). These data, and the reduction in import to a root half supplied exogenously with sucrose, supported the hypothesis that the size of soluble sugar pools within the roots is, in the short-term, inversely proportional to rate of import, the soluble sugar pools thus acting as a mediator between rate of sucrose use and supply from the phloem. © 1991 Oxford University Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001139316

Particular attention has been paid to the pastry ingredient sugar, which has a greater affinity to water than starch. Sugars, in general, raise the phase transition temperature of starch gelatinization. Based on a competing effect to the available water sugar lowers the degree of starch gelatinization during baking, influencing the crumb properties. Different sugars may lead to different endothermic phase transition resulting in altered keeping behaviour of the pastry crumb. For instance, lactose leads to less energy uptake (endothermic) compared to sucrose or glucose/fructose after the same period of storage respectively. This points to retarded retrogradation with lactose whereas the rate of retrogradation (lactose: sucrose) remains almost the same at a given moment. DSC results correspond to sensoric results. The positive effects of lactose is subject to further investigations with the aim of optimizing baking techniques. © 1991.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0011735457

The assessment comprised a week-long weighed dietary survey and the measurement of a number of haematological indices that included serum ferritin concentration. Information on duration of menses was also collected and included in the assessment. Two-fifths of the subjects assessed had a serum ferritin concentration < 12 μg/l indicating iron deficiency, including one who was considered anaemic as suggested by a haemoglobin level < 12 g/dl. Duration of menses showed a negative significant correlation with serum ferritin concentration. The mean iron intake in the group was 9.5 ± 1.5 mg/day. Energy intakes were low and positively correlated with iron intake. Although serum ferritin showed no correlation with iron intake, it showed significant negative correlations with the daily and meal-time intakes of tea and a significant positive correlation with the meal-time intakes of vitamin C. The six iron-depleted subjects were assessed as a separate group (Group I) in comparison with the other nine subjects who had a serum ferritin concentration > 12 μg/l. The results of this assessment showed that, while there were no significant differences in duration of menses or the mean daily intakes of iron and energy between the two groups, Group I subjects had significantly higher daily and meal-time intakes of tea and significantly lower meal-time intakes of vitamin C compared to Group II subjects. The study provides some evidence suggestive of an association between the iron deficiency states observed and tea intake in adversely affecting iron status, particularly in the absence of adequate meal-time intakes of vitamin C. The findings from the study also suggest that long-stay mentally handicapped women of menstruating age, in addition to their handicap and dependency states which may often predispose them to a low dietary intake, are at particular risk of iron deficiency.",,"ascorbic acid; hemoglobin; iron; adult; article; chronic patient; clinical article; coffee; diagnosis; diet; dietary intake; energy; feeding behavior; female; ferritin blood level; fruit juice; hematology; human; iron absorption; iron deficiency; iron deficiency anemia; iron storage; longitudinal study; management; menstruation; mental deficiency; nutritional status; priority journal; tea; Adult; Anemia, Hypochromic; Ascorbic Acid; Coffee; Diet Surveys; Energy Metabolism; Female; Ferritin; Great Britain; Human; Longitudinal Studies; Menstruation; Mental Retardation; Nursing Homes; Nutrition Assessment; Nutritional Status; Prevalence; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025780542

By storing surplus electricity during periods of low demand, for discharge during periods of high demand, existing generation and distribution equipment can be utilized to maximum efficiency, and the need for controversial new facilities can be averted. For example, by installing battery energy storage systems at substation locations with growing demand, the cost and environmental impact of new transmission lines to carry increased capacity can be avoided, as well as the cost and impact of more generators to provide that increased capacity. At the same time, peak demand charges are saved with a BESS installation. Yet many of the BESS installations around the world are relatively isolated engineering efforts. To bring this promising technology to the forefront of consideration by electric utilities, a unified, industry-wide effort is needed among battery makers and lead producers. The International Lead Zinc Research Organization, Inc., with its network of industry contacts and established lines of cooperation, has provided the infrastructure for just such an industry-wide technology transfer effort. The window of opportunity is open now for providing proven, lead-acid battery technology as the energy solution for the 1990s and beyond.

Several modes of system operation, including seasonal and daily storages, were investigated under each condition. In almost every case studied, seasonal storage operation mode did not give positive net energy savings, because large amounts of electric energy were required for heat transfer from solar collectors to the underground (17 to 26 MJ/m2 (greenhouse floor) during July and February of the following year). On the other hand, daily storage modes always gave positive net energy savings. The solar energy storage system was most effective for middle cultivating temperature crops such as cucumber (about three times larger net energy saving than that for tomato cultivation in a daily storage mode) but was useless for high temperature cultivating crops such as paprika. When the greenhouse scale became larger, a larger portion of the required energy for greenhouse heating could be covered by the seasonal storage system but the net energy savings was still negative (about - 18 MJ/m2). In cold cites such as Niigata or Sapporo, effect of the heat storage system was negligible. The more effective insulation of the greenhouse surface by thermal screens in the cold season reduced scope for functioning of the storage system.",,"Greenhouses--Heating; Mathematical Models; Meteorology--Climatology; Soils--Heating; Storage Systems; Underground Storage; Solar Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026212906

Glucose deprivation additionally increased the efflux of deaminated 3H-metabolites, as a consequence of an increased net leakage of vesicular 3H-noradrenaline; moreover, 3H-dihydroxymandelic acid then became the predominant neuronal metabolite. The simultaneous lack of oxygen and glucose resulted in a very pronounced release of the 3H-amine. Moreover, during spontaneous efflux more outward transport of 3H-noradrenaline was observed in the absence than in the presence of extracellular calcium. In rat atria (under the same experimental conditions) the contribution by carrier-mediated outward transport to the spontaneous efflux of tritium exceeded that in vasa deferentia. Moreover, the efflux of lactate (as an index of hypoxia of the tissue) exceeded that observed in vasa deferentia, under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It is proposed that the greater contribution by outward transport of 3H-noradrenaline to spontaneous efflux in atria than in vasa deferentia does not reflect any basic difference between the varicosities in two different organs. It is likely that the less heterogeneous distribution of the 3H-amine in atria than in vasa deferentia is responsible for storage of the exogenous amine in atrial varicosities that are subject to some hypoxia, to an increased extracellular lactate level and to perhaps a minor degree of glucose deficiency; these factors may well be responsible for the difference with regard to outward transport of 3H-noradrenaline during spontaneous efflux. Thus, in addition to the heterogeneity of the distribution of 3H-noradrenaline, an additional heterogeneity with regard to the energy supply must be expected for incubated organs. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.","Energy requirements; Glucose deprivation; Hypoxia; Noradrenaline; Rat atria; Rat vas deferens","3',4' dihydroxy 2 methylpropiophenone; 3,4 dihydroxymandelic acid; 3,4 dihydroxyphenylethylene glycol; desipramine; glucose; lactic acid; noradrenalin; ouabain; pargyline; radioisotope; animal tissue; article; catecholamine metabolism; controlled study; energy metabolism; heart atrium; hypoxia; male; nonhuman; noradrenalin release; priority journal; rat; sympathetic nerve; vas deferens; Animal; Anoxia; Atrial Function; Biological Transport; Calcium; Catechol O-Methyltransferase; Desipramine; Energy Metabolism; Extracellular Space; Glucose; Heart Atrium; In Vitro; Lactates; Lactic Acid; Male; Myocardium; Norepinephrine; Ouabain; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Sympathetic Nervous System; Vas Deferens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026044536

(1986) VII Int. Congr. Photosynth. III, 169). Experiments to test that hypothesis have been done using two assay systems that provide robust indicators of a shift from localized to delocalized energy coupling. Thylakoids stored in low salt medium normally show localized coupling (lumen pH remains considerably more alkaline than the pKa of pyridine (5.44) in both assays and storage in high salt medium yields a delocalized coupling pattern (lumen pH drops to values close to the pKa of pyridine). Therefore, applying those assays to low-salt-stored thylakoids, with and without nigericin or hexylamine, provided the test for whether those compounds caused delocalization of the H+ gradient. The assays were: (A) the effect of pyridine (a membrane-permeable buffer) on the ATP formation onset lag in flashing light; (B) permeable buffer (pyridine or hydroxyethylmorpholine) effects on H+ uptake into the lumen in steady illumination under coupled compared to basal conditions. By both criteria, it was found that 1-3 nM nigericin caused much more acidification of the lumen compared to the control (absence of nigericin) in low-salt-stored thylakoids. The apparent delocalization of domain H+ gradients into the lumen occurred at nigericin concentrations noted by earlier work to cause stimulation of both electron transport and ATP formation (Giersch, G. (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 725, 309-319). In contrast, hexylamine at 50-100 μM did not cause acidification of the lumen, although it clearly had perturbing effects on the membrane domain metastable H+ pool. At hexylamine concentrations less than 100 μM there may be transfer of protonated hexylamine into the lumen, although we could not detect it. The high pKa (10.2) of hexylamine would keep the amine in the protonated form and not contribute to lumen acidification. © 1991 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

PTR monitors modulated light conversion to heat by sensing the resulting modulated infra-red radiation emitted from the leaf. It is, therefore, a complementary method to photoacoustics for estimating energy storage and its time variation, particularly under controlled leaf atmosphere. With modulated light-1 (λ&gt;690 nm) the energy storage approached zero and P700 was maximally oxidized. When background light of shorter wavelength (λ&lt;690 nm-light-2) was added, energy storage momentarily increased (a manifestation of Emerson enhancement) while P700 was reduced. The values of both parameters varied as a function of the background light intensity, keeping a mutual linear relationship. Following the initial change, there was a slow reversal transient of P700 oxidation with a parallel decrease in energy storage. Temporal correlation to P700 redox state after dark adaptation was observed also for the energy storage measured in modulated light 2 when combined with background actinic light of medium intensity (about 50 W m2). Under these circumstances P700 was almost totally oxidized initially and then gradually reduced while energy storage was initially low and then increased parallel to P700 reduction. A comparison between the maximum energy storage in modulated light 1, enhanced by background light 2, to the energy storage with short wavelength light (where light tends to be more evenly distributed) indicates a comparable contribution to energy storage from each active photosystem. The above experiments indicate that energy storage contribution from PS I is directly related to the extent of openness of its reaction-centers. While some aspects of the data call for more experimentation, these experiments already establish PTR as a valuable method to monitor photosynthetic energy storage activity in vivo, particularly when used simultaneously with other non-invasive methods. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Emerson-enhancement; infra-red; PS-I",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001822854

Whereas hypometabolism may initiate obesity in some people, once obese, individuals tend to manifest a higher resting metabolic rate because of their greater fat-free mass, exhibit an impaired thermic response to food, and expend more calories than lean individuals for equivalent amounts of activity. As a result, over a 24-h period, obese people generally expend more energy than lean people. A second determinant of obesity is related to fuel utilization and suggests that those predisposed to be obese may have an innate insulin resistance in muscle, leading to decreased uptake, oxidation, and storage of glucose in this tissue. As a result, the glucose is shunted to adipose tissue, where it is stored. With regard to treatment of obesity, emphasis on increased energy expenditure through the inclusion of reasonable amounts of activity is essential. However, this must always be combined with restraint in caloric intake.",,"glucose; caloric intake; energy metabolism; exercise; human; metabolism; obesity; review; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Glucose; Human; Obesity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026183387

Comparison of the chemical shifts of the bathorhodopsin resonances with those of an all-trans-retinal protonated Schiff base (PSB) chloride salt show the largest difference (6.2 ppm) at position 13 of the protein-bound retinal. Small differences in chemical shift between bathorhodopsin and the all-trans PSB model compound are also observed at positions 10, 11, and 12. The effects are almost equal in magnitude to those previously observed in rhodopsin and isorhodopsin. Consequently, the energy stored in the primary photoproduct bathorhodopsin does not give rise to any substantial change in the average electron density at the labeled positions. The data indicate that the electronic and structural properties of the protein environment are similar to those in rhodopsin and isorhodopsin. In particular, a previously proposed perturbation near position 13 of the retinal appears not to change its position significantly with respect to the chromophore upon isomerization. The data effectively exclude charge separation between the chromophore and a protein residue as the main mechanism for energy storage in the primary photoproduct and argue that the light energy is stored in the form of distortions of the bathorhodopsin chromophore. © 1991, American Chemical Society.

Microbes also alter the concentration and composition of chemicals in the environment, thereby creating new conditions for further biological and chemical reactions. Rates of degradation and possible indirect consequences on leaching rates in waste repositories are a function of the presence or absence of microbes and of the conditions which allow them to become catalytically active. Microbially mediated reactions are no exception to the rule that all chemical processes are basically governed by thermodynamic laws. Naturally occurring processes proceed in the direction that leads to the minimal potential energy level attained when equilibrium is reached. A continuous supply of energy to an ecosystem in the form of biochemically unstable compounds maintains non-equilibrium conditions, a prerequisite for all chemotrophic life. Energy is released as a chemical reaction progresses towards equilibrium. Microbes scavenge that portion of the free energy of reaction (ΔGr) which can be converted into biochemically usable forms during the chemical oxidation processes. As 'electrontransfer catalysts', the microorganisms mediate reactions which are thermodynamically possible thereby stimulating reaction rates. Decomposition and mineralization in systems without a continuous supply of substrates and oxidants will lead to equilibria with minimal free energy levels at which point further microbial action would cease. The differences in the free energy levels of reactions (ΔGr), represent the maximal energy which is available to microorganisms for maintenance and growth. How much of the released free energy will be conserved in energy-rich bonds, compounds (e.g. ATP), and chemical potentials (e.g. emf) useful for biosynthesis and biological work is characteristic for the microbes involved and the processes and metabolic routes employed. Materials whose elements are not present in the most oxidized form attainable in the oxic environment of our planet are potentially reactive. Microbial activities are associated only with chemical reactions whose free energy changes are exergonic. This should be kept in mind for all investigations related to the role of microbes in repositories or in the layout of proper waste storage conditions. Rigorous application of thermodynamic concepts to environmental microbiology allows one to develop models and design experiments which are often difficult to conceive of in complex natural systems from physiological information alone. Thermodynamic considerations also aid in selecting proper deposition conditions and in carrying out thoughtful experiments in areas related to microbial ecology of waste repositories. © 1991 Birkhäuser Verlag.","bitumen degradation; ecosystems; Gibbs free energy of reaction; group increment method; microbial activity; Microbial ecology; nuclear waste repositories; state parameters; thermochemical values","ecosystem; energy metabolism; microorganism; nonhuman; priority journal; review; waste",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025812675

Anorexia and food selection have been studied in experimental uremia and the findings are comparable with those observed in uraemic children. The optimal dietary protein content for growth is close to the minimal requirement for ""optimal"" growth. Protein excess leads to growth retardation and renal deterioration in uraemic rats, at least with the commonly used dry diets. The increased water requirement may be more critical for growth than the blood urea level or acidosis, although this requires further investigation. Reduction of the dietary protein by 50% and supplementation with essential amino acids (EAA) results in growth similar to that of the 100% protein diet. There is no growth improvement despite low blood urea levels, but the renal parenchymal is preserved. Supplementation with nitrogen-free analogues is more frequently associated with defective growth; the optimal mixture remains to be defined, and to date, when nutrition is identical, nitrogen-free analogues offer no benefit for renal preservation compared with EAA. Sucrose-rich diets have adverse effects on uraemia. These effects are associated with fructose intolerance and with reduced energy storage in the liver.

During feeding, the liver builds up energy stores in the form of glycogen and triglyceride, the latter being exported to adipose tissue. During fasting, it releases glucose and ketone bodies. Glucose is formed by degradation of glycogen and by gluconeogenesis from gluconeogenic amino acids provided by muscle. Ketone bodies are produced from fatty acids, released by adipose tissue, and from ketogenic amino acids. The major signals which control the transition between the fed and the fasted state are glucose, insulin and glucagon. These influence directly or indirectly the enzymes which regulate liver carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism and thereby orient metabolic fluxes towards either energy storage or substrate release. In the fed state, the liver utilizes the energy generated by glucose oxidation to synthesize triglycerides. In the fasted state it utilizes that produced by β-oxidation of fatty acids to synthesize glucose. The mechanisms whereby a number of inborn errors of glycogen metabolism, of gluconeogenesis and of ketogenesis cause hypoglycaemia are also briefly overviewed. © 1991 SSIEM and Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"glucagon; glucose; glycogen; insulin; ketone body; triacylglycerol; amino acid metabolism; carbohydrate metabolism; diet restriction; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; feeding; gluconeogenesis; glucose oxidation; glycogen metabolism; glycogen synthesis; homeostasis; hypoglycemia; inborn error of metabolism; ketogenesis; liver; liver metabolism; metabolic regulation; oxidation; regulatory mechanism; review; Animal; Homeostasis; Human; Liver; Metabolism, Inborn Errors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025768055

The circulating bunches of positrons interact with the vacuum chamber and the rf cavity, and can, under certain conditions, induce coherent synchrotron oscillations of the beam. With two bunches in the ring, the dipolar modes of oscillations are counteracted by a longitudinal feedback system, based on a method developed by Pedersen at CERN. Synchrotron oscillations (dipolar, quadrupolar and hexapolar modes) depend on the ring current, and are reproducible from one experiment to another. The threshold for the laser oscillation is strongly dependent on the coherent synchrotron oscillations. The gain reduction due to these longitudinal instabilities in the beam is analysed theoretically for the undulator and optical klystron case. For an undulator, the gain is lowered because of a modulation in the electronic density. For an optical klystron, there is an additional modification of the energy, and the gain can even become negative. Experimentally, the laser cannot start in presence of strong and stable hexapolar or quadrupolar modes of oscillations. Besides, when the FEL has started, it destroys the quadrupolar modes of oscillations. In addition, the stability and the temporal structure seem to depend strongly on the bunch oscillations. © 1991.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002196532

When the daily energy intake is consumed in a small number of large meals, there is an increased chance to become overweight, possibly by an elevated lipogenesis (fat synthesis and accumulation) or storage of energy after the meal. Thirteen subjects, two males and eleven females, were fed to energy balance in two meals per day (gorging pattern) and seven meals per day (nibbling pattern) over 2-day intervals. On the second day on each feeding regimen, the diurnal pattern of nutrient utilization was calculated from simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and urinary nitrogen excretion over 3 h intervals in a respiration chamber. A gorging pattern of energy intake resulted in a stronger diurnal periodicity of nutrient utilization, compared to a nibbling pattern. However, there were no consequences for the total 24 h energy expenditure (24 h EE) of the two feeding patterns (5.57 ± 0.16 kJ/min for the gorging pattern; 5.44 ± 0.18 kJ/ min for the nibbling pattern). Concerning the periodicity of nutrient utilization, protein oxidation during the day did not change between the two feeding patterns. In the gorging pattern, carbohydrate oxidation was significantly elevated during the interval following the first meal (ie from 1200 h to 1500 h, P < 0.01) and the second meal (ie from 1800 h to 2100 h, P < 0.05). The decreased rate of carbohydrate oxidation observed during the fasting period (from rising in the morning until the first meal at 1200 h), was compensated by an increased fat oxidation from 0900 to 1200 h to cover energy needs. In the nibbling pattern, carbohydrate and fat oxidation remained relatively constant during the active hours of the day. The increased lipogenic activity on a gorging pattern, resulting in an elevated energy expenditure during the postprandial hours, indicated a greater contribution of the diet induced thermogenesis (DIT) to 24 h EE. Because 24 h EE was not affected by the feeding frequency this might mean that the energy expenditure during the rest of the day was decreased, possibly by a decrease of the physical activity on the gorging pattern. There were no significant effects of meal frequency on either 24 h nutrient utilization or 24 h EE. A gorging pattern of energy intake resulted in a stronger diurnal periodicity of lipogenesis and lipolysis, compared to a nibbling pattern.",,"article; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; human; lipogenesis; normal human; nutrient; priority journal; Adolescent; Adult; Body Weight; Carbon Dioxide; Diet; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Energy Metabolism; Female; Human; Male; Nitrogen; Oxygen Consumption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025759327

The following results were obtained: (i) The TL B-band emitted from whole thylakoids and PS II core complex showed the same emission spectrum peaking at about 690 nm (uncorrected for wavelength dependence of the photocathode) with a broad tailing in far-red region. This spectrum agrees with the reported emission spectrum of delayed luminescence, consistent with the view that the TL B-band arises from thermally stimulated recombination of charge pairs in PS II. (ii) The emission spectrum of TL Z-band was variant, depending on the PS I/PS II ratio in the sample. This was because the Z-band consists of two spectral components emitting at about 740 nm and 690 nm (also uncorrected for the wavelength dependence of the photocathode); the former originates exclusively from PS I and the latter from PS II. (iii) Light-harvesting chlorophyll protein complexes (LHCI and LHCII) emit the respective spectral components of Z-band more strongly than do their respective core complexes, indicating that reaction center photochemistry is not involved in energy storage for the Z-band. (iv) A methanol extract of thylakoids emitted only a weak Z-band at 690 nm, but the formation of a chlorophyll aggregate markedly enhanced the Z-band intensity, concomitant with a shift in emission maximum to 740 nm.

The sensitivity of the average ring torsion angle to the effects of steric repulsion and electron delocalization is manifest in the effects of derivatization and temperature on the optical spectra of these materials. It is shown that charge is self-trapped into localized defect states in part via changes in ring angle, leading to novel ring-torsional polarons which induce only one defect level into the energy gap and possess a very large kinetic mass (50 - 500 me). Evidence for the existence of these defects in PAN and PPS is discussed. © 1991.",,"Band structure; Electric Conductivity - Mathematical Models; Polyanilines; Polyparaphenylene Sulfides; Ring Torsional Polarons; Synthetic Metals; Aromatic polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006794518

The world must have energy options for the next century that are not vulnerable to possible disruption for technical, environmental, public confidence, or other reasons. Growing concerns about the greenhouse effect and the safety of transporting oil may lead to reduced burning of coal and other fossil fuels, and the incidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, as well as nuclear waste storage problems, have eroded public acceptance of nuclear fission. Meeting future world energy needs will require improvements in energy efficiency and conservation. However, the world will soon need new central station power plants and increasing amounts of fuel for the transportation sector. The use of fossil fuels, and possibly even fission power, will very likely be restricted because of environmental, safety, and, eventually, supply considerations. Time is running out for policymakers. New energy technologies cannot be brought to the marketplace overnight. Decades are required to bring a new energy production technology from conception to full market penetration. With the added urgency to mitigate deleterious environmental effects of energy use, policymakers must act decisively now to establish and support vigorous energy technology development programs. The U.S. has invested $8 billion over the past 40 years in fusion research and development. If the U.S. fusion program proceeds according to its present strategy, an additional 40 years, and more money, will be expended before fusion will provide commercial electricity. Such an extended schedule is neither cost-effective nor technically necessary. It is time to launch a national venture to construct and operate a fusion power pilot plant. Such a plant could be operational within 15 years of a national commitment to proceed. © 1991 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","energy; Fusion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342515602

Histopathologic examination was performed on paraffin or semi-thin sections and at the ultrastructural level. Histochemical examination mainly concerned the metals, reducing groups and sulfur-containing proteins. Microanalytical study involved the use of a wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectrometry microprobe and ion microanalyzer, and the use of an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry microprobe at the ultrastructural level. Our results emphasize the role of the branchial crown for metal penetration. Its cuticle accumulates silver as a metal, in particulate form. The internal accumulation of mainly extracellular deposits concerns the basement membranes and connective tissue present in the axis of the branchial crown filaments, or surrounding the nephridial pouches and the gut sinus. The carrier role of the closed vascular system is suggested by ultrastructural observations. The silver route from transepithelial uptake to nephridial excretion involves at least two intracellular transits, plus the vascular mesothelium. Nephridia play a role in silver storage (lysosomes) and elimination (concretions). In all parts internal to the crown cuticle, silver is at least partly associated with protein SH-groups (metallothionein-like); deposits can be enriched with silver sulfide and metallic silver. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.","Metallothionein-like; Microanalysis; Nephridial lysosomes; Pomatoceros; Silver bioaccumulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344340192

This paper reports an extension of earlier work11 on gravel beds employed as the storage medium. Volumetric coefficients of heat-transfer are determined to and from air streams passing upwards through a vertical circular-section test column. The column was filled with glass balls and hollow plastic spheres containing air, water and (of particular interest here) palm oil, which were packed in such a way that normal voidage was obtained. Air was passed through the bed materials at various inlet temperatures, and the air mass velocities and bed heights were varied. The volumetric coefficients of heat-transfer are correlated in terms of dimensionless groups for both heating and cooling the beds; when the beds are cooled, the heat-transfer rates are somewhat higher. Data on the efficiency of the systems as storage devices and on pressure-drops across the beds are reported, and equations which predict outlet temperatures from the beds are offered. The use of such beds for space-heating and air-conditioning applications is considered in economic terms, where equations are developed for sizing a bed for given time-lags and attenuations of temperature amplitude. A refrigerated air system and packed beds are compared, with the conclusion that the latter offers an attractive proposition - certainly in terms of cost - and that such systems merit further exploration.",,"Flow Of Fluids - Packed Beds; Heat Exchangers; Heat Transfer - Packed Beds; Spheres; Heat Recovery; Heat Transfer Coefficient; Hot Air Systems; Time Lags; Energy Storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026175625

The motivation for this study is to supply information for the planned storage of thermal energy in unsaturated soils and for hot waste storage. Information is required on the possibility of significant drying at a hot boundary, as this would reduce the thermal conductivity of a layer adjacent to the boundary and, thus, prevent effective heat transfer to the soil. This study indicates the possibility that the considered system may be unstable, with respect to the drying conditions, with the occurrence of drying depending on the initial and the boundary conditions. An analysis performed for certain boundary conditions of heat transfer and for given soil properties, disregarding the advective flux of energy, indicated that there are initial conditions of water content for which heating will not cause significant drying. Under these conditions, fine soils may be better suited for heat transfer at the hot boundary, due to their higher field capacity, although their heat conduction coefficients at saturation are lower than those of sandy soils. At present, these conclusions are limited to the range of 50-80°C. Potential effects of solute concentration at the hot boundary are indicated. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","heat transport; Seasonal heat storage; stability; unsaturated soils","Drying--Mathematical Models; Heat Transfer--Underground; Mathematical Techniques--Boundary Value Problems; Soils--Heat Transfer; Hot Boundary Heat Transfer; Hot Boundary Mass Transfer; Seasonal Heat Storage; Thermal Energy Storage; Unsaturated Porous Media; Unsaturated Soils; Energy Storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026171161

Mature sclerotia were bounded by a compact rind and contained abundant storage reserves. Histochemistry of the larger sclerotia showed large quantities of protein stored as protein bodies in the cytoplasm, lipid present as small droplets, glycogen granules stored in the cytoplasm and polyphosphate present as small granules in the cytoplasm and in the protein bodies. Energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis confirmed the presence of phosphate in the granules and was used to map its distribution throughout the sclerotium. The smaller sclerotia induced at 8°C and below on the same medium had the same basic structure and composition, but lacked the complex phenolic cell network found in large sclerotia, and had abundant extracellular polysaccharides.

Box 120, Cleveland, 4163, Queensland, Australia","Neutral lipid and phospholipid fractions and their component lipid classes in the digestive gland, abdominal muscle, epidermis and cuticle of Penaeus esculentus Haswell were analysed and compared during the moulting cycle and during starvation. The prawns were collected from Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, by trawling during 1985-1987, and were fed on a standard, semi-purified diet. The digestive gland appears to be a major site of lipid synthesis, storage and mobilisation in preparation for moulting. Neutral lipid, 59 to 80% of which was triacylglycerol, was the larger fraction. It accumulated during early premoult, mainly due to the increase in triacylglycerol. The digestive gland contained only 18% of the total body lipid, or 8% of body lipid as triacylglycerol. Thus, the reserve lipid available for energy production is very small. Digestive gland triacylglycerol was markedly depleted after 4 d starvation and was almost completely absent after 8 d. In the other tissues, the major fraction was phospholipid, of which over 50% was phosphatidylcholine and up to 20% phoshatidylethanolamine; cholesterol was the major class in the neutral lipid fraction and appeared to be very stable. Most of this lipid was probably a component of cellular membranes. The lipid composition of muscle changed very little during the moulting cycle: total lipid levels in the epidermis were high in late premoult and early postmoult, when new cuticle is being secreted, but the proportions of the component lipids were closely similar. Cuticle lipid, together with other major components, was resorbed from the old cuticle prior to ecdysis, but the cuticle phospholipids appeared to be labile at all moult stages. The total of all lipids in fed P. esculentus was about 3.6% dry weight, of which about 70% was phospholipid. Earlier research had shown that when digestive gland lipid is exhausted after a short period of starvation, muscle is metabolised for energy. The present research showed that in the remaining muscle only about 13% of lipid was lost after 21 d starvation, mostly as phosphatidylcholine. This is in keeping with the need to maintain this tissue in a functional state. In contrast, epidermal lipid levels were markedly reduced after only 4 d starvation and the proportions of phospholipids changed significantly. This sensitivity of the cuticle lipids to starvation may be the cause of delayed moulting, which is characteristic of poor nutrition. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000524414

Chromaffin granule ghosts with a well-preserved ability to actively transport and store catecholamines, were used as a model for adrenergic synaptic vesicles due to their functional similarity. Nicardipine, verapamil, terodiline and diltiazem were found to have effects comparable to that of prenylamine (Grønberg, M., O. Terland, E.S. Husebye and T. Flatmark, 1990, Biochem. Pharmacol. 40, 351) by inhibiting the generation of a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient driven by the vesicular H+-ATPase, mainly by loose-coupling/uncoupling of this ATPase. Amlodipine inhibited the internal acidification of the vesicles in a tyramine-like manner and increased the steady-state membrane potential (positive inside) generated by the MgATP-dependent proton translocation. Nifedipine and felodipine also inhibited the efficiency of the proton pump, but their mechanisms of action require further investigation. The concentrations giving 50% inhibition of the H+-ATPase-dependent generation of a pH-gradient were found to be: 12 μM felodipine, 16 μM nicardipine, 25 μM terodiline, 50 μM nifedipine, 60 μM verapamil, 65 μM amlodipine and 150 μM diltiazem.

Several methods of three-dimensional dose computations in heterogeneous media capable of 3% accuracy are likely to be available, but significant work still remains, particularly for high energy x-rays where electron transport, and possibly pair production, need to be considered. Innovative display and planning techniques, as well as plan evaluation schemes, are emerging and show great promise for the future.

In order to minimize the electron beam orbit disortion and to obtain the best phase space distribution of the generated synchrotron radiation (a single bright spot), a superconducting dipole, producing a sharp vertical field peak (6 T, 12 cm FWHM), between two normal conducting side dipoles (0.8T), to compensate the field integral, has been manufactured. The s.c. dipole is made up of 2NbTi coils, separated by a central plate and kept together by two 356 kg total weight iron yokes. The magnet gap is 6 cm and the design current is 360A. The system is contained in a warm bore cryostat and cooled by boiling helium at 4.6K. The static cryostat helium consumption is of 41/h and, when the cryomagnet is energized, it is cooled by a 1430S Koch liquefier/refrigerator on line with it through transfer lines.

The safety function of the spent-fuel pool (SFP) and storage racks is to cool the spent-fuel assemblies and maintain them in a subcritical array during all credible storage conditions and to provide safe means of loading the assemblies into shipping casks. Generic Issue 82 (GI-82) relates to the concern that for a postulated accident sequence that results in the loss of water from a light-water reactor (LWR) spent-fuel storage pool, a Zircaloy cladding fire could occur and propagate to older stored fuel. This issue was identified during hearings concerning SFP reracking amendments in the late 1970s when licensees were starting to use high-density storage racks. High-density racks are used to accommodate the storage of spent fuel in SFPs at reactor sites until such time as the Department of Energy (DOE) repository is available and spent fuel can be removed from the reactor sites. Maintaining a low-density storage configuration for recently discharged spent fuel would reduce the Zircaloy cladding fire probability by an order of magnitude, but at a greater cost for additional onsite storage space. The accident sequences that could result in water loss from the SFP, including beyond design basis earthquakes, various types of seal failures and dropped shipping casks, and the Zircaloy cladding fire issues have been studied by the NRC staff. The results of these studies are provided in NUREG-1353, ""Regulatory Analysis for the Resolution of Generic Issue 82, Beyond Design Basis Accidents in Spent-Fuel Pools"". Although these studies conclude that most of the spent-fuel pool risk is derived from beyond design basis earthquakes, this risk is not greater than the risk from core damage accidents due to these beyond design basis earthquakes. Therefore, reducing the risk from spent-fuel pools due to events beyond the safe shutdown earthquake would still leave a comparable risk due to core damage accidents. The risk due to beyond design basis accidents in spent-fuel pools, while not negligible, is sufficiently low that the added cost involved with further risk reduction is not warranted. © 1991.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949273373

Astaxanthin is less sensitive to light than canthaxanthin. The photobleaching is strongly wavelength dependent, and the quantum yield for astaxanthin dissolved in chloroform at 22° C is 3.2×10-1 mol·Einstein-1 at 254 nm, 3.1×10-2 at 313 nm, and 1.6×10-6 at 436 nm, respectively. The quantum yields are less dependent on the nature of the solvent and show no simple correlation with oxygen solubility, i.e. for 366 nm excitation of astaxanthin the quantum yields are 6.1×10-5 mol·Einstein-1 in acetone, 1.2×10-4 in saturated vegetable oil, 1.9×10-4 in chloroform, and 3.4×10-4 solubilized in water, respectively. The photobleaching quantum yield provides an objective measure of the light sensitivity of the carotenoids in relation to the discolouration of carotenoid-pigmented salmonoids. The quantum yield was also found to be independent of the carotenoid concentration and, in a homogenous solution, of light intensities. For astaxanthin solubilized in water, the quantum yield increases for low light intensities. Excitation of astaxanthin solubilized in water using visible light shows that the photobleaching quantum yield is independent of temperature, while excitation at 313 nm shows an increase in the quantum yield with increasing temperatures, corresponding to an energy of activation of 28 kJ·mol-1. From the available photophysical data for β-carotene, an upper limit of 3×10-5 mol·Einstein-1 for photooxidation quantum yields for carotenoids is estimated for a limiting non-radical mechanism, providing an estimate of 104 for the chain length in a radical process initiated by 254 nm light. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",,"astaxanthin; canthaxanthin; carotenoid; drug derivative; animal; article; food handling; food irradiation; food preservation; light; radiation exposure; salmon; salmonid; solubility; trout; Animal; Canthaxanthin; Carotenoids; Food Handling; Food Irradiation; Food Preservation; Light; Salmon; Salmonidae; Solubility; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Trout",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026163980

In DRAMs, traps can affect refresh time by causing leakage of the cell storage charge. To characterize these traps, we developed a noise measurement technique that uses a custom designed test fixture with a matched pair of transistors. The fixture uses the device under test (DUT) as a differential amplifier and thus eliminates any possibility of noise from the system.

One of them, that of Kooijman (1986), assumes that all assimilated energy enters a storage compartment prior to use in production and metabolism, and that under starvation the stores are used to support maintenance, reproduction and somatic growth, in that order of priority. This predicts that, under starvation, reproduction and growth will continue for a time, and that after they cease death will be immediate. Another model, that of McCauley et al. (1990), assumes that assimilated energy is used directly for maintenance and production, and that stores are accumulated to support maintenance metabolism under starvation. This predicts that growth and reproduction should cease immediately upon starvation and that death will not be immediate. We have carried out laboratory experiments, manipulating starvation time, on Daphnia magna to distinguish between these two models. The results support features of both models in that reproduction, but not growth, ceases upon starvation. We therefore developed a third model in which both maintenance and growth are supported from stores under starvation, with maintenance taking priority over growth under these conditions. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.","Daphnia; Energy allocation; Modelling; Starvation","Cladocera; energetics; starvation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026046777

In order to make use of the high light intensities available, the experiment should measure the spin polarization of the total photoyield since this quantity is insensitive to space charge effects. The following examples are discussed: (1) For amorphous GdTbFe, a magneto optical storage material, it is shown that the speed of thermomagnetic writing critically depends on whether the initial temperature of the sample is above or below the compensation temperature. (2) The response of the magnetic order to pico and nanosecond heating pulses has been measured in iron and other materials. It is found that the spin polarization of the electrons emitted from Fe by 30 ps pulses does not depend on the pulse energy even if melting occurs. Accordingly, ferromagnetic relaxation in Fe takes place on a time scale which is considerably longer than 30 ps. (3) Using optical spin orientation, the dynamics of the band bending induced by high intensity laser pulses has been studied in a p GaAs/Cs Schottky barrier. The buildup time for the photovoltage created by the electron hole pairs excited in the band bending region is of the order of several hundred picoseconds. © 1991, American Institute of Physics.

The design of the pond was carried out in two steps. First, the depths of different layers of the pond were determined by considering the maximum temperature of the storage zone and the useful energy gain. For the given load and the local meteorological conditions, the optimum depths of various layers of the pond were found as follows: The minimum payback period was used as the economic figure of merit to determine the optimum area of the pond. The optimum area of the pond is 6000 m2. The payback period depends on the transparency of the pond, and for the conditions considered in the study, it varies between 3 and 4.5 years. The solar fraction varies from 65% for extinction coefficient, μ = 1.0m-1to 94% for μ =0.55 m_l. An experimental pond with an area of 14m2and a depth of 1.5 m was built and tested over a period of time under the meteorological condition of Singapore. These results are used to validate the mathematical equations used in the design of the solar pond.

These standards have become increasingly stringent in the last few years. To comply with these standards, the pace of development in radwaste management technology has accelerated significantly. An overview of the current state of the art in radwaste management technology in the United States is presented in this paper, with an attempt to analyze its future trends. The overview covers the legally defined radwaste categories, including high-level waste (HLW), spent nuclear fuel (SNF), transuranic (TRU) waste, and low-level waste (LLW). Over 95% (by volume) of the HLW in existence in the United States is the result of defense-related fuel reprocessing activities under the jurisdiction of the Department of Energy (DOE). Consequently, major efforts are being made by the DOE in developing HLW management technologies to ensure its safe, long-term disposal and isolation. emphasis for HLW solidification/immobilization is placed on the vitrification process, with the crystalline ceramic form process as an alternative. Most of the SNF is presently being accumulated in storage pools at individual commercial power reactor sites. The SNF storage space in many of the power plants, however, is becoming scarce. Several different designs of dry storage facilities are being developed by a few nuclear power plants to provide interim storage [e.g., Surry (Virginia Power), and H. B. Robinson (Carolina Power and Light)]. The ultimate long-term isolation technology of SNF will be disposal in one or more deep geologic repositories. The location of such a repository, however, has not yet been decided. Recently (November 1989), the Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) Commission appointed by the U.S. Congress recommended that a federal emergency storage (FES) facility (with a capacity of 2000 metric tons of uranium) and user-funded interim storage (UFIS) facility (with a 5000-metric ton uranium capacity) be authorized for construction to provide safe interim storage of SNF. Like HLW, the major portion of TRU wastes have been generated by defense-related activities. Because this type of waste includes TRUcontaminated bulky equipment (such as glove boxes), size reduction is one of the key steps in its processing. Liquid/sludge TRU wastes require concentration and solidification. The existing suspect TRU wastes are stored in shallow-land burial sites (prior to establishment of the 1970 policy). Since establishment of the 1970 policy, the TRU wastes have been in retrievable storage at individual DOE facilities. The current plan is for those wastes in retrievable storage and those newly-generated to be transported to and emplaced in a prototype geologic repository (waste isolation pilot plant, or WIPP) for long-term isolation, assuming that the WIPP will have successfully completed a five-year test phase. Low-level waste (LLW), which accounts for more than 80% of the total volume of radwastes generated, comes in a variety of forms and is generated by widely different sources. The processing method, therefore, varies with the type and the nature of the LLW. The common emphasis, however, is on volume reduction, including evaporation and solidification (liquid/slurry), incineration (combustibles), and compaction. The major disposal technology for solid LLW in the past has been shallowland burial. At DOE facilities, liquid LLW is normally stored in underground tanks prior to solidification. Among the key issues to be emphasized are the development of new disposal facilities nationwide and of improved burial site designs. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

However, the mechanism of action of these solutions remains poorly understood. To delineate better underlying intracellular mechanisms, we studied a modified, simple, hypothermic, intracellular (340 mOsm/kg) flush solution (PB-2). The development of PB-2 solution is based on the ability of some of its individual components to minimize ischemic adenine nucleotide (AN) catabolism and endothelial post ""reperfusion injury."" Preliminary results in 10 canine autorenal transplants show a significant (P&lt;0.02) improvement in renal recovery and viability (recipient posttransplant inulin clearance and survival) after 50 h of cold storage compared with 10 canine kidneys similarly preserved using conventional C-2 flush solution. High performance liquid chromotography (HPLC) studies show a significant (P&lt;0.01) loss of AN using C-2, while PB-2 was associated with regeneration of AN within 45 min of reperfusion. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy using phosphorus 31 (31P-MRS) showed more high energy phosphorus metabolites (phosphomonoester and nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate: P&lt;0.001) at 50 h cold storage using PB-2 compared with C-2. Electron micrographs (EM) revealed normal microcapillary morphology for the PB-2 group; however, moderate vascular red and white blood cell clumping was observed in the C-2 group. Characterization of the basic preservation mechanisms by HPLC, 31P-MRS, and EM studies indicates that PB-2 solution enhances renal preservation by diminution of both reperfusion injury and the loss of intracellular high energy metabolites that are necessary for viability. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.","Intracellular flush solutions; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS); Organ preservation; Renal transplantation","collins solution; cryoprotective agent; pb2 solution; unclassified drug; animal model; animal tissue; article; dog; kidney perfusion; kidney preservation; kidney transplantation; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; Animal; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Comparative Study; Dogs; Female; Hypertonic Solutions; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Microscopy, Electron; Organ Preservation; Reperfusion Injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025809933

On the other hand, any single or dual parameter spectra associated with selectable regions or windows of other parameters can be displayed during multiparameter acquisition. An optional multiplexer is used to divide the energy ADC into four separate parts for different detectors. The data system is based on a MicroVAX-II computer. One of the two terminals is employed for data acquisition and on-line monitoring. The other is used for off-line data processing. The sorting program can pick up 64 spectra from different scanned regions or 64 different element maps simultaneously.

Using Γ* an experimentally derived mean cluster size for molecular beams can be assigned. This allows one to clearly demonstrate the systematic variations of the measured spectra due to cluster fragmentation.

Four irrigation tests were conducted late in the growing season. Runoff from the reservoir tillage treatments was lower than from the non-reservoir tillage treatments. This was particularly evident in the high soil compaction treatments. In low compaction treatments, the difference in runoff amount between reservoir tillage and non-reservoir tillage was small. The depth of water which infiltrated exceeded 97% of the depth of water applied in low compaction plots, and varied between 50% and 90% of the depth of water applied in the high compaction plots.

The geometry of packing bricks and their composition, as well as the dimensions of the regenerators as a whole, have a decisive influence on the efficiency and the life of the regenerator.

Then the depletion of U.S. direct shipping ore gave birth to taconite and new material sources. That was followed by phosphates and met-coal. The energy crisis in the 1970s opened Western coal mines. The expansion of the 'Soo' Lock brought along the giant self-unloaders and new transshipment terminals on the Great Lakes. Iran gave rise to the second phase energy crisis and new coal export terminals. Finally the 1980s world recession forced major cutbacks and made it necessary to conserve and renovate.

The soil under the greenhouse was assumed not to be insulated. Solar energy collected by collectors from summer through winter is transferred to the soil by circulating water. A scale model experiment showed that the amount of heat recovered is approximately doubled when circulating greenhouse air as needed, compared to the case in which air is not circulated. A numerical experiment showed, however, that under the conditions tested, electric energy consumed in water and air circulations in seasonal storage [18.14 MJ/m2 (greenhouse floor)] is greater than the energy saved in greenhouse heating (6.54 MJ/m2), resulting in a negative net energy saving (-11.60 MJ/m2), while the energy saving in daily storage is positive (6.52 MJ/m2).

The linear chains can be thought of as thermoplastic polymer, while the crosslinked molecular matrix is a thermoset; therefore, this resin system can be termed a thermoplastic/thermoset epoxy. Rheological analysis has been performed on this system to determine the occurrence of the crossover of the storage and loss moduli during the reaction using three techniques: isothermal cure, interval frequency sweep, and interval stress relaxation. Determination of the activation energy of the reaction by consideration of the conventional gel-point determination prove unsatisfactory as compared to that which is determined by FTIR. An alternative technique is presented which yields a value in good agreement with that obtained by following epoxide consumption.

Previously, variability of this magnitude has been expected to occur only at larger scales, between land-use zones or as urban-rural differences. In view of these findings, it is recognized that microadvective interaction between surface types at small scales may be important and can affect the energy balance even at larger scales. The present study discusses the small-scale spatial variability of energy fluxes and shows that it varies greatly for each term in the surface energy balance. Net radiation shows a relatively conservative behaviour (via albedo-surface temperature feedback) with little spatial variability. The turbulent fluxes (measured by eddy correlation at 28 m height), on the other hand, show a link between their temporal and spatial variability as the result of a temporally shifting source area which contains varying combinations of surface cover (using the dynamical source area concept of Schmid and Oke, 1990). As a result, part of the measured temporal variation is attributable to spatial differences in surface cover. Anthropogenic heat flux and storage heat flux (both modelled using a high resolution surface data-base) exhibit temporally varying spatial distributions. Their spatial pattern, however, is governed by nested scales of urban morphology (blocks, streets, properties, etc.). These differences in the source of variability between each component flux suggest a difficulty in the interpretation of the energy balance over urban areas, unless each term is spatially-averaged over the principal morphological units occurring in the area. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"energy flux variability; land use; suburban terrain; surface energy balance; Canada, Vancouver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026056041

One lipid site in P. xiphias corresponds to the mesenteric tissue that surrounds the anterior region of the midgut. The morphology of these cells resembles that of mammalian brown adipocytes. The cytoplasm is filled with extensive smooth endoplasmic reticulum, numerous mitochondria and several deposits of intracellular lipid. The second lipid site of P. xiphias lies in the posterior region of the metasome and resembles the thin-walled lipid sac of E. marina. Both lie adjacent to, but are not contiguous with, the narrow mesenteric tissue surrounding the last region of the midgut. Both sacs contain a single, large deposit of intracellular lipid enclosed by a very thin rim of cytoplasm and resemble mammalian white adipocytes. The different habitats and reproductive processes of these two copepod species may relate to the observed variations in lipid cell morphology. The reserve lipid in E. marina plays a primary role in reproduction and is linked closely with the continuous cycle of oocytic maturation. The lipids synthesized and stored by P. xiphias, a strong vertical migrator, may be influenced by food availability, a function of their mesopelagic habitat.

The budgets were determined for three different types of day: an ""ideal"" day with no cloud and an in situ daily integrated irradiance at 3 m of 14.385 E m-2 d-1; a ""normal"" day with sporadic cloud cover and daily irradiance of 11.915 E m-2 d-1; and an ""overcast"" day with daily irradiance of 6.128 E m-2 d-1. On the ""ideal"" day, the energy fixed in photosynthesis was more than that required for respiration and growth of both zooxanthellae and animal components of the association, and there was a predicted loss of between 19.3 and 32.4% of the energy fixed. On a ""normal"" day, the total photosynthetic energy fixation was lower and the excess was between 12.1 and 27.9% of the energy fixed. On the ""overcast"" day, however, in both Pocillopora damicornis and Porites lobata energy expenditure exceeded photosynthetic energy fixation and the budget was in deficit. Estimates of rate of mucus secretion on an ""overcast"" day were derived and, when incorporated into the energy budget, it was predicted that all three species would have a deficit budget, necessitating the catabolism of lipid reserves. From published values for lipid storage in these species it was calculated that the reserves would last from 28 d in Pocillopora damicornis to 114 d in M. verrucosa. A model is suggested in which corals draw upon their extensive lipid stores on days of sub-optimal light, replenishing the reserves again when daily light levels are high, and finally excreting the excess energy fixed, as mucus-lipid when the lipid stores are replete. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001079424

The ratio between the fluorescence intensities observed at 680 nm for excitation wavelengths of 475 nm and 600 nm respectively, decreased around the 20th day, indicating a decreased energy transfer from carotenoids to chlorophylls in Photosystem II. Photoacoustically monitored photosynthetic oxygen evolution and photochemical energy storage decreased in parallel with the decrease in the fluorescence intensity ratio. In contrast, no decline was seen until the 25th day in the ratio between the intensity of fluorescence emission at 730 nm for this same excitation wavelength pair. This suggests that the energy transfer mechanism is affected first in Photosystem II and only later in Photosystem I. The decrease in the photothermal component preceded the massive destruction of photosynthetic pigments. The ratio of fluorescence emission at 685 nm to 730 nm with excitation at 450 nm increased after a massive decrease in pigment content of leaves.

The test variables included the type of fuel, equivalence rlatio, ignition pressure and ignition temperature. It was found that coal-derived fuels exhibit a longer ignition delay than light diesel fuel, primarily because of its higher aromatic content. Rich and lean mixtures produce long delay whilst the minimum delay occurred at the stoichiometric mixture. Higher ignition pressures and temperatures reduced the delay. The fuels that were considered suitable for high speed engines were singled out; also those suitable for medium and slow speed engines were put forward. A correlation was developed to predict the data which read: Arrhenius plots were made to evalaute the activation energy of each test fuel.

Electrically-propelled vehicles, however, soon proved unable to satisfy users' increasing performance demands in terms of range, acceleration, top speed and hill-climbing, together with such factors as operating life, initial purchase price, running costs and reliability. Engineers investigating electric propulsion today face precisely the same unwelcome legacy as their predecessors, despite many and varied attempts in the meantime to improve the components of the electric vehicle's drive system (energy storage device, motors, controller). Progress in battery development, particularly in the case of the NaS system, has nevertheless enabled us at least partly to overcome the previous problems associated with electric drive systems, though it cannot be claimed that all obstacles to its commercial application have been eliminated as yet.

The complexities of ecosystems require a sophisticated understanding of the interactions between the atmosphere, all nutrients, and life forms. While many experiments must be done to find the relationships between mass flows and chemical/energy transformations, it seems necessary to develop generalized models to understand the limitations of plant growth. Therefore, it is critical to have a robust modelling capability to provide insight into potential problems as well as to direct efficient experimentation. Last year we reported on a simple leaf model which focused upon the mass transfer of gases, radiation/heat balances, and the production of photosynthetically produced carbohydrate. That model indicated some of the plant processes which had to be understood in order to obtain parameters specific for each species. However, that model did not account for available carbohydrate balance between storage, growth, and export to new tissues. The objective of this paper is to develop a generalized model which includes layers of leaves interacting with each other. This model differs from general canopy models of field growth since in growth chambers these leaf layers differentially absorb radiation, from a spatial fixed light source above the canopy, and gases, arriving from below the canopy and being forced to pass through it. The overall approach to the calculations remains largely the same as the leaf model. Energy balances are first used to calculate gases exchange patterns. Carbohydrate production is then calculated from the light intensity and CO2/O2 concentrations. The productivity is then divided into respiration loss, storage for maintenance, structural growth, and export to other growing portions of the plant. © Copyright 1991 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Carbohydrates; Light sources; Mass transfer; Above grounds; Generalized models; Growth chamber; Light intensity; Modelling capabilities; Plant process; Potential problems; Radiation balance; Plants (botany)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072354100

Major advances have resulted in the fields of electrically conductive additives for monopolar batteries and high power, high capacity bipolar lead-acid batteries. The advances in conductive additives have taken the practical form of a conductive fiber additive that improves electrical conductivity and electronic network maintenance within the positive active material. The additives can be readily incorporated into the positive active material (PAM) used in monopolar lead-acid batteries to significantly improve battery performance. The conductive additive allows higher active material utilization efficiency i.e. increased battery capacity at various states of discharge, faster recharge and higher finishing currents that minimize excess gassing and grid corrosion, longer life from more efficient battery charge and discharge cycles, i.e. less positive plate shedding and softening and lower battery manufacturing costs from faster formation and lower input energy requirements. The high capacity, high power bipolar lead-acid battery represents a major technology advance. It is characterized by six important features: (1) High capacity and energy, (2) 50+% reduction in weight and volume, (3) High power, (4) Lightweight bipolar polymer composite structure and ruggedness - no heavy lead grids -no heavy intercell connects, (5) Large cross section areas and low internal resistance, and (6) Maintenance free no watering system - no high temperature thermal insulation - no hydrogen gassing. The Bipolar Energy Storage battery has excellent voltage design flexibilty for the production of from 6 to 48 volt batteries. Typically a 12 volt battery has a thickness of from 3/4 inch to a 1 1/2 inch and length/width which can vary from 3 inches to 14 inches on each side. Performance values developed to date for nonoptimized 4, 6 and 12 volt batteries (ENSCI -(EV) 1) show performance superiority of the Bipolar batteries in specific power and energy as compared to monopolar batteries.

To achieve the desired cooling of the inlet air to the turbine's compressor, it is proposed to use indirect cooling from a mechanical-vapor compression-type chiller in combination with cool storage. Two types of cool storage are examined, including chilledwater storage and ice storage. A sizing methodology for the chiller and storage capacity was formulated by PSE&G to maximize the economic attractiveness which a cooling capability can achieve under the power-pool rules. The study considered an energy/thermal assessment to predict turbine performance and electrical output with and without inlet-air cooling. Total benefits include a capacity benefit, net power-generation increase and turbine fuel-input savings less operating costs.

The experiment currently collects nearly 40 Mbytes of data from each shot of the experiment. In the past, most of this data was acquired through the MODCOMP Classic data acquisition computers and then transferred to a DEC VAX computer system for permanent archiving and storage. A much smaller amount of data was acquired from a few MicroVAX based data acquisition systems. In the last two years, MicroVAX based systems have bccome the standard means for adding new diagnostic data and account for half the total data. There are now 17 VAX systems of various types at the DIII-D facility. As more diagnostics and data are added, it takes increasing amounts of time to merge the data into the centred shot file. The system management of so many systems has become increasingly time consuming as well. To improve the efficiency of the overall data acquisition system, a mixed interconnect VAX cluster has been formed consisting of 16 VAX computers. In the cluster, the software protocol for passing data around the cluster is much more efficient than using DECnet. The cluster has also greatly simplified the procedure of backing up disks. Another big improvement is the use of a VAX console system which ties all the console ports of the computers into one central computer system which then manages the entire cluster. © 1991 IEEE.",,"Digital storage; Backing-up; Data acquisition system; Department of Energy; DIII-D tokamak; Fusion energy; Software protocols; System management; Data acquisition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067698396

These requirements have been based on tokamak experimental data and credible extrapolations of that data. Assessment of the energy confinement and MHD stability requirements led to the choice of the major plasma parameters of 22 MA for the plasma current, a toroidal field of ~ 5 T, aspect ratio of ~ 3 and an elongation of ~ 2. Among the major accomplishments of the physics group has been the development of a database and an empirical scaling for L-mode energy confinement and the facilitation of an H-mode database and scaling. The divertor heat loads have been estimated by using experimentally validated models. The thermal and mechanical loads due to off- normal events such as disruptions have been based on analysis of the data from tokamaks such as TFTR, JET, JT-60, DIII-D, and TORE-Supra. To achieve the required availability of 10%, the pulse length has been extended by the use of current drive using 75 MW 1.3 MeV neutral beam and 45 MW Lower Hybrid systems. Plasma shaping and control of the high beta, elongated plasma is provided by seven pairs of poloidal field coils located exterior to the toroidal field coils. A relatively complete set of plasma diagnostics is planned for ITER. Finally, a Physics R and D program has been developed to ensure that the international fusion program will address the issues which either introduce uncertainties into the design or lead to demanding design requirements. © 1991 IEEE.",,"Aspect ratio; Availability; Digital storage; Fusion reactions; Hybrid systems; Magnetohydrodynamics; Magnetoplasma; Plasma diagnostics; Plasma simulation; Plasma stability; Program diagnostics; Diagnostic systems; Empirical scaling; Energy confinement; Plasma currents; Plasma parameter; Poloidal Field coils; Thermal and mechanical loads; Toroidal Field coils; Tokamak devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067666715

These requirements arc twice and over four times the corresponding figures for the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR), respectively. The BPX subsystem requirements and the planned sources of power and energy are summarized in Table 1. The design of the BPX power system has evolved, along with the tokamak, over a period of several years and has included studies of several alternative approaches. The rcapplication of the existing TFTR power and energy facilities has been basic to all approaches. The dynamics of the power requirements for the BPX poloidal coil system suggest that the the TFl'R facilities would be most suitably applied to that requirement. The chief concern related to that match has been the adequacy of the 4.5 gigajoule energy rating of the TFTR flywheel units. Among the new sources of pulse power and energy that have been considered are: Direct utility grid pulsing, new flywheel units, and lead-acid storage batteries. The toroidal field power requirements arc the greatest of the BPX subsystems and, fortunately, arc sufficiently free of dynamics to allow the consideration of all approaches. Additional design challenges were presented by the multiplicity of plasma control scenarios incorporated in the BPX physics planning and the power response demanded of the plasma position control system.

In recent years, because high speed and large storage computers were available, the numerical stimulation of the Blot's coupled equation was developed. Blot's equation takes account of energy dissipation due to the relative motion between a viscous pore fluid and the porous solid matrix. But for the same size model, the numerical stimulation of Biot's equation takes much more computer storage and hours than that of elastic wave equation. The realistic oilfields are composed of non-porous rocks (elastic media) and fluid-saturated porous rocks (Blot's media). In this paper, we present a hybrid finite difference scheme to stimulate wave propagation in realistic oilfields, which describes the wave propagation in an elastic medium by elastic wave equation, and in a fluid-saturated porous medium by Blot's coupled wave equation. Numerical example is presented to demonstrate the scheme. By comparing the result with that computed by acoustic wave equation, the effects of parameters such as porosity and fluid content can be investigated. © 1991 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

The isolated working heart model was used to determine the cardiac functions and the degree of functional recovery was expressed as a percentage of the prearrest value. Groups of hearts (n=6) were rapidly freeze-clamped immediately after arrest, at end of storage, or after 30 min reperfusion for quantitation of the high energy phosphate content.Subjects - 84 Male albino Wistar rats weighing 280 to 320 g (heart weight = 1.25 g) were used.Measurements and main results - All hearts in the three different volumes of STH recovered 80% or more [mean 90 (SEM 3)%] of their prearrest aortic output after 5 h storage but after 10 h, recovery was significantly reduced [23(7)%] with no significant difference among groups. During 5 h storage the phosphocreatine content of the hearts rapidly declined from 33.2(3.1) to 5.0(0.2) μmol·g-1 dry wt in the 5 ml group but only to 16.7(1.2) μmol·g-1 dry wt in the 100 ml group. Similarly ATP preservation was improved in the latter group (81% v 63%, p&lt;0.02). Extending the storage time to 10 h resulted in a further decline in high energy phosphates (ATP + phosphocreatine) to 30% of normal values in the 100 ml group and to 9% in the 5 ml group (p&lt;0.01). While the total nucleotide pool did not decrease the major catabolite was inosine monophosphate (IMP) which comprised 46% of the nucleotide pool in all groups. The extent of cardiac function recovered was correlated inversely with tissue IMP (R = 0.859) and positively with ATP (R = 0.835) but showed no significant correlations with the postischaemic ADP, AMP, or phosphocreatine.Conclusions - Increased storage volume of oxygenated cardioplegic solution is superior in the preservation of ATP and phosophocreatine content in donor hearts with full recovery of cardiac function after the first 5 h of hypothermic (4°C) storage.","ATP; Cardioplegia; Inosine monophosphate; Lactate; Oxygen","animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cardioplegia; metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Cardioplegic Solutions; Cryopreservation; Heart; Heart Arrest, Induced; Male; Myocardium; Phosphocreatine; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Time Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047679624

Gels formed at pH 4–6 were opaque, whereas at pH values below or above this range they were transparent. The fracture properties showed large variations over the pH range studied. Gels formed at low pH were brittle with low strain and stress at fracture, as opposed to those formed at high pH, which were rubber-like with high strain and stress at fracture. Gels formed at intermediate pH (pH 4–6) had an intermediate, near-constant, strain at fracture. The fracture stress was, however, higher at pH 5.5–6.0 than at pH 4.0–5.2. The specific fracture energy resembled the stress at fracture, with a maximum of 6 J/m2 at pH 6.0. Gels formed at pH 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5 were all notch-sensitive. The opaque gels were defined as aggregate gels and the transparent gels were defined as fine-stranded gels. The fracture properties clearly showed there are differences between the fine-stranded gels formed at high pH and those formed at low pH. The fracture stress demonstrated that there are structural differences within the pH range in which the aggregate gels are formed. The non-linearity of the stress-strain curve was the same for all fine-stranded gels, which had r-shaped stress-strain curves. The stress-strain curves of the aggregate gels were almost linear. The non-linearity did not influence the fracture properties. Young's modulus showed two peaks, at pH 3.5 and 6.0, coinciding with the range where the structure changes between aggregated and fine-stranded. The stress at fracture also has a maximum at pH 6.0. The high elasticity and fracture stress may depend on strong, elastic areas in the network structure. Apart from the two peaks, Young's modulus shows the same behaviour as the storage modulus, G′, measured at small deformations, but Young's modulus is slightly larger than 3G′. © 2009, Elsevier Ltd.

The metabolism of glucose is very complex, involving transformation to many compounds having smaller numbers of carbon atoms. Owing to the multiplicity of configurations, a monosaccharide has a number of stereoisomers with similar physico-chemical properties. Oligosaccharides and polysaccharides have additional types of isomers arising from the differences in sequence and positions of attachment of monosaccharide residues. High-resolution chromatography is essential to overcome the difficulty of separating these structurally similar sets of isomers. Gas chromatography, especially in the capillary mode, gives excellent resolution, and has been used for the analysis of monosaccharides and lower oligosaccharides.

In those converters, energy storage ability of the devices can not be used effectively, especially when DC power ripple is required to be very small. To solve such a problem, this paper presents novel single-phase AC/DC conversion circuits, in which the energy storage devices are used at the AC side rather than at the DC side.

Therefore, the PWM-controlled cycloconverters can be made compact and highly reliable compared with the conventional rectifier-inverter systems. The PWM-controlled cycloconverters, however, directly connect the input terminals to the output terminals by the switching devices. Therefore, if the source voltages contain asymmetrical and/or harmonic components, the influences directly appear on the output terminals. This problem may be a major obstacle for the PWM-controlled cycloconverters to be used in place of the conventional converter-inverter systems. We have already reported a real time control method based on a coordinate transformation. The method realizes sinusoidal output voltages and sinusoidal input currents with controllable input displacement factors regardless of the load power factors. But the control functions of this control method need complex calculations to compensate the distortion of the input source voltages and are difficult to comprehend physically. In this paper, we propose a novel control method using a new control function with a clear physical meaning. By this control method, the compensation of the asymmetrical and harmonic components of the input source voltages is easily realized. Feasibility of the proposed control method is confirmed by simulations and experiments. © 1991, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

For nonnuclear power systems, the 354-hour lunar night presents a formidable challenge in energy storage. Because of their low energy densities, the energy storage systems usually are the most massive components of the nonnuclear power systems. Consequently, their applicability is limited to low power applications only. Eliminating or greatly reducing the need for energy storage in these power systems can make these systems much more competitive with the nuclear power systems. The feasibility of illuminating a photovoltaic (PV) array on the lunar surface with in-space solar reflectors during the lunar night has been examined. One option evaluated included a mirror placed at the lunar libration point LI, Preliminary optics analysis shows this option to be unfeasible due to an excessively large mirror required to achieve one sun equivalent radiation on the lunar surface. Another option considered was to have multiple orbiting satellites with reflecting mirrors around the moon. The optics analysis for this concept determined the required minor sue to be on the order of kilometers. This concept may be feasible if the cost of these satellite systems can be traded with the reduced cost of the lower energy storage system mass placed on the lunar surface. An added benefit of the satellite system may be its use in the communication network for the lunar base. © 1991 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Communication satellites; Energy storage; Interplanetary flight; Lunar surface analysis; Martian surface analysis; Mirrors; Moon; Moon bases; Nuclear fuels; Orbits; Photovoltaic cells; Reflection; Satellites; Solar power generation; Space flight; Energy storage systems; In-situ resource utilizations; Low power application; Orbiting satellites; Photovoltaic arrays; Photovoltaic power systems; Reflecting mirrors; Satellite system; Lunar missions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007071690

The 354-hour lunar night presents a formidable challenge in energy storage systems for nonnuclear power systems. The photovoltaic/regenerative fuel cell (PV/RFC) is currently being considered as an option to meet the initial low power requirements. For lunar applications, the RFC mass can be a critical driver in the overall PV/RFC system mass. For the long-duration nighttime operation missions, the hydrogen/oxygen (H2/O2) reactants and storage are the dominant components from a mass standpoint. It is important, therefore, to examine the RFC in detail in an attempt to reduce its mass and, thereby, making the overall PV/RFC system lighter. A detailed computer model has been developed to design a proton exchange membrane (PEM) RFC. Several key features of this model include capability in designing and characterizing the fuel cell (FC) and the electrolyzercell (EC) based on bus voltage and load, optimizing the FC and EC stack sizes, designing the EC pressure vessel for given operating pressures, and sizing the high-pressure storage composite tanks for given reactant pressures. In addition, the computer model accounts for the necessary heat rejection system and plumbing for the RFC. The inputs to this model include power level, operating the, and life requirements. The model uses these conditions to determine an optimized RFC design capable of meeting the specified requirements. The model generates operating conditions as well as mass of the major RFC components. The model has been used to design RFCs for applications ranging from low-power (a few kilowatts), short-duration mobile missions to high-power (10 s of kilowatts) long-duration stationary applications. The trade analysis of RFC mass performed with the help of this tool show a significant difference in energy densities of the RFCs between the short- and the long-duration missions. For the short-duration missions, the RFC mass is driven to the EC and the FC mass. The energy densities of these devices range from 100 to 200 W-hr/kg, On the other hand, for the long-duration applications, the reactants and storage are the predominant mass components of the RFC. The energy density of a long-duration RFC can be as high as 800 W-hr/kg. © 1991 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.",,"Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Lunar missions; Martian surface analysis; Moon; Regenerative fuel cells; Energy storage systems; Heat rejection systems; High-pressure storage; In-situ resource utilizations; Long duration missions; Nighttime operations; Proton-exchange membrane; Stationary applications; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007071375

Adjusted odds ratios for risk of NIDDM prevalence with increasing WHR category were estimated from a multiple logistic regression model which controlled for age and BMI. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) is 2.19 (1.14, 4.19) for risk of NIDDM prevalence for a female in the middle BFD category compared to a female in the low BFD category.

These reactions lead to the permanent accumulation of oxidized and reduced product proteins, i.e. cyt c(ox) in the inner compartment and Fd(red) in the outer compartment. The yields of such accumulation were 11%, based on the 3Chl quenched, and 1.4%, based on absorbed quanta, under the conditions used in the present study. This system mimics one of the key events in natural photosynthesis and results in an appreciable storage of electromagnetic energy in the reaction products. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

In leaves of three different cultivars of cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata), the fungal toxin fusi‐coccin (FC) induced a plasmalemma depolarization from ‐175 to ‐100mV, a value slightly below the N2‐determined diffusion potential in the dark, and to a lesser extent in the light. The depolarization was preceded by the usual initial membrane hyperpolarization (up to 18mV). The membrane depolarization was accompanied by considerable K+ efflux and extracellular alkalinization. Primary and secondary leaves as well as stem tissue of plants, grown under long‐day conditions or in the dark responded similarly. Dark O2 uptake in leaves and hypocotyls was stimulated by FC by up to 77 and 87%, respectively. In contrast, FC caused a typical Em hyperpolarization, K+ influx, extracellular acidification and smaller stimulation of respiration (50%) in leaves of other legumes such as mungbean (Vigna radiata), or soybean (Glycine max). Leaves of navy beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) revealed an intermediate response to FC. The unusual effect of FC in Vigna might be related to the production of toxic catabolites during degradation and fermentation of storage products necessary to meet the strong energy requirement of the pm‐H+ ATPase.

The model considers the approach of cationic norepinephrine (NE) to a positively charged guanidinium moiety. Ion‐pair formation is found for the whole range of dielectric constants. Even though stable states of H‐bonded partners are found for large dielectric constants, this process is ruled out to occur because it involves too high energies. It appears that the medium's polarity is determinant in lowering the energy barrier between the ion‐pair complex and the separated partners. Thus, as the medium dielectric constant increases, the equilibrium between the two states is enhanced. Copyright © 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987063282

Very high density plasmas (1010 to 1011 ions/cm3) were measured with fast injection Langmuir probes. Electron temperature, plasma potential, and plasma density were found to be similar to high density plasmas reported from Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) and other types of reactors.1 The high density plasmas can also be confirmed by the high etch rates observed throughout this study. Ion energy perpendicular to the wafer surface can be controlled from a separate bottompowered electrode. A mixture of Cl2 and BCI3 was used for the study. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to understand the trends of the aluminum etch performance versus process parameters. Experimental matrices were designed and run to understand etch results such as aluminum etch rate, feature profile, and residue removal as functions of independent variables such as sourcecoil power, bias power, and gas flow ratio. Aluminum etch rates of one micron per minute can be achieved at 5 to 10 mTorr pressure regions.

The motivating application is the design and analysis of computer experiments, where t determines the input to a computer model of a physical or behavioral system, and y(t) is a response that is part of the output or is calculated from it. Following a Bayesian formulation, prior uncertainty about the function y is expressed by means of a random function Y, which is taken here to be a Gaussian stochastic process. The mean of the posterior process can be used as the prediction function ŷ(t), and the variance can be used as a measure of uncertainty. This kind of approach has been used previously in Bayesian interpolation and is strongly related to the kriging methods used in geostatistics. Here emphasis is placed on product linear and product cubic correlation functions, which yield prediction functions that are, respectively, linear or cubic splines in every dimension. A posterior entropy criterion is adopted for design; this minimizes the expected uncertainty about the posterior process, as measured by the entropy. A computational algorithm for finding entropy-optimal designs on multidimensional grids is described. Several examples are presented, including a two-dimensional experiment on a computer model of a thermal energy storage device and a six-dimensional experiment on an integrated circuit simulator. Predictions are made using several different families of correlation functions, with parameters chosen to maximize the likelihood. For comparison, predictions are also made via least squares fitting of various polynomial and spline models. The Bayesian design/prediction methods, which do not require any modeling of y, produce comparatively good predictions. For some correlation functions, however, the 95% posterior probability intervals do not give adequate coverage of the true values of y at selected test sites. These methods are fairly simple and offer considerable potential for virtually automatic implementation, although further development is needed before they can be applied routinely in practice. © 1991 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Computer models; Correlation function; Cross-validation; Entropy; Experimental design; Interpolation; Kriging; Optimal design; Spline fitting; Stochastic processes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950437532

It is clear that LNG has a higher market price than natural gas. What has not been included in this price differential is the ultimate cost of reducing the total global supplies because of the lower energy efficiency in the use of LNG. The laws of thermodynamics also show there is a limit to the increased efficiency gained by technological improvements in the liquefaction process. Sharp increases in the price of imported LNG and a glut of domestic natural gas lead to a sharp reduction in the imports of LNG. Opposition to at least one import terminal because of concern with the possible danger in the shipping and storage of LNG contributed to its shut-down. The early consideration of the hidden costs of LNG might have saved this nation billions of dollars invested in import terminals now standing largely unused.

Experimental parameters included the diameter of inlet tube, the diameter of baffle plate, the position of baffle plate, the hot-cold water temperature difference, the flow rate, and the water level. From the experimental results and theoretical considerations, dimensionless semi-empirical equations suitable for predicting the amount of cold water mixed into the hot water region and the thermal storage efficiency of the cylindrical water tank were deduced as a function of the Archimedes number based on inflow conditions, the Peclet number, and three dimensionless geometric parameters. The general conclusion reached was that, for relatively low Archimedes numbers, the installation of a baffle plate improved the thermal storage efficiency appreciably due to the prevention of mixing of hot and cold water. © 1991, The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.

At this low frequency, the difference between the intensity of spectra in the presence and in the absence of a non-modulated background light indicated the relative magnitude of the photochemical energy storage, which is generally measured at high frequencies. The amount of energy stored per unit absorbed light energy is low in blue, intermediate in green and high in red regions of the spectrum, indicating the excitation energy transfer efficiency of photosynthetic pigments. Similarly, the relative quantum yield of energy storage was low in blue and high in red regions showing the red-drop phenomenon.

In order to respond to President Bush’s mandate, it is expected that the peculiar demands of the lunar base and Mars missions will require 1he use of nuclear energy. For example, the demands of permanent human presence on the Moon with its 354 hour night puts extreme demands for energy storage on solar based power systems. Because energy storage is bulky and massive, it is likely that a practical cost effective upper limit on the amount of solar based power will be reached before the demands of permanent human habitation will have been satisfied. To put this into perspective, the cost of transporting both 100 kWe solar and nuclear power systems to the Moon and Mars will be presented. Various technological options will be presented for each of the scenarios. These results demonstrate a clear advantage for nuclear power systems on the Moon and a lesser advantage on Mars. © 1991 by American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Cost effectiveness; Energy storage; Lunar landing; Lunar missions; Martian surface analysis; Moon; Moon bases; Nuclear energy; Seebeck effect; Space stations; Cost effective; Human exploration; Human habitation; Human landing; Mars missions; Permanent settlements; Space nuclear power; Upper limits; Nuclear fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911678823

The aim of the present work was to examine, with the help of the photoacoustic technique, whether this high-light treatment deteriorated the in vivo PS I function too. High-frequency photoacoustic measurements indicated that photochemical conversion of far-red light energy in PS I was preserved (and even transiently stimulated) whereas photochemical energy storage monitored in light exciting both PS I and PS II was markedly diminished. Low-frequency photoacoustic measurements of the Emerson enhancement showed a spectacular change in the PS II/PS I activity balance in favor of PS I. It was also observed that the linear portion of the saturation curve of the far-red light effect in the Emerson enhancement was not changed by the light treatment. Those results lead to the conclusion that, in contrast to PS II, the in vivo PS I photofunctioning was resistant to strong light stress, thus confirming previous suggestions derived from in vitro studies. Estimation of the redox state of the PS I reaction center by leaf absorbance measurements at ca. 820 nm suggested that, under steady illumination, a considerably larger fraction of PS I centers were in the closed state in high-light pretreated leaves as compared to control leaves, presumably allowing passive adjustment of the macroscopic quantum yield of PS I photochemistry to the strongly reduced photochemical efficiency of photoinhibited PS II. © 1991, Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung.

Losses caused by bean hardening during storage in Chile were determined from a survey and a model of the post-production trade system. The survey involved nine farmers and four wholesalers in the bean growing area. After one year of storage, losses due to hardening were significant at both ends of the commercialization chain. The model used dynamic simulation of the post-harvest trade chain of beans in Chile to predict the losses. The overall economical loss due to this defect in tortola beans only, was estimated at almost US$4 million per annum. Of this loss, 34% was attributable to physical losses, 41% to nutritional losses and 24% to extra energy required to cook beans.

The cyclone experienced three development stages: energy storage stage, explosive development stage and continuous development stage. The explosive in tensification of the cyclone is caused mainly by the heat transport from the Kuroshio in to the cyclone, baroclinicity of the SST frontal zone and cumulus convection in the warm sector of the cyclone. The continuous explosive development is caused by a change in the atmospheric dynamic condition resulting from the development in the earlier stages and the release of baroclinic energy from the oceanic and atmospheric frontal zones. © 1991, Elsevier B.V.

This chapter describes the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols, digestion, absorption, and transport of lipids, control of triacylglycerol synthesis, metabolism of triacylglycerols when the action of insulin is high, and metabolism of triacylglycerols when the action of insulin is high. Most of the triacylglycerols in animals are stored in adipose tissue. However, triacylglycerols can be deposited in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle under several conditions of metabolic stress when the supply of fatty acids from adipose tissue exceeds the need or capacity of the cells to oxidize them. Although, the increased use of tissue- and cell-culture techniques means that the specific effects of hormones and metabolites on triacylglycerol metabolism can be investigated, one of the biggest problems in lipid metabolism is to isolate, characterize, purify, and raise antibodies against the enzymes, which are often tightly associated with membranes. The regulation of triacylglycerol metabolism is an important part of intermediary metabolism. A greater appreciation of this regulation would help to alleviate or prevent several clinical conditions, including fatty liver, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemias, and atherosclerosis. © 1991, Elsevier B.V.

The design parameters of the system components are evaluated at rated conditions using the steady state model. Test simulation of the dynamic model is carried out with the cooling load corresponding to a typical cold storage house on a hot summer day. It is found that the refrigerant stored during excess generation hours may not be sufficient to meet the cooling load during off-generation hours, and hence, provision to evaluate the auxiliary refrigerant mass required and the fraction of the load met by solar energy is included in the simulation model.

A simple mechanical example illustrates the geometric-differential formulation of its dynamics and the question of its order with respect to reduction procedures. For bond graphs containing dependent energy-storage fields, the multiple causality assignments are interpreted in differential-geometric terms as a set of coordinate charts of the constrained state-space.

These nearly one hundred satellites have a limited lifetime and are expected to be replaced in due time by unmanned platforms of increasing size. Maintenance, repair and removal of these platforms by unmanned and manned space vehicles is one of the options discussed with increasing frequency. Another space system envisioned for the geostationary orbit are space solar power plants (SSPS). They have been investigated during the last two decades to find out whether there are any technical or financial problems which have to be overcome before a SSPS can materialize sometime in the next century. So far, none have been discovered, but proof is lacking that a SSPS is technically feasible and competitive if compared with other options to solve the energy problem on this planet in the next century. A partial problem for the acquisition and operation of a system of space power satellites is their assembly, maintenance and repair. Most of it must be done automatically but a sizable crew would probably have to be in GEO for quick action. Such a crew requires not only habitats, storages and a local energy supply, but also a regional space transportation system to transport spares, tools and people between the individual power plants and the other elements of the geostationary infrastructure. Such a regional transportation system for local transportation in the geostationary orbit (GRET) was recently studied at the Aerospace Institute of the Technical University of Berlin. It envisions a fleet of small space vehicles for interorbital transfer requiring modest velocity changes and flight times. The fleet comprises taxis for passenger transport, tugs for cargo transport and several unmanned and manned services vehicles of different sizes. These vehicles are housed in a special GEO space facility connected directly to the GEO spaceport. A SSPS driven market model assumes the initial operational capability for the year 2004. The GEO crew might have two hundred people by 2010 and several thousand tons of construction materials and spares would have to be transported by that time. The regional transportation system including GEO facilities and space vehicles will require approximately 1000 tons within the first decade of operation, not counting the propellants. The results of a preliminary cost model indicate acquisition cost in the order of 28 × 109 dollars. If the acquisition and operating costs of a commercial entity of this kind are to be covered by the services rendered to the company operating the SSPS, then transportation prices of 15,000 $/trip and 50,000 $/metric ton moved between the GEO facilities would have to be charged. This system model might not be the best way for solving the local transportation problem in GEO, but this kind of overhead cost must be included in any future system analysis of the SSPS. © 1991.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949284897

The numerical calculations are made for Indian market conditions and Delhi (India) climate for open loop water heating systems and closed loop water heating systems, with a heat exchanger in the collector loop. The basic problem which deserves to be considered for all types of solar water heating systems is the optimization of the collector with respect to the cost of useful delivered energy for various storage capacities. It was observed from computation that the cost of solar energy comes out to be more than for electrical energy which has been highly subsidized in the alternative systems. The cost of useful delivered energy comes out around the cost of electrical energy without a subsidy and 10% less with a subsidy. The optimized collector area for 70°C desired temperature for 200 l. of daily hot water demand comes out to be 2.5 m2 for 801. of tank capacity and 2 m2 with a heat exchanger in the collector loop. The cost of the useful delivered energy will be more if an auxiliary heating system is provided inside the storage tank instead of at load. For a forced flow system, the cost of the delivered useful energy comes out 15% higher. © 1991.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949281982

This range embraced the insulating powders, high density polyethylene (HDPE) and phenol formaldehyde (resistivity &gt; 1013 Ωm); the moderately conducting products, starch and sugar (resistivity 109 Ωm); and relatively conductive wheat (resistivity 107 Ωm). Pneumatic transport tests were conducted and triboelectric charging was monitored. The incendivity of electrostatic discharges in the receiving silo was assessed by using an earthed probe shrouded in a propaneair environment. Numerous non-incendive discharges were promoted by the probe. By increasing the product charge levels artificially by using a charge-injection device to simulate the levels of triboelectric charging that might arise in some industrial circumstances, it was possible to promote two propaneair ignitions at the probe, one from bulk HDPE and one from the starch dust cloud. It was concluded that the risk of discharges from bulked powder igniting the dust cloud depends on product resistivity. For relatively conducting products of resistivity &lt; 109 Ωm no ignition risk was identified. For more insulating products when resistivity &gt; 109 Ωm no risk was identified if minimum ignition energy &gt; 10 mJ. For discharges from the product dust cloud there is no evidence from the silo project to contradict the guidance in BS 5958. © 1991.","electrostatc; hazard; powders",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949279452

Examples of success and nonsuccess were examined using the critical incident technique to compare the teacher's directions and comments with FD or Fl students’ performances. Results suggested that Fl children experienced success 76.6% of the time, while FD children were successful 46.6%. Teachers permitted Fl children to respond to questions and take part in demonstrations more frequently that FD children. FD Children's behavioral responses to complex problem solving situations are discussed. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749057584

The interpretive study was conducted with field-dependent (FD) 7-year-old children within an analytical movement education curriculum taught by a field-independent (Fl) teacher. Research questions examined (a) the extent to which the strategies increased the learning behaviors of FD children and (b) the perceptions of the FD children when learning using the strategies. Children were tested using the Children’s Embedded Figures Test to determine their cognitive styles. Observations and interviews were collected over a four-month period. Emergent themes were analyzed using constant comparison. Results indicated that the Explicit Organization strategy facilitated the memory organization and storage of FD children. The Variable Format and the Student Pairing strategies appeared to contribute to active learning by enhancing the interest and motivation of FD children. FD children were more involved in the tasks increasing their ability to focus mental energy necessary for system flexibility. Discussion centered on the FD children’s modification of the Student Pairing strategy to decrease demands on memory storage capacity and preclude the development of memory access strategies. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Five soils differing in texture and with different C-content: sandy 1.1%, loamy 1.4%, forest mineral layers 5.1%, peaty 11.9% and forest organic layers 34.1% were stored moist at 4, -18 or -140°C or air-dry at 21°C. Indicators for microbiul activity included, ATP, heat output and fluorescein diacctate hydrolysis (FDA), showed different effects. The ATP-content in most cases decreased markedly, except in peaty soil and in forest organic layers stored for 20 months at -18, -140 or 21°C. The heat output was enhanced extremely in peaty soil (except at 4°C) and slightly in forest organic layers stored at 21 or -140°C for 20 months. In the other soils storage caused a marked reduction of heat output. FDA-hydrolysis did not change during 2 months in most cases, except in peaty soil, forest mineral layers (-140 and 21°C) and forest organic layers (21°C) where it increased significantly during storage. In most cases, air drying caused a significant decrease in the quantity of these indicators of microbial activity. The ditferences between the effects on samples stored at 4, -18 or -140°C were slight and in most cases insignificant. The adenylate energy charge (AEC) measured after 20 months of storage was markedly lower in samples of sandy soil and soils derived from forest stored air-dry, while in loamy soil and in peaty soil the results were less clear. The highest AEC values were obtained in loamy soil and forest organic layers stored at -18°C. The signature indicators muramie acid, glucosamine and crgosterol increased after 20 months storage except for crgosterol in sandy soil, loamy soil, forest mineral layers and forest organic layers (21°C), where it decreased rapidly. © 1991.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31144458096

Free energy data from the literature predict that the region of the Te-Ge-Sn phase diagram between Ge, Sn, and the TeGe-TeSn pseudobinary consists of one two-phase field [a-Ge and Te50 (GexSni x)50] and one three-phase field (a-Ge, /?-Sn, and TeSn). Electron diffraction from five different Te-Ge-Sn films annealed at 623 K experimentally confirms this prediction. One composition from the two-phase field is deposited as a tri-layer film with the structure 150 nm Si02/75 nm Te363Ge47.4Sn16.3/150 nm Si02 on a grooved disk substrate, and the microstructure resulting from low-power (12 mW) CW and higher-power (—50 mW) pulsed laser exposure is studied by transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. Of particular significance is that laser-induced crystallization produces a single-phase structure consisting of the Te-Ge-Sn compound phase which is supersaturated with respect to the excess Ge. This supersaturation leads to a disordering of the equilibrium NaCl-type structure of this phase. Crystallization of a micron-sized amorphous spot on a ~200 ns time scale occurs by a diffusionless process. The fast erase times required by a phase-change optical recording application can thus be achieved in off-stoichiometric compound compositions by way of a nonequilibrium crystallization process. © 1991, Materials Research Society.

Absorption spectra measured in situ showed that while peak energy of the interband transition increased in the order PPY < PMPY < POCPY, the absorption edge of PPY was located at almost equal energy as that of PMPY and POCPY. Stability, indicated by decrease in the ratio of conductivities after storage to the initial conductivity, was primarily dependent on the length of alkyl chains, secondly on dopants and associated with spectral deterioration. While the initial conductivity was strongly dependent on temperature and current density during electrochemical polymerization, the stability was virtually independent of these conditions.

The method involves the simultaneous double-labeling of cells with [35S]methionine and [32P]orthophosphate. Proteins that incorporate one or both isotopes are then identified within the same gel on the basis of the different energies of the respective isotope emissions. Detection is achieved using a storage phosphor screen that is exposed to the dried 2DE gel with or without (+/-) the insertion of a copper filter between the gel and the storage phosphor screen. Each of these two accumulated potential images is digitized on a Phosphorimager. Because both +/- copper-filtered images are derived from the same gel, it is possible to precisely overlay the two images. Measuring the efficiency of transfer of radiation across the copper for each spot allows accurate determination of whether there is a double or single label in each protein. The dynamic range of the method allows quantitation over five orders of magnitude for a single isotope and over four orders of magnitude for 32P and 35S isotope mixtures in the 2DE gel. The sensitivity is more than 10-fold greater than that of autoradiography and requires exposures of 2-48 h instead of several weeks. We describe the application of this method to the identification of protein phosphorylation events in a rodent cell line (PC12 cells) after exposure to nerve growth factor. This method should have wide applicability in identifying post-translational modifications of proteins involved in many biological processes. © 1991 Academic Press, Inc.

Transverse fluted waves on vortex sections propagate at the phase velocity vs= u, which neither depends on the density of the fluid nor on the radial velocity profile u(r). They can appear as a fast mode where vs is in the direction of the local swirl velocity u(r) = r • Ω(r), or as a slow mode, vs= —u, where the wave appears to stand still in the laboratory frame. Both may combine into standing waves of frequency fm= mΩ/lπ which are fixed in the frame of the rotating vortex. The fundamental mode of standing waves may be excited in resonance by a sound wave field of frequency f1= Ω Ω/2π During the subsequent decay of the excitation a vibration of 2 f1 and the higher harmonics (m &gt; 1) may be produced. The wavefront trajectories of transverse fluted waves are stable where ∂u/∂r = const.

The possibility of such a heat pump was investigated by equilibrium and kinetic evaluations. The equilibrium evaluation showed the possibility of raising low-level thermal energy above 313K and of raising the temperature more than 40K. The coefficients of performance of the heat pump were calculated from the equilibrium compositions. The activity coefficients of the equilibrium compositions were calculated by the UNIFAC method. The effectiveness of the UNIFAC method was confirmed in practice by the estimation of the solubility of isobutene in tert-butanol solution. The exothermic reaction of isobutene hydration was chosen for kinetic evaluation. The reaction rates were measured and the reaction rate equation was derived from the measured rates. The output capacity was calculated from the exothermic reaction rate and the equilibrium concentration.

The effects of self-irradiation due to alpha decay were monitored at room temperature for times as long as 1198 days and doses as high as 1.6 × 1026 α/m3, using differential thermal analysis. As storage time increased, the temperature of recovery from the damaged to the crystalline state increased and the recovery step became more abrupt. Stored energy reached a maximum of 100 J/g at 2.1 × 1025 α/m3 and then decreased to half this value with further damage. Results for synthetic samples were compared with those for naturally-occurring zirconolites that had attained a damage dose of ≈ 4.8 × 1026 α/m3 as a result of their high Th and U contents. At high alpha decay doses the synthetic and natural materials behaved similarly, indicating the absence of major damage recovery or alteration effects for the natural mineral at ambient temperature.

To achieve the desired cooling of the inlet air to the turbine's compressor, it is proposed to use indirect cooling from a mechanical-vapor compression-type chiller in combination with cool storage. Two types of cool storage are examined, including chilled-water storage and ice storage. A sizing methodology for the chiller and storage capacity was formulated by PSE&G to maximize the economic attractiveness which a cooling capability can achieve under the power-pool rules. The study considered an energy/thermal assessment to predict turbine performance and electrical output with and without inlet-air cooling. Total benefits include a capacity benefit, net power-generation increase and turbine fuel-input savings less operating costs.

The short-channel effect is well suppressd for gate length down to 0.5 µm by a rather dense p layer buried under the channel. Its acceptor ion dose is as high as 2 × 1012 cm−2, which corresponds to a partially depleted condition. Furthermore, for 1-µm gates, the Vth standard deviation (σVth) of as low as 9 mV in 3 mm × 3 mm is attained in 60-µm-pitch microscopic measurement. High gm (600 mS/mm) and K value (490 mS/V · mm) are also obtained for 0.5-µm gates. Dose for the p layer is more effective than implantation energy in suppressing the short-channel effect and reducing the Vth scattering. This indicates that the acceptor ion concentration of the p layer near the channel side is more important than its thickness. As for applications for SRAM'S we can successfully attain fully functional 7-ns 4-kb SRAM'S that are operative at 75°C by using the FET with 1-µm gate.

During the day the thermostat must control the warm‐up in such a way that the stored energy is released when it brings maximum benefit. This strategy exploits the heat capacity of the building itself; it can be implemented at low cost and without sacrifice of comfort. To evaluate the strategy for a given building and to control the thermostat, one needs to know the thermal behaviour of the building. Building temperature, internal load and solar data are used to determine a small number of thermal parameters which characterize the building. Several thermostat control strategies, distinguished by their knowledge of the building dynamics, are described and simulated, with a data‐based dynamic model. Universal graphs for effective storage capacity and storage efficiency are developed. A simple economic analysis shows that subcooling is likely to be cost‐effective for many commercial buildings, with current electric rate schedules.

The Arctic basin is dominated by multi‐year ice. whereas the Antarctic is subject to large seasonal changes in the cover by annual sea ice. Primary production is intensely seasonal nearshore but probably less so in offshore waters where significant production is associated with the marginal ice zone. Oxygen consumption in polar zooplankton is low compared with temperate and tropical species. Annual growth rates are generally slow and, especially in herbivores, highly seasonal. It is likely that fast growth rates are possible for polar zooplankton in areas of high food availability such as ice‐edge blooms, but these growth rates are not usually achieved in the more oligotrophic open‐ocean areas. Lipid stores in polar herbivorous zooplankton are generally high, although some euphausiids and gelatinous zooplankton also rely on degrowth to provide energy over winter. Ice‐edge blooms are of great importance to the polar marine food web although the quantitative significance of winter feeding under ice has yet to be resolved. Comparison of data on lipid storage and oxygen consumption for polar zooplankton indicates that there are large differences in the energy requirements of benthos and crustacean zooplankton. This is probably related to the high metabolic cost of staying in the water column. In contrast gelatinous zooplankton (salps, ctenophores. medusae and siphonophores) have a low energy throughput, related to a body composition which renders them essentially neutral in buoyancy and a slow but efficient means of locomotion. Under good feeding conditions many species can therefore grow and reproduce very rapidly. This emphasises the distinct energetic regime of gelatinous zooplankton, now known to be a group of major ecological importance in most waters of the world. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

Only the vertically and latitudinally averaged mean temperature and mean water vapor content over the strip of Earth between 30 and 50°N latitudes are considered as atmospheric state variables; only two hydrologic state variables, the water storage (through the water balance equation) and ground temperature, are considered for describing the behavior of the hydrologic system. The ocean temperature is specified as a function of season only. The coupling between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface occurs through exchanges of thermal energy (radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes) and of water (evapotranspiration and rain), which are parameterized functions of the four state variables of the atmospheric-hydrologic interactive system. Using this GCM, the mechanism leading to drought conditions is investigated. It is shown to be a non-linear positive feedback mechanism in the sense that it feeds on itself. Imposing a temperature wave over a geographical region (western USA in this study) for a short period of the order of few months induces geophysical conditions in that region which tend to reduce the hydrologic water storage for a period of time of the order of years (called 'drought growth period'). These conditions consist initially of increased cloudiness over the region, which reduces the net radiative flux of energy available at the surface. This in turn reduces the evapotranspiration which is needed to achieve condensation conditions in the atmosphere. Consequently, a reduction in rainfall occurs. After the end of the drought growth period, the hydrologic system recovers the water storage mainly owing to decreased evapotranspiration (related to reduced water storage) while rainfall resumes its normal levels. The time duration necessary to return to the climatological average conditions of water storage (called 'drought recovery period') is proportional to the peak drought severity during the growth period. © 1991.",,"atmospheric dynamics; drought; general circulation model; hydrological process; water storage; Atmospheric Movements--Mathematical Models; Geophysics; Hydrology; Meteorology; Atmospheric Processes; Drought Physics; General Circulation Models; Hydrologic Processes; Water Resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026359336

The flux enhancements predicted by Model 1 (Deardorff) for prevailing over-lake lapse conditions were inconsistent with measured changes in lake heat storage. When using the Budyko formulation for sky emissivity, ε, satisfactory energy residuals were obtained by eliminating the lapse enhancement while retaining the suppressive effects of over-lake inversions (Model 2 = modified Deardorff). Here, the best estimate of the 10 m Dalton coefficient was 1.45 × 10-3 (cgs units; neutral profile). However, when the Koberg model for ε was adopted instead, satisfactory energy residuals were obtained only after eliminating all adjustments for non-neutral conditions, and increasing the 10 m Dalton coefficient to approximately 1.55 × 10-3 (Model 3). Models 2 and 3 predicted annual evaporation from Lake Mendota of 71 and 86 cm during 1977 (including approximately 6 cm of sublimation during ice cover), bracketing earlier estimates for this locality (76 cm) based on U.S. Weather Bureau Class A pan data, and consistent with intensive studies of Pretty Lake in northern Indiana.

We hypothesized that animals select the stride frequency at which they behave most like simple spring-mass systems. If higher or lower frequencies are used, they will not behave like simple spring-mass systems, and the storage and recovery of elastic energy will be reduced. We tested the hypothesis by having humans hop forward on a treadmill over a range of speeds and hop in place over a range of frequencies. The body was modeled as a simple spring-mass system, and the properties of the spring were measured by use of a force platform. Our subjects used nearly the same frequency (the 'preferred frequency,' 2.2 hops/s) when they hopped forward on a treadmill and when they hopped in place. At this frequency, the body behaved like a simple spring-mass system. Contrary to our predictions, it also behaved like a simple spring-mass system when the subjects hopped at higher frequencies, up to the maximum they could achieve. However, at the higher frequencies, the time available to apply force to the ground (the ground contact time) was shorter, perhaps resulting in a higher cost of generating muscular force. At frequencies below the preferred frequency, as predicted by the hypothesis, the body did not behave in a springlike manner, and it appeared likely that the storage and recovery of elastic energy was reduced. The combination of springlike behavior and a long ground contact time at the preferred frequency should minimize the cost of generating muscular force.","elastic energy; locomotion; running","adult; article; controlled study; elasticity; female; frequency modulation; gait; human; human experiment; jumping; locomotion; male; motor unit; muscle; normal human; priority journal; rigidity; tendon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026320429

All corneas slowly increased in thickness during storage, despite the presence of colloidal osmotic agents. Corneas stored for 2.5 days in M-K became slightly thinner when cultured over a 24-hour period. Corneas stored in UW swelled quickly in culture and became too opaque to measure within three hours. Corneas stored in UW with 1.8 mM CaC12 swelled transiently, then maintained their thickness and exhibited deturgescence in the latter stages of the culture period. Deturgescence of corneas stored for 7 days in M-K was only slightly worse than those stored for 2.5 days. Corneas stored for 7 days in UW, however, became opaque almost imnediately in culture and those stored in calcium-supplemented UW became opaque within 4.5 hours. Replacement of the dextran in M-K with hydroxyethyl starch produced a slower rate of corneal swelling during storage and a substantially better corneal deturgescence profile during culture. Use of high concentrations of potassium ion in the M-K formulation had no significant effect on post-storage deturgescence. Replacement of glucose in M-K with the impermeable sugar, raffinose had a slight deleterious effect on corneal deturgescence in subsequent culture. Use of the impermeable anions gluconate or lactobionate to replace chloride ion caused profound corneal swelling during culture, compared with those stored in M-K. These experiments show that UW solution is inferior to M-K at preserving post-storage corneal function. Furthermore, most of the components of uw solution are inferior to their analogous components of M-K at maintaining corneal function during storage. The hydroxyethyl starch used in UW solution, however, appears to have advantages over dextran during and after corneal storage. © 1991 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,"calcium chloride; dextran; hetastarch; potassium ion; tissue culture medium; animal tissue; article; cornea; cornea edema; cornea preservation; cornea thickness; eyebank; nonhuman; rabbit; Animal; Comparative Study; Cornea; Corneal Edema; Cryopreservation; Culture Media; Rabbits; Solutions; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Time Factors; Tissue Culture; Tissue Preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026318875

Hydrologic data collected over a 5‐year period (1985–1989) from an arctic watershed in northern Alaska are presented. Processes related to snow accumulation, redistribution, ablation, evaporation and subsequent snowmelt‐generated runoff are discussed. The total water content of the snowpack at the end of winter has comprised between 28 and 40% of the annual precipitation. Redistribution of snow on the ground by the wind is a major factor in increasing the snowmelt runoff. Much of the redistributed snow accumulates in the valley bottom along the stream and also along depressions on the hillslopes. These depressions are small surface drainage channels that are referred to as water tracks. Partitioning of the snowmelt into runoff, evaporation and increased soil water storage in the active layer was carried out on the plot and watershed scale. Over a 5‐year period, the volume of snowmelt runoff varied from 50 to 66% of the average watershed snowpack, while evaporation varied from 20 to 34% and soil moisture storage increased between 10 and 19%. Much greater variation in these hydrologic components occurred at the plot scale.

The basic events occurring across the apical and basolateral membranes of the cells are far better understood today, although gaps still exist in the area of the relationship of the cellular and paracellular pathways and their relative contribution to the overall behavior of the endothelium. Little is known about the movement of ions or fluid between the cells or in what proportion this may occur compared to the cellular events. Furthermore, although our knowledge of the ionic movement processes has been enhanced, the link between fluid transfer across the endothelium and ion movements remains an enigma. Important questions also remain concerning the link between electrical characteristics and either ion movement or fluid transport. Improved storage solutions are needed that will preserve endothelial function after transplantation through the provision of a significant improvement in long-term cell survival. The limit to preservation time at present is about 14 days, and the use of other variables in the storage solution may extend this time. In reality, however, extension of preservation time is now of secondary importance relative to the need to enhance cell survival and reduce cell loss following surgery. Whether such improvement can be made with manipulation of the solution alone, or whether refinements are needed in the surgical technique awaits further study. Our comprehension of the biochemical linkage between energy supply and ion movement also remains uncertain in view of the particular intracellular localization of the anionic ATPases to mitochondrial loci. Despite numerous attempts there have been only a few chemicals identified that stimulate the fluid pump, but the level of stimulation has been relatively small and short-lived. No sustained effects have been found that would be of clinical benefit in reducing corneal thickness. A considerable variety of chemicals has been tested on the endothelium and it is unlikely that any new compounds will be identified that will cause enhancement of the fluid pump that would be of clinical benefit in dystrophic, or otherwise swollen, corneas. Of all the toxic responses of the endothelium the majority have been identified because of a malfunction of corneal thickness regulation, with the resultant corneal swelling, or by morphological examination. Only in a few instances has the permeability to non-electrolytes (carboxyfluorescein, inulin/dextran) been measured, and even more rarely have ion fluxes, or pump activity (3H-ouabain binding), been measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"eye drops; toxin; animal; contact lens; cornea edema; cornea endothelium; cytology; electrochemistry; human; pathophysiology; physiology; review; transport at the cellular level; drug effect; metabolism; Animals; Biological Transport; Contact Lenses; Corneal Edema; Electrochemistry; Endothelium, Corneal; Humans; Ophthalmic Solutions; Animal; Endothelium, Corneal; Human; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Toxins",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026298173

The optimal fraction of surplus energy devoted to growth decreases with age, whereas the fraction devoted to storage increases asymptotically with age. The latter fraction increases also with the maximum possible probability of winter survival. At high chances of survival in winter, it is optimal to delay maturation and to grow intensively in a few initial years of life. This delay leads to much greater body size than the one optimal at low survivability, even under the same productivity of a habitat.

Evaporation from the understorey and forest floor, Eu, estimated from the available energy determined from radiation attenuation by the tree canopy, is also included. The model is applied to an 11-year-old Pinus radiata D. Don stand before and after thinning. Parameters in the model were determined for the unthinned stand, and changes in the parameters following thinning were estimated from changes in tree number per unit area and leaf area index, L. Independent measurements of Et from trees growing in weighing lysimeters within the stand, estimates of evaporation from the canopy (not including the stems), Eic, from measurements of rainfall, throughfall and stemflow, and measurements of Eu are used to validate the model. The model also shows good agreement with measurements of the duration of tree canopy wetness and Et from a drying canopy after rainfall. The model is used to estimate the annual components of canopy water balance for the unthinned and thinned stands during a year with high, well distributed rainfall (1623 mm), when there was no summer drought period. For the unthinned stand, modelled annual Et, Ei and Eu were 636, 268 and 93 mm, respectively, with the net amount of water added to the soil storage, N, being 626 mm. Thinning resulted in a significant reduction (36%) in modelled annual Et, slightly less than the decrease in L (42%). The decrease in modelled annual Ei (27%) was much smaller than the decrease in L. These results are discussed in relation to the significance of canopy structure in determining evaporative losses from forest canopies and the net addition of water to storage in the soil. During the year following thinning, the model indicated an increase in N of 201 mm (13% of gross rainfall). Implications for managing the water yield from forest catchments are discussed. © 1991.",,"canopy water balance; coniferous forest; evaporation; forest thinning; interception; leaf area index; lysimeter; Penman-Monteith equation; Rutter model; transpiration; water balance model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026294007

Pollution control reduces injection of noxious substances into the biosphere to values below limits determined by risk assessment and social consensus. The heat emissions associated with pollution control are still a relatively benign environmental burden. They can be considered as a thermodynamic indicator of the (least troublesome) pollution potential of a given energy carrier and its appropriate energy conversion process. In this sense, environmental accounting with respect to a reference state can be done with the help of the heat equivalents of noxious substances (HEONS). They are defined as the waste heat generated by pollution control in a production process of given utility output divided by the primary energy input into a non-pollution-controlled production process of the same utility output. In the discussed scenarios the HEONS are about 0.7% for 80% NOx reduction, 1-4.4% for 60-95% desulfuration, 38% for 66% cryogenic CO2 removal and deep ocean storage, and 0.08%-3%; for the disposal of radioactive nuclear fuel rods in interstellar space via electromagnetic launchers. The relative primary energy required for the indicated processes of pollution control is equal to the HEONS with the exception of the nuclear fuel rods where 0.02-0.9% have to be added for the energy lost in space. Similar to the oxygen equivalents of organic waste water pollutants in the German sewage levy law, the heat or energy equivalents of noxious substances may serve as one criterion for charging taxes and levies to energy carriers. © 1991.",,"air pollution; bat; emission control; environmental accounting; heat equivalent; noxious substance; Pleistocene; pollution control; France, Cote-d'Or, Santenay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026281682

These adders primarily feed on field voles Microtus agrestis which undergo great population density fluctuations. In order to survive periods of low food supply adders allocate some energy to storage, and they can be expected to increase the proportion of energy devoted to storage when good levels and rate of energy intake decrease. Individuals allocating much energy to storage have less energy available for growth, reproduction and maintenance, and one can expect a trade-off between growth and energy storage, especially during resource shortage. Since the size of energy reserves influences fasting endurance, while body size influences future reproductive success, the pattern of energy allocation between growth and storage might have important fitness consequences. The authors compared the size of energy reserves and the growth rates of individual male adders from two localities with different densities of field voles. Relative body mass was similar to both adder populations, but individuals grew faster where vole density was higher, ie the pattern of energy allocation changed with resource availability.

In essence the model only requires land cover and net all-wave radiation as input, but it can be further refined to include anthropogenic heat release, the three-dimensional form of the surface, and can allow for changes in source area. Tests against energy balance data from a site in Vancouver, BC indicate the model simulates most aspects of measured storage heat flux values for a suburban site in both winter and summer.

Over the range of magnetic field waveforms considered, it is shown that the stored energy required to achieve stimulation, both cortically and in the periphery, varies by approximately 2:1. Greater efficiency is obtained by using shorter risetime magnetic fields. This results in more effective stimuli for the same stored energy, or, for the same stimulus, a decrease in energy storage, power dissipation and peak currents, thus simplifying hardware design. A novel method of processing the data obtained from different waveforms is presented which enables neural membrane time constant to be calculated. Data from normal subjects is presented showing both peripheral and neural time constants to be of order 150 microseconds. The cortical measurements represent the first non-invasive determination of cortical membrane time constant in man. Time constant measurements using magnetic stimulation may be clinically useful because they give information concerning the electrical properties of the nervous system not available from present techniques. Finally a method of quantifying the output of magnetic stimulators and coils is described which enables laboratory comparisons to be made, and takes into account magnetic field waveforms and coil geometry.

The method discussed here concerns the recovery of carbon dioxide from gases with a high carbon content. After recovery, the carbon dioxide is disposed of in exhausted natural gas (NG) fields. In an integrated-gasifier, combined-cycle (IGCC) power plant, coal is converted to an intermediate synthesis gas. The carbon can be recovered from this synthesis gas in three steps: 1. (i) conversion of the carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, 2. (ii) extraction of the carbon dioxide by a physical absorption process and 3. (iii) compression and drying of the carbon dioxide. The method reduces the emission of carbon dioxide by about 88%. Application of this process might decrease the net energy-conversion efficiency from 43.6% in the original IGCC base configuration to 38.1% in the low-carbon-dioxide-emission integrated-gasifier, combined-cycle (LCE-IGCC) plant. Assuming a fuel price of 4 Dutch guilders (Dfl)/gigajoule (GJ) for coal, the recovery of the carbon dioxide costs 25 Dfl/metric tonne (t) of carbon dioxide avoided, while electricity-production costs increase from 7.0 to 8.7 Dutch cents (Dct)/kWeh for the disposal of carbon dioxide. Storage in exhausted NG fields is a suitable option in The Netherlands. Upon exhaustion, the Dutch gas fields could store 40 times the total current Dutch annual carbon dioxide production. This disposal is likely to cost about 3.5 Dfl/t CO2, which increases the electricity-production costs by 0.3 Dct/kWeh. It is estimated that the removal of about 88% of the carbon dioxide from an IGCC power plant will cost 28.5 Dfl/t carbon dioxide avoided and lead to an increase of &lt;30% in the electricity-production costs. © 1991.",,"Carbon Dioxide - Storage; Coal Gasification; Fossil Fuel Power Plants - Gas and Steam Turbine Combined; Electricity Cost; Emission Reduction; Exhausted Natural Gas Field; Integrated Gasifier Combined Cycle Plant; Recovery Cost; Carbon Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026260568

In this paper we investigate the performance of a hybrid Photovoltaic(PV)-Wind generator power supply system operating under good and fair insolation and wind regimes. The effectiveness of such a hybrid system is measured by the Relative Sizing Parameter (RSP), Money Saving Parameter (MSP), and the Overall Reliability Parameter (ORP). Under specified weather conditions and for a nominal load demand, the RSP relates the product of the PV-modules and storage batteries involved in sizing the PV-Wind hybrid system to those of a stand alone PV-system sized to meet the same load. The MSP reports the difference between the total costs of a stand-alone PV power supply system and a hybrid PV-Wind power supply system, both sized to meet the same load, as a percentage of the total costs involved in supplying the load with a stand-alone PV power supply system only. The ORP compares the yearly average of the daily excess energy (positive difference between generated and consumed energy) of the hybrid system to that of the stand-alone PV power system. Based on this strategy we were able to develop a number of design diagrams which can be used in judging the benefits of utilizing hybrid PV-Wind generators on both economic and energy reliability grounds. © Ambient Press Limited 1991.",,"Photovoltaic Cells--Costs; Money-Saving Parameter; Overall Reliability Parameter; Relative Sizing Parameter; Wind Turbines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026243064

The activation energy for the relaxation approximated from the shift factors is about 100 kJ/mol which is nearly the same as that for diffusion of A1 and Ni in Al.

Experiments are described that demonstrate the successful application of these techniques in conduction time ranges from 50 ns to over 1 μs. Physics understanding of the conduction and opening mechanisms is far from complete; however, many insights have been gained from experiments and theory. Measurements of current distribution, plasma density, and ion emission indicate that conduction and opening mechanisms differ for 50 ns and 1 μs conduction times. For the 50 ns conduction time case, switching begins at a current level close to the bipolar emission limit, and opening could occur primarily by erosion. In the 1 its conduction time case, limited hydrodynamic plasma displacement implies far higher plasma density than is required by the bipolar emission limit. Magnetic pressure is required to augment erosion to generate the switch gap inferred from experiments. © 1991 IEEE",,"Electric Power Systems; Electric Switches; Plasma Opening Switches; Pulsed Power Systems; Plasma Devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026242048

These results have been reproduced using the transient heat and mass transfer mathematical model. Subsequently, the model has been used to simulate roof performance in different seasons and in different climate regions. In all cases the effects continue to be signifi cant. Small amounts of water readily move up or down in the insulation depending on the direction of the vapor pressure gradient. If a large amount of water is present, it concentrates on the bottom during the summer and on the top during the winter. In addition, during most days there is a portion that cycles up and down This adds excess heat to the building during the warm afternoon which may increase the air conditioning load and removes nearly the same amount of extra heat during the cool evening which may increase the building's heating system load The results from the model calculations are reported in terms of increased cooling and increased heating. Combining these into a changed building energy load and discussing the impact on building performance requires additional analysis to show how these hourly changes impact the whole building's energy balance Using the available property data for other roofing insulations indicates that this latent heat effect is not as important as it is for fibrous glass insulation Additional computer simulations with the model suggest that the effect is notice able even for moisture concentrations at a level which can be picked up by insulations in outdoor storage Impermeable layers between insulation boards influence the magnitude of dynamic heat transfer but do not eliminate it. Calculations show that thermal performance for new roofs over old insulation where moisture is probably common may be particularly affected by these results. © 1991, Sage Publications.

We conclude that by maintaining depletion/weak-inversion at the Si surface, the primary charge loss mechanism is back-tunneling of charge from the nitride traps into the Si bands. The actual charge distribution in the nitride is a function of charge injection and trapping.

The ground water for a city usually is collected from an existing well field. A major component of the operational expense is pumping, which includes the vertical lifts and the head losses through the collection piping to the storage facility. When the demand served by the well field is significantly less than its total capacity, a potential exists for energy-efficient management decisions as wells are selected to meet that demand. Such decisions should include consideration of transient drawdown at each well and energy losses between the wells and the storage facility. A simulation model has been assembled, for use with microcomputers, to assist an operator with these decisions. Input information includes hydraulic parameters for the aquifer, wells, and collection system. For a given demand, the model output provides an estimate of the best combination of wells to meet that flow rate.

These state-to-state transition rates were fed into the master equation, which was numerically solved to determine the rotational and vibrational population densities as well as the bulk thermodynamic properties. Our results show that a) the vibrational transition rates of H2 increase monotonically with the vibrational levels, faster than the Landau-Teller model, b) the rotation of the molecules helps relax the low vibrational levels, serves as a temporary storage of vibrational energy during the relaxation, and thereby delays the dissociation process, c) the dissociation and recombination rates can be approximated within an order of magnitude using equilibrium formulations and Park's two-temperature model for temperature averaging, d) lower vibrational levels tend to over-relax, and e) the average energy loss due to the dissociation is about 80-90% of the dissociation energy.

The predictions of the theory for capacitors with elastic dielectrics are compared with experimental charging curves on anodic films of tungsten oxide. The experimental curves show that the electrostatic energy stored can exceed the external work done on a charging cycle. This is possible because anodic oxides are grown in a high field, and when the anodizing field is removed the oxide films acquire elastic energy which can be reconverted partially to electrostatic energy on a subsequent charging cycle. The apparent conflict between theory and experiment is not because there is anything unusual about the coupling between electrostatic and elastic energy in anodic oxides, it is because the theory assumes that the elastic energy is zero at zero field and expands the energy density accordingly. The permittivity variation deduced from charging curves on tungsten oxide compares closely with the permittivity variation deduced from open-circuit transients using an effective field model with the permittivity expanded about the anodizing field. If the ionic current is controlled by an effective field, changes in relative permittivity will affect the current density, and electrostriction will have a significant impact on the ionic transport process whenever the field in the oxide is changed. © 1991, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

The algorithm is similar in spirit to the classical Progressive Refinement Radiosity Method designed for more conventional computers but is not an adaptation of that technique to massive parallelism. Instead, the new algorithm uses a discretization of the wave equation as a local rule for shuttling radiant energy values between processors which correspond to regions of space. A number of example images that were created with an implementation of the algorithm on a Connection Machine are depicted and critiqued. © 1991.",,"Computer Systems, Digital--Parallel Processing; Data Storage, Digital; Light--Propagation; Global shared memories; Massive parallelism; Parallel machines; Simulation algorithms; Tagged shooitng method; Computer Programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026237381

During exercise the major locomotory muscles undergo alternate cycles of lengthening and shortening. Force development is greatly influenced by the timing of stimulation in relation to the length-change cycle and by the nature of elastic structures connecting the muscle fibres to the skeleton. The storage and recovery of elastic strain energy by the tendons (apodema in insects) results in a considerable saving of metabolic energy. Strain is independent of locomotory frequency, body size and muscle temperature. In contrast, the frequency of cycles, and hence strain rate, generally increases with speed and is inversely proportional to body size. The maximum isometric stress (P0) striated muscles can exert is rather similar. During steady running or hopping in mammals the peak muscle stress is around one-third of P0. Behaviours such as vertical jumping impose higher stresses requiring disproportionately larger muscles and tendons, which may limit the storage of elastic strain energy. Muscles of small animals consume significantly more energy per gram than do those of large ones. This may be because they need to activate and deactivate their muscles at a higher rate to move at an equivalent speed. When differences in force production are normalised, by multiplying the energy consumed per stride by stride frequency, similar values for the mass-specific cost of locomotion are found in animals with different leg architectures, numbers of legs, skeletal type, body sizes and muscle temperatures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,"animal; comparative study; exercise; locomotion; muscle; physiology; review; Animals; Exertion; Locomotion; Muscles",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026231543

In the measurement of I–V characteristics using metal‐SiN‐Si (MNS) structure, the film leakage current was small, but the film deposited at high‐substrate temperature had a large leakage current although the interface characteristics improved.

Most effective use of each component part of the system must be achieved in order to optimize the utilization of the plant and achieve maximum economy. Implementation of such load management schemes demands the installation of some intelligent interface between the source and the load. This is usually some form of microprocessor controller that can be programmed to disable different types of load under different circumstances of supply/demand to limit the maximum demand on the system. The requirements of these controllers and the improvements to be expected from their installation are discussed. © 1991, All rights reserved.",,"Electric Power Systems--Load Management; Solar Cells--Energy Storage; Remote Area Power Systems; Solar Panels; Storage Batteries; Electric Batteries, Secondary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026222169

The decrease in the weight‐average molecular weight (M̄w) of PAA in N,N‐dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solution with time and the acceleration of M̄w drop due to the increase in storage temperature or the addition of APy into PAA solution were observed. Apparent activation energies (Ea) for scission of PAA chains were similar: about 13 kcal/mol in PAA/DMAc and PAA/APy/DMAc, respectively. When stored at 60°C for a week, the number of scissions per polymer chain in PAA/DMAc is about 2, but is about 5 in PAA/DMAc with a large amount of APy. The result indicates that the M̄w drop accelerated by the addition of APy is attributed to amide exchange reaction between PAA Chains and monofunctional APy. It was concluded from the dependence of M̄w drop on Apy concentration that the exchange reaction between different PAA molecules during storage of PAA/PAA solution may scarcely occur under the conditions (storage time and temperature) used for preparation of PAA/PAA blends.

With the other part of the solar energy electricity will be generated in a power conversion unit consisting of a Stirling engine and a generator. In times without insolation the Stirling engine can be driven with the heat of reaction released when hydrogen is recombined with magnesium.

For the first two technologies, this prediction has been realized by the placement and successful operation of batteries in RAPS field sites. Battery failure is associated mainly with degradation of the positive plate, namely, breakdown/shedding of active material, together with the development of inter-plate short circuits; corrosion/growth of grids; irreversible sulphation (including penetration of separators).

To enhance heat transfer, the porous layers are located in regions where the melting rates for a pure substance are the lowest. n-Octadecane is used as the phase-change material, and the porous matrix is composed of glass or aluminum beads of various diameters. Natural convection in the liquid and conduction in the solid are present. The temperature distributions in both the fluid and porous regions are measured using thermocouple rakes, and solid-liquid interface positions and shapes are recorded by tracing the interface at specified time intervals. It is found that the differences in the thermophysical properties between the porous layer and the pure fluid layer cause strong variations in heat transfer, melt convection, and the movement and shape of the solid-liquid interface. Although a porous layer may cause a faster movement of the solid-liquid interface, the melting and heat transfer rates are reduced compared to the case without a porous layer. This is attributed to the effects of the low porosity and permeability of the porous media tested, which are not offset by the high thermal conductivity of the media. Considerable care must be exercised in trying to enhance melting heat transfer using high thermal conductivity porous media. © 1991.","melting; natural convection; porous media; thermal energy storage","Energy Storage; Heat Transfer - Convection; Heat Transfer - Porous Materials; Solids - Melting; Thermal Conductivity; Enclosure Melting Heat Transfer; High Thermal Conductivity Porous Medium; Natural Convection Heat Transfer; Phase-Change Materials; Porous Layer Thermophysical Properties; Thermal Energy Storage; Enclosures; Heat Transfer; Porous Media-Flow Through",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026220094

The exceptions include a few second-law studies, noted in the Introduction, of sensible heat storage systems and the latent heat storage systems. The cited second-law studies treat the storage and removal processes essentially as “batch” heating and cooling. The approximation effectively ignores the significant temperature gradient, especially in the axial direction, in the storage medium over a substantial portion of both the storage and removal processes. The results presented in this paper are for a more comprehensive model of the packed bed storage system utilizing encapsulated phase-change materials. The fundamental equations for the system are similar to those of Schumann, except that a transient conduction equation is included for intraparticle conduction in each pellet. The equations are solved numerically, and the media temperatures obtained are used for the determination of the exergy (or availability) disposition in complete storageremoval cycles. One major conclusion of the study from both the first-law and second-law perspectives is that the principal advantage in the use of phase-change storage material is the enhanced storage capacity, compared with the same size of packed bed utilizing a sensible heat storage material. Thermodynamically, however, it does not appear that the system employing phase-change storage material will always, or necessarily, be superior to that using a sensible heat-storage material.

Because of its limited storage, depletion of muscle glycogen has been shown to be one factor responsible for fatigue and exhaustion during prolonged exercise. Thus, dietary carbohydrate plays a key role in exercise performance and training. When the athlete's diet is low in carbohydrate, little glycogen is resynthesized between training sessions, leaving the individuals with low muscle glycogen and a state of chronic fatigue. The most sensitive period for glycogen resynthesis is within the first few hours after exercise. Optimal recovery from an exhaustive exercise bout depends on a reasonably rich carbohydrate diet soon after the exercise. Such feedings serve to replenish carbohydrate stores in both liver and muscles. Exertional hypoglycemia can occur when liver glucose output falls below the rate of muscle glucose uptake. Though this seldom occurs in well-fed and highly trained individuals, sugar feedings during long-term exercise has been shown to enhance performance. Thus, the important role of dietary carbohydrate before, during and after endurance activities is well established, whereas our understanding of the nutritional needs for protein and fat remain unclear.",,"carbohydrate diet; exercise; feeding behavior; human; metabolism; nutrition; physical education; review; sport; Dietary Carbohydrates; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Nutrition Physiology; Physical Education and Training; Sports",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026199998

These equations take into account effects of exchange stiffness, magnetic anisotropy, external and either long- or short-range demagnetizing fields, wall energy, and dissipation. Attention is devoted to the special case of a matched film pair using the capacitor or transmission-surface approximation for its short-range demagnetizing energy. The theory is founded on energy and dissipation functionals including domain and wall terms. The constraint of wall-normal magnetization continuity across a domain wall is handled by a novel method of implementing d'Alembert's virtual work principle without introducing Lagrange multipliers. The result is a set of coupled equations expressing 1) the dynamic torque balance at points inside domains, 2) the wall-domain constraint due to wall-normal magnetization continuity, 3) an additional boundary condition coupling domain magnetization and wall curves, and 4) the wall velocity.

Application was made to a subsystem of the Brazilian hydroelectric system. The model consists of two parts. An off-line, one-time-only, deterministic dynamic program computes the value of the stored water in all of the reservoirs as a function of the several reservoir storages and the month of the year. The calculated values represent potential energy generation and are based on historical flow data. The on-line program is formulated in terms of a stochastic dynamic program and conducted in real time for operational use. Each month a multidimensional search is made for the optimal set of reservoir releases that maximize system benefits. The search uses the probability transition matrices and the tables of stored-water benefits for the particular month determined by the off-line program. The optimization requires knowledge of the previous month's inflows and the starting storages for the current month; but these, of course, are observables and are readily determined. The following month, the on-line search procedure is repeated to find the optimal releases for that month. The off-line program also can be used to obtain trade-offs between expected energy-generation benefits and water-management benefits consequent to some other objective, such as flood control. Model performance was checked against actual operational data for a Brazilian subsystem, and there are indications of superior performance by the model. © 1991 ASCE.",,"Brazil; Hydropower; Optimization; Power Generation; Reservoirs; Stochastic Methods; Hydroelectric Power Plants - Management; Management - Optimization; Mathematical Programming, Dynamic; Power Plants - Brazil; Probability; Stochastic Processes; Reservoirs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026191754

A unique aspect of this superconducting configuration is power transmission at the optimal generator voltage level. This voltage level is also close to the subtransmission system voltage, eliminating the need for high voltage insulation and transformers. A reduced system with one rectifier feeding three inverters is studied in this paper. The ability to control the output power from the inverters, both locally and globally is demonstrated.

The proposed technique is a modified version of the dynamic hysteresis loop method. The energy released as heat was measured with an electric modelling method. It was found that the energy stored during one cycle in a specimen loaded with a stress equal to the fatigue limit was larger than zero (i.e., with Nf → ∞, the stored energy value theroetically also tends to infinity).

This is the first time the process of electrodepolymerization-electropolymerization has been exploited for energy. storage, establishing a broad class of chemically flexible, low equivalent weight, and inexpensive electrodes for advanced batteries. Electrochemical investigation of a diverse group of novel solid redox polymerization electrodes indicates that these materials are excellent candidates for all-solid-state, thin-film, energy-storage systems. Some of the advantages offered by the batteries based on these materials include high energy density and rate capability, extensive utilization of positive electrode capacity, ease of fabrication, low cost, and superior reliability, and safety. In addition, these materials are reversible to lithium and sodium (as well as many alkaline earth and transition metals), allowing for a much greater choice of negative electrode materials, in stark contrast to cells based on analogous intercalation compounds. Further, and in particular, a great advantage of redox polymerization electrodes is the ability to alter the physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties of these materials in a very predictable manner through manipulation of various functional groups, electron-withdrawing heteroatoms, and the molecular architecture. © 1991, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

We propose alternative practical strategies of peak shaving that use the opportunities offered by modern electronics as well as a more intelligent use of the thermal mass storage inherent in the structure and furnishings of the house. Using the framework of a simplified electrical analogue, we predict the thermal performance of the residence when the air-conditioner is switched off and illustrate the validity of such simplified estimates with monitored data from an actual residence.

For many applications, message standards already have been developed. For a few kinds of clinical entities, such as drugs, these code systems (e.g., the National Drug Code) are virtually complete, but a few gaps must be filled and an agreement must be reached about the level of granularity needed. The available codes for clinical descriptors are inadequate but the National Library of Medicine's Universal Medical Language (UML) project will do much to redress this deficiency. Codes for clinical variables such as blood pressure and blood glucose which have methods, units, normal ranges, and physiologic correlates are very inadequate. CPT4 provides some of the needed codes but has huge gaps. An early effort to extend CPT4 is included in ASTM 1238. Work being done by ASTM E31.12 and the Euclides project will offer robust codes for clinical laboratory measurements. If we want to pool data from different institutions for clinical and policy research, universal codes for observations are prerequisite. And agreement of an international coding system for observation-bearing variables should be a major agenda item for standards groups in the next year. Our goal has been to standardize the communication of clinical data between clinical systems, not the systems themselves or their internal operation. In fact, standardizing the internals of clinical application could be counterproductive at the present. It would deflect energy from, and delay the spread of, CDI standards. Moreover, it gives undue attention to computer systems, rather than the data they contain. The data are the most expensive part of any data system. They are the raison d'être for such systems. Computer systems come and go. The data last forever. Yet we have been mesmerized by the computer system while ignoring its contents. As a result, most computer-stored clinical data must live like the tragic boy in the bubble. They cannot ""live"" outside of the computer system in which they were born. So, we find at every hospital the bizarre rituals of humans reading computer-generated reports so they can type this information in another computer. Electronic (e.g., stored clinical) data should not depend upon the internals of a particular program, language, or machine for its interpretation. The clinical data entered into one computer system should be directly available to any other computer system that now receives them through manual transcription.

The body's physiologic response to this insult is, in some ways, similar to that of controlled hypothermia employed in the hospital setting, with the time sequencing being greatly enhanced. The application of hypothermic techniques employed with extracorporeal heat exchange on cardiopulmonary bypass to those of cold-water submersion requires careful differentiation, especially during rewarming phases. Conversely, protecting the brain from hypoxic injury (and thus a favorable neurologic recovery) following cold-water submersion can be favorably modified by the co-existence of hypothermia. The protective effects of safe usage of hypothermic without neurologic damage is multifaceted and influenced by age, time, temperature and intracellular pH, metabolic rate, biochemical changes, high-energy storage depots, as well as institution of rewarming techniques. Criteria for brain death established by the President's commission does not apply to the hypothermic patient. According to colleagues, rewarming to between 30 and 34 degrees C is essential before discontinuing resuscitative measures because of the multifactoral influences that the hypothermic state entails. A child who appears asystolic, apneic, and with absence of central nervous system activity after cold-water submersion, requiring intensive resuscitative efforts, may have a favorable outcome.

A sieved fraction (250/400 mesh) of LaNi5 particles was encapsulated with polystyrene (polymerization degree 1000–1400). The effect of polystyrene/LaNi5 weight ratio (0.015, 0.075, 0.15 and 0.30) on the material characteristics was investigated by using an absorption-desorption apparatus. The number of activation pretreatment increased with increasing of the polystyrene/LaNi5 ratio. The absorption capacity was not influenced by the encapsulating treatment. The initial absorption rate decreased with increasing polystyrene/LaNi5 ratio. Disintegration did not occur in the range of polystyrene/LaNi5 ratio larger than 0.15.

This is the second of two papers presented in this issue dealing with the regional hydrological effects of climatic change. By using a set of plausible hypothetical climatic scenarios to represent both greenhouse warming and precipitation changes, the sensitivity of the guaranteed annual fresh water and energy supply levels has been evaluated under conditions of altered runoff for four connected multi-purpose reservoirs in central Greece. It is shown that reservoirs designed and operated under current climatic conditions are, in general, affected by the climatic changes examined. A dramatic increase of the risk associated with the annual guaranteed quantity of water supply and energy production would occur if greenhouse warming were accompanied by a reduction in annual precipitation. Significant increases of storage volume would then be needed to maintain existing water and energy yields at tolerable risk levels. © 1991 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"climate change; greenhouse warming; hydroelectric production; precipitation change; reservoir storage; water management; Greece; Climate Changes; Global Warming; Environmental Impact; Hydroelectric Power Plants; Hydrology - Greece; Reservoirs - Management; Water Supply - Management; Climatic Change; Greenhouse Effect; Meteorology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026174294

These processes have been measured aerobically and anaerobically within a temperature range of 4-95°C in sediment samples consisting of either quartz-rich coarse sand or peaty clay. At temperatures above 45°C organic carbon compounds, including fulvic acids, were mobilized from both sediments resulting in an increased chemical oxygen demand of the water phase. Complexation of calcium and magnesium by fulvic acids resulted in the supersaturation of the water phase with regard to calcite and dolomite and thus prevented the precipitation of these carbonates. The highest rates of CO2 release were observed during the first 4 days. Aerobically, the maximum velocity for CO2 formation varied between 35 and 800 (sand) or 15 and 150 (peaty clay) μmol CO2 per gram volatile solids per day. Anaerobically, similar rates were observed, namely 25-500 (sand) and 10-110 (peaty clay) μmol CO2 per gram volatile solids.

Therefore, the PWM cycloconverters can be made compact and highly reliable compared with the conventional converter-inverter systems. The PWM cycloconverters, however, directly connected the input terminals to the output terminals by the switching devices. As a result, if the input source voltages are asymmetrical and/or contain harmonics, the influence of the distortions directly appear on the output terminals. This problem is a major obstacle to using PWM cycloconverters instead of the conventional converter-inverter systems. This paper presents a novel control method for PWM cycloconverters.

A comparison of the mechanisms and performance of such systems enables their essential features to be recognized and distinguished, and the conditions for transition between supercapacitor and “battery” behavior to be characterized. Supercapacitor systems based on two-dimensional underpotential deposition reactions are highly reversible and their behavior arises from the pseudocapacitance associated with potential-dependence of two-dimensional coverage of electroactive adatoms on an electrode substrate surface. Such capacitance can be 10–100 times the double-layer capacitance of the same electrode area. An essential fundamental difference from battery behavior arises because, in such systems, the chemical and associated electrode potentials are a continuous function of degree of charge, unlike the thermodynamic behavior of single-phase battery reactants. Quasi-two-dimensional systems, such as hyperextended hydrous Ru02, also exhibit large pseudocapacitance which, in this case, is associated with a sequence of redox processes that are highly reversible. Such oxide redox systems give rise to the best supercapacitor behavior and capacitances of farads per gram can be achieved. Other examples are the conducting polymer electrodes and Li intercalate systems. These systems provide examples of the transition between battery and supercapacitor behavior arising from a range of degrees of oxidation/ reduction that arise over an appreciable range of potentials.

Solution approaches based on relaxation techniques are typically used to minimize this increase, but they can be slow to converge. We present an adaption of Brandt’s multilevel acceleration scheme for control volume discretizations coupled with solvers based on either Stone’s strongly implicit method or the Gauss-Siedel (G-S) method to overcome this speed and storage space problem. We demonstrate this approach by solving Poisson’s equation in a two-dimensional amorphous silicon thin film transistor structure. The structure has a generalized density of states function whose occupancy is computed using nonzero degree Kelvin Fermi-Dirac statistics. We show that the use of the multilevel acceleration algorithm gives more than an order of magnitude increase in the asymptotic rate of convergence for the potential distribution in this thin film transistor.

Pregnant gilts were fed a 15% tallow diet from d 80 to 99 and then fed a basal high-carbohydrate diet (control) or fasted from d 100 to 110 of gestation. Caesarean section was performed on d 110. Fasting caused maternal nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels to increase 7.5-fold, beta-hydroxybutyric acid (beta-HBA) levels to increase 4.8-fold triglyceride (TG) levels to decrease 1.8-fold, and no change in plasma glucose concentration compared with controls. Fasted fetuses had a 1.3-fold increase in NEFA, 1.9-fold decrease in TG, 1.5-fold decrease in glucose, and no change in beta-HBA levels compared with control fetuses. Distribution of NEFA in fetal plasma was different from distribution of NEFA in maternal plasma. Esterification of [14C]-palmitate by maternal placenta and fetal adipose tissue was reduced by fasting, but other parameters of fatty acid metabolism were unaffected. Fasting decreased lipoprotein lipase activity per milligram of protein by 33% in maternal placenta and by 44% in fetal adipose tissue. Glycogen content of fetal liver and skeletal muscle was reduced by fasting pregnant gilts, but there was no detectable effect on percentage of carcass lipid of the fetus.

Spatially independent, cross-correlated, and systematic errors in irrigation demands are considered. These three, types of errors have similar patterns in their effects on system operation. When the Mahaweli system is operated optimally, both energy shortages and irrigation shortages increased with increasing standard deviations of error.

Results of the simulation indicate that such a pond is a potential energy source for greenhouse heating. This is especially true when the material properties are such that solar absorption and storage are enhanced. To demonstrate this point, three sets of collectors constructed with materials of different physical (radiation) properties were tested. One set is constructed of common materials which are readily available and are normally used as covers for greenhouses. The second set is made of improved materials which are also available but have a smaller long-wave transmittance. The last set is made of “ideal” material which additionally possesses selective radiation absorption properties. Collectors made of “ideal” materials make a superior solar pond; thus, manufacturing films with improved properties should become a worthwhile challenge for the agricultural polyethylene-films industry. Preliminary economic studies indicate that even with the low oil (< $20/Bbl) prices which exist between 1986-1989, the fresh water floating collectors solar pond provides an economically attractive alternative to the conventional oil-burning heating system. This is especially true in mild climate areas and when the large initial investment is justified by long-term greenhouse utilization planning. © 1991 by ASME.",,"Economics; Solar Radiation--Solar Ponds; Temperature Distribution; Auxiliary Heating; Zero-Load Simulation; Greenhouses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026155190

A cogeneration system is defined as a system that simultaneously produces electric power (electricity) and thermal power (steam). The cogeneration system model includes both the electric and thermal systems. The electric system model includes generation and transmission. The thermal system model includes the individual plants which are comprised of boilers, turbines, condensers, deaerators, pumps, and storage tanks and the interconnecting steam network. The optimization problem has as its objective the minimization of the overall cost of all fuels and makeup water used during the scheduling horizon (1 to 24 hours), subject to satisfying a number of constraints on electric and steam systems. A novel solution approach is introduced which is based on coordinated optimization of the electric and thermal systems. A production-grade computer program has been developed and tested for a real industrial complex. The program is being integrated as part of the Energy Management System of the industrial complex where it is to be used as an operational scheduling tool.

From the predictions of this model for SAW gratings, the frequently used coupling-of-modes (COM) phenomenogical description is evaluated. The network model consists of the usual sequence of mismatched transmission lines with susceptance loading at discontinuities to account for energy storage, plus a new additional reactive element, calculated using a perturbation formula, to account for the asymmetry that exists for arbitrary orientations. The circuit elements are determined by geometrical and material parameters. It is demonstrated that the incremental COM description can be derived from the unit-cell-based network model, and analytical formulas quoted in the literature for the COM coefficients are compared with the values calculated from the ABCD network model description. An analytically tractable approximation for the network model is also described, from which rather simple explicit formulas for the COM coefficients that predict their dependence on material parameters and on frequency are derived.

Industry gains from reduced capital and operating costs, reduced liabilities, cleaner and safer working conditions, conservation of energy and material resources, and the opportunity for government and industry to work together in a cooperative manner. However, a number of regulatory barriers exist which discourage pollution prevention/waste minimization. This paper provides examples from the aluminum, chemical, petroleum, and wood treating industries of how these regulatory barriers become disincentives. To promote pollution prevention/waste minimization, Congress and the U.S. EPA need to reexamine those RCRA provisions which support a command and control strategy that creates the barriers. The barriers include the distinction between value and valueless materials, offsite storage requirements prior to reuse/recycle, the “Derived from Rule”, the “Burning for Fuel Rule”, land ban technology standards, and RD&D restrictions. A new RCRA Pollution Prevention/Waste Minimization subtitle is proposed to eliminate or minimize these barriers. © 1991, Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Industrial Plants - Effluents; Industrial Wastes - Management; Legislation; Waste Disposal; Pollution Prevention; Regulatory Control; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; Waste Minimization; Environmental Protection; article; industrial waste; pollution; waste management; environmental protection; industrial pollution; pollution prevention; regulatory barrier; waste minimisation; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026143189

The example of two simple steam cycles demonstrates the applied technique. The method requires only a few, if any, iterations.

In a purely resistive circuit the cell internal resistance is a key variable which can fluctuate with internal modifications occurring during the cell discharge. By filtering and properly recording the spontaneous electrochemical transients it was possible to reveal some interesting differences between the Li/SO2 and Li/SOCl2 systems. The electrochemical noise patterns can thus be seen as a characteristic signature that is sensitive to the cell's operation which, in the case of Li cells, is a compromise between a passivated metal with an extra long shelf life and an active state triggered by the galvanic coupling to an ever-ready cathode. © 1991.",,"Electric Measurements--Voltage; Energy Storage; Passivation Mechanisms; Shelf Life; Electric Batteries, Secondary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026140965

However, the inherent advantages of “electrolytics” such as self-heating and high energy density make them an attractive candidate for pulse discharge circuitry. To this end, a new type of electrolytic capacitor has been developed specifically for high peak current applications. Preliminary results of an ongoing research effort to determine the operational characteristics of this new type of electrolytic are reported. Electrical characteristics such as equivalent series inducatance (ESL) and equivalent series resistance (ESR) has been determined for the first-generation test units. Along with the ESR determination, the adiabatic temperature rise per-pulse was measured to assist in cooling system design, as well as operation in environments where heat rejection is limited. These new electrolytic capacitors may facilitate the development of a new class of pulse generators based on high energy density components. Pulse generators for mass launchers, very low impedance loads, and space-based applications, where volume and weight density are at a premium, are ideal target applications for pulse electrolytics. Compared to other energy storage alternatives, the electrolytic capacitor still offers the best source of joules per dollar for traditional applications. © 1991 IEEE",,"Electric Energy Storage; Pulse Generators--Components; Energy Storage Density; Pulse Discharge Circuitry; Pulse Electrolytics; Capacitors, Electrolytic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026140239

The results show that this pH titration method, with prior rehydration at 150°C, is a practically useful way of determining the degree of air oxidation of a coal sample of known origin but uncertain weathering status. For coals of a lower rank than high volatile bituminous, this method can be simplified to direct measurement of the slurry pH without the rehydration step. Among the variables influencing the rate of mild air oxidation as measured by the slurry pH, temperature is the most important whereas humidity exhibits little or no effect on the initial slurry pH although it has a marked effect on the pH titration profiles. Use of Curie-point pyrolysis-low voltage mass spectrometry on weathered, subbituminous coal samples from a coal storage pile reveals that the main effect of humidity on the composition of the pyrolyzate appears to involve certain sulfur compounds. Application of the initial slurry pH as an oxidation /weathering index yields an activation energy of oxidation/weathering in the 20-150°C range of 50-65 kJ/mol (12-16 kcal/mol) and indicates the existence of several different oxidation mechanisms in the temperature regimes between 60 and 150°C. © 1991.",,"Chemical Analysis - Titration; Hydrogen Ion Concentration - Measurements; Coal Pile Weathering; Coal Properties; Coal Rank Effect; Humidity Effect; Oxidation Index; Water Treatment Effects; Coal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026138385

The quench behavior of such a conductor plays a very important role in the protection of this system and of other magnets having similar cooling environments. In particular, the existence of the thermohydraulic quenchback effect predicted recently by numerical analysis and theoretical calculation has been investigated experimentally. The test sample consists of a 50-m-long single triplex NbTi superconductor enclosed in a stainless steel conduit. Heaters 0.2 to 8 m long are provided both at the center and at one end of the sample, and the heated end can be closed off to simulate quenching centered in a 100-m-long conductor. The quench behavior of the conductor (e.g., the propagation velocity and the temperature profile) was measured as a function of initial normal zone length, conductor current density, helium temperature, etc. This paper reports the test results and the comparison with the predictions. © 1991 IEEE",,"Hydraulics; Cable in Conduit Superconductors; Quench Propagation; Thermal Hydraulics; Superconducting Cables",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026122434

In addition, the significant capital investment in this prototype for commercial electric utility and defense application mandates that the SMES/ETM fully accomplish its primary mission of demonstrating large-scale SMES technology, while at the same time minimizing technical, schedule and cost risks.

This selection has typically been justified on the basis of cost. A toroidal configuration would have a much less extensive external magnetic field, which might be a desirable feature for siting a SMES unit where land is limited. This paper reviews the characteristics of large-scale toroidal and solenoidal coils (> 10 MWh, or 36 GJ) to establish a basis for quantitative estimates of the material requirements for these two SMES systems and compares the size dependence, scaling features, and the estimated costs for major material components.

That is, after field data have been collected, the equation for ground‐water velocity, using either method, still contains the two unknowns, velocity and porosity. If the local hydraulic gradient is known and if a drift and pumpback tracer test is conducted at a well whose hydraulic conductivity has been determined, two independent functional relationships between velocity and porosity are established. By treating these functions as nonlinear simultaneous equations, a unique solution for the local velocity and porosity can be obtained. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

Two separate tests were run at the Texas Accelerator Center using different inductive heater designs: the first was a long heater about a subcable pitch in length (50 cm) and was wound with inner and outer coils with currents flowing in opposite directions to minimize stray fields; the second was a short coil about 2 m long without an inner coil. Thermocouples were used in both tests to measure the total energy delivered to the conductor. In order to calculate the “stability margin”, one needs the energy delivered per unit volume of conductor. This relies on knowing the energy distribution along the length of the test conductor. For the long heater with inner and outer coils, the energy distribution has been calculated to be fairly uniform along the length of the heater. However, for a single short heater, the losses are distributed in a very non-uniform fashion; in fact they are considerably higher at the test conductor ends due to coupling losses induced by the radial field component. Another design consideration in the test was to let the LRC circuit “ring”, with the hope of increasing the efficiency of energy transfer to the test conductor. The main conclusion of this paper is that the induced heating in the test conductor will depend on the cabling geometry, resistance, and applied field distribution, and that great care must be taken to correctly interpret stability margin results based on inductive heat input to very large cabled conductors. © 1991 IEEE",,"Electric Coils; Electric Heating, Induction; Thermocouples; Energy Distributions; Superconducting Magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026120704

Ripples also help carry the radial magnetic forces. A low-bending ripple shape achieves a near-zero bending status in structure pieces and greatly reduces the net structure stresses and conductor strains under cyclic magnetic loads. An iteration method determines the optimum ripple shape for minimum bending moments. Friction between the structure and conductor is the largest potential thermal disturbance to SMES conductors. Direct calculation of the disturbance is difficult because input assumptions on friction coefficients and slippage distances are not reliable for a stick-slip occurrence. A general approach is presented in this paper. The disturbance ED is calculated as the difference in strain energy before and after slippage, which is independent of the friction coefficients and slippage details. The disturbance is found for the low bending ripple, circular ripple, and non-ripple structures. The low bending ripple structure has very small disturbance, approximately 2% of that for a non-ripple. © 1991 IEEE",,"Friction; Mathematical Techniques - Iterative Methods; Strain; Rippled Structures; Superconducting Magnets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026117824

Since the initial state can often be described as a potential field, the stress arising from subsequent magnetic twisting is characterized by vanishing net-current flow. Such a layering scheme provides the lowest global energy excess for a given local field twist. In this paper we investigate the nonlinear release of this stored energy by the resistive magnetic-tearing instability. Our aim is to discover whether the evolution of this dynamic reconnection process is modified by the finite width and restoring force of the energizing field reversal. We use a force-free magnetic-field model with the sheared reversing component varying as tanh y sech ay. We study the unstable nonlinear evolution by a 2–5-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulation in a slab geometry. Almost all of the perpendicular (with respect to the ignorable coordinate) stored magnetic energy is released for some cases in this model. Although the magnetic reconnection is due to resistivity, the resulting closed flux surfaces evolve to a lower-energy state, i.e. to a nearly circular one, by mostly ideal MHD. Thus an elongated flux surface drives the plasma flow, and the flow speed is comparable to the Alfvén speed. The excess or stored magnetic energy is thereby released. In general, however, these processes take place only after reconnection occurs, and thus the release of energy is limited by the rcconnection rate. The evolution of our new current/field system, which is more realistic as a model of a solar flare, exhibits an energy-release rate similar to that of more conventional field configurations. This rate can be increased, however, by the effects of an assumed anomalous resistivity enhancement. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

The need to schedule a diverse array of experiments, within the constraints of limited solar energy and battery storage availability, calls for a delicate energy demand and supply balance. This has to take into account the uneven energy supply between the sunshine and eclipse periods, and occasional need to simultaneously serve a peak load and the full battery charging load. In addition, the noninterruptible and nonrestartable nature of many experiments have to be accounted for in the schedule. These have been accounted for by using various time intervals and priority weighting factors. Supply/demand windows of various durations are tested for the typical load profile. This shows under what circumstances less scheduling tasks are needed and how a closer match between the supply and demand can be obtained. The optimal supply/demand is expressed in terms of the excess and shortage of electricity, the peak load, and the time displacement of the individual payloads.

These have potential applications for use in thermal energy storage. Pure plastic crystals undergo first order transformations but the binaries exhibit complex behavior. A phase diagram for two energetic materials, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol (NPG) and 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (AMPL) plastic crystals is proposed. This diagram was determined by high temperature Guinier X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetric methods. It is found that the AMPL rich binaries supercool and the high temperature phase can be triggered by straining the material to release an estimated amount of 50-53 cal g-1 at room temperature. The structure of the high temperature γ′ phase of AMPL is determined as body centered cubic with a lattice parameter 6.778 Å at 92 °C; which is much lower than that of 8.8381 Å at 46.5 °C for the face centered cubic γ phase of NPG. A eutectoid γ → α + β transformation occurs at 20 °C. In the AMPL rich mixtures heat is absorbed in the α + γ and α + γ′ regions over a wide temperature range. An interesting feature is that there are binary equilibria between the γ and γ′ phases, with molecular rotations. Some rather uncommon thermal contractions with abrupt changes of 28% are observed in γ and γ′ phases in heating AMPL-25 mol.% NPG binary mixture. © 1991.",,"Crystals--Structure; Glycols--Phase Diagrams; Thermodynamics--Phase Equilibria; Endothermal Phase Transitions; Organic Molecular Plastic Crystals; Phase Transformation Thermodynamics; Propanediol Crystals; Solid-State Phase Transitions; Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026105160

These diverse properties account for the bewildering array of names under which this factor has been published (Table 2). Although the most common designation is leukemia inhibitory factor, this molecule can promote both suppression and stimulation of proliferation and/or differentiation depending on the leukemic cell line examined. In addition, LIF may serve as part of the body’s energy storage communication network. In this regard, some of the abnormalities that manifest in mammalian hosts with chronic illness include increased serum acute phase proteins and a wasting diathesis accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia; the latter is caused by suppression of lipoprotein lipase, the key enzyme of triglyceride metabolism. It is therefore of interest that LIF induces cachexia in mice, inhibits lipoprotein lipase, and stimulates hepatocyte release of acute phase proteins. In a different arena, the potent effects of LIF on embryonal stem cells suggest a critical role for this molecule in the earliest stages of embryogenesis. Finally, LIF also promotes remodeling of bone and functions as a neuronal differentiation factor. It remains unclear how one molecule can affect distinct organ systems without simultaneous side effects on its other target tissues, although recent data demonstrating that LIF exists both as a diffusible form and a form incorporated into the extracellular matrix (18) suggest that immobilization may serve to restrict its spheres of influence. In this review, we will discuss the multifaceted aspects of LIF functions and implications for understanding the cytokine network. © 1991 by The Endocrine Society.",,"interleukin 6; leukemia inhibitory factor; animal experiment; bone remodeling; controlled study; embryo development; hematopoiesis; human; leukemia; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; review; Animal; Bone Remodeling; Embryo and Fetal Development; Growth Inhibitors; Hematopoiesis; Human; Lymphokines; Nervous System; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026095995

The objectives of the present study were (1) to establish the temporal relationship between storage time (at 10 °C) and the postischemic recovery of function in the isolated rat heart, (2) to assess, by metabolic and functional measurements, whether storing the heart in fluid as opposed to moist air had any effect on the viability of the preparation, and (3) to ascertain the optimal storage temperature. Isolated rat hearts (at least 6 in each group) were infused for 3 minutes with St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution No.2 at 10°C, stored at 10°C for 6, 12, 18, or 24 hours, and then reperfused at 37°C. Mechanical function, assessed by construction of pressure-volume curves (balloon volumes: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 μl), was measured before ischemia and storage and after 60 minutes of reperfusion. Function deteriorated in a time-dependent manner; thus at a balloon volume of 60 μl the recovery of left ventricular developed pressure was 84.2% ± 5.3% after 6 hours (p = not significant when compared with preischemic control); 69.1% ± 3.3% after 12 hours (p < 0.05); 55.6% ± 4.4% after 18 hours (p < 0.05), and 53.0% ± 6.8% (p < 0.05) after 24 hours of storage. Other indices of cardiac function, together with creatine kinase leakage and high-energy phosphate content, supported these observations. Since the recovery of the left ventricular developed pressure balloon volume curves were essentially flat after 18 and 24 hours of storage, either 6 or 12 hours of storage were therefore used in subsequent studies. Comparison of storage environment (hearts either immersed in St. Thomas Hospital cardioplegic solution No. 2 or suspended in moist air at 10°C for 6 or 12 hours) revealed no significant differences in functional recovery between the groups. Thus hearts recovered 94.9% ± 3.5% and 113.7% ± 12.4%, respectively, after 6 hours of storage and 71.6% ± 2.4% and 54.2% ± 7.9%, respectively, after 12 hours of storage. Enzyme leakage and tissue water gain were also similar in both groups of hearts. Finally, hearts (n = 6 per group) were subjected to 12 hours' storage at 1.0°, 5.0°, 7.5°, 10.0°, 12.5°, 15.0°, and 20.0°C. At a balloon volume of 60 μl, the postischemic recovery of left ventricular developed pressure was 50.0% ± 9.3%, 60.5% ± 5.2%, 53.9% ± 3.3%, 55.7% ± 2.2%, 24.0% ± 4.4%, 21.6% ± 6.3%, and 4.8% ± 3.4%, respectively. These results suggest that the optimal temperature for extended storage is between 1.0° and 10.0°C and that edema formation was not exacerbated by storage in cardioplegic solution. We have selected 7.5°C as the optimal hypothermic temperature for use in further studies to assess myocardial preservation during extended storage.",,"animal experiment; article; heart muscle; heart transplantation; human tissue; nonhuman; preservation; priority journal; rat; tissue injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026093571

The ubiquitous distribution of proton-ATPases and their central role in energy conversion makes them indispensable components of cell metabolism.

The good energy resolution (ca. 0.5 eV) at the sulfur K edge and the strong dependence of XANES on the sulfur environment combine to give excellent sensitivity to changes in the electronic and structural environment of the sulfur. This has permitted identification and approximate quantitation of different classes of sulfur-containing compounds (e.g., sulfur, sulfides (including disulfides and polysulfides as a group), thiophenes, sulfoxides, sulfones, sulfinic acids, sulfonic acids, and sulfate) in a series of petroleums and petroleum source rocks. Our results indicate that the sulfur speciation of geological samples can be correlated with differences in source depositional environment, thermal maturity, and aromaticity. We report organosulfur compositions for the asphaltene, maltene, and liquid Chromatographie fractions of two sulfur-rich oils. In addition, we find that the organosulfur species in some, but not all, oils are subject to oxidation upon storage and thus may also be susceptible to oxidation in shallow reservoirs exposed to oxic waters.

Such a settlement requires considerable amounts of energy not only for conventional food production needs, such as water pumping and irrigation, but also for the production of fresh water and for modifying the harsh summer environment for human habitation as well as food production. A typical site for a desert settlement is often characterized by its long hot summers, its remoteness (away from any electric grid), and the presence of little or no fresh water suitable for humans or food production. In such areas, the only means of obtaining fresh water is through the desalination of sea or brackish waters using oil and natural gas. Such a dependence on an exhaustible resource is not only expensive, but also unwise, in the long run. The only permanent, inexhaustible source of energy available for desert areas is the sun. It is also the excessive solar radiation that is responsible for the often harsh and long summer season in such areas. The successful utilization of solar energy to supply the major part of the energy needs for electric and water production for such desert settlements could be a major contribution to its future energy security. The concept of the integrated food/water/power complex supported mainly by solar energy was developed and completed in 1985 in Kuwait. The complex consisted of a cogeneration solar thermal power plant serving as the primary source of energy for a desert settlement, by supplying its electric energy as well as the production of the fresh water needs, utilizing the reject waste heat from the power plant. The desert settlement also included both controlled environment agriculture as well as open agriculture, seasonal storage of desalinized water, and a satisfactory scheme for water conservation and safe disposal of water desalination brine by utilizing it to breed salt gradient solar ponds. The objective of this article is to report on the design concept, the hardware development, and operation of the solar agricultural desert settlement and its suitability for application in arid areas. © 1991 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Agriculture - Energy Resources; Solar Power Plants; Water Resources - Arid Regions; Cogeneration Solar Thermal Power Plants; Desert Settlements; Solar Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026082263

Belowground components were characterized by a larger biomass, ranging from 172±48 g m-2 at the end of summer to 569±211 g m-2 in late spring. The biomass of live aboveground tissue was usually higher than dead tissue, ranging from 51±21 g m-2 in winter to 116±36 g m-2 in summer. The overall mean root to shoot ratio was 4·8, ranging from 1·7 in the summer to 8·5 in late spring, reflecting storage and translocation events.

Appl. Physiol. 67: 2408-2419, 1989) demonstrated a relatively robust phenomenological relationship between resistance (R) and elastance (E) of lung tissue during external forcing. The relationship can be expressed as ω(R) = η(E), where ω = 2π times forcing frequency and η is hysteresivity; they found η to be remarkably invariant under a wide range of circumstances. From data gathered in previous experiments, we have tested the adequacy and utility of this phenomenological description for the chest wall (η(W)) and its major compartments, the rib cage (η(rc)), diaphragm-abdomen (η(d-a)), and belly wall (η(bw+)). For forcing frequencies and tidal volumes within the normal range of breathing, we found that η(W) remained in a relatively narrow range (0.27-0.37) and that neither η(w) nor the compartmental η's changed much with frequency or tidal volume. Compared with η(w), η(rc) tended to be slightly low, whereas η(d-a) tended to be slightly higher than η(w). However, at higher frequencies (> 1 Hz) all η's increased appreciably with frequency. During various static nonrespiratory maneuvers involving use of respiratory muscles, η(w) increased up to twofold. We conclude that in the normal ranges of breathing frequency and tidal volume 1) elastic and dissipative processes within the chest wall appear to be coupled, 2) η's of the various component parts of the chest wall are well matched, 3) respiratory muscle contraction increases the ratio of cyclic dissipative losses to energy storage, and 4) R of the relaxed chest wall can be estimated from E. One implication of these results is that hysteretic 'matching' of chest wall components enhances uniformity of regional displacement.","mechanics of breathing; pressure-volume hysteresis; respiratory impedance; respiratory muscles; structural damping","article; breathing muscle; human; human experiment; normal human; pressure volume curve; priority journal; thorax wall",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026082081

University of Wisconsin solution contains adenosine (5 mmol/L), which may maintain the concentration of myocardial adenine nucleotides. Cultures of human adult myocytes were grown from left ventricular biopsy specimens obtained from patients undergoing coronary bypass procedures. Cells (seven to nine dishes per group) were rinsed of culture medium and stored at 0 °C in University of Wisconsin solution. Cells were analyzed for adenine nucleotide content after 1, 6,12, and 24 hours of storage by high-performance liquid chromatography (units = nmol/μg DNA) and compared with control samples (0 hour).

During feeding, progressive insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia appear to promote storage of nutrients in maternal fat and serve to ″shunt″ nutrients to the fetus by slowing their uptake into maternal tissues, especially during late pregnancy. Between feedings, hormones liberated by the fetoplacental unit create an environment that progressively favors maternal fat catabolism as an energy substrate source, thus curbing maternal protein catabolism while keeping some carbohydrate available for the fetus. These normal changes have important implications for women with abnormal glucoregulation. Women with pre-gestational diabetes will need progressively greater insulin doses during gestation in order to maintain normoglycemia and, in the case of women with IDDM, to avoid ketosis. Women without known diabetes may develop glucose intolerance by late gestation if their pancreatic B cells are not capable of compensating for their inherent insulin resistance and/or the normal insulin resistance of pregnancy. Norbert Freinkel was a leader in the development of our current physiological understanding of these metabolic adaptations to pregnancy. That understanding has contributed greatly to the improved outcome of pregnancies complicated by maternal diabetes. A major challenge for present and future investigators will be to develop an understanding of those adaptations at the molecular and genetic levels so that we may have even greater impact on the well-being of diabetic women and their offspring.","Gestational diabetes; Glucoregulation; Insulin resistance; Pregnancy diabetes","carbohydrate; fat; insulin; catabolism; diet restriction; energy; feeding; female; fetus; glucose intolerance; glucose metabolism; human; hyperinsulinemia; insulin resistance; pancreas islet beta cell; physiology; pregnancy complication; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; priority journal; review; Blood Glucose; Female; Glucose; Human; Insulin Resistance; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Diabetics; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026072622

Estrous cycles can be interrupted by brief periods of food deprivation, by pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, or by increasing energy demands for thermoregulation. We predicted that manipulations that divert an excessive portion of the metabolic fuel supply into storage also should inhibit reproduction. Redirection of metabolic fuels from oxidation to storage was accomplished by treatment with protamine zinc insulin suspension (PZI). Syrian hamsters treated with PZI and fed ad libitum increased their food intake by ≃40% and body fat stores, but there was no effect on estrous cycles. When PZI-treated hamsters were limited to ≃110% of their preinjection food intake, they still fattened, and there was a significant inhibition of estrous cyclicity. Thus, in the absence of overeating, PZI-enhanced energy storage may lead to a shortage of oxidizable metabolic fuels with the result that reproduction is inhibited in favor of processes essential for survival (e.g., cellular maintenance, thermoregulation). It is unlikely that insulin-induced anestrus is due to actions of PZI unrelated to metabolic fuel partitioning, because the hormone had no effects on estrous cyclicity in ad libitum-fed hamsters. These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that nutritional infertility is due to the failure to maintain a minimum body fat content and raise the possibility that the infertility associated with some types of obesity could be due in part to a disorder of macronutrient partitioning.","Adipose tissue; Estrous cycle; Fuel partitioning; Obesity; Reproduction","isophane insulin; animal experiment; article; body fat; controlled study; estrus cycle; female; hamster; infertility; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026063731

Although control of glucose homeostasis implicates many hormonal, neural, and autoregulatory factors, insulin and glucagon, two secretory products of the islets, are the major determinants of this control. Insulin is secreted by the β-cells of the islets in response to nutrients to promote energy storage in target organs (liver, muscle, and adipose tissue); glucagon release by the a-cells is then inhibited. In the postabsorptive state, while insulin secretion falls, glucagon is stimulated and activates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis; this reciprocal change in the plasma insulin-glucagon concentration ratio will favor energy store consumption.

A thermal time constant, which is very important factor for this heat transfer model and influenced by a natural convection of charged gas, is experimentally investigated at constant gas volume after the rapid discharge of oil into the accumulator. A simple model for predicting thermal time constants based on the structure of bladder-type accumulators is proposed.

Step function, equilibrium labeling with [14C]palmitate was used to develop uptake and washout curves of radioactive fatty acid products contained in coronary effluent during either aerobic perfusion or reperfusion after ischemia (60% reduction in left anterior descending coronary flow for 30 minutes). Left anterior descending control flows were slightly overperfused in Aerobic hearts (18% higher than in Ischemic/Reflow hearts); otherwise, circumflex and right coronary flows, left ventricular pressure, and serum fatty acids and blood sugar levels were comparable between groups. As expected in Ischemic/Reflow hearts, recovery of regional systolic shortening and myocardial oxygen consumption in reperfusion was only modestly impaired (-20% and -19%, respectively, not significant and p&lt;0.011 compared with preischemic values, not significant from Aerobic hearts). The only significant metabolized product to be released from labeled fatty acid utilization in either group was 14CO2. A smaller fatty acid pool also was measured and accounted for by that contained in the coronary intravascular volume. We could determine no significant back diffusion of fatty acids from myocardium in either perfusion condition. Uptake time constants of the early phase of 14CO2 production also were virtually identical in both groups (19.9±3.2 versus 16.7±3.2 minutes in Aerobic and Ischemic/Reflow hearts, respectively) and strongly correlated with hemodynamics as described by heart rate. In washout studies, tissue radioactivity in the aqueous soluble and fatty acid pools declined in both study groups, and counts in complex lipids and cholesterol/cholesteryl esters remained steady, whereas those in triacylglycerols varied. Washout of 14CO2 in both groups never reached background radioactivity over a 40-minute sampling after cessation of isotope infusion into the perfusate, suggesting slow release of trapped substrate from intracellular pools, which then proceeded to fatty acid oxidation. In conclusion, these experiments have demonstrated very similar findings with respect to fatty acid uptake, storage, and release characteristics between aerobic and reperfused myocardium. We found no differences in preferred substrate utilization and oxidation as a result of reversible ischemia followed by reflow.","Coronary effluent; Fatty acids; Radioactivity; Reperfusion; Stunned myocardium","adult; animal experiment; article; carbon dioxide transport; controlled study; energy consumption; fatty acid blood level; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle reperfusion; nonhuman; priority journal; swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026055469

One strategy to solve this problem is to reduce the height (volume) of the storage cell. A water diffusion model for stratified Glauber salt is proposed which allows to calculate the maximum storage cell height allowing complete recrystallization. The crucial kinetic parameter of the model is the water diffusion coefficient in the hydrate layer. From DTA experiments its average value is found to be 5.1 · 10-8 cm2 sec-1. For a complete recrystallization within an unloading period of, e.g., 5 days the model predicts a maximum storage cell height of about 1.3 mm at a discharge temperature of 20°C. The admissable height increases with the square root of the unloading period.

Twelve dogs were subjected to brain death by interrupting cerebral blood flow (ligation of innominate artery, carotid arteries, and superior vena cava) and were followed up for as long as 6 hours. Each showed progressive hemodynamic deterioration, necessitating inotropic support (dopamine, calcium, and epinephrine) and large amounts of volume replacement (hetastarch; Hespan) to support the circulation (maintain mean arterial blood pressure greater than 60 mm Hg). Biopsy specimens were taken after 6 hours, or when irreversible ventricular fibrillation occurred, and were analyzed for adenosine triphosphate, creatine phosphate, glycogen, glutamate, and lactate. In six dogs the aorta was then clamped, and a 10-minute infusion of warm (37° C) substrate-enriched aspartate/glutamate blood cardioplegic solution (with the dog's own blood) was given by roller pump to simulate warm induction during the harvesting process.

Myocardial metabolism, expressed as percent of control values, during brain death was characterized by the following: (1) moderate energy depletion (adenosine triphosphate fell 25% ± 8%, creatine phosphate fell 55% ± 15%; p < 0.05 versus control: mean ± standard error of the mean); (2) substrate depletion (tissue glutamate fell 48% ± 9.5%, glycogen fell 66% ± 7.5%; p < 0.05 versus control: mean ± standard error of the mean); and (3) evidence of anaerobic metabolism (lactate increased 374% ± 95%; p < 0.05 versus control: mean ± standard error of the mean). Warm induction of blood cardioplegia in these energy- and substrate-depleted ischemic hearts showed (1) return of creatine phosphate levels to normal (113% ± 16.8%), (2) replenishment of glutamate (201% ± 24% of control; p < 0.05 versus control: mean ± standard error of the mean), and (3) 43% ± 14% reduction in myocardial lactate content; (p < 0.05 versus brain-dead animals). These data suggest that brain-dead donors requiring inotropic support sustain energy and substrate depletion and ischemic damage that can be reversed by a brief period of induction of cardioplegia with a warm substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic solution before harvesting. Warm substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic solution may increase the tolerance to subsequent ischemia during organ storage, provide potential expansion of the donor pool, or improve the potential function of hearts harvested from hemodynamically impaired donors.",,"article; cardioplegia; heart transplantation; hemodynamics; human; human tissue; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026014595

Part of this energy-dependent pool could be released by GTP in a polyethylene glycol-dependent manner. The kinetics of GTP-induced release of Ca2+ showed a biphasic pattern with an initial rapid phase followed by a sustained slower phase. In contrast, IP3-induced release of Ca2+ was completed within 30 s following addition of IP3. No reuptake of Ca2+ was observed following GTP- or IP3-induced release of Ca2+. The GTP effect was independent of IP3 and not inhibited by Ca2+, indicating that the IP3-operated Ca2+ channel is not involved in GTP-induced release of Ca2+. The size of the IP3-releasable pool was not affected by GTP, indicating that GTP, when added to permeabilized acinar cells, does not promote the coupling between IP3-insensitive and IP3-sensitive Ca2+ accumulating organelles. Thus, in permeabilized acinar cells, GTP and IP3 act on different Ca2+ sequestering pools. Interestingly, however, comparison of the size of the GTP-releasable pool with that of the IP3-releasable pool for the cell preparations used in the present study, revealed an inversed relationship, indicating that at the time of permeabilization the GTP-releasable pool can be coupled to a greater or lesser extent to the IP3-releasable pool. This suggests that, in the intact cell, a GTP-dependent mechanism may exist that controls the size of the IP3-releasable pool by coupling IP3-insensitive to IP3-sensitive organelles. Moreover, this suggests that the extent of coupling is preserved during permeabilization. © 1991.",,"calcium 45; calcium ion; guanosine triphosphate; inositol trisphosphate; macrogol; saponin; acinar cell; animal cell; article; calcium cell level; calcium transport; cell organelle; drug mechanism; kinetics; nonhuman; priority journal; rabbit; regulatory mechanism; storage; Animal; Calcium; Cell Membrane Permeability; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Guanosine Triphosphate; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate; Kinetics; Pancreas; Polyethylene Glycols; Rabbits; Rats; Saponins; Animalia; Oryctolagus cuniculus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025990085

They were then recirculated with human blood at 37°C for 2 hr for the evaluation of their viability. At the end of preservation, significantly higher levels of total adenine nucleotides (TAN) and energy charge (EC) were observed in the CHP group compared with the S1 and S2 groups. At 2 hr recirculation, the level of TAN was significantly higher in the CHP group than in the S1 and S2 groups. The EC level was also higher in the CHP group than in the S2 group. During recirculation, the ketone body ratio (acetoacetate/β-hydroxybutyrate) was higher in the CHP group than in the S2 group. The values in the CHP group were above 1.0 after 45 min recirculation. There were no significant differences in the pyruvate/lactate ratio and lactate level between the CHP and S1 groups. However, these values were significantly different from those in the S2 group.

Selecting the best cell disruption method depends on the factors listed in Table 6. The kind or type of cells is an important consideration. For example, some disruption methods which work well for animal tissue do not work at all for microorganisms. A guideline for the suitabiity of a given disruption method for some cell types is given in Table 7. The ratings in this table are not incontestable and, as mentioned earlier, combinations of methods can sometimes produce satisfactory results whereas one method alone fails. The disruptibility of cells can be influenced by their growth and storage history. For microorganisms, cells in log phase growth tend to produce thinner cell walls which are more easy to disrupt. This and other conditions which can influence microbial cell disruptiability are listed in Table 8. The cell disruption method selected will depend on its capability to process samples of a certain size or to be able to process multiple samples in a reasonable period of time. Other considerations are the availability, cost, and general utility of the disruption equipment. Thus, in a research environment the purchase of an expensive cell disrupter which processes a wide variety of cell types may be more easy to justify than a specialized disrupter. And if the long-term goal is to scale up, the choice of disruption methods narrow considerably. Indeed, several of the most successful laboratory cell disruption methods have no possibility of being scaled up. Despite possible scale-up difficulties, in the case of many bioactive recombinant products expressed at high levels in microorganisms, this concern may be irrelevant. Few of these products are likely to be manufactured in really large amounts and current laboratory scale or pilot plant scale production equipment may be entirely adequate. For instance, active human TNF (tissue necrosis factor) can be expressed in Pichia pastoris yeast at levels of 100 g/kg of yeast (dry weight). At this level of expression, only a few kilograms of r-DNA yeast needs be disrupted to meet the worldwide demand for this research material. Finally, the operating and energy requirements which affect the economics of the disruption process (batch versus continuous, disruption yield, cell fragment size, effect of added enzymes on downstream separation, etc.) are important considerations in the selection of production equipment.",,"dyes, reagents, indicators, markers and buffers; hydrolase; recombinant protein; animal; bacterium; cell fractionation; isolation and purification; methodology; plant; review; ultrasound; Animals; Bacteria; Cell Fractionation; Hydrolases; Indicators and Reagents; Plants; Recombinant Proteins; Ultrasonics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025983966

In response to a 24 h starvation period, both lean and obese rats showed an enhanced rate of [14C]triolein oxidation. There were, however, no changes in the rate of intestinal absorption of [14C]triolein between the lean and obese animals. Conversely, the total tissular [14C]lipid accumulation was significantly higher in white adipose tissue, carcass and plasma in the obese animals, whereas that of brown adipose tissue was lower. This was associated with a marked hyperinsulinaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia in the fa/fa animals. Starvation dramatically decreased [14C]lipid accumulation in white adipose tissue of the lean Zucker rats, but had no effect in the obese rats. The lipogenic rate of the obese rats was significantly higher than that of lean rats in liver, white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and carcass. Lipoprotein lipase activity (per g of tissue) was significantly lower in both white and brown adipose tissue of obese versus lean rats; however, total activity was higher in both tissues. Starvation significantly lowered perigenital-adipose-tissue lipoprotein lipase activity in the lean groups, and had no effect in the obese ones. These results demonstrate that the tissue capacity of exogenous lipid uptake is involved, but cannot be the only factor influencing the maintenance of obesity in these animals. Thus, in the adult fa/fa rat, the large increase in obesity is not solely dependent on a deviation of energy-producing substrate metabolism towards the storage of lipids in white fat. Other factors, such as a low rate of oxidation, a high lipogenic rate and decreased brown-adipose-tissue activity are involved in the perseverance of the obesity syndrome.",,"lipoprotein lipase; triolein; adipose tissue; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; lipid metabolism; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; rat; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025979229

The aim of this study was to develop and test a new and simple kidney perfusion model from slaughterhouse swine using a new 4.7-tesla/40-cm diameter system, with the intention behind to provide a human-like mammalian experimental kidney perfusion model, and to avoid sensitive in vivo animal experiments on higher-developed mammalians. 35 pig kidneys obtained 10-15 min post mortem were studied to evaluate and define conditions for optimum metabolic preservation with the following perfusion protocols: (1) immediate plegia with cold Collins solution, 1-3h cold storage, P-31 MRS; (2) immediate plegia, 1-3 h cold storage, blood reperfusion, P-31 MRS; (3) immediate blood reperfusion, plegia, 1-3 h cold storage, blood reperfusion, P-31 MRS; (4) immediate blood reperfusion, plegia, 24 h cold storage, blood reperfusion, P-31 MRS. Blood flow showed a weak correlation with β-ATP/inorganic phosphate in protocols 3 and 4 of r = 0.64. Repeated reperfusion and ischemia experiments of this model allowed the on-line observation of the metabolic response of the energy phosphate pattern for several hours. In conclusion, slaughterhouse-harvested swine kidneys lend themselves to a simple, low-cost in vitro perfusion model, provided they are reperfused with arterial blood immediately after harvesting. Together with P-31 MRS, this model might be suitable for a variety of experimental protocols, especially metabolic studies of new preservation solutions, and might decrease the need for animal sacrifice in medical kidney research.","kidney plegia; P-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy; swine kidney perfusion model","phosphorus 31; animal model; animal tissue; article; kidney perfusion; kidney preservation; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025970756

These studies established that eating a high carbohydrate diet before, and ingesting glucose during prolonged exercise delayed the onset of fatigue and enhanced performance, in part by preventing the development of hypoglycaemia. The next significant advance came with the introduction of the muscle biopsy needle which allowed muscle carbohydrate (glycogen) content to be measured for the first time. This technique focused attention on the role of muscle glycogen as possibly the more important factor explaining fatigue during prolonged exercise. Subsequent research inevitably focused on the identification of techniques that would either increase muscle glycogen storage before exercise or decrease the rate of muscle glycogen utilization during subsequent exercise, or both. Coincidentally, studies of fluid balance and of the control of gastric emptying during exercise suggested (a) that dehydration posed a serious health risk especially to marathon runners and (b) that dehydration could only be prevented during prolonged exercise if water alone was ingested. Thus the ‘state of the art’ knowledge in 1970 was that a high carbohydrate diet should be eaten before competition; that muscle glycogen depletion was the main cause of fatigue during prolonged exercise; and that water alone should be ingested in large volumes during exercise. The value of carbohydrate ingestion during exercise was systematically ignored despite the evidence from the classical studies of the 1920s. Fortunately commercial interests came to the rescue of exercise physiology in the mid‐1980s. Whereas water is without commercial value, carbohydrate added to the water and ingested by millions of athletes throughout the world has attractive commercial potential. Thus research funded and orchestrated largely by the commercial sector has established that adequate fluid delivery can be provided from drinks containing carbohydrate and that the ingestion of carbohydrate during prolonged exercise can prevent the onset of premature fatigue caused by liver glycogen depletion, hypoglycaemia and a low rate of carbohydrate oxidation. Thus the ‘state of the art’ knowledge in 1990 is that there is no proven value of ingesting water alone during prolonged exercise: that liver glycogen depletion is an important and preventable cause of fatigue during prolonged exercise: and that although muscle glycogen depletion is an important contributor, the real biochemical explanation for fatigue during prolonged exercise is still not clearly established. Nevertheless, there is clear evidence that the provision of exogenous carbohydrate at high rates is essential to delay fatigue and optimize performance during prolonged exercise. It has also become apparent that high rates of both carbohydrate and fluid delivery can be achieved by the adoption of appropriate drinking techniques during exercise.

Ten parenterally fed newborn infants with no respiratory problems received two 5-day isoenergetic and isonitrogenous regimens that differed in their nonprotein source of energy; the level of fat intake (low fat (LF) 1 gm·kg-1·day-1; high fat (HF) 3 mg·kg-1·day-1) varied inversely with that of glucose. Continuous transcutaneous PO2 (tcPO2) and PCO2 (tcPCO2), respiratory gas exchange (indirect calorimetry), and plasma arachidonate metabolites were measured at the end of each regimen. Oxygen consumption and resting energy expenditure were not affected by modification of the source of energy. However, carbon dioxide production (V̇CO2) was higher during LF than during HF (6.9±0.2 vs 6.2±0.1 ml·kg-1·min-1; p&lt;0.01), as was the respiratory quotient (1.08±0.02 vs 0.96±0.02; p&lt;0.001).

The lower tcPO2 during the HF regimen (73.8±2.8 vs 68.8±2.6 mm Hg; p&lt;0.015) indicated a disturbance at the alveolocapillary level induced by the lipid emulsion.

Measuring net radiation with a net radiometer on the lake appeared to be more accurate than measuring incoming radiation nearby and modeling outgoing radiation. Short-term agreement between the two evaporation measurements was obtained by using an energy storage term that was weighted to account for the area-of-influence of the eddy correlation sensors.

Measurements of E and Fc were obtained using a modified Bowen ratio/energy balance method. The factors influencing Fc were considered in the light of recent work by Farquhar and coworkers, while those affecting E were examined in the context of the McNaughton-Jarvis Ω parameter. The findings were as follows. 1. (1) Daytime E and Fc were generally lower in the younger stand, even though W was higher. These results were attributed mainly to lower leaf area index in the younger stand. 2. (2) In the older stand, Fc was significantly reduced by low soil water potential (Ψs within the range of soil water storages at which measurements were made, while canopy conductance was less dependent on Ψs. Following Farquhar and Sharkey, consideration of changes in estimated intercellular CO2 concentration at the canopy mean sink level (ci), indicated that reductions in Fc were nonstomatal in origin, i.e. due to reduced foliar photosynthetic capacity rather than reduced stomatal conductance. 3. (3) Evapotranspiration in the older stand was less related to net irradiance and more dependent on the atmospheric saturation deficit (D) than in the young stand, in accordance with the predictions of McNaughton and Jarvis. As W decreased, calculated values of Ω and of the Priestley and Taylor α parameter also declined, showing greater stomatal sensitivity at low Ψs. © 1991.",,"canopy; carbon dioxide flux; Douglas fir stand; evapotranspiration; root zone; soil water storage; summertime change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025954049

Seven lean subjects (mean 96.5% of ideal body weight) were studied in the postabsorptive state and also during mixed nutrient liquid feeding, eight obese subjects (mean 165% of ideal body weight) were studied in the post-absorptive state and six obese subjects (mean 174% of ideal body weight) were studied during feeding. Resting energy expenditure was higher in the obese subjects, but the thermic response to adrenaline, both in absolute and percentage terms, was similar in lean and obese subjects. Plasma adrenaline concentrations attained (3 nmol/l) were comparable in all groups and the infusion had no differential effects on the plasma insulin concentration. Before adrenaline infusion the plasma glucose flux was higher in the obese than in the lean subjects in the fed state only (45.8 ± 3.8 versus 36.6 ± 1.0 mmol/h, P<0.05); it increased to the same extent in both groups with the adrenaline infusion. Before the adrenaline infusion plasma palmitate flux was higher in the obese than in the lean subjects (by 51%, P<0.01, in the post-absorptive state and by 78%, P<0.05, in the fed state). However, there was no significant change during adrenaline infusion in the obese subjects (from 13.5 ± 1.00 to 15.0 ± 1.84 mmol/h, not significant, in the post-absorptive state and from 14.4 ± 2.13 to 15.7 ± 1.74 mmol/h, not significant, in the fed state), whereas there were increases in the lean subjects (from 8.93 ± 1.10 to 11.2 ± 1.19 mmol/h, P<0.05, in the post-absorptive state, and from 8.06 ± 1.19 to 9.86 ± 0.93 mmol/h, P<0.05, in the fed state). Before adrenaline infusion the palmitate oxidation rate was also higher in the obese than in the lean subjects (1.86 ± 0.14 versus 1.22 ± 0.09 mmol/h, P<0.01, in the post-absorptive state and 1.73 ± 0.25 versus 1.12 ± 0.12 mmol/h, P< 0.05, in the led state). However, in response to adrenaline the fractional oxidation rate (% of flux) increased less in the obese than in the lean subjects, especially in the post-absorptive state (from 13.8 ± 1.02 to 14.9 ± 1.39%, not significant, versus from 13.7 ± 0.98 to 19.3 ± 1.92%, P<0.05). These effects were independent of feeding. Leg glycerol release increased more in the lean subjects with adrenaline infusion, although increases in the plasma glycerol concentration did not differ between the groups. These results suggest that in obese subjects plasma inter-organ transport of fatty acids and the subsequent fractional oxidation responses favour storage of triacylglycerol. These factors may be important determinants for the development and maintenance of the obese state.","fat oxidation; fat storage; glycerol; limb exchange; stable-isotope tracers","adrenalin; adult; article; controlled study; fatty acid metabolism; female; glucose metabolism; human; human experiment; lean body weight; normal human; obesity; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025949414

The articular cartilage obtains the substrate and oxygen from the synovial fluid. Their concentrations within the cartilage diminish with increasing proximity to the basal layer at the bone-cartilage boundary. The gradients depend upon the cell density and the consumption by the cells. The gradient of the partial oxygen pressure (PO2) could provide the conditions for the Pasteur effect, which, however, has not yet been clearly observed. Metabolic reactions of chondrocytes to positive or negative glucose gradient have not hitherto been examined, and are the object of the present study. The oxygen consumption (QO2) in the articular cartilage of pig femoral heads was measured manometrically (Warburg technique) in the absence of glucose and in its presence in concentrations of 1.25 to 10.0 mM. There was a close correlation between the QO2 and the concentration and consumption of glucose having the nature of a glucose-induced respiratory suppression (Crabtree effect). The consumption of glucose, which did not rise in proportion to its concentration, did not exceed 15.7 μmol/gdw/h. The maximum lactate production of 20 to 23 μmol/gdw/h was attained at 5 mM glucose and showed no further increase at higher substrate concentrations. This stoichiometric 'lactate deficiency' means that the absorbed but not glycolyzed glucose is channeled into synthesizing and storage processes. In glucose-free incubation, despite aerobic conditions, lactate was utilized by the chondrocytes only at unphysiologically high concentrations &gt; 10 mM. Potassium cyanide reduced the QO2 by only 80-90% as a sign of the activity of non-mitochondrial oxidases. With monoiodoacetate (MIA), respiration fell dramatically during the 4 h of substrate-free incubation. It can be concluded from the results that, under physiological conditions, the glucose level in the synovia reduces the consumption of oxygen in the well-glucose-supplied upper layer of the articular cartilage, thus allowing an oxidative compensation of the diminishing glycolysis in the basal zone. The Crabtree effect, which is demonstrated for the first time in chondrocytes, thus seems to have the role of an essential regulatory mechanism in the basic metabolism of the cartilage.",,"animal model; animal tissue; article; articular cartilage; cartilage cell; cell metabolism; etiology; glycolysis; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; swine; Animal; Blood Glucose; Cartilage, Articular; Glycolysis; Lactates; Lactic Acid; Manometry; Oxygen Consumption; Swine; Synovial Fluid; Tissue Culture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025947255

In addition, we have observed photoperiod-induced changes in body weight gain in lean and obese Zucker rats. In this experiment, body mass, food intake, body composition, brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic state, and blood concentrations of corticosterone, insulin, and glucose were evaluated under one of two lighting conditions: a short (10 h light: 14 h dark) or a long (14 h light: 10 h dark) photoperiod. Plasma corticosterone and glucose concentrations measured under fasting conditions were unaffected by photoperiod in either genotype. The amount of BAT mitochondrial protein isolated was less in long photoperiod rats. BAT mitochondrial GDP binding was unaffected by photoperiod in the lean rats, but tended to be lower in long photoperiod obese rats than in short photoperiod obese rats. Although, photoperiod had no effect on daily food intake of rats exposed to the short versus long photoperiod, body mass was heaviest in obese rats raised in long photoperiod. Plasma insulin was increased in both lean and obese rats in long photoperiod. In addition, fat storage appeared to shift to internal depots in the lean rats exposed to long photoperiod. Our data demonstrate that photoperiod does have an effect on male Zucker rats with respect to body weight and fat distribution, with the obese rats being more sensitive to changes in photoperiod than the lean rats. Photoperiod modifies fat accumulation, food intake, body composition, and body weight gain in a variety of mammals. These effects are pronounced in rodents such as Syrian hamsters and voles, whose reproductive cycle is sensitive to photoperiod (1). Rats are generally not thought to be as sensitive to changes in photoperiod as are the more ""wild-type"" rodents even though rats breed more succesfully when placed in long photoperiod. Moreover, under some experimental conditions such as bulbectomy and pinealectomy, photoperiod responses are unmasked in rats (2,3). This study evaluated the effects of long versus short photoperiod on weight gain, body composition, and food intake as well as on several hormonal variables in Zucker lean and obese male rats. A pilot study from our laboratory indicated that pinealectomy increased weight gain without a change in food intake of lean but not obese Zucker rats. In addition, obese Zucker rats (fa/fa) lack the normal diurnal feeding pattern and periodicity in plasma corticosterone levels seen in most lean rats,(4), adrenalectomy restores the feeding patterns to those observed in lean rats, and corticosterone replacement restores the patterns to those of sham-operated obese rats (5). These observations suggest that photoperiod may have a greater effect on the lean than on the obese rat. The present study negates this hypothesis. © 1991.",,"corticosterone; glucose; insulin; corticosterone; guanosine diphosphate; insulin; adipose tissue; animal experiment; article; blood level; body weight; food intake; male; nonhuman; obesity; photoperiodicity; priority journal; rat; animal; blood; brown adipose tissue; caloric intake; glucose blood level; light; metabolism; mitochondrion; rat strain; weight gain; Animalia; Animal; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Brown Fat; Corticosterone; Energy Intake; Guanosine Diphosphate; Insulin; Light; Male; Mitochondria; Rats; Rats, Zucker; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025923567

The plasma destruction of wastes involves a relatively expensive energy source; therefore, the advantages and disadvantages must be weighed and summed to determine if plasma technology is appropriate. The consideration must include economics, destruction efficiency, recycling, and long range storage. For mixed wastes, plasma processing has the advantage of separating organics from heavy metals, oxides, and salts, as well as of producing a waste form with extremely low leachability in long term storage. Present processing technology uses combustion oxidation to reduce volume and cementation of the ash for storage. Future systems should be extended to recycling, which will reduce the volume to be processed, recycle useful materials, and reduce the amount needed to be stored. Plasma processing is particularly suited for this purpose.",,"Combustion; Hazardous Materials--Plasma Applications; Recycling; Waste Disposal--Plasma Applications; CombustioN Oxidation; Hazardous Mixed Waste; Plasma Destruction; Plasma Processing; Radioactive Wastes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025903189

The utilization of transportation nodes, such as parking orbits about Earth and the Moon, has long been known to maximize mission planning flexibility while minimizing program risks. This paper examines the utility of a special parking orbit transportation node, the cislunar libration point. Space Station Freedom is used as the low Earth orbit transportation node and the cislunar libration point is used as a way station for multiple-site exploration of the Moon. Performance results are compared to the Apollo-style lunar orbit rendezvous technique using missions to two specific sites as a baseline. A near-equatorial site on the west limb (Riccioli) and a high-latitude site near the south pole (Amundsen) were selected due to their extreme latitudes and their high degree of scientific interest. Trade study performance criteria include energy and trip time requirements, injection windows, lighting and abort constraints, on-orbit station-keeping requirements and initial mass in low Earth orbit. Use of the cislunar libration point provides mission planning flexibility when multiple site lunar exploration is desired due to the elimination of complex ascent and injection window constraints associated with some lunar orbit rendezvous strategies. In addition, the cislunar libration point is an ideal storage location for reusable lunar excursion vehicles, reducing the required mass in low Earth orbit when compared to the expendable lunar excursion vehicle approach.",,"Dynamics; Abstract Only; Cislunar Libration Points; Lunar Orbits; Moon Exploration; Orbit Dynamics; Rendezvous Techniques; Spacecraft",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025902798

Some of these HTSC are well enough understood that small conductors and coils may be fabricated for operation near 20K. Numerous physics, magnetic flux mechanics, materials processing and structural support issues remain for resolution before large scale coils made of HTSC can be operated at high energy storage density at temperatures well above 20K.

To date radiobiology experiments in this energy region have relied on characteristic X-rays (mainly Alk and Ck) from X-ray tubes. However, limitations in the photon intensity and the available energies from X-ray tube sources prevent a definitive characterization of the relationship between photon energy and biological damage. Synchrotron radiation has the potential to avoid these limitations, since it produces X-rays with high intensity over a continuous spectrum. We have established a synchrotron-based system for radiation biology studies using the ES-0 exposure station of the Center for X-ray Lithography at the University of Wisconsin Synchrotron Radiation Center storage ring, Aladdin.

Such mixed convection flows are frequently encountered in thermal energy storage problems in electonic systems and in room fires. However, not much work has been done to understand the basic fluid flow mechanisms of such flows, particularly the flow near the corner. In this study, a two-dimensional horizontal jet of heated air is discharged adjacent to the lower surface of an isothermal horizontal plate. An isothermal vertical plate is attached at the other end of the horizontal surface, making a right angle corner. The vertical penetration distance of the resulting downward flow is measured and is related to the inflow conditions, particularly, the temperature and velocity at the jet discharge. The penetration distance was also found to increase as the distance between the discharge location and the corner was reduced. Extensive velocity and temperature measurements were carried out over the flow region, particularly near the surfaces and the corner. These measurements indicate that the ceiling flow separates from the horizontal surface just before reaching the corner and then reattaches itself to the vertical wall at a finite distance vertically below the corner. The local surface heat flux measurements show a minimum in the heat transfer rate before the corner and a maximum just after the turn, indicating a recovery in the heat transfer rate at the corner. All these results confirm the existence of a small recirculation zone near the corner. The net mass flow entrainment into the ceiling jet was also measured and correlated with the jet discharge conditions.",,"Energy Storage; Fires; Flow of Fluids--Jets; Heat Transfer--Measurements; Mechanical Variables Measurement--Velocity; Buoyant Jets; Ceiling Jets; Flow Characteristics; Mixed Convection; Recirculation Zones; Heat Transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025893477

Although velocities up to 5.65 km/s have been obtained with “clean” plasma armature structures devoid of secondary arcs, performance on most shots is degraded to one degree or another by the formation of parasitic secondary arcs. These experimental results, however, have not been very reproducible, making controlled studies of these secondary arcs difficult. A new second generation railgun is now being constructed to improve straightness, stiffness, sealing, and diagnostic access. The basic design consists of a steel tube with a thin lengthwise slit forming two halves in cross section with bolt preloading. The internal structure consists of split tubular G-10 compression blocks with Glidcop AL-15 rails and polycarbonate insulators formed from 90 degree tube sections. Machining tolerance mismatch is adjusted with compliant layers as required. An adjustable diameter, helical diamond lap is used to produce a finished round bore of nominally 1 cm diameter in the assembled launcher and for bore refurbishment between shots. This approach is expected to provide well defined and reproducible bore initial conditions. A fully functional 12” long test barrel has been constructed allowing verification of assembly techniques, current feed connections, diagnostics, machining tolerance checks, and initial tests of high risk rail and insulator materials. A new 0.9 m launcher of the same design is now under construction, with a 3.6 m version to follow thereafter. An upgraded electrothermal injector has been developed using modified Armature Injection Module (AIM) hardware. Injection velocities of 2500 mls have been attained with 1.1 gram polycarbonate projectiles for stored bank energies of 65 kJ. Injection velocities of 3000 m/s may be possible. The paper will discuss the design details of the new railgun, injector, and diagnostics and present some initial experimental results. © 1991 IEEE",,"Ballistics - Projectiles; Electric Arcs; Energy Storage; Plasma Devices; Second-Generation Railguns; Electromagnetic Launchers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025889454

The conductors used to minimize resistive losses have an inherently low modulus of elasticity and are therefore useless as a structure. This generalization includes new “hyperconductors” such as high-purity aluminum in an aluminum-iron-cerium matrix. Although the aluminum material has high yield strength, the useful strength is limited by the strain induced in the pure aluminum filaments during magnetic loading. To maintain low resistivity at 20 K (boiling hydrogen), filament strain must not exceed 0.2%. All aluminum alloys at all temperatures have essentially the same elastic modulus, 70 GPa. The useful strength is thus limited to 140 MPa. Self-supporting transformers or inductors operating at this stress store only about 15 kJ/kg. Improving the specific energy requires adding a lightweight stiff structure. Boron or graphite might be used to make such a structure. We estimate that transformers or inductors can store energy at 50 to 100 kJ/kg using a boron structure and hyperconducting windings. In this paper we describe the scaling relationships for energy-storage transformers and how external structures improve specific energy. We compare transformer mass and efficiency to several transformer designs, each storing 5 MJ at I MA. © 1991 IEEE",,"Electric Conductors; Electric Inductors; Hyperconducting Aluminum; Electric Transformers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025889451

Creatine phosphate decreased by 85% (dog hearts) and by 93% (rat hearts) during the first hour of storage. The ATP and creatine phosphate values observed in rat hearts after 1 hour of procedure A preservation were significantly lower than in dog hearts (p<0.05). With procedure B, cardioplegic arrrest by itself did not alter high-energy phosphate concentrations in dog or rat hearts.

The reduction in glucose disposal in anorectics was primarily due to a significant (P &lt; .01) reduction in glucose storage, while glucose oxidation was normal. In obese women, both storage and oxidation of glucose were reduced compared with controls (P &lt; .01). Basal energy expenditure was similar in anorectic, obese, and control subjects (20.6 ± 1.00, 23.7 ± 0.56, 23.2 ± 1.36 cal/kg LBM · min, respectively).

This analysis examines the potential magnitude of C storage in biomass, emphasizing the amount of land area that could be planted to trees, the rates of C storage in developing forest plantations, and the fate of material harvested from forests. I conclude that while converting old-growth forests to plantations is a losing proposition, there may be sufficient formerly forested land and the possibility of sufficiently high rates of C storage in young tree plantations that reforestation could remove substantial quantities of C from the atmosphere (≥~1 Pg yr-1). However, rapid net C storage is a short-lived phenomenon, and it is unlikely that a substantial fraction of material harvested from plantations can go into long-term storage on land. Therefore, new tree plantations designed to store C can at best cause a brief delay in the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. Forest plantations designed to produce energy from biomass would represent a longer-term contribution to reducing rates of CO2 accumulation - as long as they replaced fossil fuel-derived energy.",,"carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; methane; nitrogen oxide; air quality control; climate; forest; nonhuman; review; tree",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025859194

The system performance of rock beds with large-sized storage materials that have comparably low friction loss is studied. A theoretical model of the heat transfer process within the rock bed is developed for large storage materials. In this model, the temperature within the materials is assumed to be distributed quadratically and symmetrically at their center. The relationship between the model parameter and the air flow rate was derived from experimental measurements for some large materials as well as the pressure drop through the bed.

A multisegment amplifier consists of two or more conventional disk amplifiers which share one or more common flash-lamp arrays. Each 'segment' amplifies one 'beamlet.' A 2 x 2 MSA can therefore amplify four beamlets. The shared flash-lamp arrays, lacking large reflectors, pump the disks more efficiently because of reduced lamp self-absorption. Furthermore, the reduction of reflector surface area per unit disk area reduces absorptive losses of pump light. The authors have constructed a 2 x 2 MSA with individual beamlet apertures of 24 cm. Each aperture contains five phosphate glass disks. This device is designed to be angularly double-passed by a 20-cm beam. Design details and rationale are presented. The energy transport performance of the amplifier was measured in both small- and large-signal regimes. A nominal small-signal gain of 11.8 was measured. The storage efficiency exceeded 3.5% at the nominal operating point. The amplifier was deployed as a booster for one beamline of the OMEGA laser system at the University of Rochester. In that configuration, 950 J of focusable energy was obtained from a single segment in a 800-ps pulse at 130-J drive.

Benefits and costs were compared on a levelized annual basis to indicate the general viability of system-specific SMES applications. A principal purpose was to provide information that could help increase utility interest in SMES and, thereby, assist the rapid development and deployment of the technology. This paper reviews eight SMES application scenarios and their estimated benefit/cost ratios under the operational conditions of specific utility systems. Most of the SMES scenarios show levelized benefit/cost ratios greater than unity. However, the value of a single benefit was seldom found to exceed the unit's levelized cost. This suggests, as a general principle, that the total value of multiple benefits should be considered to fully establish the cost effectiveness of SMES in many utility applications. These results should encourage utilities to conduct more detailed analyses of SMES benefits to identify the applications cost beneficial to individual systems.",,"Electric Power Systems - Energy Storage; Cost Benefit Study; Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage; Energy Storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025849435

Free-convective buoyancy movements of the water around the outside of this coiled pipe (immersed in the store) occur as a result of initially-cold water (at ∼ 20° C) being forced internally through the heat exchanger's pipe. For the most rapid rate of heat extraction, the axis of the heat exchanger coil should be oriented horizontally, and the heat exchanger's inlet arranged to be at the lowest level. Increasing the rate of water being passed through the heat exchanger's pipe resulted in a reduction of the heat exchanger's quality effectiveness, but a rise in the thermal store's recuperation effectiveness. The latter was due to the reduced level of mixing between the ascending warm streams and the descending colder streams. The development of the thermal boundary layer adjacent to the tank's wall was beneficial in deflecting the centrally descending stream of relatively colder water (which comes off the heat exchanger's pipe) to drive the ascending warmer water onto the heat exchanger, which is located near the surface of the water in the tank. © 1991.",,"Energy Storage; Flow of Fluids; Heat Exchangers - Heat Transfer; Heat Transfer - Mathematical Models; Hot Water Supply Systems - Heat Exchangers; Free Convection; Hot Water Store; Submerged Heat Exchangers; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025845964

Open air sun drying and smoke drying, which are traditional drying methods in these regions, lead to insufficient product quality. In order to be marketable, the produce meant for sale on the world market has to meet high quality standards. Otherwise the price will decline resulting in low profits for the exporting country and the producing farmer. To produce high quality products for the world market as well as to reduce losses, the development of suitable dryers for tropical regions is urgently needed. A multi-purpose solar tunnel dryer, orginally developed for the use in arid zones, was modified to enable operation under tropical weather conditions. This type of dryer consists of a small centrifugal blower, a collector and a tunnel drying chamber. To prevent penetration of water into the construction and subsequent flooding, the solar dryer was installed on a wooden substructure. To heat the drying air during cloudy and rainy days, particularly in the rainy season, a biomass furnace with heat exchanger was integrated into the solar drying system. The construction consists exclusively of materials available in Java. Only low energy requirements are necessary to run the blower. Results showed that compared to natural sun drying, the drying time of cocoa, coffee and coconut could be reduced up to 40%. Solar drying improves the quality of the products in terms of colour, flavour and appearance, reduces the risk of microorganism growth, prevents insect infestation and contamination by foreign matters and mycotoxins. The products dried with the solar drying system meet the national and ingternational market standards. Investigations further showed that even during the rainy season it was possible to dry the products to the final moisture content which is needed for storage and marketing. The modular system allows adaptation to different farm sizes as well as cooperative use. © 1991.",,"Food Products - Drying; Solar Energy - Applications; Cocoa Drying; Coffee Drying; Solar Drying; Solar Tunnel Dryer; Tropical Climates; Dryers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025844574

Such flows are frequently encountered in buoyancy driven transport in enclosed regions, such as those associated with thermal energy storage problems and enclosure fires. However, very little work has been done on the basic heat transfer mechanisms in such flows, particularly on the local heat flux distributions over the ceiling and the vertical wall near the corner. In this study, a two-dimensional horizontal jet of heated air is discharged adjacent to the underside of an isothermal horizontal plate whose other end is attached to an isothermal vertical plate, making a right angle corner with it. The distance between the jet discharge and the corner could be varied. Extensive heat flux measurements were carried out for different inflow conditions of the jet. The variation of the local heat transfer rate along the ceiling and the vertical wall shows a minimum followed by a recovery, as the flow turns at the corner. The average Nusselt numbers for the horizontal surface and the vertical walls are obtained as functions of the mixed convection parameter Gr/Re2 which is also known as the Richardson number Ri of the discharged ceiling jet. The total heat transfer rate to the isothermal ceiling and the vertical wall by the jet flow is also obtained. The study brings out several basic considerations in the thermal transport from a buoyant jet to the isothermal surface over which it flows, including the effects of opposing buoyancy for the vertical wall.",,"Air; Flow of Fluids--Jets; Plates; Buoyant Ceiling Jets; Heat Flux Distributions; Heat Transfer Rates; Inflow Conditions; Mixed Convection; Heat Transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025843217

The analysis considers additional spent fuel aging up to a maximum of 50 years relative to the currently planned 2010 repository startup. As part of the analysis, an equal energy deposition (EED) methodology was developed for determining allowable waste emplacement densities in a tuff geologic repository as a function of spent fuel age and exposure. The method yields virtually identical results to those obtained by a more indirect method referred to as the 'equivalent peak temperature rise concept' that has been used by the Yucca Mountain Project. This study demonstrates how this methodology can be used to design both the waste package and the waste emplacement layout to meet more than one thermal goal simultaneously. The analysis also demonstrated the feasibility of delivering an energy levelized mix of spent fuel to the repository each year either directly from the reactors or from a Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facility and the feasibility of representing the complex spent fuel mixture received by the repository by simply the average age and exposure. Results of this analysis indicate that substantial benefits of spent fuel aging will already have been achieved by a repository startup in 2010 (when the average spent fuel age will be 28 years). Even so, further significant aging benefits in terms of reduced emplacement areas and mining requirements and reduced number of waste containers, will continue to accrue if the repository startup is delayed for at least another 50 years, when the average spent fuel age would be 78 years.",,"Nuclear Reactors--Spent Fuels; Equal Energy Deposition Methodology; Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) Facility; Radwaste Emplacement Layout; Spent Fuel Aging; Yucca Mountain Geological Repository; Radioactive Wastes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025842480

First, it permits the sprinkler system to be part of a system that enhances cash flow. Second, the incremental extra cost of the thermal storage system is reduced since the storage tanks already had to be provided for the sprinkler system.

Nonetheless, the greenhouse effect is expected to be accompanied by changes not only in temperature and precipitation, but also in radiation, wind, humidity, and the snow/rain ratio (Ramanathan 1981; Washington and Meehl 1983; Manabe and Wetherald 1975; Manabe et al. 1981; Schlesinger 1984; Wilson and Mitchell 1987; Schlesinger and Mitchell 1987).

In order to evaluate all these impacts, traditionally used air-temperature-index-based snowmelt runoff models, such as used by Gleick (1989) and Lettenmaier and Gan (1990), cannot be used. This snowmelt runoff model has five major characteristics that together are structurally unique: 1) a two-layer snowmelt runoff algorithm is developed; 2) the variations in the snow albedo are determined as a function of the snow grain size and the impurities in snow composition; 3) the flux of water in the snow pack is determined by Darcy's law; 4) the snow metamorphism of the snowpack is determined; and 5) the model is structured to be readily used in the analysis of the effects of greenhouse warming on snowmelt runoff.",,"Energy Resources--Calculations; Greenhouse Effect; Meteorology--Climatology; Global Warming; Sierra Nevada; Snowmelt Runoff; Snow and Snowfall",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025842136

With these more realistic speed and cask-handling assumptions, the annual transportation capability of a fleet consisting of all of the existing casks is approximately 465 metric tons of uranium (MTU). The most likely fleet of existing casks that would be made available to the Department of Energy (DOE) consists of two rail, three overweight truck, and six legal weight truck casks. Under the same transportation assumptions, this cask fleet is capable of approximately transporting 270 MTU/year.

In order to have a concentrated form of energy, natural gas is liquefied and stored under a pressure slightly above atmospheric and at a corresponding temperature just above its normal boiling point (112 K). This investigation presents a general steady-state study of the heat transfers into such a storage tank. Two mathematical models are proposed in order to help improve the thermal design process for such a tank. It is concluded that the aspect ratio (i.e. height-to-radius) of such a tank for the minimum rate of heat gains should be approximately unity. This value differs from the economically most favourable aspect ratio, i.e. that leading to the least total financial expenditure over the lifetime of the tank. However, the two models allow a complete simulation of the thermal costs. As the unit cost of fuel rises relative to other costs (e.g. for the construction of the tank), the overall most economic tank design approaches that of the optimal thermal design of tank as deduced in this investigation. © 1991.",,"Economics; Mathematical Models; Tanks--Heat Transfer; Aspect Ratio; Heat Gains; LNG Storage Tank; Thermal Design; Natural Gas, Liquefied",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025838528

Obese individuals have an increased total EE compared with lean subjects; this increase is essentially due to an increased lean body mass concomitant with obesity, and is completely reverted after weight loss. Glucose-induced thermogenesis (GIT), measured during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, has been found to be decreased in obese individuals, although some discrepancy exists between studies. The observed decreases in GIT show a gradation, increasing progressively from obese patients with normal glucose tolerance to obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and an increased insulin response after OGTT to obese patients with NIDDM and a hypoinsulinemic response after OGTT. The defect in GIT appears to be related to impairment in nonoxidative glucose storage and with the degree of insulin resistance. Obese patients after weight loss show a further decrease in GIT after OGTT or during a euglycemic clamp, which remains unclear. Obese patients have an increased basal lipid oxidation and a decreased suppression of lipid oxidation after OGTT or during a euglycemic clamp. Glucose oxidation and storage are both markedly decreased during a euglycemic clamp. In contrast, the defect in glucose storage is less apparent after OGTT, due to the compensatory effect of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Infusion of triglycerides in lean nondiabetic individuals increases plasma free-fatty acid concentration and lipid oxidation and decreases insulin-mediated glucose oxidation and storage during a euglycemic clamp. Hyperglycemia under these conditions restored both glucose oxidation and storage to their initial values, Thus, an increase in lipid oxidation produces in lean individuals the metabolic alterations observed in obese patients.",,"glucose; triacylglycerol; adult; controlled study; energy metabolism; human; impaired glucose tolerance; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; review; Aging; Body Temperature Regulation; Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Glucose Tolerance Test; Human; Insulin Resistance; Obesity; Obesity in Diabetes; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025837249

There is a limited store of carbohydrate in the body but this is not the case with fat. The average lean man has about 15% of his body weight as fat, whereas the average lean women has about 25% of her body weight as fat. Male and female endurance athletes have only about 7-10% of their body weights as fat. Sedentary people consume diets which contain about 35-40% of their energy intake as fat. The recommended intake of fat in the diet of active and sedentary people is less than that percentage. Although there is a need to increase carbohydrate intake as part of the preparation for heavy training and competition there is no need to supplement the normal diet with additional fat. Fat is mobilized from adipose tissue in response to stimulation of an intracellular lipase by the catecholamines. The products of the hydrolysis of triglycerides, the storage form of fat, are fatty acids and glycerol. The ‘free’ fatty acids are transported to muscle in loose combination with plasma albumin where they are released and taken up and oxidized. Glycerol is not used directly as a substrate but undergoes gluconeogenesis in the liver. This process helps restock liver glycogen stores which, in turn, provides glucose as a fuel for the central nervous system and for muscle metabolism. Training increases the capacity of skeletal muscles to use fat as an energy source. An increase in fat metabolism during prolonged exercise has a glycogen sparing effect and as such improves endurance capacity. Fat cells increase their sensitivity to hormonal stimulation after training and, as a result, mobilization of fatty acid more closely matches utilization. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Body fat; Diet; Energy metabolism; Exercise; Fatty acids; Gluconeogenesis; Glycerol; Muscle","fat; fatty acid; glycerol; athlete; body fat; conference paper; diet; endurance; energy metabolism; gluconeogenesis; muscle metabolism; nutrition; sport; training; Adaptation, Physiological; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Female; Human; Male; Physical Endurance; Sports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025830045

The results show that the speed of phase transition strongly depends on the thermal conductivity and temperature gradient of the film, and that the speeds of melting and solidification vary greatly when deposited energy changes.

This analysis has been used to evaluate the performance of the energy storage systems that utilize direct contact heat transfer model between the cyclic fluid and the storage media in a closed loop latent heat thermal energy storage unit. This heat transfer model reduces the thermal resistance between the tank components and in turn increases the system performance. The main purpose of this paper is to provide clear physical insights to the second law analysis and present thermal design parameters that describe the optimal performance and operation of thermal energy storage systems.",,"Energy Storage; Heat Transfer; Thermodynamics; Cooling Thermal Energy Storage; Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025813979

Although hypothermia delayed the catabolism in dog myocardium it still remained very extensive. CrP dropped to virtually nil and ATP fell to below 15% of the total purines within 6 hours. The majority of the adenine nucleotides was broken down to adenosine (ADO; 32% of total purines) and inosine (INO; 21%). Apart from the delay (7 to 9-fold), hypothermia also reversed the ratio between ADO and INO when compared to normothermia, suggesting a profound effect of temperature on the nucleoside transporter. In human myocardium even after 12 hours of hypothermia ATP still contributed more than 60% to the total purines. Concomitantly, nucleoside formation proceeded slowly with almost no intermediate ADO. Under similar conditions, the catabolism of ATP in baboon myocardium occurred at a higher rate than in man but still far below canine metabolism. Irrespective of the relatively higher fall in ATP, ADP and AMP accumulated more in baboon myocardium indicating a limited dephosphorylation of the nucleotides. Only in the baboon myocardium did inosine monophosphate increase above the detection limits. In none of the species did purine catabolism proceed beyond hypoxanthine and even this could hardly be detected in the primates. It is concluded that considerable species differences do exist in the rate as well as in the pattern of nucleotide catabolism even during storage of the myocardium at low temperature.","baboons; dogs; donor heart storage; high-energy phosphate level; hypothermic preservation; man","endogenous compound; article; baboon; dog; heart muscle ischemia; heart preservation; heart transplantation; high energy phosphate; human; hypothermia; nonhuman; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025807612

A cycle life prediction has also been derived from the reliability equation and has been compared to a prediction generated for Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) hardware. The comparison clearly shows the superiority of NiH2 in LEO. At each DOD for which test data existed in the 5°C to 10°C range, the real time and accelerated LEO life cycle test data were best-fit to a Weibull distribution by a method that accounts for cells removed from test without a failure. The analysis was performed for the 40%, 60% and 80% DOD test conditions for NiH2, and at DOD's ranging from 15% to 50% for NiCd. The end result of the cell reliability analysis is a plot of cell probability of success (PS) versus cycle time. The PS graph may be converted to a graph of expected cycle life for the case of a battery, given number of cells per battery and a value for required battery reliability.

Resting metabolic rate (RMR) varied from 1,269 to 2,467 kcal/day in C and from 1,228 to 2,098 kcal/day in EtOH-Ci. RMR was significantly related to fat-free mass (FFM) in both groups, but EtOH-Ci decreased FFM and increased RMR when expressed per kilogram FFM (+33%). Glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and a decreased C-peptide-to-insulin ratio were observed in EtOH-Ci after a test meal. Concomitantly, nonoxidative glucose metabolism was reduced in association with normal increases in glucose oxidation. EtOH-Ci reduced insulin sensitivity (-59%) and maximal insulin-dependent glucose disposal (-40%) during a sequential two-step glucose clamp protocol (phase 1: 1 mU·kg body wt-1·min-1 insulin infusion rate + euglycemia; phase 2: 4 mU·kg body wt-1·min-1 insulin infusion rate + 165 mg/dl plasma glucose concentration). This was explained by reduced glucose storage (-99%, -51%) in association with normal responses in glucose oxidation rate, plasma lactate concentration, lipid oxidation rate, and rate of lipogenesis. Defective glucose storage was independent of reduced FFM. EtOH-Ci increased glucose-induced thermogenesis by 57%. We conclude that increased resting metabolic rate, enhanced thermogenesis, defective glucose storage, and normal glucose oxidation together result in increased energy needs and favor negative energy balance in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.","Glucose metabolism; Insulin resistance; Thermogenesis","alcohol; adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; energy expenditure; female; human; human tissue; insulin resistance; liver cirrhosis; male; priority journal; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025801154

The PCM, a LiF-20CaF2 salt, is contained in annular, metal canisters located in a heat receiver at the focus of a solar concentrator. This paper discusses PCM canister ground-based experiments and analytical heat transfer studies. The hardware, test procedures, and test results from these experiments are discussed. After more than 900 simulated Space Station Freedom orbital cycles, no canister cracks or leaks were observed and all data were successfully collected. The effect of 1-g test orientation on canister wall temperatures was generally small while void position was strongly dependent on test orientation and canister cooling. In one test orientation, alternating wall temperature data were measured that supports an earlier theory of oscillating vortex flow in the PCM melt. Analytical canister wall temperatures compared very favorably with experimental temperature data. This illustrates that ground-based canister thermal performance can be predicted well by analyses that employ straight-forward, engineering models of void behavior and liquid PCM free convection. Because of the accuracy of analytical models and the relative insensitivity of 1-g performance to test orientation, canister performance in micro-g should be predictable with a high degree of confidence by removing gravity effects from the analytical modeling.",,"Calcium Compounds; Heating--Heat Storage; Lithium Compounds; Solar Energy; Phase Change Materials; Space Station Freedom; Space Stations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025798622

It replaces the traditional silage harvest system composed of a forage harvester, two or three traveling wagons from field to the storage site and an unloading mechanism. Power requirements were measured at harvest with a forage harvester at 6.35 mm theoretical length of cut (TLC) and with a self-loading wagon at 20, 40 and 60 mm TLC, and at two moisture levels (70 and 80% on a west basis). The forage harvester (New Holland 782) required an average specific energy of 26.5 MJ/t DM at a real length of cut of 11.3 mm. The self-loading wagon (TAARUP 1030) required an average specific energy of 5.2 MJ/t DM. The real lengths of cut were 42.4, 70.4 and 93.3 mm. A multiple linear regression was performed on the data collected with the self-loading wagon. The equation explained 60% (R2 adjusted = 0.60) of power requirement variance at the power take-off. A global equation was developed to evaluate overall tractor power requirement. The overall power, including a safety factor of 25%, varied between 47 and 81 kW. When comparing the self-loading wagon with a forage harvester, it was observed that the self-loading wagon would not reduce the harvest tractor size but it would reduce fuel, labor, and the number of tractors required for the same harvest rate.",,"Agricultural Machinery - Energy Utilization; Agricultural Products - Processing; Machinery - Automation; Tractors - Testing; Forage; Power Requirements; Self-Loading Wagons; Agricultural Machinery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025798512

In this paper, the design, construction and start-up details of a commercial scale pond (400 m2), built for a publishing company in Albuquerque, New Mexico will be presented. A pond with trapezoidal cross section was designed so that shadowing could be minimized and also the ratio of surface area to the volume of the storage zone could be maximized. The publishing company required a minimum of 1 GJ/day (1MBTU/day). Generally it has been noted that in ponds with large volume a lesser percentage of retained energy is lost as edge losses. Based on the above consideration a pond size of 400 m2 and 5 m deep with a gel thickness of 60 cm and a mass flow rate (for the heat extraction loop) of 1 × 10-4 to 1 × 10-3 kg/m2·sec was determined to be the optimum size for the publishing company's needs. Two to seven percent salt water was used mainly to keep the gel bags floating on the surface. Tedlar bags were used to contain the gel. During the first year of operation, while the pond was still heating up, the pond obtained a temperature of 60°C and the gel showed no signs of degradation. © 1991.",,"Gels - Applications; Water Resources - Saline Water; Commercial Solar Gel Pond; Shadow Minimization; Trapezoidal Cross Section Pond; Solar Radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025796554

The protective nature of such species in regard to the durability of the alloy and the formation of supported-metal type species upon activation accounts for its excellent behaviour. The relative higher stability of LaNi5 over CaNi5 under cyclic operating conditions has been explained based on surface energy criteria of the constituent elements rather than the deterioration initiated by hydrogen and/or gaseous impurities alone.

These benefits are the result of reduced aerodynamic drag, a lower initial launch mass, and a significantly longer life for Solar Dynamic Systems compared to static power conversion systems such as PV (photovoltaic). The higher conversion efficiency of SD systems compared with PV systems results in much lower equivalent normal drag area which significantly decrease orbital decay rates (and costly reboost). In addition, PV systems store energy for use in the eclipse portion of the orbit in relatively heavy batteries which have limited life, from 3 to 5 years. SD systems utilize the thermal energy storage capabilities of a phase-change material which has an unlimited life. Thus, replacement costs are eliminated and life in orbit is extended. Although the viability of Solar Dynamic CBC (closed Brayton Cycle) systems has been established through detailed analyses, conceptual/preliminary designs and component/technology development programs, the demonstration of a complete power conversion system, including thermal energy storage, is yet to be accomplished. This paper presents a concept for a ground-based test program, utilizing an existing CBC engine built for NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and the DoE (Department of Energy) in 1976. Other components utilized in such a demonstration program would be fabricated from existing designs or design concepts such as those developed for the Space Station Freedom. In this manner, the costs associated with the continued development/demonstration of the CBC-based solar dynamic power conversion system would be minimized.",,"Electric Power Generation; Solar Energy; Thermodynamics--Brayton Cycle; Closed Brayton Cycle Systems; Solar Dynamic Systems; Spacecraft",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025796295

Even at the current technology limits of energy storage (100 KJ/Kg), superconducting magnetic energy storage inductors do not offer a strong advantage over state-of-the-art batteries. The commerical utility application does not have a weight and volume limitation, and is under intense study in several countries for diurnal cycle energy storage and high power delivery. The advent of high temperature superconductors has reduced one of the penalties of superconducting magnetic energy storage in that refrigeration and cryocontainers become greatly simplified. Still, structural and current density issues that limit the energy density and size of superconducting inductors do not change. Cold weather starting of aircraft engines is an application where these limitations are not as significant, and where current systems lack performance. The very cold environments make it difficult to achieve high power densities in state-of-the-art batteries and hydraulically activated starters.

For example, Jones (1990) found that, for those extremes of stress, both the increase in speaking fundamental frequency and the decrease in vocal jitter were statistically significant. Neither measure, however, was capable of distinguishing any intervening levels. Researchers continue searching for acoustic measures that might more precisely indicate ongoing changes in stress to establish a metric capable of more than simply differentiating between the two extremes. The objective is to distinguish among several levels of stress or to furnish a continuous, concurrent estimate of the talker's state. Two main components are considered for improving the estimation of a talker's actual stress level: 1) refinements in the acquisition of signals and their processing; and 2) proposals concerning the choice of acoustic parameters. The first objective is intended to maintain signal fidelity which should enhance the potential to detect changes in the speaker's voice. For acquisition of the acoustic signal, direct sampling and storing to a computer is highly recommended, thus eliminating the potential distortion that is inherent in tape recording. During the analog-to-digital conversion phase, the highest sample rates attainable in the face of storage limitations and the finer amplitude resolution provided by 16 bit converters should also be beneficial. Concerning the selection of acoustic parameters, in addition to speaking fundamental frequency and jitter, certain variations in the waveform (spectrum) might be exploited. The maximum rate of change in amplitude during a pitch period or the ratio of the energy in various segments of the spectrum, after each has been appropriately normalized, might not only indicate stress levels but also be independent of speaker variability.",,"Acoustic Waves--Spectrum Analysis; Biomechanics; Data storage, Digital; Human engineering--Psychophysiology; Signal processing--Digital techniques; Signal Fidelity; Stress Detection; Voice Jitter; Workload Estimation; Speech",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025793044

Gate-turn-off thyristors are used as the semiconductor switches. Total mass estimates, operating characteristics, and applicability to a space-based pulsed power system are discussed. Both designs store the commutation energy in capacitors. The commutation energy is then dissipated in resistors after switching has occurred. The capacitor mass is shown to dominate the total switch mass. Therefore, the mass of both switches is approximately equal. The advantages of the all solid-state switch include high reliability, no moving parts, proven design. and a high probability of future mass reduction with new semiconductor device developments. The all solid-state switch has a higher on-state power dissipation than the vacuum interrupter switch. We propose that the advantages of the all solid-state switch outweigh the disadvantage of higher power dissipation. © 1991 IEEE",,"Capacitors; Electric Switches, Semiconductor; Semiconductor Devices - Switching; Thyristors; GTO Thyristors; Opening Switches; Electric Transformers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025792917

The energy storage system switch must be capable of conducting a peak current in excess of two MA for as long as five seconds. It must then be capable of opening with microsecond precision timing, to synchronize current commutation with the operation of various electromechanical as well as electrical load components. A solid conductor, explosive operated switch design has been selected as most suitable for meeting these needs. Switch design incorporates both a normally closed contact for inductor charging and a normally open contact for safety abort as well as for routine energy management after each launch sequence. Both contacts are installed on the BPS switch bus as “stand alone” devices which may be used independantly or sequentially, depending upon experiment requirements. The combination is used as the primary system switch for inductor charging, current commutaton to various loads including other switches, and energy management.

Three alloy states are studied: as-cast, rehomogenised/water-quenched, rehomogenised/air-cooled. With binary leadcalcium alloys, three successive discontinuous transformations are observed, namely: an initial and complete discontinuous transformation with regular moving of the front of reaction; a second and incomplete discontinuous transformation (puzzle-shaped); a third and incomplete discontinuous transformation with precipitation of Pb3Ca. The role of secondary-lead impurities is complex: Ag reduces and Bi accelerates the rate of the discontinuous reaction, while Al refines the grain size. Leadcalciumtin are characterized by the Sn/Ca ratio. For very small values of this ratio, the hardening is similar to that of leadcalcium alloys. For high ratio values, the hardening takes place after an incubation period and proceeds via a continuous micro-precipitation of the (PbSn)3Ca Compound. For intermediate ratios, the different processes are able to operate separately in sequence. Ag increases the rate of the continuous precipitation and reduces the incubation time. No significant effects are observed with Bi or Al.

The Transfer Facility was intended to provide a receiving and transfer to storage capability at a relatively low throughput rate (approximately 500 MTU/yr) and to provide the recovery capability needed on the site in the event of a transport or storage cask seal failure during a period of about two years while the larger Spent Fuel Handling Building (SFHB) was being completed.

A flywheel is among the best energy’ density storage devices, The modified flywheel Will further improve upon the energy density and efficiency. Coupled to a pulse-duty generator, It could produce a near-square pulse or other desirable pulse shapes. The amount of energy, its rate, and its switching all could be controlled prior to electric energy conversion. The modified flywheel is structured with masses movable along radial paths. Potential energy is stored with respect to mass position and kinetic energy with respect to spin. This mass positioning provides a means to control the rate of energy discharge. Control with spring-loaded weight-the design presented here–would have near constant spin output. But a servomechanism scheme can provide the precise inward-moving positioning control of masses, and hence the other desirable output pulse conditioning. In the conventional flywheel, energy is always discharged in an exponential decay. In an EML system, a flywheel is the rotor of the pulse-duty generator, such as in the homopolar generator, compulsator, or the disk alternator. The flywheel could also be a separate component placed between the prime source and the pulse generator. The latter method is preferred because it provides much design flexibility and does not depend on the breakthrough of certain critical technology for the success of the EML concept. © 1991 IEEE",,"Electric Generators, DC; Flywheels; Pulse Generators; Servomechanisms; Compulsators; Homopolar Generators; Megajoule Storage; Pulse Conditioning; Electromagnetic Launchers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025786374

Whereas it predicts the development of diabetes, its effect on body weight change is unknown. We measured glucose disposal rates at submaximally- and maximally-stimulating insulin concentrations in 192 nondiabetic Pima Indians and followed their weight change over 3.5±1.8 y (mean±SD). Results: (a) Insulin-resistant subjects gained less weight than insulin-sensitive subjects (3.1 vs. 7.6 kg, P < 0.0001). (b) The percent weight change per year correlated with glucose disposal at submaximally- (r = 0.19, P < 0.01) and maximally-stimulating (r = 0.34, P < 0.0001) insulin concentrations independent of sex, age, initial weight, and 24-h energy expenditure; the correlations were stronger for glucose oxidation than for glucose storage, (c) Weight gain was associated with an increase in insulin resistance more than four times that predicted from the cross-sectional data. We conclude that insulin resistance is associated with a reduced risk of weight gain in nondiabetic Pima Indians.","Glucose oxidation; Insulin resistance; Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; Obesity; Weight gain","adult; article; female; glucose metabolism; human; insulin resistance; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Female; Glucose; Human; Indians, North American; Insulin Resistance; Male; Oxidation-Reduction; Survival Analysis; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025783337

The use of multiple MSMES systems can provide many new solutions to the problems facing the transmission networks of the United States today. On the distribution side, MSMES systems can be used as advanced power distribution centers that supply high-quality power to the customers while providing desirable load shapes to the power systems. In addition to these functions, a MSMES unit can also perform functions such as damping of power oscillation, stability and dynamic performance improvement and other recognized benefits of the conventional SMES system.

Four of these scenarios are hypothetical SMES applications in the Pacific Northwest, where relatively low energy costs impose a stringent test on the viability of the concept. The other four scenarios address SMES applications on high-voltage, direct-current (HVDC) transmission lines. While estimated SMES benefits are based on a previously reported methodology, this paper presents results of an improved cost-estimating approach that includes an assumed reduction in the cost of the power conditioning system (PCS) from approximately $160/kW to $80/kW. The revised approach results in all the SMES scenarios showing higher benefit/cost ratios than those reported earlier. However, in all but two cases, the value of any single benefit is still less than the unit's levelized cost. This suggests, as a general principle, that the total value of multiple benefits should always be considered if SMES is to appear cost effective in many utility applications. These results should offer utilities further encouragement to conduct more detailed analyses of SMES benefits in scenarios that apply to individual systems.",,"Electric Power Transmission, HVDC; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; Magnetic Devices--Energy Storage; Superconducting Magnets--Energy Storage; Benefit Cost Analysis; Pacific Northwest; Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) Systems; Superconducting Devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025759595

The initial program of experiments on the ENEL pilot unit is carried out at atmospheric pressure (AFBC) in order to check the plant performances both at steady state and under dynamic conditions before future operation at higher pressure (PFBC). A simulation model for the whole plant has been developed in order to gain a better understanding of the process phenomena, to assess operating procedures, to define admissible operation ranges, to study the control and automation system and to produce a real time simulator to be used for training and as a plant analyzer. The dynamic mathematical model for the description of the combustor was developed taking into account fluid-dynamics, drying, devolatization, combustion and attrition of the coal particles, mass storage, transport and exchange of the gas-components, homogeneous gas phase reactions, energy storage and exchange among coal particles, gases, solids and cooling surfaces, and free-board phenomena. Submodels for calcium oxide formation from limestone, sulphur dioxide removal, NOx generation and destruction are still under development. The structure of the model and the main interaction between submodels are shown in Fig. 1. The model is currently used for atmospheric pressure operation. However its governing equations are also valid under pressure, with a few correlations and parameters modified appropriately. The model of the other plant systems (feed-water, in-bed and wall heat exchangers, air and flue gas, etc.) are based on the modelling method already used for conventional power plant training simulators (Busi et al., 1989). This paper is aimed at: describing the system model, with the assumptions and the governing equations considered in each submodel; discussing the model application at steady state with reference to experimental results obtained on a pre-pilot fluidized bed combustor at CNR/IRC in Naples; validating the model under dynamic conditions using the results of transient tests carried out on the ENEL pilot facility in Livorno.",,"Computers--Applications; Control Systems--Applications; Fluid Dynamics; Heat Transfer; Mathematical Models; AFBC; Air Mass Flow Rate; Combustor Dynamic Model; Dynamic Simulation; Energy Storage; PFBC; Combustors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025759594

Drumstick shaped barriers are located to the north (Cumberland Island) and to the south (Amelia Island). The mean tidal range is 1.8 m and wave heights average 0.6 m. Southerly directed longshore sediment transport is dominant due to alongshore wave energy increasing to the southeast. Nearshore processes, sediment distribution patterns, and ebb-tidal delta morphology are all being measured and used to document temporal change in the physical and environmental parameters of St. Marys Inlet. This investigation is ongoing and part of a five-year monitoring program sponsored by the U.S. Navy. This paper discusses wave, bathymetric profiles, and sediment data sets collected during August 1988 and August 1989. Inshore wave conditions during April-October 1989 ranged between 0.27 and 1.76 m for significant wave height and between 4.3 and 14.2 seconds for wave period. Spatial changes in nearshore subbottom elevation were evaluated within six distinct morphologic features. Bathymetric contours of the nearshore zone to the -10 m contour indicates three large areas of sediment storage and two embayment areas where sediments are moved alongshore and offshore. The average mean grain size generally decreased along both islands within the beach and nearshore zones between the summer of 1988 and summer 1989. This change is attributed to several factors: storm activity, beach nourishment activity on Amelia Island, and alongshore sediment movement.",,"Flow of Water--Sediment Transport; Rivers--Estuaries; Tides--Effects; Bathymetric Profiles; Nearshore Wave Action; Offshore Barrier Island Inlets; Tidal Delta Complexes; Tidal Sediment Transport; Oceanography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025751145

The MED has 8 VTE of the falling film type, and it replaces the condenser in conventional absorption machines. Steam released at the generator pressure is supplied to the effect which matches its conditions, and the condensate follows its usual route towards the evaporator of an A/C unit. Thus, the MED is powered by the waste heat of the absorption machine which improves the overall gain and the thermodynamic characteristics significantly. Governing equations for the combined system are given and are numerically solved. Medium parabolic concentrators are used to power the system, and a transient simulation for the combined arrangement is presented. Results are given for a typical design summer day in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for a range of firing temperatures 150-190°C with a storage temperature amplitude of 10-20°C over a daily working period of 12 h. For a given cooling load of 100 ton refrigeration, the system can produce up to 40m3 of fresh water at a specific collector area of 12.41. H2O plus 0.03 TR/m2.

Acceptance and transport of spent fuel by DOE/OCRWM in 1988 will require an operating transportation system. Because this interim storage facility is not yet defined, development of an optimally compatible transportation system is not a certainty. In order to assure a transport capability for 1998 acceptance of spent fuel, it was decided that the OCRWM transportation program had to identify likely options for an interim storage facility, including identification of the components needed for compatibility between likely interim storage facility options and transportation. Primary attention was given to existing hardware, although conceptual designs were also considered. A systems-based probabilistic decision model was suggested by Sandia National Laboratories and accepted by DOE/OCRWM's transportation program.

Because the facility is designed for the storage of nuclear waste, special design considerations are necessary to ensure containment of potential radioactive releases. The main design considerations which influence the ventilation system are the requirements of separate air splits for mining and storage operations and of air filtering before atmospheric discharge in the event of a radioactive release. The leakage between the two air splits must always be from the mining area to the storage area. The transient effects of natural ventilation pressures, caused by seasonal and diurnal surface temperature changes, impact the ventilation characteristics throughout the facility.

Heavy duty opening and closing switches operated by small explosive charges (50 g or less) are essential to operation of the 60 MJ Balcones power supply. The six independent modules—a 10 MJ homopolar generator (HPG) and a 6μ H storage inductor—can be discharged sequentially, a valuable feature for shaping the current pulse delivered to loads such as high-energy railguns. Each delayed inductor must be isolated from the railgun circuit with a heavy duty closing switch capable of carrying megampere currents of millisecond duration. Similar closing switches are used to crowbar the railgun as the projectile approaches the muzzle: noise reduction, reduction of muzzle arc damage, and reduction of post-launch perturbation of projectile flight. The switches—both opening and closing-are characterized by microhm resistance in the closed state. Current is carried in metallic conductors. Metal-to-metal seams which carry current are maintained in uniform high pressure contact. Efficient. switching is crucial to efficient conversion: rotor kinetic energy to stored inductive energy with.~50% efficiency. stored inductive energy to projectile kinetic energy with ~30% efficiency. The switches must. operate with a precision and repeatability of 10–5 s, readily achievable with explosives. The opening switches must be structurally and thermally capable of carrying megampere currents for more than 100 ms (105 C) and develop 10 kV upon opening, stay open for 10–2 s, and safely and reliably dissipate megajoules of inductive energy in the event of a fault, a failure of the switch to operate or an attempt to commutate into an open circuit. An example of the severe switching duty: commutate 1.2 MA into a railgun already carrying 2 MA when the projectile is several meters into the gun and traveling several kilometers per second. © 1991 IEEE",,"Ballistics - Projectiles; Electromagnetic Launchers - Rail Guns; Energy Storage; Explosives - Applications; Megajoules; Megampere Currents; Pulsed Switches; Electric Switches",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025746156

Their solubility in common solvents renders them more processable and their good oxidative stability in comparison to doped, unsubstituted polyacetylene offer greater advantages for such applications. The optimization of the concentration and nature of dopants as well as their morphology for enhancement of electrical conductivity in these polymers is being currently investigated. Results show that there does not appear to be any trend relating ease of elimination with the conductivity of the final PPV. However, we found that water catalyses the elimination. Transmission IR spectra of the precursors revealed a significant quantity of water, evidenced by a broad band at around 3400 cm-1, in all PXT's except PXT acetate.

Dietary energy balance over 28 d with animals fed on equal amounts of a basal ration showed partial digestible energy values, calculated from the intake and faecal loss of energy, for the supplements which averaged 0 kJ/g SF and 10 kJ/g GG, so that GG contributed substantial amounts of absorbable energy. Despite this additional energy from GG, there was very often no additional gain of body fat. Rather, in some experiments, fat deposition was actually decreased by supplementation with GG. GG is inferred to have a putative thermogenic effect which is often greater than the energy it supplies. This effect occurred to a greater extent in circumstances associated with a higher ‘energy status ‘, indicated by higher efficiencies of conversion of gross dietary energy to retained body energy, higher fat:lean tissue deposition ratios and the occurrence of larger deposits at the epididymal fat pad site. There was some evidence that deposition at this site was more extensively affected by GG than deposition of fat in the body as a whole. Possible implications of the present findings are discussed. © 1991, The Nutrition Society.

The wall is usually composed of masonry or containers filled with water to provide sensible heat storage, i.e., storage resulting from the specific heat capacity of a material as it increases in temperature. An interesting alternative to the standard materials are phase-change materials (PCMs) which employ latent heat storage. Latent heat storage utilizes the energy associated with a change of state of a material such as the transition from a solid-to-liquid, or liquid-to-gas. The solid-to-liquid phase change is preferred for many applications because of the much smaller volume change resulting in this transition for a given amount of energy storage. This paper summarizes the results of a simulation study of the use of PCMs as a collector-storage wall. © 1991.",,"Buildings--Walls; Heat Storage--Materials; Heat Transfer--Walls; Mathematical Models--Applications; Collector-Storage Building Walls; Latent Heat Storage; Phase-Change Materials (PCMS); Thermal Storage Walls; Solar Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025726109

The storage medium consists of alkaline earth crystals doped with rare-earth elements. Thin crystalline films of these media deposited on disk substrates can store information in the form of trapped electrons. The information is written, read, and erased entirely by optical signals in this purely electronic process. Electrons are raised to a higher energy state by the absorption of visible light photons, filling available trap sites. An electron in the elevated energy state can be released from its trap site by imputing sufficient energy to the electron to permit it to escape from the well. When this occurs, the electron falls back to its ground state and emits a corresponding photon, indicating the existence of a binary '1' at the storage location site. Read and write data transfer rates are very high because the process in the ET media is electronic rather than thermal in nature. The writing sensitivity of ET is approximately 100 times better than other optical media. This implies that the data recording rate can be made 10 times higher while using only 1/10 of the optical power of the systems.

There is no dependence of the hydrogen storage capacity on composition as manganese is substituted for chromium. Increasing manganese substitution increases the extent of hysteresis but decreases the degree of the plateau slopes as well as the hydride stability. This is caused by the more sensitive change in the equilibrium pressures for hydride formation than for hydride decomposition in the two-phase region as the alloy composition x varies. It is suggested from the above results that the compositional dependence of the PCT relations of the Zr0.8Ti0.2(MnxCr1-x)FeH2 system originates from the difference in nature of the hysteresis behavior between ZrMn2-type and ZrCr2-type Laves phase alloy systems, since the hysteresis energies show a drastic change around x = 0.5. The difference in hysteresis nature is probably related to the difference in mechanical properties of the alloy itself, i.e. between ZrCr2-type and ZrMn2-type Laves phases. © 1991.",,"Hydrogen; Zirconium Titanium Chromium Iron Alloys - Thermodynamic Properties; Zirconium Titanium Manganese Iron Alloys - Thermodynamic Properties; Hydride Formation; Hydrogen Storage; Laves Phase Alloys; Intermetallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025722376

To simulate an ensemble of many trajectories requires a large amount of CPU time. Since each trajectory is independent, it is possible to parallel process a large set of trajectories instead of processing the trajectories by the conventional sequential approach. This enhances the vectorizability of the VENUS program, since the integration of Hamilton's equations of motion and the gradient evaluation, which comprise 97.8% of the CPU, can each be parallel processed. In this article, the vectorization and ensuing optimization of VENUS on the CRAY‐YMP and IBM‐3090 are presented in terms of both global strategies and technical details. A switching algorithm is designed to enhance the vector performance and to minimize the memory storage. A performance of 140 MFLOPS and a vector/scalar execution rate ratio of 10.6 are observed when this new version of VENUS is used to study the association of CH3 with the H(Ar)12 cluster on the CRAY‐YMP.

Both frequency- and time-domain behaviour are reviewed and it is pointed out that very high charge densities are being stored at low frequencies. The connection between LFD and electrochemical reactions is emphasized. The physical conditions under which LFD can be seen are discussed with particular emphasis on the distinction between interfacial and volume processes. Earlier interpretations of LFD-like phenomena in terms of Maxwell-Wagner processes and fractal geometry of contacts are briefly discussed and found to be insufficient to account for the observed facts. It is concluded that there is likely to be more than one physical or physico-chemical cause giving rise to the variety of LFD phenomena observed in nature but their common feature must be a frequency independent ratio of loss to polarization. We define an ""energy criterion"" which gives a physical basis for the interpretation of power-law responses and on this basis we propose a new electrochemical model of very general applicability giving the correct dynamic response and having the advantage of not requiring enormous electric fields to account for the very high charge storage observed.

Residual strengths were measured on coupons cut from the impacted square plates and evaluated in interlaminar shear (three-point bending) and compression. Both tests show that for all three material systems there exists an impact energy threshold above which the residual strength drops dramatically.

Since there is then no problem with fragmentation, the beam density of each neutral cluster can be measured in the presence of larger clusters. Although these measurements must be done in the test ions' onset regions where their yields are often quite small, the technique is made highly practicable by the large intensities of widely tunable vacuum-ultraviolet synchrotron light now available at electron storage rings.

Although a small amount of sporamin could be detected in leaves and petioles treated with 1% or lower concentrations of sucrose, the maximum level of induction required sucrose at a concentration of 3% or higher. The appearance of sporamin polypeptides in leaves and petioles treated with 3% sucrose followed a lag period of about one day, while a significant amount of sporamin mRNAs was already detectable in petioles after one day of treatment with sucrose. Addition of silver nitrate to the medium did not affect the accumulation of sporamin, suggesting that this induction is not due to the effect of ethylene induced by wounding of the tissue. The accumulation of sporamin could also be induced by glucose and by fructose, but not by man-nitol, suggesting that changes in carbohydrate and/or energy metabolism in the cell may be involved in the induction. Callus tissues obtained by treatment of leaf segments with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid did not accumulate sporamin even though these cells were cultured on agar medium that contained 3% sucrose. However, when callus tissues were allowed to grow after transfer to a medium that contained 6-benzylaminopurine and sucrose, accumulation of large amounts of sporamin was induced. These results suggest that, while expression of genes coding for sporamin can be induced in organs other than the tuberous root by a process that does not accompany the differentiation of tissue, the induction of expression of sporamin genes by sucrose requires that cells be competent in some specific, but as yet unidentified, way. © 1991 The Japanese Society of Plant Physiologists (JSPP).","Benzylaminopurine; Sink; Sporamin; Sucrose; Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002936968

The luminescence of YbFBr is also studied. In this compound energy migration to Sm2+ occurs. In BaFCl and BaFBr no Yb2+ luminescence is observed.

Preillumination with farred light induced the high fluorescence state (state 1) as determined by fluorescence emission spectra measured at 77K and preillumination with green light produced a low fluorescence state (state 2). Upon transition from state 1 to state 2, there was an almost parallel decrease of all of the fluorescence bands at 693, 705, and 750 nanometers and not the expected decrease of fluorescence of photosystem II and increase of fluorescence in photosystem I. The momentary level of room temperature fluorescence (fluorescence in the steady state, Fs), as well as the fluorescence levels corresponding to all closed (Fm) or all open (Fo) reaction-center states were measured following the kinetics of the transition between states 1 and 2. Calculation of the distribution of light 2 (540 nanometers) between the two photosystems was done assuming both the 'separate package' and 'spill-over' models. Unlike green plants, red algae, and cyanobacteria, the changes here of the light distribution were rather small in Macrocystis so that there was approximately an even distribution of the photosystem II light at 540 nanometers to photosystem I and photosystem II in both states 1 and 2. Photoacoustic measurements confirmed the conclusions reached as a result of fluorescence measurements, i.e. an almost equal distribution of light-2 quanta to both photosystems in each state. This conclusion was reached by analyzing the enhancement phenomenon by light 2 of the energy storage measured in far red light. The effect of light 1 in decreasing the energy storage measured in light 2 is also consistent with this conclusion. The photoacoustic experiments showed that there was a significant energy storage in light 1 which could be explained by cyclic electron transport around photosystem I. From a quantitative analysis of the enhancement effect of background light 2 (maximum enhancement of 1.4-1.5) it was shown that around 70% of light 1 was distributed to this cyclic photosystem I transport.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001528358

The mixing index is correlated with the flow parameters for three different inlet configurations.

The method is applied to Monte Carlo simulations of one-dimensional random rough surface scattering with a Gaussian roughness spectrum satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions. Convergence of the method is demonstrated by varying the number of sampling points. The percent error in conservation of energy is shown to be less than 0.007% for all the examples presented. The numerical solutions are compared with integral equation methods. The results from the finite element method are in perfect numerical agreement with the integral equation results for each surface realization if the periodic boundary condition is also used in the integral equation method. They are in excellent numerical agreement with a tapered wave solution of the integral equation for large surface lengths and upon averaging over many realizations. For the examples discussed, it is shown that the CPU time and memory storage requirements for the finite element method are much less than those of the integral equation method for cases when the number of horizontal sampling points is much larger than the number of vertical points in the region of discretization. Numerical results are presented for various rms surface heights, correlation lengths and surface lengths.

A formalism is developed within the scalar wave analog to calculate the change in the widths caused by a small perturbation, such as a distortion of the microdroplet shape from perfect sphericity. This formalism may be viewed as the generalization of the usual Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation scheme to the imaginary part of the energy. The results are checked against T-matrix calculations. In particular, it is proved that any perturbation can only increase the widths of theseresonances, provided that terms of O(1/Q0) can be ignored in the first-and second-order corrections, whereQ0 is the original quality factor of the resonance. The result can be interpreted in terms of a generalized golden rule and is relevant to similar problems involving quasi-normal modes in quantum mechanics.

Time-resolved photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves and kinetic energy release distributions (KERDs) were determined. The lowest appearance energies observed for both reactants at storage times of ∼1 ms are 10.6-10.7 eV and lie ∼0.2-0.3 eV above the calculated thresholds. The excess energy is ascribed partly to an ""ordinary"" kinetic shift and partly to an ""intrinsic"" one, the latter reflecting competition to dissociation by radiative relaxation in the IR. The KERDs are bimodal. At storage times of ∼100 μs, reflecting most probable microcanonical rate constants of kmp = 104 s-1, the dominant process for both isomers leads to a high KER and proceeds via a tight transition state. In m-iodotoluene, the low-KER component becomes dominant at kmp = 105 s-1.

This new intermediate, BSI, has a blue-shifted spectrum relative to the pigments as well as to their batho and lumi intermediates. At room temperature BSI is formed subsequent to batho and approaches an equilibrium with batho before decaying to the lumi intermediate. Chromophore modifications, which modify the j8-ionone ring, eliminate conjugation between the ring and the polyene chain, add bulky groups to the C4 position on the ring, or remove the 13-methyl group all yield time-resolved spectra which lead to the general scheme [equation omitted] The same mechanism is shown to be valid in isorhodopsin and in the native bovine pigment rhodopsin. Chromophore modifications described above affect the batho s=t BSI equilibrium as well as the kinetics of approach to equilibrium but have little effect on the spectra of the intermediates or on the rate of the BSI to lumi transition. Implications for the nature of the BSI intermediate are discussed. Though BSI has a spectrum blue-shifted from that of batho, BSI is higher in enthalpy. It is proposed that this apparent conflict may be due to the fact that the photon energy, initially stored in chromophore-protein interactions, is transmitted to the protein during the batho-to-BSI transition. If energy at the BSI stage is still stored in the chromophore, models simply relating energy storage to bathochromic shifts must be ruled out. © 1991, American Chemical Society.

The determination of H+/ATP stoichiometry utilized a kinetic approach where rates of H+ influx, estimated by three different methods, were compared to rates of ATP hydrolysis measured by the coupled enzyme assay under identical conditions. These methods for estimating H+ influx were based upon either determining the initial rate of alkalinization of the external medium from pH 6.13, measuring the rate of vesicle H+ leakage from a steady-state pH gradient after stopping the H+-ATPase or utilizing a mathematical model which describes the net transport of H+ at any given point in time. When the rate of H+ influx estimated by each of these methods was compared to the rate of ATP hydrolysis, a H+/ATP stoichiometry of about 1 was observed.
