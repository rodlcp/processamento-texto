The combination of the Generalized 2-D Correlation Analysis, 2-D Sample-Sample Correlation Analysis, and Factor Analysis using the MCR-ALS technique was applied to identify the reactive species. Transient surface sulfate species were formed under oxidative reaction conditions (lean mode) and decomposed under reducing reaction conditions (rich operation mode). The reduction of this species was identified to be the main contribution to the SO2 release observed under dynamic flow conditions. Pt facilitates the formation of sulfates but also catalyzes the reduction of the transient surface sulfate species leading to a higher amount of SO2 released under rich conditions. In the presence of water, this effect was diminished, which was found to be mainly a result of the suppressed formation of surface sulfate species caused by the faster transport of SO2 into the bulk phase of the SOx trapping component (BaCO3). Increasing the time under reducing conditions in the cycles leads to an enhanced reduction of the surface during rich conditions. The presence of water did not influence the bulk type species. It is proposed that for effective SO2 storage materials, strong SOx adsorption sites on the surface, the presence of water, and a short time under reducing conditions are essential. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Correlation methods; Reaction kinetics; Sulfur compounds; Surface reactions; Thermal cycling; Dynamic flow; Reactive species; Transient surfaces; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846392623

Driving forces are growing energy consumption in combination with unstable oil prices and environmental aspects. Since most gas reserves are located in remote areas low temperature liquefaction is necessary to make gas handling and storage feasible. This paper discusses welding of 9% nickel steel LNG storage tanks focusing on possibilities to increase productivity while maintaining a high and consistent weld quality. Conventional cylindrical storage tanks are on-site erected typically using SAW for horizontal welds and MMA-welding for vertical welds. New storage tank concepts are being considered with a view to permit more factory-oriented manufacturing processes. A new flux has been developed permitting increased SAW productivity while minimising the risk of hot cracking. Examples are given for single and two-wire SAW with different consumable combinations. An alternative option for vertical welds in cylindrical tanks and for positional fillet welding in new tank concepts is manual or mechanised GMAW. It is shown that solid wire GMAW using new advanced software controlled power sources can match MMA productivity and provides an excellent weld quality.","9% nickel steel; Consumables; GMAW; LNG; Productivity; Quality; SAW; Storage tanks","Computer software; Cylinders (containers); Energy utilization; Liquefaction of gases; Liquefied natural gas; Low temperature effects; Nickel; Petroleum refining; Productivity; Welding; Gas handling; Hot cracking; Nickel steel; Storage tanks; Steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845678106

In our study we investigate acidified pre-heated milk gels formation that are fairly often used to product yoghurts. The gel formation requires a tight control of the first step of micelles modification process and the kinetics reaction parameters. The most current rheological parameters used to achieve the monitoring are the storage G′ and the loss G″ shear moduli and the gelation time. The study of these parameters is commonly performed at very low frequencies (1 Hz). Our technique uses a 6 MHz AT-cut quartz crystal immersed in an acidified milk solution kept at a constant temperature. This method is singularly effective to ensure a complete and a reliable follow-up of the viscoelastic parameters of casein gels. A suitable new model enables a complete follow-up of the micelles evolution from the viscoelastic properties. The experimental results of the G′ and G″ moduli versus temperature and versus glucono-δ-lactone (GDL) added to milk are analyzed. In order to understand the micelles modifications, an analysis of the viscoelastic evolution try to explain the validity of the various models of micelles modification. In addition a new accurate kinetics characteristic time is proposed. This time corresponds to the moment for which the elastic effect of material becomes significant. From the kinetics study of casein gels at various temperatures, the Arrhenius relationship and a modified Flory-Stockmayer relationship give us access to the activation energy. By using the proposed technique and the suitable models developed, the structure thus quality of dairy products may be better controlled. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The SG process leads to an oxide macromolecular network through a sol (liquid phase) to gel transition. To optimize this process, the control of the kinetic of the chemical reaction is required. This kinetic can be deduced from the temporal evolution of the viscoelastic parameters. Upto date no complete investigation during the SG formation can be achieved by a unique non-destructive technique. In this paper, we present an ultrasonic technique to measure the viscoelastic parameters (storage G′ and loss G″ shear moduli) of the gel material during its formation. By using a suitable model which takes into account the mass loading on the surface, the viscoelastic parameters of these materials are accurately deduced. In order to study the efficiency of this technique, silica gels transition is monitored at various formation temperatures and for different initial hydrolysis molar ratio (h). In addition, the monitoring is performed at different oscillatory shear measurements in the 6-54 MHz frequency range to determine a new characteristic time tvs corresponding to the moment when the material is no more a newtonian liquid. This characteristic time is then compared to the gelation time tg determinated by rheological or acoustic audible range methods. Thus the new characteristic time is also a good criterion to characterize earlier the SG matrix transition. Our AT-cut quartz technique using our model can also be used as a high frequency rheometer for the sol-gel materials. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, phased array present a great adaptability to the inspection configuration and the application of suitable delay laws allows to optimize the detection and characterization performances by taking into account the component geometry, the material characteristics, and the aim of the inspection. In addition, the amount of potential information issued from the inspection is in general greatly enhanced. It is the case when the employed method involve sequences of shots (sectorial scanning, multiple depth focusing etc) or when signals received on the different channels are stored. At last, application of electronic commutation make possible higher acquisition rates. Accompanying these advantages, it is clear that an optimal use of such techniques require the application of simulation-based algorithms at the different stages of the inspection process: When designing the probe by optimizing number and characteristics of element; When conceiving the inspection method by selecting suitable sequences of shots, computing optimized delay laws and evaluating the performances of the control in terms of zone coverage or flaw detection capabilities; When analysing the results by applying simulation-helped visualization and data reconstruction algorithms. For many years the CEA (French Atomic Energy Commission) has been being greatly involved in the development of such phased arrays simulation-based tools.

The dc distribution system is suitable for dc output type distributed generations such as photovoltaic and fuel cells, and energy storages such as batteries and electric double layer capacitors. Power is distributed through dc distribution line and converted to required ac or dc voltage by converters placed near loads. The load side converters do not need transformers by choosing proper distributed dc voltage. The spread scheme of converters contributes to provide a high quality power supplying. Even if a short circuit occurs at one load side, it does not effect other loads. In this paper, we propose a configuration of DC micro-grid and control methods of converters for generations and energy storages. Computer simulation results demonstrated the seamless operation during turn-on and turn-off of a distributed generation, the transient of connecting and disconnecting operation with bulk power system, and the stability against a sudden large load variation.","dc distribution; Distributed generation; High quality power; Micro-grid","Dc distribution; Distributed generation; High quality power; Micro-grid; Capacitors; Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Photovoltaic cells; Electric power systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845548602

It was found that the nickel content in the alloys significantly affects the crystallization and the hydrogenation-desorption temperatures. With an increase of nickel content, the crystallization temperature increases, the hydride content is reduced and the desorption temperature decreases. The observations were successfully interpreted in terms of the formation enthalpy of a nickel monovacancy in the magnesium and nickel based alloys during heating.

High cost and high power consumption are the two major drawbacks of TCAM-based lookup engines. Adoption of IPv6 with increased address length will further exacerbate the challenges. In this article, we present a filter encoding method, called prefix inclusion coding (PIC) to improve the efficiency of TCAM-based lookup engines. Filters are stored in an encoded format to reduce storage requirement. Codeword assignment in PIC preserves the inclusion relationship among prefixes/ranges. By doing so, a prefix will be represented by a single codeword, and unnecessary filter replication can be avoided. Codeword lookup is equivalent to finding the longest matching prefix in the codeword table. Hence, a pure-TCAM lookup engine can be built without the needs of other semi-custom ASICs in the system. Our method can reduce the TCAM storage requirement by 70% to over 90%. The reduction in TCAM storage requirement also helps to alleviate the high power dissipation problem. The proposed method can be applied to both IPv4 and IPv6. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

At temperatures of the calorimetric glass transition, on decreasing the frequency from 10+1 to 10-3 Hz at a constant temperature, the storage modulus exhibits a striking drop, of an order of magnitude, which is similar to the change observed under continuous heating. The lowering of the storage modulus and the accompanying maximum in the loss modulus indicate a dynamic glass transition; the material behaves as a solid at high frequencies but as a liquid at low frequencies. The range of frequencies where the storage and loss moduli exhibit the characteristic behavior is much wider than expected from a simple Maxwell model of viscoelasticity. A parallel combination of Maxwell units is found to reproduce the observed trend, and is used to evaluate the characteristic rate constant.

The method is based on microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), which uses microwave energy to heat the extracting solvent and the sample. MAE allows the extraction process to be carried out at elevated temperatures and pressures, which dramatically reduces the time required to complete the process. A custom-made PTFE vessel was used for extraction investigations. TCE analysis was performed using gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD). Three different solvents were tested: methanol, 1 : 1 hexane : acetone mixture, and 10 : 1 hexane : acetone mixture. A comparison of TCE recoveries from clay samples using the new method and the standard methanol extraction method was carried out. The newly developed method and the method currently in use were found to recover similar amounts of TCE. The major advantage of the MAE technique is the very short time needed to obtain complete analyte recovery (6-10-min), which makes it possible to analyse a large number of samples without the need for sample preservation or prolonged storage. Thus, the new method is much more efficient than the existing methods. The technique has a good potential for field application. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Clay; Low-permeability media; Microwave-assisted extraction; Soil; Trichloroethylene; Volatile organic compounds","Acetone; Clay; Extraction; Microwaves; Mixtures; Volatile organic compounds; Low-permeability media; Microwave energy; Microwave-assisted extraction; Trichloroethylene; Polyethylenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751105245

T6G 2S2, Canada","The heart is capable of utilizing a variety of substrates to produce the necessary ATP for cardiac function. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has emerged as a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis and coordinates multiple catabolic and anabolic pathways in the heart. During times of acute metabolic stresses, cardiac AMPK activation seems to be primarily involved in increasing energy-generating pathways to maintain or restore intracellular ATP levels. In acute situations such as mild ischemia or short durations of severe ischemia, activation of cardiac AMPK appears to be necessary for cardiac myocyte function and survival by stimulating ATP generation via increased glycolysis and accelerated fatty acid oxidation. Whereas AMPK activation may be essential for adaptation of cardiac energy metabolism to acute and/or minor metabolic stresses, it is unknown whether AMPK activation becomes maladaptive in certain chronic disease states and/or extreme energetic stresses. However, alterations in cardiac AMPK activity are associated with a number of cardiovascular-related diseases such as pathological cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial ischemia, glycogen storage cardiomyopathy, and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, suggesting the possibility of a maladaptive role. Although the precise role AMPK plays in the diseased heart is still in question, it is clear that AMPK is a major regulator of cardiac energy metabolism. The consequences of alterations in AMPK activity and subsequent cardiac energy metabolism in the healthy and the diseased heart will be discussed.

In many situations, with limited floor space, it is unavoidable to have coils stored as multi-layer stacks. The potential energy associated with the coils at elevated positions poses a significant risk to the surrounding objects as well as plant personnel. Depending on the coil arresting mechanism, the stability of a coil stack is dependent on the friction between the coil and the chock, and the chock and the floor surface, as well as the initial spacing between the coils. The collapse of a coil stack can also be triggered by bore softening or tight-bore collapse of individual coils (particularly those on the bottom row), both of which are highly dependent on the tension policy applied during recoiling, specifically for thin gauge material. This paper presents an analysis of the various factors affecting coil stack stability. It is shown that the typical energy release of a 2-high stack collapse is in the order of a quarter of the potential energy of the elevated coil prior to the collapse. For movable chocks, the combined constraints of the floor friction and coil configuration provide only a relatively small window of safe operation. The integrity of the coil shape is also paramount to ensure coil stack stability. Also covered in this paper are the factors affecting the coil shape integrity, particularly in terms of soft collapse and tight-bore collapse.","Coil stack; Mathematical model; Safety issues; Stability; Steel coils","Accident prevention; Mathematical models; Personnel; Risk assessment; Winding; Coil stack stability; Coil stacks; Safety issues; Steel coils; Steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845439025

Increased requirements lead to the plan, to offer topping-up operation to the users. Topping-up means injection with open beamshutters. Based on a successful model for the estimation of the electron losses, we investigated the effect of topping-up injections in the experimental hall with FLUKA simulations. The BESSY experimental hall is divided in a free part and 16 small parts close to the front ends, that are not accessible to the users. The FLUKA simulations result, that if the electron losses during injection are limited to 10%, the annual dose in the accessible part of the experimental hall is below 1 mSv/a. Topping-Up means injection with closed undulator gaps too. Here we used FLUKA to calculate the energy dose in the Fe-Nd-B material of the BESSY undulators from the electron losses in the undulator vacuum chamber. These simulations also show, that it is necessary to limit the electron losses in the storage ring to 10% to avoid an unacceptable demagnetization within few years of operation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For simple differential operators (e.g. isotropic elasticity) these special solutions are known in their explicit form. Hence, the realization of the BEM is straight forward. For more complicated problems (e.g. anisotropic materials), we can only construct the fundamental solution numerically. This is normally done before the actual problem is tackled; the values of the fundamental solutions are stored in a table and all values needed later are interpolated from these entries. The drawbacks of this approach lie in the high amount of storage capacity, which is required, and in numerically errors due to interpolation especially near the singularity of the fundamental solution. Hence, an alternative BEM, the Fourier BEM, was proposed in Duddeck (2002) which is based on boundary integral equations (BIE) obtained via Fourier transform. It can be applied to all problems as long as the differential operator is linear and has constant coefficients. The first step to derive the Fourier transformed BIE consists in a rigorous mathematical formulation via distribution theory, which was developed by Schwartz (1950/51) at the end of the 1940s and which is still the mathematical basis for the treatment of partial differential equations, e.g. Hörmander (1990). In the context of BEM, this theory offers a straightforward approach towards the discussion of singularities normally encountered in the BIE. Distribution theory is able to handle all kind of singularities (jumps, weak, strong and hyper singular values) occurring in the BEM formulations and it is the adequate approach for the discussion of the corresponding integrations. In fact it can be shown by this approach, cf. Duddeck (2002), that all strong and hyper singular components are vanishing. In addition, the distribution theory enlarges the applicability of Fourier transform leading to alternative formulations for linear differential equa tions with constant coefficients. All differentiations are converted to multiplications; the differential operator becomes a simple algebraic expression, which can easily be inverted. This inverse differential operator is the Fourier transform of the fundamental solution. In the approach discussed here, this Fourier fundamental solution and not the fundamental solution itself is taken for the computation of all entries to the BEM-matrices. Based on Parsevals formula, which states the equivalence of energy expressions in the Fourier and the original space, alternative BIE can be derived in the Fourier space leading to the same entries for the matrices. Thus for the Fourier BEM, every term should be established in the Fourier space. Because a Galerkin approach leads to symmetric matrices and does not require a second integration in the Fourier BEM, this approach was preferred to the conventional collocation BEM. The trial and the test functions can be easily transformed to the Fourier space as long as they are defined on straight elements. Otherwise a numerical approach can be selected. In this paper, the method is applied to thin plate problems according to Kirchhoff's theory. The differential operator is of fourth order leading to highly singular integral equations. Although these singularities are quite complex, it can be shown easily that all strong and hyper singular terms are vanishing in both, the original and the Fourier transformed space. In the small example, all integrals were solved analytically, thus - in contrast to other publications, e.g. Maucher and Hartmann (1999) - no numerical errors, i.e. artificial oscillations, are occurring at the corners of a rectangular plate.

The objectives of this study were to determine throughfall, stemflow and rainfall interception in differently managed forest stands, and to relate the observed pattern of rainfall partitioning to stand structural characteristics. The study was conducted in a lower montane rainforest region (800-1140 m asl) in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Stands of four management types (natural forest, forest subject to small-diameter timber extraction, forest subject to selective logging of large-diameter timber, and cacao agroforest under trees remaining from the natural forest) were analyzed with three replicates per use type. The tree basal area decreased from the natural forest (52.5 m2 ha-1) to the agroforest (19.4 m2 ha-1) which was paralleled by a reduction in mean tree height (trees ≥ 10 cm dbh) from 21.3 to 17.5 m. The estimated leaf area index (LAI), as derived from hemispherical photos, averaged 6.2 m2 m-2 in the natural forest, 5.3 in forests with small timber extraction, 5.0 in forests with large timber extraction, and 5.3 in the agroforest. The annual gross precipitation close to our different study plots varied locally between 2437 and 3424 mm during the time of the study. Throughfall was measured on 15-17 rain days per plot with a median of 70% of gross precipitation over all the natural forest plots, 79 and 80% in forest with small and large timber extraction respectively, and 81% in the agroforest. Stemflow was less than 1% in all studied use types. Thus, rainfall interception was highest in the natural forest where 30% (median) of the gross precipitation was re-evaporated back into the atmosphere, and much lower in the three other use types (18-20%). Variability in structure and rainfall partitioning was high even within the same forest use types, thus further analysis focused on gradual changes rather than categories. In the 12 stands, LAI alone did not correlate significantly with the pattern of rainfall partitioning, the throughfall percentage increased significantly with decreasing tree height (r2 = 0.63). In a multiple linear regression with tree height and LAI as influencing factors, 81% of the variation in throughfall percentage is explained. A possible reason for this tree height-LAI-throughfall relationship is that under the conditions prevailing in our study region the canopy may not completely dry up between subsequent rainfall events. Therefore, the actual water storage at the start of a rainfall event would be below its potential. We hypothesize that tall trees increase the vertical distribution of foliage and other canopy components contributing to the canopy water storage, resulting in a higher canopy roughness and a more effective energy exchange with the atmosphere. This would consequently lead to an increased re-evaporation of intercepted water, larger available water storage and, thus, a reduced throughfall in stands with tall trees. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We present a detailed comparison of the results with the high-energy-resolution measurements reported recently from the Heidelberg heavy-ion Test Storage Ring by Schmidt et al. Many Rydberg series contribute significantly from this initial 3s23p M-shell ion, resulting in a complex recombination 'spectrum'. While there is much close agreement between theory and experiment, differences of typically 50% in the summed resonance strengths over 0.1-10 eV result in the experimentally based total Maxwellian recombination rate coefficient being a factor of 1.52-1.38 larger than theory over 104-105 K, which is a typical temperature range of peak abundance for Fe13+ in a photoionized plasma. Nevertheless, the present theoretical recombination rate coefficient is an order of magnitude larger than that used by modellers to date. This may help explain the discrepancy between the iron M-shell ionization balance predicted by photoionization modelling codes, such as ION and CLOUDY, and that deduced from the iron M-shell unresolved-transition-array absorption feature observed in the x-ray spectrum of many active galactic nuclei.

During interim storage or geological disposal of nuclear fuel, the activation products such as 36Cl may be released from the fuel to the geo/biosphere and contribute to the ""instant release fraction"" as they are likely to migra te in defects and grain boundaries. In order to differentiate diffusion mechanisms due to ""athermal"" processes during irradiation from thermally activated diffusion, both irradiation and thermal effects must be assessed. This work concerns the measurement of the thermal diffusion coefficient of chlorine in UO2. 37Cl was implanted at a 1013 at/cm2 fluence in depleted UO2 samples which were then annealed in the 900-1200°C temperature range and finally analyzed by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) to obtain 37Cl depth profiles. The migration process appears to be rather complex, involving mechanisms such as atomic, grain boundary, directed diffusion along preferential patterns as well as trapping into sinks before successive effusion. However, using a diffusion model based on general equation of transport, apparent diffusion coefficients could be calculated for 1000 and 1100°C and a mean activation energy of 4.3 eV is proposed. This value is one of the lowest values compared to those found in literature for other radionuclides pointing out a great ability of chlorine to migrate in UO2 at relatively low temperatures. In order to unequivocally determine the diffusion behaviour of both implanted and pristine chlorine before and after thermal annealing, the structural environment of chlorine in UO2 was examined using micro X-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) and micro X-ray absorption spectroscopy (micro-XAS). © by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag.","Activation product; Chlorine; Diffusion; Thermal; Uranium dioxide",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845244859

Experimental results demonstrate that, as well as a strong TL peak at 105 °C and a weak peak at 205 °C, another small peak appears at 150 °C. The TL peak at 150 °C exhibits dopant concentration quenching. The intensity of the two small peaks, particularly that at 150 °C, increases rapidly with the energy of the photons. However, increasing the doping concentration of Yb2 O3 reduces the intensity of both TL peaks at 105 and 205 °C, and reduces the Zr O2 content in the monoclinic phase. This finding indicates that the intensities of both TL peaks at 105 and 205 °C are associated with the Zr O2 content in the monoclinic phase. Additionally, the TL glow remains clearly observed from both undoped and doped samples after 48 h of storage. Doping Zr O2 with Yb2 O3 reduces the rate of fading of TL from the undoped Zr O2 sample. The stable TL peak of the Yb2 O3 dopant at 150 °C indicates its greater effectiveness than pure Zr O2 in dosimetry.

In addition, our results reveal that micrometeorological data (recorded with at least a bihourly frequency) are required to obtain reliable results from such a model. Net radiation accounted on average for around 95% of the non-advective fluxes and long wave radiation emitted accounted for around 70% of the non-advective losses. Evaporation was also a considerable component of the energy budget, accounting for about 20% of the total energy losses. In relation to advective heat fluxes, results from a water budget in Nueva lagoon have shown that groundwater discharge and irrigation surpluses contributed to the heat storage of Nueva lagoon, whereas the effect of heat advected via rainfall was negligible. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

Analytical surveys indicate that while aflatoxin has long been recognised as a significant problem, Fusarium mycotoxins are now understood to cause major economic losses in both temperate and tropical climates. It is also now clear that combinations of mycotoxins arising from blends of contaminated ingredients in finished feeds can cause toxicological synergism, which increases the severity of mycotoxicoses. This is particularly true for Fusarium mycotoxins, which result in conditions such as immunosuppression and increased production losses arising from disease challenge. When mycotoxins cannot be eliminated from raw materials due to adverse climatic conditions pre-harvest or due to poor storage facilities, therapeutic and preventative strategies can be employed to minimise production losses and to ensure safety and wholesomeness of foods of animal origin. Therapeutic strategies include nutrient fortification, which minimise mycotoxin-induced damage to target tissues such as liver and promote mycotoxin metabolism and excretion. Preventative strategies include the use of organic and inorganic mycotoxin adsorbents, which minimise intestinal absorption of mycotoxins and promote their faecal excretion. Studies of the feeding of combinations of Fusarium mycotoxins to starter pigs indicate that appetite suppression is the major cause of reduced growth. Such diets also result in reduced appetite when fed to sedentary horses. When metabolic energy requirements are increased, however, such appetite suppression is largely overcome. This has been observed in gestating sows and exercised horses. Laying hens also more readily consume Fusarium mycotoxin-contaminated grains compared to broiler chicks, turkeys and ducks. The behaviour of reduced feed intake serves as a natural mechanism to protect animals from the adverse effects of mycotoxins on metabolism. When such behavioural mechanisms are overridden, greater metabolic toxicity is seen. When mycotoxins cannot be eliminated in animal and poultry feeds, preventative strategies can be employed to maximise production efficiencies and to ensure food safety. © Wageningen Academic Publishers The Netherlands, 2006.","Coses; Horses; Mycotoxi; Poultry; Prevention; Swine",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895357385

Carbon is also involved in many physicochemical processes on all time scales. Biological processes have caused the accumulation of ancient organic carbon deposits in the form of oil, coal, peat, methane gas or gas hydrates over the millennia as well as massive deposits of inorganic carbon (e.g. limestones). The recent reactivation of these fossil fuel deposits for energy production by man over the very short time span of less than a century has led to the present sharp rise in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the atmosphere as shown in Figure 3.2.1.1. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is one component, amongst several, influencing the heat balance of Earth over long time scales. Changes in its concentration are generally associated with changes in Earth's climate. Therefore, much attention in recent years has been focussed on understanding variations in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. It has to be borne in mind, however, that other ""greenhouse"" gases are concomitantly released into the atmosphere enhancing the effect of CO2 (Prather et al. 2001). The most important ones are water vapour, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and tropospheric ozone (O3). They either originate directly from human activities, such as burning of plant biomass or release of methane from rice paddies and cattle, or their production is caused by changing environmental conditions, such as changes in the water cycle or emission of methane and dinitrogenoxide from suboxic areas on land and in the sea. The effect of these gases on the heat balance of Earth is amplified by changes in water vapour content in the atmosphere. Furthermore, aerosols may add or diminish the effects of ""greenhouse"" gases (Penner et al. 2001). Depending on the type of aerosol and its distribution, it can either reflect solar radiation back into space providing a cooling effect or it can absorb solar radiation and thus heat up certain strata of the atmosphere. Backscattering of solar radiation by clouds (cloud albedo) is a major feedback in the atmosphere to regulate the surface temperature of the Earth. At present, the heating effect of the ""greenhouse"" gases is thought to be compensated by the backscattering of solar radiation by clouds and aerosol particles. Recent estimates indicate that the heating impact of ""greenhouse"" gases may be reduced by 65%-80% due to albedo effects (Crutzen and Ramanathan, Dahlem Conference May 2003, in press). These authors argue that it is not likely that aerosols will increase at the same rate as CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and, hence, the heating effect may rise more rapidly in future. High CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, however, have also quite different effects on the environment. They increase photosynthesis in land plants, reduce the pH of water and can alter calcification processes. Experiments have shown that carbonate formation by marine organisms, including plankton, algae and corals, is inhibited at concentrations of ca. 800 ppm expected for the year 2100 (Kleypas et al. 1999, Riebesell et al. 2000). In fact, models predict a drastic reduction in carbonate formation (Figure 3.2.1.2) with unknown consequences for the marine ecosystem. It would endanger coral reefs, decrease their high biodiversity and may deteriorate the stabilisation by the reefs for coasts and tropical islands. It would also change the composition of plankton organisms in the open ocean with possible impacts on the production of fish. In addition to the above mentioned direct influences of rising CO2, indirect effects are suspected from climatic changes triggered by the increasing atmospheric concentrations. At present, rising global temperatures are being observed that are the result of the combined effects of ""greenhouse"" gases, water vapour, aerosols and clouds. These components are linked by various feedback processes, which enhance or compensate each other. Therefore, the understanding and modelling of such complex interacting systems is a major challenge for future research which requires to consider the linkages within the Earth system. Global average temperature increase predicted by different models range from 1.7 to 4.2°C with a mean of 2.8°C over the next 100 years. Sea level rises due to thermal expansion of sea water and melting of glaciers are predicted to amount to 0.48m (range 0.09-0.88m) over the same time span as a result of global warming. Such climatic changes will alter hydrological cycles, ocean stratification and current systems. The present knowledge of carbon flows and their effects on our climate is compiled most comprehensively in the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports (IPPC 2001). After a decade of basic research into the pivotal role of the element carbon in the Earth system, the international scientific community has now launched into a new effort to link the present understanding of the natural carbon cycle with the behaviour of human societies. This ""Global Carbon Project"" (GCP, see http://www. globalcarbonproject.org/) has defined the following central issues for the next decade of research: 1. Patterns and variability: What are the current geographical and temporal distributions of the major stores and fluxes in the global carbon cycle? 2. Processes and interactions: What are the control and feedback mechanisms . both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic . that determine the dynamics of the carbon cycle? 3. Management of the carbon cycle: What are the likely dynamics of the carbonclimate system into the future and what points of intervention and windows of opportunity exist for human societies to manage this system? The GCP is a joint project of the four global change programmes IGBP, WCRP, IHDP and DIVERSITAS. Its main function is to address the above questions by integration of knowledge and data obtained by other research programmes. It has the task to link natural and human sciences with the aim to better understand the carbon cycle and to assess mitigation and adaptation options for society. This article will firstly give a brief overview over the present understanding of the variability and of critical processes in respect to atmospheric carbon concentrations. In the following some of the research issues will be highlighted that were identified in several workshops as being of particular relevance to link natural and socio-economic sciences in respect to carbon research. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895303327

The ultimate purpose when designing a solar system is to maximise its economic benefits. This can be achieved either by maximising the life cycle savings of the system or by minimising its net solar energy price. The method suggested in this chapter employs an ANN to learn the correlation of some variable parameters and a GA is used subsequently to find the optimum solution. Two cases are presented in this chapter. In the first, the collector area and storage tank size are correlated with the auxiliary energy required and thus on the net solar energy price. Subsequently a GA is employed to estimate the optimum size of the two parameters, which minimise the net solar energy price. In the second, the variable parameters are the collector area, collector slope, mass flow rate through the collectors and volume of the storage tank. In this case, the genetic algorithm is used to estimate the optimum size of the variable parameters, which maximise life cycle savings. By following this procedure in both cases, the design time is reduced substantially. The system is initially modelled with TRNSYS computer program. An artificial neural network is trained using the results of a small number of TRNSYS simulations, to learn the correlation of the above variable parameters on the auxiliary energy required by the system from which either the net solar energy price or the life cycle savings can be estimated. As examples of the two variations of the method, the optimization of an industrial process heat (IPH) system and a large hot water system, both employing flatplate collectors are presented. The optimum solution obtained from the present methodology is achieved very quickly in both cases as compared to the time required to obtain the same solution by the traditional trial and error method, which would require thousands of runs of TRNSYS to cover all possible combinations considered by the genetic algorithm. Therefore, the present method greatly reduces the time required by design engineers to find the optimum characteristics of a solar system. © 2006 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The members of this class, which include foams, dense emulsions, pastes slurries, among others, display intriguing features in their low frequency shear rheology. In oscillatory shear, for example, their viscoelastic storage and loss moduli, G′ (ω) and G^^′( ω), are often weak power laws of shear frequency [1-7], while their nonlinear stress response to shear strain of constant rate γ̇ is often fit to the form = A + Bγ̇n (known as the Herschel-Bulkley equation, or when A = 0, the power-law fluid) [8-10]. The fact that such a broad family of soft materials exhibits similar rheological anomalies is suggestive of a common cause, and it has been argued that these anomalies are symptomatic of the generic presence in such materials of slow, glassy dynamics [11, 12]. Indeed, all the above materials share features of structural disorder and metastability: large energy barriers impede reorganization into states of lower free energy because this would require rearrangement of local structural units, such as the droplets in a dense emulsion (see Chapter 7). The term ""soft glassy materials"" (SGMs) has therefore been proposed to describe such materials [11, 12]. A prime manifestation of glassy dynamics is rheological ageing, where the elastic modulus increases as time goes by, while the loss modulus decreases. Effects of this type can be rather complicated, with the rate of ageing depending on stress [13]. Rheological ageing effects have seen intense experimental interest recently [13-18], stimulated (we may hope) at least in part by the theoretical developments that will be reviewed below. We will focus in this chapter on the ""soft glassy rheology"" (SGR) model which has been developed over the last few years to describe the rheology of soft glasses [11, 12, 19, 20]. As will be clear from the above introduction, this model was designed for what can be termed repulsive glasses, in which metastability arises because the particles (or droplets, etc.) that make up the material are too compressed to easily move past each other and rearrange. Gels, on the other hand, can be thought of as attractive glasses, where particles form tenuous networks but are held together by bonds that are sufficiently strong to again hinder rearrangements [21]. This aspect is not captured by the SGR model. The model also does not incorporate structural changes during ageing. This is appropriate for repulsive glasses: in a compressed assembly of colloidal particles, only very weak changes in the overall structure are expected while the material ages by local rearrangements which bring particles into energetically more favourable positions. For gels, on the other hand, structural changes during ageing are surely important, with characteristic lengthscales of network structures growing in time.Afinal deficiency of the SGM model is that it assumes local elastic properties to be essentially homogeneous, whereas in gels strong inhomogeneities must be expected. In spite of these shortcomings, the present chapter will describe the SGM model ""as is"", without modifications that could be contemplated to make it more appropriate for gels. It is hoped that the approach presented, which attempts to capture complex rheological phenomena using minimal models, will nevertheless prove useful. One key advantage of the SGR model is its simplicity, which allows for a full study of a broad range of non-trivial rheological effects including ageing. Confronting the resulting predictions with experiment for verification or falsification should help to stimulate the development of more sophisticated models, both for the ""traditional"" soft glasses and for gels. We begin in Section 2 by briefly introducing rheology and ageing. Then in Section 3 we review the SGR model and its recent generalization to a tensorial description of stress and strain, and review its rheological predictions under non-ageing conditions. Section 4 begins with a discussion of the origin of the SGR models glass transition and the nature of the glass phase, and then describes the predicted rheological ageing phenomena for conditions of controlled strain. The corresponding results for imposed stress are given in Section 5. We close in Section 6 by summarizing and discussing our results; a brief comparison with related rheological models that have recently been developed is also provided. © 2006 Springer.

Using proteins, new superconductors, ionic conductors, polymers or ferro-magnetic compounds, fundamental research is laying foundations for applications as varied as microelectronics, metallurgy, fine chemicals, the oil industry, energy storage, building materials, pulp, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Many of the materials pertinent to these fields have complex packing arrangements, such as partially disordered crystalline solids. The disorder can be static or dynamic in origin, one being occasionally the consequence of the other in the same structure.Various solids show some degree of disorder in their periodic arrangement and can be very different in nature, as for instance, ionic conductors and pharmaceuticals. An order-disorder transition initiating disordered vacancies in the former may lead to ion diffusion inside the crystalline solid, inducing high thermal vibrations of atoms in the lattice. In the latter, size and individualistic character of the molecules gives rise to two kinds of structural disorder due to intra- and inter-molecular atomic vibrations. The high frequency internal modes correspond to torsions and distortions inside the molecule, whereas the low frequency external modes describe oscillations of the global molecule and result in larger atomic displacement parameters. The intramolecular vibrations may perturb the long range order of the molecular arrangement. Nowadays, solving structures from single crystal data has become relatively routine using well-proven modern methods and software packages assisted by more and more powerful computers. Crystal structure determination from powders, a much more recent technique, is less straight-forward. Even so, the same basic principles are applied. The main drawback of this method is the projection of the three-dimensional reciprocal lattice onto a single axis (θ,d,q) which very often produces a severe overlap of the Bragg reflections. For that reason, it is highly advantageous to work with single crystals when they are available. Unfortunately, it is often difficult or not possible to grow single crystals of disordered molecules due to their intrinsically disorganized character. In order to overcome these difficulties when determining crystal structures from powders, methods have been developed recently to improve the usual procedures. Simulated crystallographic models can be built from molecular chemistry, local atomic arrangement and structure fragments. The resulting trial structures are calculated and compared to the diffraction data, and some atom parameters are changed in the direct space in order to find the best fit. Besides this, molecular dynamics, statistic genetic algorithms and simulated annealing help to predict the most probable crystallographic structure. The next step of the determination is classical refinements of Rietveld type. In the following parts, some definitions and principles concerning the crystalline state are given. Then methods for determining and refining a crystal structure are developed. Finally, some typical examples of structure determinations of partially disordered structures are presented. © 2006 Springer.

The use of solar radiation for cooling allows a time synchronization between solar offer and cooling demand since cold air is in general more necessary when the solar radiation is high, reducing this way the need of storage systems, which is one of the drawbacks of the use of solar energy for other application such as heating. There exist different procedures for cold production that have been tested using solar radiation as primary source. One of the most successful methods is by means of an absorption machine, which produces chilled water when hot water is injected into its generator. As the sun heats the water, this type of air conditioning systems reduces conventional energy consumption and therefore contributes to the maintenance of a non-polluted air. The plant includes buffer storage and an auxiliary energy system to be used in the case that the solar energy supply is not enough. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882474405

The combustion of these supposes an extra source of CO2 that the Planet earth is not capable of assimilating. An option to avoid the mixture of this gas in the atmosphere contributing to the greenhouse effect could be its storage in geologic suitable structures. On the other hand, the extraction of the methane (CH4) adsorbed by the coal acquires big interest due to the gradual disappearance of oil that transfers part of his leading role to natural gas. Also, the importance of extracting the methane contained in the coal layers is even major, since the liberation to the atmosphere of this gas in coal mines supposes an effect twenty-four times greater than the corresponding emission of CO2. Studies realized in advance show the ""Cuenca Carbonifera Asturiana"" as that of major contained methane zone where they will centre on the activities of the Thesis. First of all, there will be carried out a study of the coal from the ""Cuenca Central Asturiana"", in particular the area of Riosa-Olloniego. In the above mentioned study, we will try to determine more accurately the quantity of contained gases and their elementary and isotopic composition. There will be studied petrophysic characteristics of coals (maceral composition, reflectivity of the vitrinite, calorific top power (CTP), percentage of volatile,...). The above mentioned work needs the base of a previous study using the whole available bibliography. All the obtained information from this previous study, as well as from the analyses realized to the coal they will be included in a database in order to be able to realize threedimensional models of its geometry in depth, isovalues curves, information from wells, trial pits,... Later, once there has been demonstrated the possibility of extraction of methane from the coal layers, there will be analyzed the possibility of geologic storage of CO2 with recovery of methane in the above mentioned layers, Enhanced CoalBed Methane (ECBM); for it, an essential tool are the adsorption isotherms (% contained in gases / pressure). Finally, there will be valued the option of the geologic storage of CO2 in permeable deep formations, in particular, the Calizas de Montaña of the ""Cuenca Central Asturiana"", which constitute the base of the whole coalbearing basin of the zone. For it, there will be studied the similar industrialists of diverse international projects carried out.","Cantabrian Mountains; CO2 storage; Coalbed methane",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877949299

As stated in Chap. 1, both the presentation and management mainly depend on the pathophysiology involved. This chapter focuses on the main clinical presentations in neonates and children for those inborn errors of metabolism for which emergency treatment may be life saving and outlines the first steps of such treatment until the definite diagnosis is known. The subsequent management of patients is addressed in the specific chapters. In neonates, the main clinical presentations are as follows: 1. Neurological deterioration: This is the commonest presentation and most often caused by maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), branched-chain organic acidurias (BCOAs), and urea-cycle defects (UCDs). Treatment must be started immediately to avoid severe cerebral sequelae. 2. Liver failure: Galactosemia, hereditary fructose intolerance, and tyrosinemia type I are amenable to emergency treatment. 3. Hypoglycemia: Blood glucose levels must be corrected immediately. The three groups of disorders usually implicated are hyperinsulinism, glycogen storage disease (GSD), and mitochondrial -oxidation defects. 4. Cardiac failure: In neonates the only treatable disorders are fatty-acid-oxidation defects. 5. Primary hyperlactatemia: This is associated with a general lack of cellular energy and may be due to different enzymatic defects. Some patients may benefit from high dose vitamin treatment. 6. Intractable convulsions: Vitamin responsiveness (pyridoxine, pyridoxal phosphate, folinic acid, biotin) must be assessed systematically. In older children all these clinical situations can also arise. Any type of coma or acute psychiatric symptoms can, in particular, be the presenting sign of a metabolic disorder. In addition, children may present with recurrent attacks of unexplained dehydration, abdominal pain, muscle pain and myolysis, or peripheral neuropathy. Such situations require careful and urgent biochemical investigation. Emergency treatment should be started concurrently and subsequently modified accordingly. Good collaboration with the metabolic laboratory is indispensable. The results of all laboratory investigations relevant to the diagnosis of metabolic disorders for which specific emergency therapy exists should be available within 24 h.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866538993

They are most useful in disorders that give rise to toxicity or energy deficiency. The best functional test is elicited by nature itself during episodes that cause metabolic stress, including acute infection, inadvertent fasting, or consumption of a nutrient that induces a metabolic intolerance. If an inherited metabolic disease is suspected then blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid should be collected for the appropriate investigations (7 Chap. 1, . Table 1.3). If no material is available or if the results are ambiguous, a provocative test that challenges a metabolic pathway may provide clues for a diagnosis and indicate which specific enzymatic or genetic analysis should be undertaken. When performing a functional test, it is important to adhere to a strictly defined protocol in order to attain a maximum of interpretable diagnostic information and to minimize the risk of metabolic complications. Some of the tests described in this chapter are now used infrequently, since more simple direct assays of metabolites and DNA have reduced their diagnostic value. This applies to the galactose, fructose, or fat-loading tests. Other tests have fallen into total disuse and are not considered here.

The photoluminescence spectrum of the nanoclusters at 300 K consists of two bands at 2.9 and 2.1 eV. Temperature dependence of the high-energy band maximum deviates from the dependence of the energy bandgap of bulk CdS. The integrated PL intensity of this band decreases with increasing temperature up to 75 K, grows in a temperature range 150-230 K, and rapidly falls at temperatures higher 230 K. The experimental data have been explained within the framework of a model of recombination of carriers considering carrier transport between CdS nanoclusters.

During operation at normal speed, a flywheel has sufficient kinetic energy to produce high-energy missiles and excessive vibration of the coolant pump assembly if the flywheel should fail. It is thus important to evaluate the fracture properties of the material to ensure it can withstand the applied stress. The structural integrity of a large steel flywheel to be used in the primary cooling system of the OPAL research reactor at Lucas Heights was evaluated according to the requirements of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission guide RG 1.14. The guide was developed for nuclear power plants where significant over-speeds in pumps are possible. In the OPAL reactor at ANSTO such pump over-speeds are not possible, however, the code was used to demonstrate the incredibility of failure of the flywheel. An experimental program determined the fracture toughness and tensile properties of the flywheel material; thick section AS 3678 Grade 350 plate. Revision 4 of the well-validated British Energy R6 defect assessment procedure was used to analyse the critical speed and crack length for the flywheel using the two-component failure assessment diagram which considers brittle fracture and plastic collapse.

Visualization was conducted by ellipsometric microscopy. The growth of the dewetting is determined not only by the well-known instability of films on a flat solid surface but also by the disjoining pressure and surface topography of a disk even if it has sub-nanometer roughness. The dewetting film formed small droplets, which were not along the surface topography of the substrate, when the disjoining pressure is negative. On the other hand, it formed grooves along the surface topography with a sub-nanometer roughness when the disjoining pressure is positive. Moreover, the sub-nanometer roughness initiated the dewetting of the metastable liquid thin films. These results are useful for clarifying the mechanism of dewetting of nanometer thick lubricant film on a solid surface, which is important for the design of the head disk interface of hard-disk drives. © 2007 by Allerton Press, Inc.",,"Hard disk storage; Interfacial energy; Lubricants; Metastable phases; Surface roughness; Thin films; Wetting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547572400

Most tissues are involved in fatty acid metabolism, but three are quantitatively more important than others: adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. Each of these tissues has a store of triacylglycerol that can be hydrolysed (mobilized) in a regulated way to release fatty acids. In the case of adipose tissue, these fatty acids may be released into the circulation for delivery to other tissues, whereas in muscle they are a substrate for oxidation and in liver they are a substrate for re-esterification within the endoplasmic reticulum to make triacylglycerol that will be secreted as very-low-density lipoprotein. These pathways are regulated, most clearly in the case of adipose tissue. Adipose tissue fat storage is stimulated, and fat mobilization suppressed, by insulin, leading to a drive to store energy in the fed state. Muscle fatty acid metabolism is more sensitive to physical activity, during which fatty acid utilization from extracellular and intracellular sources may increase enormously. The uptake of fat by the liver seems to depend mainly upon delivery in the plasma, but the secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein triacylglycerol is suppressed by insulin. There is clearly cooperation amongst the tissues, so that, for instance, adipose tissue fat mobilization increases to meet the demands of skeletal muscle during exercise. When triacylglycerol accumulates excessively in skeletal muscle and liver, sometimes called ectopic fat deposition, then the condition of insulin resistance arises. This may reflect a lack of exercise and an excess of fat intake. © 2006 The Authors.",,"Mammalia; fatty acid; lipoprotein lipase; triacylglycerol; adipose tissue; biological model; exercise; general aspects of disease; human; liver; metabolism; physiology; review; skeletal muscle; Adipose Tissue; Disease; Exercise; Fatty Acids; Humans; Lipoprotein Lipase; Liver; Models, Biological; Muscle, Skeletal; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250616386

Electric energy from a solar simulator panel adjusted to simulate heat trapped from natural solar energy was used. Exposure of the various developmental stages of C. maculatus infesting adzuki bean seed to heat for 45 min and more raised the temperature between and within the seeds well in excess of the lethal level (> 60 °C) and resulted in complete control. Heating at 60°C of up to 3 cm adzuki bean seed (seven to eight seed layers) took about 1 h and resulted in complete control of the pest. This would enable this heater to treat large amounts of seed at a time compared with solar heaters demonstrated so far in which only a single layer of seed can be treated. Therefore, solar heating of infested adzuki bean seeds using the aforementioned box heater around noon, for 1 h, gives effective control of C. maculatus. Results of the effect of heat treatment on seed viability and moisture content showed that adzuki bean seed germination is affected by heating; hence seed meant for planting should not be heat treated to control storage insect pests.

The main aim is to verify experimentally which type of expansion valve would be preferable from energy point of view when a classical thermostat or a fuzzy logic algorithm are used as the control system for the refrigeration capacity. The fuzzy logic-based control is able to modulate continuously the compressor speed through an inverter. The results show that with a fuzzy algorithm, the thermostatic expansion valve allows an energy saving of about 8% in comparison with the electronic valve.

Cartilage from the main weight-bearing zone of the medial condyle of 38 fresh sheep knees was used. Of these, 20 condyles had an intact cartilage, while defects (14 grade I and 4 grade II) were found in the rest. The mechanical hardness was determined as Shore A. Cartilage specimens of approximately 5 mg were analyzed in special devices for moisture measurement and then continuously heated up to 105°C. The actual measurement was performed in an electric cell (coulometry). An electrode was laminated with hygroscopic phosphorus pentoxide. In the electrochemical reaction, H and O are liberated from the electrode. The requirement for electric energy correlates with the amount of water in the specimen. The water content in intact cartilage was 66.9%. Grade I (72.6%) and grade II (77.8%) defects had significantly higher water content. Significantly higher and faster spontaneous evaporation was observed in cartilage defects at room temperature. The water content and spontaneous water evaporation correlated with significantly lower mechanical hardness. The experimental design (combined method of thermogravimetry, Karl Fischer titration, and coulometry) was sufficient for evaluating the water content in small cartilage specimens. It is also possible to measure the temperature-dependent water liberation from cartilage specimens. © 2006 by Walter de Gruyter.","Cartilage; Coulometry; Hardness; Karl Fischer titration; Water","Coulometers; Electric energy storage; Hardness; Phosphorus compounds; Titration; Water; Karl Fischer titration; Room temperature; Water liberation; Cartilage; hydrogen; oxygen; phosphorus pentoxide; water; biological marker; water; analytical equipment; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; biomechanics; cartilage; controlled study; coulometry; electricity; electrode; female; femur condyle; knee; measurement; moisture; nonhuman; room temperature; sheep; temperature dependence; thermogravimetry; titrimetry; water contamination; water content; weight bearing; animal; articular cartilage; body water; chondropathy; conductometry; in vitro study; metabolism; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Animals; Biological Markers; Body Water; Cartilage Diseases; Cartilage, Articular; Conductometry; Female; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sheep; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247378300

Adipose tissue is no longer considered a passive bystander in body-weight regulation. It actively secretes a large number of hormones, growth factors, enzymes, cytokines, complement factors and matrix proteins, at the same time as expressing receptors for most of these elements, which influence fuel storage, mobilisation and utilisation at both central and peripheral sites. Thus, an extensive cross talk at a local and systemic level in response to specific external stimuli or metabolic changes underpins the multifunctional characteristics of adipose tissue. In addition to the already-known adipokines, such as IL, TNFα, leptin, resistin and adiponectin, more recently attention has been devoted to 'newcomers' to the 'adipose tissue arena', which include aquaporin, caveolin, visfatin, serum amyloid A and vascular endothelial growth factor. While in vitro and in vivo experiments have provided extremely valuable information, the advances in genomics, proteomics and metabolomics are offering a level of information not previously attainable to help unlock the molecular basis of obesity. The potential and power of combining pathophysiological observations with the wealth of information provided by the human genome, knock-out models, transgenesis, DNA microarrays, RNA silencing and other emerging technologies offer a new and unprecedented view of a complex disease, conferring novel insights into old questions by identifying new pieces to the unfinished jigsaw puzzle of obesity. © 2006 The Nutrition Society.","Aquaporin; Cardiovascular risk factors; Caveolin; Comorbidities; Obesity","adenylate cyclase; adipocytokine; aquaporin; beta adrenergic receptor; bucladesine; caveolin; chlorisondamine; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; cytokine; forskolin; isobutylmethylxanthine; isoprenaline; leptin; n(g) nitroarginine methyl ester; phosphodiesterase; serum amyloid A; sodium chloride; tumor necrosis factor alpha; vasculotropin; visfatin; adipocyte; adipose tissue; atherosclerosis; body fat; cardiovascular risk; cell culture; comorbidity; conference paper; DNA microarray; endocrine system; endothelium cell; gene expression; genome; genomics; heart protection; human; hyperlipoproteinemia type 3; in vitro study; in vivo study; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipolysis; metabolomics; neuroendocrine system; nonhuman; obesity; protein expression; proteomics; transgenics; vascular smooth muscle; Adipocytes; Cardiovascular Diseases; Comorbidity; Homeostasis; Humans; Neurosecretory Systems; Obesity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947416218

However, there is a remarkable lack of consistency between studies that have investigated the relationships between measurements of physical activity and energy expenditure and body fatness in children. This disparity could be because energy intake is a more important determinant in preventing obesity. Alternatively, some of the conflicting results could be related to methodological limitations in assessing activity and body composition. Erroneous conclusions may be drawn if physical activity energy expenditure is not adjusted for differences in body composition, or body fat is not appropriately adjusted for body size. For public health purposes it may be more informative to evaluate the amount and intensity of physical activity required to prevent fat-mass gain than to assess energy expended in physical activity. The lack of consensus in the cut-off points applied to define intensity levels is severely hindering comparisons between studies using accelerometers that have examined relationships between activity intensity and body fatness. Thus, it is not currently possible to develop a firm evidence base on which to establish physical activity recommendations until the limitations are addressed and more prospective studies undertaken. In order to turn research into effective prevention strategies a clearer understanding of the psycho-social, behavioural and environmental factors that influence activity is needed, including the interactions between physical activity and other behaviours such as time spent sedentary, sleeping and eating. © 2006 The Nutrition Society.","Body fatness; Childhood obesity; Energy expenditure; Physical activity","accelerometer; adolescent; behavior; body composition; body fat; body fat distribution; body size; caloric intake; child; conference paper; consensus; diet; eating; energy expenditure; environmental factor; female; human; lipid storage; male; medical research; methodology; obesity; physical activity; risk factor; sitting; sleep; social psychology; caloric intake; energy metabolism; exercise; health behavior; obesity; physiology; preschool child; review; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Obesity; Risk Factors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947393675

The input is a dense set of noisy photometric images, conveniently captured by using a very simple set-up consisting of a digital video camera, a reflective mirror sphere, and a handheld spotlight. We formulate the dense photometric stereo problem as a Markov network and investigate two important inference algorithms for Markov Random Fields (MRFs) - graph cuts and belief propagation - to optimize for the most likely setting for each node in the network. In the graph cut algorithm, the MRF formulation is translated into one of energy minimization. A discontinuity-preserving metric is introduced as the compatibility function, which allows α-expansion to efficiently perform the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Using the identical dense input and the same MRF formulation, our tensor belief propagation algorithm recovers faithful normal directions, preserves underlying discontinuities, improves the normal estimation from one of discrete to continuous, and drastically reduces the storage requirement and running time. Both algorithms produce comparable and very faithful normals for complex scenes. Although the discontinuity-preserving metric in graph cuts permits efficient inference of optimal discrete labels with a theoretical guarantee, our estimation algorithm using tensor belief propagation converges to comparable results, but runs faster because very compact messages are passed and combined. We present very encouraging results on normal reconstruction. A simple algorithm is proposed to reconstruct a surface from a normal map recovered by our method. With the reconstructed surface, an inverse process, known as relighting in computer graphics, is proposed to synthesize novel images of the given scene under user-specified light source and direction. The synthesis is made to run in real time by exploiting the state-of-the-art graphics processing unit (GPU). Our method offers many unique advantages over previous relighting methods and can handle a wide range of novel light sources and directions. © 2006 IEEE.","Belief propagation; Graph cuts; Markov random fields; Normal and surface reconstruction; Photometric stereo; Real-time relighting; Robust inference","Belief propagation; Graph cuts; Graphics processing unit (GPU); Markov random fields; Normal and surface reconstruction; Photometric stereos; Real-time relighting; Robust inference; Computational complexity; Computational geometry; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Markov processes; Real time systems; Photometry; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; photography; photometry; probability; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Markov Chains; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photogrammetry; Photometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947277487

An electrostatic motion-driven generator for low-frequency (human body) motion has been developed by the authors using microelecromechanical system technology. The prototype generates pulses of 250 V on a 10-pF capacitor. This paper examines the design of a circuit and semiconductor devices to convert this energy to a low voltage. Because of the very small charge involved, the effects of leakage and parasitic stored charge are important. Converters for this application using silicon-on-insulator metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors and insulated gate bipolar transistors are compared using physics-based finite-element simulation. The overall effectiveness of the generation process is shown to be composed of several terms which are functions of system parameters such as generator flight time, semiconductor device area, and circuit inductance. It is shown that device area is a compromise between leakage current, charge storage, and on-state voltage. It can, for a given generator and inductance, be optimized to provide the maximum energy yield. Parasitic series inductance is shown to be of little importance to the circuit efficiency; however, parasitic capacitance has a significant influence. © 2006 IEEE.","Buck converter; Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT); Lateral power semiconductor device; Metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET); Micro generator; Microelecromechanical system (MEMS); Micropower electrostatic generators","Electric potential; Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT); MEMS; MOSFET devices; Power electronics; Semiconductor devices; Buck converters; Lateral power semiconductor devices; Micro generators; Micropower electrostatic generators; Electrostatic generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947167788

Due to the rather moderate luminosity in the first year of LHC running the best chance for the observation of BHs will be the suppression of hard QCD-dijets at pT ∼ 1 TeV and for BHRs will be to search for high rigidity ionizing tracks in the ALICE TPC. Finally, we point out that stable BHRs in the LHC-storage rings might be interesting candidates for energy production by conversion of mass to Hawking radiation. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847626605

All of the carbon materials prepared showed a well-defined pore structure with a high surface area irrespective of the carbon precursor used in the preparation. Hydrogen adsorption tests indicated that the capacity of the materials for hydrogen adsorption was highly dependent on total surface area and the pore structure.

It has many advantages such as simple parallel distributed computation, distributed storage, and fast learning. Four factors related to a node becoming a cluster-head are drawn by analysis, which are energy (energy available in each node), number (the number of neighboring nodes), centrality (a value to classify the nodes based on the proximity how central the node is to the cluster), and location (the distance between the base station and the node). The factors are as input variables of neural networks and the output variable is suitability that is the degree of a node becoming a cluster head. A group of cluster-heads are selected according to the size of network. Then the base station broadcasts a message containing the list of cluster-heads' IDs to all nodes. After that, each cluster-head announces its new status to all its neighbors and sets up a new cluster. If a node around it receives the message, it registers itself to be a member of the cluster. After identifying all the members, the cluster-head manages them and carries out data aggregation in each cluster. Thus data flowing in the network decreases and energy consumption of nodes decreases accordingly. Experimental results show that, compared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm can significantly increase the lifetime of the sensor network.","Cluster-head selection; Radial basis function; Sensor networks","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Energy utilization; Network protocols; Neural networks; Sensors; Base station; Cluster head selection; Energy available; Parallel distributed computation; Routing protocols; Sensor networks; Simulation parameters; Standard variation; System model; Radial basis function networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846915805

Riverine floodplains are particularly heterogeneous and dynamic systems and loss of their natural environmental heterogeneity and dynamism as a consequence of human impacts constitutes their most serious threat. On river floodplains, flow and flood pulses create a shifting mosaic of channels, ponds, bars, islands, and riparian forest patches. Composition and spatial arrangement of these habitat patches determine their degree of connectivity, which in turn controls the flux of matter and energy among adjacent patches. In light of these attributes, riverine floodplains are model ecosystems for studying the effect of heterogeneity on ecological processes. In this article we introduce a conceptual model for river-flood-plain ecosystems that unifies leaf decomposition, organic-matter input, storage and quality, and stresses the importance of the flow and inundation regime. In combining these aspects of organic matter dynamics, which have been treated separately in the ecological literature, this model fosters a more holistic perspective of ecosystem processes on riverine floodplains. We conclude that the linkage between natural heterogeneity and ecosystem processes needs to be considered in future river-floodplain restoration projects.","Biodiversity; Braided river; Decomposition; Ecosystem process; Flow regime; Leaf breakdown; Tagliamento River","conceptual framework; connectivity; decomposition; ecological modeling; floodplain; flow pattern; habitat restoration; heterogeneity; nutrient dynamics; organic matter; patchiness; Eurasia; Europe; Italy; Southern Europe; Tagliamento River",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846859095

The gradual and abrupt climate changes are based on the high productivity of tropical and sub-tropical biomass in combination with a comprehensive carbon management scheme. The emergence in the late 1990s of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) as a significant mitigation technology led to the idea of linking CCS to bioenergy to give bioenergy with CO2 storage (BECS). The BECS is a two step process with a precautionary strategy, which includes the implementation of sustainable bioenergy.

It has been generally accepted that in dry aprotic organic solvents, enzymes are kinetically trapped in their conformation due to the high-energy barrier needed for them to unfold, suggesting that in such media they should remain catalytically active for long periods. However, recent studies on a variety of enzymes demonstrate that their initial high activity is severely reduced after exposure to organic solvents for several hours. It was speculated that this could be due to structural perturbations, changes of the enzyme's pH memory, enzyme aggregation, or dehydration due to water removal by the solvents. Herein, we systematically study the possible causes for this undesirable activity loss in 1,4-dioxane. Results: As model enzyme, we employed the protease subtilisin Carlsberg, prepared by lyophilization and colyophilization with the additive methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD). Our results exclude a mechanism involving a change in ionization state of the enzyme, since the enzyme activity shows a similar pH dependence before and after incubation for 5 days in 1,4-dioxane. No apparent secondary or tertiary structural perturbations resulting from prolonged exposure in this solvent were detected. Furthermore, active site titration revealed that the number of active sites remained constant during incubation. Additionally, the hydration level of the enzyme does not seem to affect its stability. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies revealed no substantial increase in the rotational freedom of a paramagnetic nitroxide inhibitor bound to the active site (a spin-label) during incubation in neat 1,4-dioxane, when the water activity was kept constant using BaBr2 hydrated salts. Incubation was also accompanied by a substantial decrease in Vmax/KM. Conclusion: These results exclude some of the most obvious causes for the observed low enzyme storage stability in 1,4-dioxane, mainly structural, dynamics and ionization state changes. The most likely explanation is possible rearrangement of water molecules within the enzyme that could affect its dielectric environment. However, other mechanisms, such as small distortions around the active site or rearrangement of counter ions, cannot be excluded at this time. © 2006 Castillo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Colyophilization; Enzyme storage stability; Hydrolases; Lyophilization; Structural perturbations; Subtilisin Carlsberg; Agglomeration; Catalysis; Dehydration; Ionization; Organic solvents; Paramagnetic resonance; pH; Titration; Enzyme kinetics; alkaline proteinase; barium derivative; dioxane; hydrolase; methyl beta cyclodextrin; nitroxide; organic solvent; subtilisin; water; article; controlled study; electron spin resonance; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetics; enzyme mechanism; enzyme stability; enzyme structure; freeze drying; hydration; incubation time; ionization; Michaelis constant; pH; protein secondary structure; protein tertiary structure; beta-Cyclodextrins; Binding Sites; Chemistry, Organic; Circular Dichroism; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrolases; Kinetics; Models, Chemical; Solvents; Subtilisins; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846595722

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a well-known stimulator of pathways favouring food intake and energy storage. Recently, studies in rodents suggested a possible mediation of ghrelin action by NPY. In contrast, until now no evidence of ghrelin-NPY interaction in humans has been provided. In the present study, we examined whether ghrelin influences NPY secretion in normal men. Subjects and Design: Twelve healthy normal men (aged 24-35 years; body mass index (BMI) 22.3±0.93 kg/m2) were tested twice at 08.00 AM on two different days, in random order at weekly intervals, after an overnight fast and rest in bed. An intravenous bolus of 1 ug/kg body weight ghrelin (esperimental test) or an equal amount of normal saline (control test) was injected at time 0. Blood was taken before and over 90 minutes after injections, and was used for the measurement of plasma NPY levels. Results: Plasma levels of NPY slightly, but significantly rose in response to ghrelin, with a mean peak level at 15 min after injection, whereas no significant change was observed after saline administration. Main Finding: Our results show a significant enhancement of plasma NPY levels under ghrelin stimulation. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a ghrelin-NPY interaction in humans, which may suggest a possible mediation of ghrelin action by NPY in humans. © Neuroendocrinology Letters.","Body weight; Feeding; Ghrelin; Growth; NPY","ghrelin; growth hormone; neuropeptide Y; sodium chloride; adult; appetite; article; bed rest; blood level; body composition; body mass; body weight; controlled study; diet restriction; energy consumption; food intake; growth hormone release; human; human experiment; male; normal human; protein interaction; protein secretion; regulatory mechanism; volunteer; Adult; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Male; Neuropeptide Y; Peptide Hormones; Reference Values; Stimulation, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846444351

Box 616, 6200 MD, Maastricht, Netherlands","Introduction: Long-chain fatty acids and glucose are the predominant substrates for cardiac metabolic energy production. While in the healthy heart there is a distinctive and very finely tuned balance between the utilization of these metabolic substrates, in chronic cardiac disease this balance is upset to the use of primarily glucose (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy and failure) or primarily fatty acids (e.g., diabetic cardiomyopathy). Cardiac substrate preference is regulated not only at the level of mitochondrial oxidation (Randle cycle) but also at the level of sarcolemmal uptake of substrates. Molecular mechanism of cardiac substrate uptake: The latter occurs by translocation of specific substrate transporters, namely fatty acid translocase/CD36 and plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein (FABPpm) to regulate fatty acid transport, and GLUT4 to regulate glucose transport, from intracellular storage pools to the sarcolemma. Both insulin and cardiac muscle contractions increase the cellular uptake of fatty acids and glucose simultaneously by these mechanisms. Although the signal transduction pathways involved in eliciting substrate transporter trafficking have only partly been disclosed, recent studies indicate the feasibility of selective recruitment of either CD36 or GLUT4 to the sarcolemma, thereby increasing the uptake of a single class of substrates and thus altering the substrate preference of cardiac muscle cells. Concluding remarks: As a result, selective modulation of the sarcolemmal localization of fatty acid- and/or glucose transporters holds promise as a therapeutic tool to rectify a disruption of the cardiac substrate balance occurring in chronic cardiac disease. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","CD36; Diabetic cardiomyopathy; Energy production; Fatty acid transporter; Glucose transporter; GLUT4; Sarcolemmal transport","CD36 antigen; fatty acid; fatty acid binding protein; glucose; glucose transporter 4; insulin; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; fatty acid transport; gene mutation; glucose transport; heart contraction; heart disease; heart muscle cell; heart muscle contractility; hormone action; human; insulin resistance; muscle biopsy; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein localization; review; sarcolemma; signal transduction; transport kinetics; upregulation; Animals; Biological Transport; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Glucose; Heart Diseases; Humans; Membrane Transport Proteins; Myocardium; Sarcolemma; Signal Transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846408278

R3C 2P4, Canada","The thermal performance of a solar energy greenhouse (SEG), a technology that has been effectively used in China to grow vegetables and flowers, was investigated under winter conditions in southern Manitoba. A 30-m by 7-m solar greenhouse was constructed in Elie, Manitoba (50°N; 97°W). The greenhouse had an insulated (3.6 m2°C/W, or RSI-3.6) solid north wall to store solar energy in the daytime and to release thermal energy in the nighttime, and a thermal blanket (RSI-1.2) over the glazed surface (single layer plastic) in the nighttime to minimize the heat loss. The experiment was conducted from February to April, 2005. On the coldest day in February, the lowest nighttime temperature recorded inside the greenhouse was 1.6°C when the outdoor temperature was -29.2°C. The mean night indoor temperature was 2.4°C while the mean outdoor temperature was -13.1°C in February. The solar radiation had more influence on the greenhouse temperature than did the outdoor temperature. The average daily energy storage by the north wall was 166 MJ (or 2635 kj/m2 of wall surface area), which was about 10% of the available solar energy received in the greenhouse. The average daily energy release by the wall was 159 MJ (2523 kJ/m2), which was 4% less than the stored amount. The average amounts of energy stored and released by soil in the greenhouse were 724 and 567 kJ/m2 (floor area) per day, respectively. Based on the average measurements of temperature and solar radiation, it was estimated that about 19 hours of supplemental heating would be required per day in February to maintain the greenhouse temperature above 10°C. The amount of required supplemental heat was estimated to be between 2 and 17 W/m2 when the thermal blanket was applied on the plastic cover of the greenhouse.","Greenhouse; Solar energy; Temperature","Energy storage; Plastic coatings; Soils; Solar energy; Thermal effects; Thermal insulating materials; Flowers; Solar energy greenhouse (SEG); Thermal performance; Vegetables; Greenhouses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846245593

The additional production is not a question of potential (harvesting residues, wood from thinning, coppice stands and short rotation forests) but more so a question of economic feasibility. The analyses of different chip production systems resulted in the identification of two major challenges: (1) the design of the chipping and transport interface, and (2) the need to reduce transportation costs. Chipping and transportation are the key processes for production and can be completed in closed or interrupted work chains. Direct chipping into the transportation machine requires larger operating areas and results in operational delays of the chipper (20% of the total work time) and the truck. In mountainous areas the separation of chipping and transportation can be appropriate and reduce costs by 24-32%. The increasing fuel demand will result in a larger supply area for the energy producer and lead to increasing transportation costs. An improved utilization of the load volumes can be achieved through drying the material, compressing of harvesting residues as well as higher payloads. Drying wood on storage areas near the forest increases the transportation productivity by 50%. Bundling of harvesting residues pays off especially by larger transportation distances.","Bundling technology; Chipping; Energy wood transport; Wood chip supply",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846046022

We investigated the effects of GH treatment in 27 adult Japanese GHD patients, 15 with adult onset (AO) and 12 with childhood onset (CO) GHD. Patients initially received GH titrated to 0.012 mg/kg/day for 24 weeks in a double-blind design and the dose was then individualized for each patient according to IGF-I for a further 24 weeks. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data were evaluated for percentages of trunk fat, total body fat and lean body mass. Serum IGF-I and lipid concentrations were determined at a central laboratory. There were 25 patients who completed 48 weeks of treatment, with 7, 6 and 12 patients then receiving GH at 0.003, 0.006 and 0.012 mg/kg/day, respectively. With the reductions in dose when individualized between weeks 24 and 48, mean serum IGF-I level was reduced and excessively high values, observed in AO patients on the fixed GH dose, were no longer seen. The decrease from baseline in trunk fat was similar at week 24 (-3.8 ± 3.3%, p<0.001) and week 48 (-3.1 ± 3.7%, p<0.001), and the difference between changes was not significant. Total cholesterol was decreased from baseline by -24 ± 28 mg/dl (p<0.001) at week 24 and -17 ± 28 mg/dl (p = 0.007) at week 48. Two patients had elevated HbA1c levels: one continued GH treatment after a dose reduction and the other discontinued due to persistent impaired glucose tolerance. Therefore, excessively high IGF-I levels can be avoided by individualized dosing during long-term GH treatment. Individualized dosing maintains the decrease in abdominal fat in adult Japanese GHD patients and should reduce the cardiovascular risk.","Abdominal obesity; Adult GH deficiency; GH treatment; Japan; Trunk fat","hemoglobin A1c; human growth hormone; placebo; somatomedin C; alkaline phosphatase blood level; arthralgia; article; body composition; body fat; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug dose increase; drug dose reduction; drug dose regimen; drug dose titration; drug effect; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; edema; female; growth hormone deficiency; hormone substitution; human; Japanese; lean body weight; lipid storage; male; phosphate blood level; randomized controlled trial; side effect; treatment duration; Abdominal Fat; Adult; Body Composition; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Dwarfism, Pituitary; Female; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Placebos; Time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845982569

The latest climate change science suggests that major (60% or more by 2050), rapid (peaking within 20 years) cuts in global emissions may be required to avoid dangerous climate change. There are a number of existing abatement options including energy efficiency, various renewable energy technologies, nuclear power and fuel switching to natural gas; as well as emerging options including CCS. We outline a simple technology assessment framework for policymakers to evaluate these different options given the climate change imperative. This framework includes technology status, delivered energy services, present and possible future costs, potential scale of abatement, potential speed of deployment and other possible social outcomes. Application of this framework to CCS suggests that it should be considered as a promising, but still somewhat unproven, option that potentially offers very significant abatement potential and good integration into the existing energy industry. There are, however, some outstanding questions regarding its effectiveness and safety, its abatement is likely to come at significant cost, and it is unlikely to be able to make a significant contribution for well over a decade. The Australian policy implications are that while government support for R&D and Demonstration of CCS is appropriate and should in our view be expanded, the major priority should be to support greater deployment of existing abatement options including energy efficiency, efficient gas-fired generation and cogeneration and renewable energy. Such policy support is noticeably lacking at present. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Carbon Capture and Storage; Energy and climate policy; Technology assessment","Carbon; Climate change; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Particulate emissions; Renewable energy resources; Research and development management; Carbon Capture; Climate policy; Gas-fired generation; Technology assessment; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845663036

Because of this there is interest in using carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies as a mitigation option, particularly in Australia because of its dependency on fossil fuels for electricity generation. Research in Australia into capture options includes post-combustion capture (PCC), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and oxyfuels combustion. Separation technologies being investigated in Australia include solvent absorption, membranes, adsorption and cryogenics, with particular emphasis on bringing down costs. Australia appears to have abundant geological storage capacity, particularly in saline formations and to a much lesser extent in depleted oil and gas fields. Storage in coal systems has potential but more research and development is needed. Australia has the opportunity to use low-emission hubs in order to bring down costs. A major study of this concept for the Latrobe Valley of Victoria, based on 50 million tonnes per annum of CO2 emissions, is encouraging. A key concept for taking CO 2 capture and geological storage forward is demonstration and commercial deployment. Australian projects are proposed for PCC and oxyfuels combustion. A significant geological storage project has started in the Otway Basin, with CO2 injection scheduled to commence in mid-2007. The coal-to-liquids Monash Project could involve up to 10 million tonnes CO 2 per annum, with injection into the offshore Gippsland Basin. The most advanced commercial project is the LNG Gorgon Project, comprising about 3 million tonnes per annum. Through current R&amp;D momentum and the likelihood of a number of major commercial-scale projects, Australia could become an early mover in the application of carbon dioxide capture and geological storage. © 2006 Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC).","Australia; Capture and separation; Carbon dioxide; Geological storage; Geosequestration","Capture and separation; Geological storage; Geosequestration; Energy resources; Gas fuel storage; Geology; Carbon dioxide; Carbon Dioxide; Energy; Geology; Storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845628389

The organisms that make up the population consist of structural biomass and energy storage compartments. In a constant chemostat environment a species without energy storage always out-competes a species with energy reserves. This hinders evolution of species with storage from those without storage. Using the adaptive dynamics approach for non-equilibrium ecological systems we will show that in a fluctuating environment there are multiple stable evolutionary singular strategies (ss's): one for a species without, and one for a species with energy storage. The evolutionary end-point depends on the initial evolutionary state. We will formulate the invasion fitness in terms of Floquet multipliers for the oscillating non-autonomous system. Bifurcation theory is used to study points where due to evolutionary development by mutational steps, the long-term dynamics of the ecological system changes qualitatively. To that end, at the ecological time scale, the trait value at which invasion of a mutant into a resident population becomes possible can be calculated using numerical bifurcation analysis where the trait is used as the free parameter, because it is just a bifurcation point. In a constant environment there is a unique stable equilibrium for one species following the ""competitive exclusion"" principle. In contrast, due to the oscillatory dynamics on the ecological time scale two species may coexist. That is, non-equilibrium dynamics enhances biodiversity. However, we will show that this coexistence is not stable on the evolutionary time scale and always one single species survives. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, PC-HMWCs were isolated from photoheterotrophic Euglena gracilis and purified to homogeneity, resulting in compounds of molecular mass 50-380 kDa depending on the CdCl2 and sulfate concentrations in the culture medium. In contrast with plants and some yeasts, PC-HMWCs from E. gracilis mainly comprise (57-75%) monothiol molecules (Cys, γ-glutamylcysteine, GSH) and, to a lesser extent (25-43%), PCs. A similar acid-soluble thiol compound composition was found in whole cell extracts. The -SH/Cd2+and S2-/Cd2+ ratios found in purified PC-HMWCs were 1.5 and 1.8, respectively; the (-SH + S2-)/Cd 2+ ratio was 3.2. PC-HMWCs of molecular mass 60 and 100 kDa were also localized inside Percoll-purified chloroplasts, in which cadmium and PCs were mainly compartmentalized. Cadmium and sulfur-rich clusters with similar sulfur/cadmium stoichiometries to those of the purified PC-HMWCs were detected in the chloroplast and throughout the cell by energy dispersive microanalysis and atomic resolution electron microscopy. The presence of PC-HMWCs in primitive photosynthetic eukaryotes such as the protist, E. gracilis, suggests that their function as the final cadmium-storage-inactivation process is widespread. Their particular intracellular localization suggests that chloroplasts may play a major role in the cadmium-resistance mechanism in organisms lacking a plant-like vacuole. © 2006 The Authors.","Aspartate; Cadmium compartmentation; Chloroplast; Glutathione; Sulfide","cadmium; cadmium chloride; cysteine; gamma glutamylcysteine; glutathione; phytochelatin; sulfate; sulfide; sulfur derivative; thiol derivative; analytic method; article; cell compartmentalization; cell vacuole; cellular distribution; chemical composition; chloroplast; complex formation; concentration (parameters); controlled study; culture medium; electron microscopy; Euglena gracilis; eukaryote; exposure; isolation procedure; microanalysis; molecular weight; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant; priority journal; stoichiometry; synthesis; yeast; Animals; Cadmium Compounds; Chloroplasts; Euglena gracilis; Glutathione; Macromolecular Substances; Molecular Weight; Sulfides; Euglena gracilis; Eukaryota; Protista",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845510365

AD is characterized, among other clinical findings, by unexplained weight loss, cachexia and altered immune function. Alteration in energy balance and nutritional status are relayed to the feeding-related hypothalamic nuclei by neuronal pathways and/or via alterations in the levels of eating-controlling hormones. The adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin, and the pancreatic-derived peptide, insulin, function as hormonal signaling mechanisms for fat deposition and play a key role in regulating food intake, body weight and energy homeostasis via their actions on specific hypothalamic nuclei. Moreover, leptin, insulin and their receptors are widely expressed in many hypothalamic and extra-hypothalamic brain regions indicating that these hormones may have other neuronal functions. Although emerging evidence supports the role of insulin resistance in the development of AD, the potential involvement of leptin in the pathogenic process of AD has been proposed only recently.

Surface net radiation is derived from the component fluxes of the radiation balance. Turbulent heat fluxes are calculated using the aerodynamic method with input from local meteorological stations and experimentally derived drag coefficients. Lake heat storage, determined as a residual of the surface energy balance, is used together with measured water temperature profiles to calculate the daily mixing layer depth. The model uses readily available meteorological inputs for radiation calculations. Verification results for surface energy balance components show mean bias error (MBE) generally less than 5% of the mean measured daily fluxes and root mean square error (RMSE) less than 38%, which decreases to less than 16% for 10-day averaging periods. The model tends to overestimate net radiation by 7% and latent and sensible heat fluxes by about 4% and 1%, respectively, on average.

Since these glucans are not biosynthesized by mammals, they are likely to activate the immune system of their host. Since the discovery of their positive involvement as immunomodulator agents, numerous studies were published all around the glycosciences. These works deal with purification procedures, analytical chemistry, synthetic processes, chemical modification of the natural polysaccharides, determination of their physico-chemical properties, and assessment of their biological and medicinal effects through in vitro and in vivo studies. This article aims at presenting some recent results linked to β-(1,3)-glucans through two closely connected points of view, i.e. biology and chemistry. Biological aspects will be focused more particularly on discovery of some receptors present on immunocompetent cells and scope and limitations of chemical synthesis and/or modifications will be described. Moreover, this paper will also introduce some new chemo-enzymatic synthetic methods using wild-type or mutant glycosidases and will be extended to novel opportunities of applications of β-(1-3)-glucans in nanotechnology resulting from a better understanding of their self-assembling propensity in aqueous media. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","β-(1,3)-glucans; Chemical modification; Immunostimulation; Receptors of β-(1,3)-glucans; Synthesis","acetyl low density lipoprotein; beta 1,3 glucan; betafectin; cetuximab; complement receptor 3; dectin 1; lactosylceramide; monoclonal antibody; pattern recognition receptor; rituximab; scavenger receptor; schizophyllan; trastuzumab; antimicrobial activity; antineoplastic activity; article; chemical modification; drug conformation; drug conjugation; drug isolation; drug potentiation; drug purification; drug receptor binding; drug solubility; drug structure; drug synthesis; drug targeting; human; immune system; immunocompetent cell; immunomodulation; immunostimulation; immunotherapy; molecular weight; nanotechnology; nonhuman; structure activity relation; tumor; beta-Glucans; Carbohydrate Conformation; Carbohydrate Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845457321

However few studies have investigated the body composition after kidney transplantation, particularly during longitudinal follow-up. In this prospective study, we assessed the changes in body composition after kidney transplantation. We also analyzed the effect of steroid withdrawal from the immunosuppressive regimen on weight gain and body composition. Methods: Thirty-eight cadaveric kidney transplant recipients were followed for 2 years posttransplant. Total and segmental body composition were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at the time of transplantation as well as 3, 6, 12, and 24 months later. Results: In 28 patients (group A), prednisone was stopped by month 6, whereas, in 10 patients (group B), it was continued throughout the study. In the overall patient group, there were no significant changes in body weight. However, a trend to increased weight was observed in group B. In this group, patients showed an early increase in total body fat with a central accumulation of fat mass that was maintained during the follow-up period. On the other hand, total lean mass increased significantly in group A but did not change significantly in group B. Conclusion: In summary, overall the group showed no major changes in body weight during the 2 years after transplantation. Steroid withdrawal in kidney transplant recipients may have a significant positive effect on body composition. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

As unique features, the materials under study present an excellent dispersion of silica within the polymer matrix and are almost free of uncross-linked chains. In addition, very progressive changes in network architecture are available, resulting from changes in particle diameter, d, volume fraction of filler, Φ, number of methacryloyl units grafted per surface unit of silica particle, n, and nature of the grafting agent. The influence of these parameters on the characteristics of the mechanically active relaxations α and β was examined. Emphasis was put on the storage modulus, E′, on the loss modulus, E″, and on their dependence on filler volume fraction. E″ values were shown to simply account for the reduction of the mechanical energy lost within the material, in connection to the occurrence of polymer molecular motions. Analysis of E′ variations as a function of Φ was based on the theoretical models available in the literature to account for the contribution of the spherical filler particles. In the glassy state, Kerner's and Christensen and Lo's models yielded comparable results. In the rubbery state, Guth and Gold's model was shown to prevail on Kerner's model. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",,"Dispersions; Molecular dynamics; Polymers; Silica; Viscoelasticity; Volume fraction; Grafting agent; Methacryloyl; Nanosilica; Polymer matrix; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845312305

The structures of the HDPE-EVA alloy/OMT nanocomposites are evidenced by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that an ordered intercalated nanomorphology of the HDPE-EVA alloy/OMT nanocomposites is formed. Then the structures of the shape stabilized PCNM are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The HDPE-EVA alloy/OMT nanocomposites act as the supporting material and form the three-dimensional network structure. The paraffin acts as a phase change material and disperses in the three-dimensional network structure. Its latent heat is given by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) method. The SEM and DSC results show that the additives of IFR have little effect on the network structure and the latent heat of shape stabilized PCNM, respectively. The thermal stability properties are characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA analysis results indicate that the flame retardant shape stabilized PCNM produce a larger amount of char residue at 800 °C than that of shape stabilized PCNM, although the onset of weight loss of the flame retardant shape stabilized PCNM occur at a lower temperature. The formed multicellular char residue contributes to the improvement of thermal stability performance. The probable combustion mechanisms are also discussed in this paper. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The efficiency of a PCM is dependent on the encapsulated quantity and energy storage capacity per unit mass during its melting and solidifying. Two different kinds of paraffin (docosane and hexacosane with melting points of 317.15 and 329.45 K, respectively) were sulfonated at three different mole percentages to increase the LHTES efficiency for this purpose. The sulfonation of paraffin samples was proven by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Adiabatic Bomb Calorimetry was used to determine sulfonation percentages of paraffin samples. Enthalpies of melting and solidifying of docosane, hexacosane, and their sulfonated derivatives were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method.

The pelvic limbs of ten ostriches were dissected and detailed measurements of all muscle tendon units of the pelvic limb were made, including muscle mass, muscle length, fascicle length, pennation angle, tendon mass and tendon length. From these measurements other muscle properties such as muscle volume, physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), tendon cross-sectional area, maximum isometric muscle force and tendon stress were derived, using standard relationships and published muscle data. Larger muscles tended to be located more proximally and had longer fascicle lengths and lower pennation angles. This led to an expected proximal to distal reduction in total muscle mass. An exception to this trend was the gastrocnemius muscle, which was found to have the largest volume and PCSA and also had the highest capacity for both force and power production. Generally high-power muscles were located more proximally in the limb, while some small distal muscles (tibialis cranialis and flexor perforatus digiti III), with short fibres, were found to have very high force generation capacities. The greatest proportion of pelvic muscle volume was for the hip extensors, while the highest capacity for force generation was observed in the extensors of the ankle, many of which were also in series with long tendons and thus were functionally suited to elastic energy storage. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Architecture; Biomechanics; Locomotion; Muscle; Ostrich; Tendon","article; controlled study; dissection; energy resource; female; flexor muscle; functional anatomy; gastrocnemius muscle; hip; leg; leg muscle; male; motor performance; muscle cell; muscle force; muscle function; muscle isometric contraction; muscle length; muscle mass; muscle strength; musculoskeletal function; musculoskeletal system parameters; nonhuman; ostrich; priority journal; publishing; stress; tendon; Animals; Biomechanics; Female; Hindlimb; Locomotion; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Pelvis; Struthioniformes; Tendons; Perforatus; Struthio camelus; Struthioniformes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751251081

The lead dioxide films prepared were used as positive electrodes of lead acid batteries. Different parameters such as pulse time (ton), pulse height, and relaxation time (toff) were optimized to obtain higher capacity. Depend on the pulse conditions, a range of different morphologies of various porosities and connectivity was obtained. The resulting batteries were discharged to a cut off voltage of 1.75 V by a pulsed current method. The energy storage ability of the prepared lead acid batteries shows a close relation with the morphology of cathode materials. Maximum capacity was observed when pulse and relaxation time was equal to 0.1 and 5 s, respectively, at a current density of 25 mA cm-2. A change in morphology of lead dioxide from aggregated globular structure to nanofiber was occurred. It was found that the high surface area as well as high connectivity between particles resulted in increased discharge capacity. Analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data revealed that the charge transfer resistance is decreased by a change in morphology from bulk globular to nanofiber as the energy storage test showed. The time dependence of impedance behavior of a sample prepared at ton = 0.1 s and toff = 5 s at 25 mA cm-2 was investigated and the results are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Lipid class composition was determined for pooled samples of groups of fish sorted by cohort and condition factor. Mass-specific lipid content ranged from 2.3% and 8.1% of fresh mass, and mass-specific triacylglycerol content between 0.16% and 5.6% of fresh mass. Total lipid content decreased by 34-57% during the winter period, before increasing by 155-176% between May and July. A large proportion of the variation in total lipid content was due to variation in triacylglycerol content (r2 = 0.95), except for variations at low total lipids levels when triacylglycerols were absent. The temporal variation in polar lipid content was, although to a lesser degree, related to total lipid content (r2 = 0.62), indicating that the fish also utilised polar lipids as an energy source during periods of starvation. Analyses of 39 individual parr collected in May showed a large individual variation in lipid class composition in the most critical period of the year. It is concluded that information on variation in lipid class composition may give more precise and detailed information of energy status during critical periods, although total lipid content will in most cases give a fair description of the energy status of the fish. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Munksgaard.","Atlantic salmon; Lipid class composition; Parr; Seasonal variation; Storage energy; Triglycerides","juvenile; lipid; salmonid; seasonal variation; survival; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; Salmo salar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751053375

Turbulent Rayleigh numbers between 1.2 × 1012 and 6 × 1016 are considered. A stratification parameter based on the moment of energy is defined to quantify the degree of stratification and this parameter is seen to be about 30% lower for the ribbed tanks. The degree of stratification is not sensitive to changes in the ratio of the rib height to the spacing between the ribs. The transient free convection is shown to be characterized by the parameter Fo × Ra0.15. The process of stratification takes place more slowly in the ribbed tanks than in smooth-walled tanks. The free convective heat transfer coefficient for tanks having ribbed surface is also seen to be significantly lower. Incorporation of ribs over the inner surface of the insulated tanks is demonstrated to offer a simple means of reducing the stratification and boil-off losses. © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Liquid hydrogen storage tanks; Natural convection; Ribbed wall; Stratification","Fuel tanks; Heat losses; Heat transfer; Heat transfer coefficients; Natural convection; Turbulent flow; Flow currents; Liquid hydrogen storage tanks; Rayleigh numbers; Ribbed walls; Thermal stratification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751015431

The many traversals through a thin target strongly improve the nuclear reaction rate with respect to a single-pass collision, in a steady configuration in which ionization losses of a target ""foil"" (typically few hundred μg/cm2 thick) are continuously recovered by an RF-cavity. With a flat foil, betatron oscillations are ""cooled"", but the momentum spread diverges exponentially, since faster (slower) particles ionize less (more) than the average. In order to ""cool"" the beam also longitudinally, a chromaticity has to be introduced with a wedge-shaped ""foil"". Therefore, in equilibrium conditions, multiple scattering and straggling are both balanced by phase-space compression. Classic Ionization Cooling [A.A.

In practice, this limits its applicability to non-interacting muon beams. Instead, in this new method, applicable to strongly interacting collisions, the circulating beam is not extracted. Ionization cooling provides ""in situ"" storage of the beam until it is converted by a nuclear interaction with the target. Simple reactions-for instance 7 Li + D → 8 Li + p-are more favourably produced in the ""mirror"" kinematical frame, namely with a heavier ion colliding against a gas-jet D2 target. Kinematics is generally very favourable, with angles in a narrow angular cone (around ∼10° for the mentioned reaction) and with a relatively concentrated outgoing energy spectrum which allows an efficient collection of 8Li as a neutral gas in a tiny volume, a technology perfected by ISOLDE at high temperatures. The method should be capable of producing a ""table top"" storage ring with an accumulation rate in excess of 1014 8Li radioactive ion/s. It has however a much more general applicability to many other nuclear reactions. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The new working point of the storage ring has been optimized by renouncing to the standard double achromatic feature of the magnetic optics. This makes possible the laser dynamics to benefit from high particle density conditions together with a particular regime of beam dynamics whose peculiarity is to correlate the longitudinal and horizontal oscillations in the laser interaction region. In such a new configuration, the Super-ACO two-bunches dynamics has been experimentally characterized and analyzed in comparison with analogous experimental results corresponding to standard machine operations. For a low emittance and a reduced momentum compaction factor, the calculated small signal gain of the laser results to be enhanced because of the increased particle density. Passing from the nominal to the low emittance setting of the storage ring, variations of the measured beam life-time have been observed by reason of either the increased particle density or the effect of the laser heating. Useful indications about the dependence of the laser saturation mechanism on the modified regime of the beam dynamics can be obtained from the analysis of the beam life-time. In spite of the dependence of the beam orbit on the energy spread in the laser interaction region, the typical non-equilibrium distribution of the laser intensity-the so-called detuning curve-has been observed also in correspondence of the new operation point of the storage ring. Finally, the average laser power measured at the equilibrium has been analyzed and theoretically interpreted. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Much work has been done on studying the optimal AC power output, while little has considered the AC-DC output. This article investigates the optimal AC-DC power generation for a rectified piezoelectric device. In contrast with estimates based on various degrees of approximation in the recent literature, an analytic expression for the AC-DC power output is derived under steady-state operation. It shows that the harvested power depends on the input vibration characteristics (frequency and acceleration), the mass of the generator, the electrical load, the natural frequency, the mechanical damping ratio and the electromechanical coupling coefficient of the system. An effective power normalization scheme is provided to compare the relative performance and efficiency of devices. The theoretical predictions are validated and found to be in good agreement with both experimental observations and numerical simulations.

The method is elegant and avoids the need for evolution equations. The extension of small strain formulations to the finite strain case, which is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into elastic and inelastic parts, proved not straight forward. Specifically, the symmetry of the resulting back stress remained elusive. In this paper, a free energy-based formulation incorporating the effect of kinematic hardening is proposed. The formulation is able to reproduce symmetric expressions for the back stress while incorporating the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. Kinematic hardening is combined with isotropic hardening where an associative flow rule and von Mises yield criterion are applied. It is shown that the symmetry of the back stress is strongly related to its treatment as a truly spatial tensor, where contraction operations are to be conducted using the current metric. The latter depends naturally on the deformation gradient itself. Various numerical examples are presented. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we focus on the recent technique proposed by Wainwright et al. [33]-tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW). It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound-it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in [33]. In addition, on stereo problems with Potts interactions, we obtain a lower energy than graph cuts. © 2006 IEEE.","Belief propagation; Early vision; Energy minimization; Graph algorithms; Markov random fields; Message passing; Stereo","Belief propagation; Early vision; Energy minimization; Graph algorithms; Markov random fields; Algorithms; Energy conservation; Graph theory; Stereo vision; Trees (mathematics); Message passing; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; energy transfer; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Energy Transfer; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pattern Recognition, Automated",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750129298

This paper explores the public perceptions of UCG in the UK through a detailed case-study and focus group discussion. A failed proposal for a UCG drill site at Silverdale (Staffordshire) provides an opportunity to understand the influence of local social, cultural and institutional factors on the manner in which the risks and benefits associated with UCG are perceived. The participants of the focus group recognised the potential of UCG as a secure source of energy for the UK in the future, provided that it is safe to humans and the environment and cost-effective. The group discussed potential benefits to the local community, potential risks, the role of carbon dioxide capture and storage, and links to the hydrogen economy. The group recommended that an open, transparent and consultative process of decision-making and operation should be adopted by the developer, operator and regulator; and that UCG should be developed at a remote site, preferably on land, before applying it in coal seams close to populated areas. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a particularly impressive feat, given the inherently low stability of membrane receptors and the need to stabilize an amphiphilic BLM to maintain receptor function. This review provides a summary of the various methods currently used for immobilization of membrane-bound proteins, a description of the advances in sol-gel technology that led to the ability to entrap viable receptors, and an outline of the current state of the field with respect to membrane proteins entrapped in silica. Advantages of sol-gel entrapment relative to alternative immobilization strategies are highlighted and potential applications of entrapped receptors, including platforms for biosensing, drug screening and energy storage, are described.

The sparging with external gases of N2 and CO2 showed higher H2 yield than the control of no sparging and internal biogas sparging. It indicated that the decrease of H2 partial pressure by external gas sparging had a beneficial effect on H2 fermentation. Especially, CO2 sparging was more effective in the reactor performance than N2 sparging, accompanied by higher production of H2 and butyrate. The best performance was obtained by CO2 sparging at 300 ml/min, resulting in the highest H2 yield of 1.68 mol H2 / molhexoseconsumed and the maximum specific H2 production rate of 6.89 L H2 / g VSS/day. Compared to N2 sparging, there might be another positive effect in CO2 sparging apart from lowering H2 partial pressure.

This was achieved by the optimisation of the electrochromic device materials (electrochromic, ion storage, protective layers, transparent conductors and polymer electrolytes) and by the refinement of a sealing method for evacuated glazing. Electrochromic evacuated glazing prototypes with dimensions up to 40 cm × 40 cm have been fabricated using vacuum techniques and chemical methods. The prototypes exhibit excellent optical and thermal performance, with a contrast ratio up to 1:32 (visible dynamic transmittance range Tlum,bleached = 63% and Tlum,colored = 2%), coloration efficiency up to 92 cm2/C and mid-pane U-values as low as 0.86 W m-2 K-1. Their durability in relation to real working environmental conditions has been assessed through indoor and outdoor testing. Such a glazing can be used in building applications to improve occupant thermal comfort, contribute to a reduction in space heating and cooling loads and allow for increased areas of fenestration thereby reducing artificial lighting loads. These factors reduce the energy demand for the building and therefore contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, our interest will be focused on the micro-cogeneration, MCHP (electric power ≤15 kW), which represents a valid and interesting application of this technology which refers, above all, to residential and light commercial users [M. Dentice d'Accadia, M. Sasso, S. Sibilio, Cogeneration for energy saving in household applications, in: P. Bertoldi, A.

In particular, our work group started a R&amp;D programme on micro-cogeneration in 1995: a laboratory, equipped with the most common appliances (washing-machine, dishwasher, storage water heater, ...), has been built and some MCHP prototypes have been tested too. In this article, the results of an intense experimental activity on three different micro-cogenerators, one of them made in Japan and in a pre-selling phase, are reported. In a previous paper a detailed analysis of the test facility, with the description of the equipments and the data acquisition systems, can be found [M. Dentice d'Accadia, M. Sasso, S. Sibilio, R. Vanoli, Micro-combined heat and power in residential and light commercial applications, Applied Thermal Engineering 23 (2003) 1247-1259]. A typical 3-E (Energetic, Economic and Environmental) approach has been performed to compare the proposed energy system, MCHP, to the conventional one based on separate ""production"". In the energetic analysis the amount of primary energy savings provided by micro-cogeneration unit has been evaluated for different types of MCHP units and at various working conditions. Furthermore the evaluation of the equivalent CO2 emissions of the compared systems, MCHP and conventional systems, allows to calculate the MCHP potentials to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finally the Simple Pay Back approach has been considered to define the economic feasibility of cogeneration in small size applications with the varying of some economic variables (first cost, gas price, operating hours per year ...). © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Experiments demonstrate that both evacuated tubes present a good heat transfer with the fluid of water, the heating efficiency is about 70-80%, and the water is easy to boil when liquid rate is less than 0.0046 kg/s. However, the efficiency of solar concentrating system with evacuated tube for heating N2 gas is less than 40% when the temperature of N2 gas reaches 320-460 °C.

Dynamic thermal simulation software, thermal analysis system (TAS), was employed to simulate the performance of adobe constructions using synthetic weather data to reproduce the climatic conditions for three regions from different latitudes in Mexico. An orthogonal array Taguchi was used to define the range of models required to test the various relevant performance parameters and to relate these through observed behaviour patterns. With this tool it was possible to develop an understanding of the complex interactions between variables.

WAT is the physiological site of energy storage as lipids. In addition, it has been more recently recognized as an active participant in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. In obesity, WAT is characterized by an increased production and secretion of a wide range of inflammatory molecules including TNF-α and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which may have local effects on WAT physiology but also systemic effects on other organs. Recent data indicate that obese WAT is infiltrated by macrophages, which may be a major source of locally-produced pro-inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, weight loss is associated with a reduction in the macrophage infiltration of WAT and an improvement of the inflammatory profile of gene expression. Several factors derived not only from adipocytes but also from infiltrated macrophages probably contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Most of them are overproduced during obesity, including leptin, TNF-α, IL-6 and resistin. Conversely, expression and plasma levels of adiponectin, an insulin-sensitising effector, are down-regulated during obesity. Leptin could modulate TNF-α production and macrophage activation. TNF-α is overproduced in adipose tissue of several rodent models of obesity and has an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in these species. However, its actual involvement in glucose metabolism disorders in humans remains controversial. IL-6 production by human adipose tissue increases during obesity. It may induce hepatic CRP synthesis and may promote the onset of cardiovascular complications. Both TNF-α and IL-6 can alter insulin sensitivity by triggering different key steps in the insulin signalling pathway. In rodents, resistin can induce insulin resistance, while its implication in the control of insulin sensitivity is still a matter of debate in humans. Adiponectin is highly expressed in WAT, and circulating adiponectin levels are decreased in subjects with obesity-related insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. Adiponectin inhibits liver neoglucogenesis and promotes fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. In addition, adiponectin counteracts the pro-inflammatory effects of TNF-α on the arterial wall and probably protects against the development of arteriosclerosis. In obesity, the pro-inflammatory effects of cytokines through intracellular signalling pathways involve the NF-κB and JNK systems. Genetic or pharmacological manipulations of these effectors of the inflammatory response have been shown to modulate insulin sensitivity in different animal models. In humans, it has been suggested that the improved glucose tolerance observed in the presence of thiazolidinediones or statins is likely related to their anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, it can be considered that obesity corresponds to a sub-clinical inflammatory condition that promotes the production of pro-inflammatory factors involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.","Adipocyte; Adipokines; Diabetes; Macrophage; Obesity; Visceral adipose tissue","adiponectin; interleukin 6; leptin; resistin; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adipose tissue; biosynthesis; blood; human; immunology; inflammation; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; macrophage; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physiology; review; signal transduction; Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Inflammation; Insulin Resistance; Interleukin-6; Leptin; Lipid Metabolism; Macrophages; Obesity; Resistin; Signal Transduction; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745896155

When SESHPS is operated at combined modes 2, the energy-saving rate with and without heat storage water tank is 14.5% and 10.4%, respectively, compared with ground source heat pump (GSHP). As for the overall effect, the combined operation mode with water tank in which the heated water flows through the solar collector first and then through the buried coil is preferable. The results are significant for the engineering design, operation and management of SESHPS. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Target of this study was to investigate the effect of the heating temperature in the range of 120-139 °C and the filling temperature after cooling down to 4-14 °C prior to storage for 24 and 96 h at 4 °C on a system comprising milk and 400 ppm kappa-2 type of carrageenan. The textural properties and the stability of such systems mainly depend on the interaction of the carrageenan and the casein micelle surface which was assessed by means of the hysteresis loop area between the upward and downward flow curves upon variation of the shear stress. The loop area was used as a dimension for the energy required breaking down the systems' textural structure. The hysteresis loop area was found to be significantly increased the higher the heating temperature and the lower the cooling temperature was. During storage, a further influence of the process parameters on structural development between casein and carrageenan was observed. Structure point analysis, small angle oscillatory rheology and particle size measurements were used for further explanation of the results of the hysteresis loop area. Particle size measurements indicated an aggregation phenomenon in the micellar casein dominated microdomains at increasing UHT heating temperatures. Variation of the carrageenan concentration enlightened the participation of casein dominated microdomains in the mixed system's texture. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are few researches on its application on root/stem vegetables. Bamboo shoot is a type of root/stem vegetables with high economic value in Taiwan. It is also enjoyed by Taiwanese and Asian people. This study experimented with vacuum cooling in combination with hydrocooling and vacuum drying on harvested bamboo shoots. It intended to discuss the relationships among the temperature of cooling water, the pressure of vacuum chamber, and the temperature of bamboo shoots during these processes. The experimental results showed that multi-stage vacuum pressure reserving technique combined with hydrocooling could reduce the temperature of bamboo shoots efficiently. It has the advantage of minimizing the energy consumed by the vacuum system. In this study, bamboo shoots were treated with vacuum cooling and hydrocooling process, and then vacuum dried to reduce the water content of the surface and bamboo crust. It was proven to prolong the storage time and improve the freshness preserving quality efficiently. The finding provides a possibility of shipping bamboo shoots to nearby countries via sea transportation. As a result, the competitiveness of Taiwan-produced bamboo shoots could be enhanced to an international scale. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a thermal balance applied to these systems, an analytic model was formulated to simulate its behavior and to consider the time variation of the environmental temperature, solar radiation, heat storage in the wall and the temperature of the room to be ventilated. The analytical results were compared against experimental data, creating an experimentally validated model that gives confidence on the accuracy and trustworthiness of the analytic proposal. Six tests were carried out in the experimental model. In four of them, the heat flux simulation was performed with electrical resistors; in the other two, solar radiation was directly employed. The results show that the thermal performance of the system can be appropriately determined and described by the analytical model, within a small margin of error. The proposed analytic model can calculate the behavior of a heat discharge system in walls by simply knowing the dimensions of the prototype and the environmental conditions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

K1A 0H3, Canada","This paper reviews the nutrient storage dynamics and body changes of Red Knots Calidris canutus islandica during migration through their final spring stopover area in Iceland and after arrival on the breeding grounds in the northeastern Canadian High Arctic at Alert. In Iceland, Red Knots not only accumulate large stores of fat and protein, but also undergo extensive morphological changes (increases in 'flight machinery' - flight muscles, heart, fat - and decreases in 'baggage' - stomach, intestines, leg muscles) that leave them well adapted for the flight to the breeding grounds. At Alert, early arrivals have substantial stores of fat and protein remaining. Subsequent body changes involve a rapid loss of these stores and a simultaneous rebuilding of various organs (e.g. restoration of digestive apparatus, development of gonads) which transforms them from a state adapted for flight to one that is suitable for breeding. Stable isotope studies show few of the stores, if any, are used for egg production. The stores could also be used as an energy source for early season survival during food shortage or poor weather. Their major purpose, however, may be to fuel the physical changes needed for breeding. The level of stores acquired at the final stopover during migration can affect survival in several ways. (1) Enhanced survival under difficult conditions: birds captured in Iceland and known to have survived a series of particularly severe summers had been in significantly better condition when caught than birds for which there were no subsequent records. (2) Longer average survival: for previously-banded birds captured in Iceland there was a positive relationship between numbers of summers survived and their condition in Iceland. (3) Reduced survival associated with inadequate stores; in North America, many rufa Red Knots passing through the final stopover area in Delaware Bay, USA, were unable to acquire adequate stores in the period 1997-2002 - this led to a dramatic decrease in annual survival rate, which was enough to account for a 50% decrease in the wintering population in Tierra del Fuego. Failure to maintain adequate habitat and food resources required by Red Knots and other shorebirds at their final spring stopover areas will almost surely lead to reduced reproductive success and survival, and consequent population decline.","Body condition; Body stores; Breeding; Migration; Survival","breeding population; breeding site; egg production; fat; population decline; protein; reproductive success; stable isotope; stopover; survival; wader; Alert; Arctic; Canada; Delaware Bay; Ellesmere Island; Iceland; North America; Nunavut; South America; Tierra del Fuego [(ARC) South America]; United States; Aves; Calidris canutus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646583573

We have used grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation for the modeling of the hydrogen and methane mixture storage at 293 K and pressure of methane and hydrogen mixture up to 2 MPa. We have found that these pores serve as efficient vessels for the storage of hythane fuel near ambient temperatures and low pressures. We find that, for carbons having optimized slitlike pores of size H ≅ 7 Å (pore width that can accommodate one adsorbed methane layer), and bulk hydrogen mole fraction ≥0.9, the volumetric stored energy exceeds the 2010 target of 5.4 MJ dm-3 established by the U.S. FreedomCAR Partnership. At the same condition, the content of hydrogen in slitlike carbon pores is ≅ 7% by energy. Thus, we have obtained the composition corresponding to hythane fuel in carbon nanospaces with greatly enhanced volumetric energy in comparison to the traditional compression method. We proposed the simple system with added extra container filled with pure free/adsorbed methane for adjusting the composition of the desorbed mixture as needed during delivery. Our simulation results indicate that light slit pore carbon nanomaterials with optimized parameters are suitable filling vessels for storage of hythane fuel.

Generally, these wastes are temporarily stored in the sanitary centre for partial activity decay and then they are managed by an authorized company. However, sometimes hospitals do not have enough storage capacity for all the RIA wastes. The treatment of these wastes with the aim of volume reduction would solve storage problems and would result in a decrease of later management costs. Membrane processes are being applied more and more often in the nuclear industry for removing radioisotopes and reducing waste volume thanks to some advantages such as effectiveness and less energy consumption. The purpose of this research is to study the feasibility of treating radioactive liquid wastes from RIA by means of membrane techniques. Some experimental tests with ultrafiltración (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were carried out with real RIA wastes. This paper presents membrane performance with regard to radioactivity removal in these experiments.

Systematic experiments on radiation-induced damage effects revealed the following results: in contrast to standard and oxygen-enriched float zone (FZ) silicon devices no space charge sign inversion was observed after irradiation. It is shown that the radiation-generated concentration of deep acceptors, dominating the behavior of n-type FZ diodes, is compensated by creation of shallow donors. Thus a positive space charge is maintained throughout the irradiation up to the highest fluence and even during prolonged elevated-temperature annealing cycles. Defect analysis studies using thermally stimulated current measurements attribute the effect to a damage-induced shallow donor at EC-0.23 eV. It is argued that, as in the case of thermal donors, oxygen dimers, out diffusing from the Cz substrate during the diode processing, are responsible precursers. Results from extensive annealing experiments at elevated temperatures are verified by comparison with prolonged room-temperature annealing. These results showed that in contrast to FZ detectors, which always have to be cooled, room-temperature storage during beam off periods of future elementary particle physics experiments would even be beneficial for n-type epi-silicon detectors. A dedicated experiment at CERN-PS had successfully proven this expectation. It was verified, that in such a scenario the depletion voltage for the epi-detector could always be kept at a moderate level throughout the full S-LHC operation (foreseen upgrade of the large hadron collider). Practically no difference with respect to FZ-silicon devices was found in the damage-induced bulk generation current. The charge trapping measured with 90Sr electrons (mip's) is also almost identical to what was expected. A charge collection efficiency of 60% (2500 e) in 50 μm n-type epi-diodes after 24 GeV/c proton irradiation with Φeq=6.2×1015 cm-2 was reported recently, independent of the operating temperature down to -20 °C. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In the laboratory of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) at the electron storage ring BESSY II in Berlin, X-ray detectors can be calibrated with low uncertainties. Two complementary approaches are realized for energy-dispersive detectors. One approach uses the storage ring as primary source standard and the detector response to the calculable spectral photon flux is measured in the undispersed synchrotron radiation. This requires the operation of the storage ring with only a few stored electrons. The other approach is the comparison to a primary detector standard, mainly a cryogenic electrical substitution radiometer. Here, monochromatized radiation of very high spectral purity has to be used which is available at different beamlines in the laboratory in the photon energy range from the UV up to about 120 keV. This method can also be applied for the calibration of non-energy-dispersive detectors. With monochromatized radiation, the response function of energy-dispersive detectors is recorded and compared to Monte Carlo simulations. A photon-energy-dependent parameterization of the response function allows deconvoluting the experimental spectra. The responsivity of Si photodiodes and the detection efficiency of Si(Li), HPGe and CdTe detectors are determined with low uncertainties in a broad spectral range. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Based on previous studies we developed an isotachophoretic (ITP) method which allows, in principle, the simultaneous determination of all metabolites of glycolysis. Since glucose metabolites are small anions, mobility of some of them may overlap in isotachophoresis and, therefore, partial mixed zones are generated. By variation of the leading/terminating system, however, it is possible to separate the compounds of interest. In this communication, we describe a method for analysis of glucose metabolites in erythrocytes from healthy donors during storage in blood bags, and from patients with thalassemia, with special respect to intracellular 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate, lactate and ATP/ADP. The well known characteristic changes of glycolysis in erythrocytes during blood storage and in erythrocytes from thalassemia patients, which are often analysed by separate enzymatic assays, could be confirmed with this isotachophoretic procedure. The method is currently adapted for analysis of glycolysis in neutrophil granulocytes and cancer cells which requires some modifications of sample preparation and performance of the isotachophoretic analysis. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, practical applications of the system are hindered by the relatively high stabilities of the compounds and uncertainty of their reaction paths. Understanding the mechanism of hydrogen interactions with the host structures is essential for further development. Here, we calculated the electronic structures and total energies of lithium hydride (LiH), lithium imide (Li2 NH), and lithium amide (LiN H2) using a first-principles full potential approach. The estimated formation enthalpies for the two-step reactions, Li3 N+2 H2 ↔ Li2 NH+LiH+ H2 ↔LiN H2 +2LiH are -162.05 and -40.94 kJ/mol, comparable to the experimental values of -165 and -45.5 kJ/mol, respectively. The bonding interaction characteristics and the stability of these materials were further analyzed from the electronic structures. It is noted that the N atom bonds unequally with the two H atoms in lithium amide. As a result, the amide LiN H2 can dissociate in two almost equivalent transient steps: Li+ + (N H2) -; and (LiNH)- + H+. The reaction of the relevant species may evolve N H3 as a transient gas in the (LiN H2 +LiH) system. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751340818

In this work structural changes of high-energy ball-milled MgHx and MgH2/Cr2O3 with varying hydrogen content were investigated with small and ultra small-angle neutron scattering (SANS/USANS) using different milling parameters, e.g., milling time, vial and ball material, to obtain information about hydrogen sorption and desorption mechanisms. In a first attempt size distributions of spheres with radii from 1 nm up to 20 μm were calculated in order to characterize the influence of cycling history on the microstructure. Apparent changes of crystallite and particle structures due to hydrogen loading and unloading were found. The use of Cr2O3 nanoparticle additives result in distinct differences of the obtained scattering curves, which indicate that Cr2O3 not only has a catalytic function for the hydrogen sorption properties of MgH2 but also serves as an agent to breakup particles during the milling process.

Recent studies have revealed the role of type 2 Ang II receptor (AT2R) in the control of energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. The contribution of the AT2R to adaptation to starvation was tested using AT2R-deficient (AT2R y/-) mice. Fasted AT2R y/- mice exhibited a lower loss of adipose tissue weight associated to a decreased free fatty acid (FFA) release from stored lipids than the controls. In vitro studies show that Ang II causes an AT1R-mediated antilipolytic effect in isolated adipocytes. AT1R expression is up-regulated by fasting in both genotypes, but the increase is more pronounced in AT2R y/- mice. In addition, the increased muscle β-oxidation displayed in AT2R y/- mice on a fed state, persists after fasting compared with wild-type mice. In liver from fed mice, AT2R deficiency did not modify the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. However, in response to fasting, the large increase of the expression of this subset of genes exhibited by wild-type mice, was impaired in AT2R y/- mice. Taken together, decreased lipolytic capacity and increased muscle fatty acid oxidation participate in the decreased plasma FFA observed in fasted AT2R y/- mice and could account for the lower FFA metabolism in the liver. These data reveal an important physiological role of AT2R in metabolic adaptations to fasting.

Organic phototransistors (OPTs) in which 6-T and pentacene were incorporated were fabricated. Their response behaviors were investigated under conditions of irradiation by either modulated or continuous ultraviolet light with various intensities. Both devices showed two distinguishable responses, i.e., fast and slow responses from photoconductive and photovoltaic effects, respectively. The fast response is mainly the result of the generation of mobile carriers by the absorption of a photon energy higher than the band gap energy of the semiconductor and, subsequently, an increase in conductance via a greater flow of photogenerated mobile carriers into the channel layer. On the other hand, the slow response, which was confirmed by a light induced shift in the threshold voltage (Vth) or the switch-on voltage (VO), is the result of a slow release of accumulated and trapped electrons in the semiconductor-gate dielectric interface. The VO is defined as the flatband voltage of devices. Below the VO, the channel current with the gate voltage is off current, and the channel current increases with the gate voltage above the VO. The speed of release of the accumulated charge was dependent on the type of semiconductor used. Pentacene OPTs showed a particularly long retention time. Even after storage for ten days, the shifted VO (or Vth) for the pentacene OPTs by light irradiation was not restored to the original value of the fresh devices. We conclude that this long sustained Vth shift renders them attractive for use in ""light-addressable nonvolatile memory devices."" © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",,"Energy gap; Light scattering; Photoconductivity; Phototransistors; Photovoltaic effects; Light irradiation; Organic field effect transistors; Organic phototransistors (OPT); Pentacene; Gates (transistor)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751096704

The electrolyzer produces hydrogen and oxygen from off-peak electricity generated by the renewable energy sources (wind turbine and photovoltaic array), for later use in the fuel cell to produce on-peak electricity. An issue related to this system is the control of the hydrogen loop (electrolyzer, tank, fuel cell). A number of control algorithms were developed to decide when to produce hydrogen and when to convert it back to electricity, most of them assuming that the electrolyzer and the fuel cell run alternatively to provide nominal power (full power). This paper presents a complete model of a stand-alone renewable energy system with hydrogen storage controlled by a dynamic fuzzy logic controller (FLC). In this system, batteries are used as energy buffers and for short time storage. To study the behavior of such a system, a complete model is developed by integrating the individual sub-models of the fuel cell, the electrolyzer, the power conditioning units, the hydrogen storage system, and the batteries. An analysis of the performances of the dynamic fuzzy logic controller is then presented. This model is useful for building efficient peak power control. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The manufacturing cost per watt has fallen and the daylight-to-power conversion efficiency increased. At the same time, the perception that the sun has to be directly shining on it for a PV array to work has faded. On some of those roadside applications, particularly for remote emergency telephones or for temporary roadwork signage where a utility electrical power connection is not practical, the keen observer will spot, usually in addition to a PV array, a small wind-turbine and an electrical cabinet quite obviously (by virtue of its volume) containing a storage battery. In the UK, we have the lions share (>40%) of Europe's entire wind power resource although, despite press coverage of the ""anti-wind"" lobby to the contrary, we have hardly started to harvest this clean and free energy source. Taking this (established and proven) roadside solution one step further, we will consider higher power applications. A cellular phone system is one where a multitude of remote radio base stations (RBS) are required to provide geographical coverage. With networks developing into the so called ""3G"" technologies the need for base stations has tripled, as each 3G cell covers only 1/3 the geographical area of its ""2G"" counterpart. To cover >90% of the UK's topology (>97% population coverage) with 3G cellular technology will requires in excess of 12,000 radio base stations per operator network. In 2001, there were around 25,000 established sites and, with an anticipated degree of collocation by necessity, that figure is forecast to rise to >47,000. Of course, the vast majority of these sites have a convenient grid connection. However, it is easy to see that the combination of wind and PV power generation and an energy storage system may be an interesting solution for the more rural and remote applications - particularly those where an electrical supply is not available or practical - and this paper attempts to explore the current practicalities of such a power generation solution for those cellular phone base stations. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Debériotstraat 32, 3000 Leuven, Belgium","Icefishes of the perciform suborder Notothenioidei dominate the Antarctic ichthyofauna. These species originated from a benthic ancestor and do not possess a swimbladder. However, some notothenioids have achieved neutral buoyancy through skeletal reductions as well as storage of lipids to reduce body mass relative to seawater. These adaptations enable them to exploit the highly productive pelagic realm. Mobilizing these lipid reserves in periods of critically low food intake may lead to buoyancy problems. Accumulating and conserving these reserves may slow down the development of somatic and reproductive tissues and hence future reproductive output. We constructed a dynamic state variable model to investigate how ingested energy is partitioned over 3 state variables: lipid reserves, structural protein body mass and egg development. Two forms of the model differed in that lipid reserves were either included in or excluded from the total metabolic energy budget of an individual. The model was parameterised for the Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum, a key species in the pelagic food web of the high Antarctic zone of the Southern Ocean. In Pleuragramma, lipids are stored in unique extracellular lipid sacs, which are thought to serve as buoyancy aids and energy reserves. The model predicts optimal habitat selection and an optimal energy allocation strategy by maximizing future reproductive output. The environment is simulated using vertical gradients in water temperature, optical properties, food availability and predation risk. The form of the model that considers lipids as metabolically inactive reserves best replicates field measurements of fat content and yields high values for fitness in Pleuragramma. Uncoupling fat reserves from metabolism, through the development of extracellular lipid sacs, probably represents a key adaptation in the evolution towards a pelagic lifestyle in a fish species with a low scope for activity. © Inter-Research 2006.","Antarctica; Dynamic state variable model; Lipid metabolism; Notothenioidei; Pelagic fish; Southern Ocean","adaptation; buoyancy; energy budget; energy resource; fat reserve; fitness; lipid; pelagic fish; reproductive productivity; resource allocation; Southern Ocean; Notothenioidei; Perciformes; Pleuragramma; Pleuragramma antarcticum; Salangini",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845894461

A pulsed high voltage with a short rise time of under 30 ns is employed to generate streamer discharges simultaneously at all tips of a needle-array electrode in nitrogen. The large number of streamer discharges prevent glow-to-arc transitions caused by inhomogeneous thermalization. SOS diodes are used as an opening switch to shorten the rise time. Circuit parameters such as the capacitance of a primary energy storage capacitor and/or the inductance of a secondary energy storage inductor are determined by experimental results using dummy resistive loads. The results show that circuit parameters adequate for producing atmospheric glow discharges are different from those for producing corona discharges. The energy transfer efficiency of the pulsed power generator has a maximum value of 75% at 193 Ω dummy load resistance. Voltage-current characteristics of the glow discharge show two regions: constant voltage (normal glow) and an increasing voltage with discharge current (abnormal glow). The glow current is drastically decreased by eliminating the SOS diodes, in which case the charging voltage is directly applied to the electode. Spatial-and time-averaged electron densities in a positive column are estimated from calculations based on nitrogen swarm data. The electron density is estimated to be 1.8 × 1011 cm-3, which is much larger than 9.7 × 109 cm-3 in the case without the SOS diodes. A photograph is presented.

In this letter, ab initio density functional theory calculations reveal how the stabilities of the AlH4 and BH4 complex anions will be affected by reducing net anionic charge. Tetrahedral AlH4 and BH4 complexes are found to be distorted with the decrease of negative charge. One H-H distance becomes smaller and the charge density will overlap between them at a small anion charge. The activation energies to release of H2 from AlH4 and BH4 complexes are thus greatly decreased. We demonstrate that point defects such as neutral Na vacancies or substitution of a Na atom with Ti on the NaAlH4 (001) surface can potentially cause strong distortion of neighboring AlH4 complexes and even induce spontaneous dehydrogenation. Our results help to rationalize the conjecture that the suppression of charge transfer to AlH4 and BH4 anion as a consequence of surface defects should be very effective for improving the recycling performance of H2 in NaAlH4 and LiBH4. The understanding gained here will aid in the rational design and development of hydrogen storage materials based on these two systems. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750921439

The films serve as a model system for powdered FeTi, with grains that are (partly) covered with Pd, which serves as a protection for severe oxidation. Two FeTi compositions near the 50/50 composition were studied. The hydrogen uptake kinetics as a function of temperature and pressure were measured by probing the differential pressure between a small hydriding reaction chamber and a reference chamber. Both compositions showed first order kinetics for the largest portion of the uptake. Using results of additional measurements in which the thickness of the layers was varied, a model is proposed in which the uptake proceeds via fast channels through the film, followed by slower diffusion into the bulk. Finally, the influence of oxidation was studied. An FeTi-oxide underneath the Pd layer is a barrier for H diffusion. It was found that by annealing the H uptake rate could be increased. This is probably due to the decomposition of the oxide. Samples partly covered with Pd and partly by FeTi-oxides, obtained by decomposing the fully covered structure by air annealing at 250 °C, showed uptake throughout the entire FeTi film with an even faster rate than in a fully covered film. Some explanation with simple models of the observed phenomena is given. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The new compounds are based on tridentate chelating sites (tpy-type ligands, tpy = 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine) and most of them carry appended anthryl chromophores. Complexes 2 a and 2b were synthesized through the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction between 9-anthrylboronic acid and the chloro ligands on the presursor species la and 1b, respectively. The monocoupling product 2c was also synthesized as the starting complex for a dimetallic complex under optimized Suzuki coupling conditions. The palladium(0)-catalyzed homocoupling reaction on complexes la and 2c led to dimetallic RuII species 2d and 2e, respectively. The solid structures of complexes 2 a and 2b were characterized by X-ray diffraction. The absorption spectra, redox behavior, luminescence properties (both at room temperature and at 77 K), and transient absorption spectra and decays of 2a-e were investigated. The absorption spectra of all new species are dominated by ligandcentered (LC) bands in the UV region and metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) bands in the visible region. The new compounds undergo reversible metal-centered oxidation processes and several ligand-centered reduction processes, which have been assigned to specific sites. The complexes exhibit luminescence both at room temperature in fluid solution and at 77 K in rigid matrices; the emission was attributed to 3MLCT states at room temperature and to the lowest-lying anthracene triplet (3An) at low temperature, except for 2c, which does not contain any anthryl chromophore and whose low temperature emission is also of MLCT origin. The luminescence lifetimes of complexes 2a-d showed that multi-chromophoric behavior occurs in these species, allowing the luminescence lifetime of the RuII-based chromophores to be prolonged to the microsecond timescale, with the anthryl groups behaving as energy-storage elements for the repopulation of the 3MLCT state. Nanosecond transient-absorption spectroscopy confirmed the equilibration process between the triplet MLCT and An levels at room temperature. Thermodynamic and kinetic factors governing the equilibration time and the lifetime of the equilibrated excited state are discussed. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

This distribution provides event generators for V (W or Z) + jets (≤4 jets), V V + jets (≤2 jets) and QCD multi-jet (≤4 jets) production processes at pp and p over(p, ̄) collisions, in addition to the four bottom quark productions implemented in our previous work (GR@PPA_4b). Also included are the top-pair and top-pair + jet production processes, where the correlation between the decay products are fully reproduced at the tree level. Namely, processes up to seven-body productions can be simulated, based on ordinary Feynman diagram calculations at the tree level. In this version, the GR@PPA framework and the process dependent matrix-element routines are separately provided. This makes it easier to add further new processes, and allows users to make a choice of processes to implement. This version also has several new features to handle complicated multi-body production processes. A systematic way to combine many subprocesses to a single base-subprocess has been introduced, and a new method has been adopted to calculate the color factors of complicated QCD processes. They speed up the calculation significantly. Program summary: Title of program:GR@PPA (v2.7). Catalogue identifier:ADRH_v2_0. Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADRH_v2_0. Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University of Belfast, N. Ireland. Operating system under which the program has been tested:UNIX. Programming language used:Fortran77. Other CPC library programs required:PYTHIA, HERWIG, BASES, SPRING. Memory required to execute with typical data:56.5 kwords for an integration, 74.6 kwords for an event generation. Number of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 570 587. No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.:143 327. Distribution format:tar.gz. Nature of physical problem:The multi-legs interaction processes have become more important with increasing the colliding energy available at the high energy collider experiments. At hadron-collider experiments, since thousands of Feynman diagrams contributes in the single interaction process, the faster and more stable calculation to obtain the results is desirable. Method of solution: GR@PPA is an event generator for V (W or Z) + jets (≤ 4 jets), V V + jets (≤ 2 jets) and QCD multi-jet (≤ 4 jets) production processes at pp and p over(p, ̄) collisions, in addition to the four bottom quark productions implemented in our previous work (GR@PPA_4b).

They speed up the calculation significantly. Restrictions on the complexity of the program: The interference between decay fermions from the boson and those from other sources is ignored in the diagram calculation.

Both melt state rheology and asphalt concrete mix (ACM) were investigated. In the melt state analysis, dynamic shear rheology, storage stability, artificial ageing, and performance grading (PG) were studied. The PG grading of polymer modified asphalt (PMA) is correlated to the elastic properties of the polymers. Both resins improved the rheological properties, reduced the temperature susceptibility, showed better storage stability, and increase the upper grading (performance) temperature of the base asphalt. The two polymers showed similar ageing characteristics with little influence on flow activation energy. In asphalt concrete mix analysis, Marshall stability, stripping (durability), resilient modulus, and permanent deformation tests were performed. Polymer-modified asphalt concrete mix (PMACM) has increased percent retained stability and the resilient modulus when compared with ACM. The elastic modulus of PMA and the resilient modulus of their ACM followed the same trend. Weak influence on water sensitivity was observed, but excellent rutting resistance was obtained for PMACM over ACM. EA (much cheaper than EBA) produced satisfactory properties of PMA and superior ACM properties when blended with the high asphaltenes Arabian asphalt. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Acrylate polymer; Asphalt concrete mix; Performance grading; Polymer modified asphalt; Storage modulus; Storage stability","Activation energy; Asphalt; Concentration (process); Polymer blends; Rheology; Acrylate polymers; Asphalt concrete mix; Performance grading; Polymer modified asphalt; Storage modulus; Storage stability; Copolymers; aging; concrete; copolymer; polyacrylate; polyethylene; rheology; stability; terpolymer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750299000

Here we present a comprehensive study of its deinsertion/ insertion mechanism by high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy on thin platelet-type particles of LixFePO4 (bPnma axis normal to the surface). We find that the lithium deinsertion/insertion process is not well-described by the classical shrinking core model. Compositions of the same x value obtained by both deinsertion and insertion gave the same results, namely that the LixFePO4 so formed consists of a core of FePO4 surrounded by a shell of LiFePO 4 with respective ratios dependent on x. We suggest that lattice mismatch between the two end members may be at the origin of the peculiar microstructure observed. Furthermore, because of the appearance of isosbestic points on the overlaid EELS spectra, we provide direct experimental evidence that the nanometer interface between single-phase areas composed of LiFePO 4 or FePO4 is the juxtaposition of the two end members and not a solid solution. One future prospect of such knowledge is to determine strategies on how to control, on a large scale, the synthesis of nanometersized thin platelet-type particles to prepare high-rate LiFePO4 electrodes for future energy storage devices. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Energy dissipation; Microstructure; Nanostructured materials; Particle size analysis; High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy; Insertion electrodes; Lattice mismatch; Two phase systems; Lithium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845254091

It absorbed 4.46 wt.% hydrogen at 606 K under the atmosphere of 3 MPa H2 within an hour for the first cycle. Even at 377 K, it still absorbed 1.77 wt.% hydrogen within an hour. No obvious degradation in hydrogen absorption/desorption property was observed for this sample after three hydriding/dehydriding cycles at 606 K.

A chip integrated energy source must accomplish different design related requirements. Because of the very limited space in a miniaturized system on a silicon chip, an integrated energy source must have a large volumetric energy density. With regard to the monolithic chip integration it should be possible to fabricate the energy source within a CMOS process. In addition, the energy source should be environmentally friendly, meaning that the energy source must be built up only from non-toxic materials. This paper presents a novel realization of a self-breathing chip integrated fuel cell which offers the opportunity to meet these requirements. A first generation prototype of the chip integrated fuel cell was built up and its working principle could be proved.

Although reductions in particle size and the addition of titanium based compounds have been found to improve the kinetics significantly, the physical understanding remains elusive. Density functional theory is used to calculate the energy of the potential low energy surfaces of NaAlH4 to establish the equilibrium particle shape, and furthermore to determine the deposition energy of Ti/TiH2 and the substitutional energy for Ti@Al and Ti@Na-sites on the exposed facets. The substitutional processes are energetically preferred and the Na-vacancy formation energy is found to be strongly reduced in the presence of Ti. The barrier for H 2 desorption is found to depend significantly on surface morphology and in particular on the presence of Ti, where the activation energy for H 2 desorption on NaAlH4{001} surfaces can drop to 0.98 eV - in good agreement with the experimentally observed activation energy for dehydrogenation. © the Owner Societies 2006.",,"aluminum derivative; hydrogen; nanoparticle; sodium aluminum hydride; sodium derivative; titanium; adsorption; article; catalysis; chemical model; chemistry; quantum theory; surface property; Adsorption; Aluminum Compounds; Catalysis; Hydrogen; Models, Chemical; Nanoparticles; Quantum Theory; Sodium Compounds; Surface Properties; Titanium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750503772

Typically, they are equipped with an internal combustion engine, and also with an electrical storage system, such as a bank of batteries or ultra-capacitors. While braking, these vehicles may convert kinetic energy to electrical energy and send it back to the electrical storage system (regenerative braking). The whole vehicle system may be abstracted to one consisting of two energy sources, one of them rechargeable and the other consumable, that feed or receive energy from an energy consumer. A centralized control strategy is required to define the instantaneous power flows among these three main components. In this work, we derive the power split between the two sources such that fuel consumption is minimized, while the vehicle performs a given velocity cycle. Bounds on the power flows from both sources are considered. There is also a constraint of an integral nature that arises from the fact that the energy of the electrical storage system must remain between proper limits, in order to avoid physical damage. The problem is posed as a finite horizon dynamical optimization problem with constraints and solved by a dynamic programming (DP) approach. The hybrid electrical vehicle being developed in the University of Río Cuarto, Argentina is taken as the case study. © 2006 IMACS.","Cost optimal control; Dynamic programming; Road vehicle control","Braking; Capacitors; Dynamic programming; Electric batteries; Energy management; Fuel consumption; Internal combustion engines; Kinetic energy; Optimization; Cost optimal control; Electrical storage system; Finite horizon dynamical optimization problem; Hybrid electric vehicles; Power flow; Road vehicle control; Electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749235302

The findings showed that heat storage terms ranged significantly in the daytime and weakly in the nighttime, and the absolute values of sensible and latent heat storage fluxes were obviously greater than other heat storage terms in all seasons. In addition, the absolute values of total heat storage fluxes reached the peak in the hot-dry season, then were higher in the rainy season, and reached the minimum in the cool-dry season. The ratios of heat storage fluxes to net radiation generally decreased with time in the daytime, moreover, the sensible and latent heat storage dominated a considerable fraction of net radiation, while other heat storage contents occupied a smaller fraction of the net radiation and the peak value was not above 3.5%. In the daytime, the ratios of the total heat storage to net radiation were greater and differences in these ratios were distinct among seasons before 12:00, and then they became lower and differences were small among seasons after 12:00. The energy closure was improved when the storage terms were considered in the energy balance, which indicated that heat storage terms should not been neglected. The energy closure of tropical seasonal rain forest was not very well due to effects of many factors. The results would help us to further understand energy transfer and mass exchange between tropical forest and atmosphere. Moreover, they would supply a research basis for studying energy closure at other places. © Science in China Press 2006.","Energy closure; Heat storage flux; Tropical seasonal rain forest; Xishuangbanna","Absolute values; Air column; Carbon fluxes; Dry seasons; Energy closure; Ground heat storage; Mass exchange; Meteorological factors; Net radiation; Observation data; Peak values; Rainy seasons; Soil heat flux; TO effect; Tropical forest; Tropical seasonal rain forest; Variation characteristics; Xishuangbanna; Drought; Energy transfer; Enthalpy; Latent heat; Ontology; Rain; Tropics; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749126942

Box 1, 1755 ZG Petten, Netherlands","Hydrogen is the fuel for fuel cells with the highest cell voltage. A drawback for the use of hydrogen is the low energy density storage capacity, even at high pressures. Liquid fuels such as gasoline and methanol have a high energy density but lead to the emission of the greenhouse gas CO2. Ammonia could be the ideal bridge fuel, having a high energy density at relative low pressure and no (local) CO2 emission. Ammonia as a fuel for the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) appears to be very attractive, as shown by cell tests with electrolyte supported cells (ESC) as well as anode supported cells (ASC) with an active area o 81 cm2. The cell voltage was measured as function of the electrical current, temperature, gas composition and ammonia (NH3) flow. With NH3 as fuel, electrical cell efficiencies up to 70% (LHV) can be achieved at 0.35 A/cm2 and 60% (LHV) at 0.6 A/cm2. The cell degradation during 3000 h of operation was comparable with H2 fueled measurements. Due to the high temperature and the catalytic active Ni/YSZ anode, NH3 cracks at the anode into H2 and N2 with a conversion of &gt;99.996%. The high NH3 conversion is partly due to the withdrawal of H2 by the electrochemical cell reaction. The remaining NH3 will be converted in the afterburner of the system. The NOx outlet concentration of the fuel cell is low, typically &lt;0.5 ppm at temperatures below 950°C and around 4 ppm at 1000°C. A SOFC system fueled with ammonia is relative simple compared with a carbon containing fuel, since no humidification of the fuel is necessary. Moreover the endothermic ammonia cracking reaction consumes part of the heat produced by the fuel cell, by which less cathode cooling air is required compared with H2 fueled systems. Therefore, the system for a NH3 fueled SOFC will have relatively low parasitic power losses and relative small heat exchangers for preheating the cathode air flow.

In this paper, existing low leakage SRAM structures are analyzed by several SPEC2000 benchmarks. As expected, the examined SRAM architectures have static power consumption lower than the conventional 6-T SRAM cell. However, the additional activities performed to enter and to exit the sleep mode also lead to higher dynamic energy. Our study demonstrates that, due to this, the overall energy consumption achieved by the known low-leakage techniques is greater than the conventional approach. In the second part of this paper, a novel low-leakage SRAM cell is presented. The proposed structure establishes when to enter and to exit the sleep mode, on the basis of the data stored in it, without introducing time and energy penalties with respect to the conventional 6-T cell.

The results of the model were validated by comparison with experimental results of temperature profiles of HTF and PCM. The model was also used to investigate the effect of porosity, Stanton number, Stefan number and Peclet number on CTES system performance. The results showed that increase in porosity contributes to a higher rate of energy storage. However, for a given geometry and heat transfer coefficient, the mass of PCM charged in the unit decreases as the increase in porosity. The St number as well as the Ste number is also influential in the performance of the unit. The model is a convenient and more suitable method to determine the heat transfer characteristics of CTES system.

Because biofuels are expected to be important alternative renewable energy sources in the near future, more studies on their stability against oxidation need to be addressed. Biofuel derived from vegetable oils is well researched, currently with more attention focused on the reuse of waste oil sources than on pure vegetable oil for such production. A method to convert used palm oil, i.e., used frying oil, and residual oil of spent bleaching earths (SPE) to their respective methyl esters has been established by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. These methyl esters can be used as diesel substitute. However, the methyl esters obtained from used frying oil have a low induction period (3.42 h). In Europe, any methyl esters must have an induction period of at least 6 h in Rancimat stability to be usable as biodiesel, as required by European Biodiesel Standard (EN 14214). To meet this requirement, the used frying oil methyl esters (UFOME) obtained can be treated with different types of antioxidants, either synthetic or natural, at different treatment levels, such as vitamin E, 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (BHA), 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl- phenol (BHT), 2,5-di-terf-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), and n-propyl gallate (PG), to investigate their oxidative stability and storage behavior. The order of increasing antioxidant effectiveness with respect to the oxidative stability of UFOME is: vitamin E < BHT < TBHQ < BHA < PG. Because methyl esters derived from residual oil of SBE have an induction period of 14.6 h, their treatment with antioxidants is unnecessary.

Levels of acrylamide in the fully roasted product are a small fraction of the peak reached earlier. Glucose and moisture in green coffee do not show a significant correlation with acrylamide in roasted coffee. Pre-roasting levels of asparagine show a correlation only in Arabica coffee. The main factors affecting the level of acrylamide in roasted coffee appear to be the Arabica/Robusta ratio, with Robusta giving higher levels; time and degree of roast, with both shorter and lighter roasting at the edges of the normal roasting range giving higher levels; storage condition and time, with clear reduction at ambient storage. This storage reduction of acrylamide followed second order reaction kinetics with an activation energy of 73 KJ/mole. The acrylamide in roasted coffee is largely extracted into the brew and stable within usual time of consumption. As these four main factors also substantially affect the sensorial characteristics of the brew, and as modifications of the process have to comply with the consumer-accepted boundaries of taste profiles, only small effects on the acrylamide level are expected to be achievable. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Altogether 150 proteins showing highly significant differences in abundance between specific stages in the life cycle were highlighted; 59 of these were identified. In addition, 50 proteins with smaller changes in abundance were identified, including several novel proteins. Most noticeably, the development process was characterized by the accumulation of the major storage protein patatin isoforms and enzymes involved in disease and defense reactions.

The aim of energy storage and conversion is to obtain energy with environmental benefit, high efficiency, and low cost (namely, maximum atomic and recycling economy). Progress has been made in the fields of hydrogen storage and rechargeable batteries. The emerging nanotechnology offers great opportunities to improve the performance of existing energy storage systems. Applying nanoscale materials to energy storage offers a higher capacity compared to the bulk counterparts due to the unique properties of nanomaterials such as high surface areas, large surface-to-volume atom ratio, and size-confinement effect. In particular, one-dimensional (1D) inorganic nanostructures like tubes and wires exhibit superior electrochemical characteristics because of the combined advantages of small size and 1D morphology. Hydrogen and lithium can be stored in different 1D nanostructures in various ways, including physical and/or chemical sorption, intercalation, and electrochemical reactions.

Juvenile salmon exhibited distinct seasonal patterns of energy storage and use. The lowest levels of energy were found towards the end of winter (mean mass specific energy about 4.3 kJ·g-1). There was a rapid accumulation of fat in spring/early summer in spite of low-water temperatures (highest mean content of mass specific energy of about 5.0 kJ·g-1 in June). By early autumn (August) there was a rapid depletion of fat and energy resources. The decline in specific energy during late summer was of the same magnitude as the corresponding winter decline. Furthermore, total fat and protein content, and thus energy resources of juveniles below a hydroelectric power plant (hydrostation (HS)) differed from those at a (lower) reference station (RS). The younger fish exhibited higher gains, but also larger losses of energy resources compared to corresponding values at the RS.

By the use of the average values of the mean specific heat capacities for the phase-changed materials, analytical solutions are obtained and compared with the available experimental data in the literature. It is shown that decreasing the entry temperature of the working fluid from -4 to -15°C has a very dominant and strong effect on the PCM solidification time. The effect of the working fluid flow rate and the material of PCM capsules on the time for complete solidification and total charging is also investigated. The agreement between the present theoretical model results and the experimental data related to the cooling using small spheres and the heat storage using rectangle containers is very good.

While the ultimate goal of CO2 injection in the subsurface is mineral storage of CO2 as carbonates, short-term (&lt;50 year) storage of injected CO2 is most likely to be accomplished by ionic trapping of CO2 as bicarbonate ions (HCO 3-) and hydrogeological trapping of molecular CO 2. Here, we demonstrate a technique for quantifying ionic trapping of injected CO2 as HCO3- using geochemical data collected prior to and during 40 months of CO2 injection into a hydrocarbon reservoir at the International Energy Agency (IEA) Weyburn CO 2 Monitoring and Storage Project, Saskatchewan, Canada. As a result of injection of CO2 with a low carbon isotope ratio (δ13C value), fluid and gas samples from four selected production wells showed an increase in HCO3- concentration and a decrease in δ13C values of HCO3- and CO2 over the observation period. Isotope and mass balance calculations indicate that, after 40 months of injection, ∼80% of the HCO3- in the reservoir brines sampled from the four wells formed via dissolution and dissociation of injected CO2. This chemical and isotopic technique should be applicable to CO2 injection and storage in oil fields and in deep saline aquifers, provided there is sufficient carbon isotopic distinction between injected CO2 and baseline aquifer HCO3- and CO2. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Brines; Carbon dioxide; Concentration (process); Injection (oil wells); Isotopes; Petroleum reservoirs; Greenhouse gas; Hydrocarbon reservoirs; Hydrogeological trapping; Ionic trapping; Petroleum engineering; bicarbonate; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbonic acid; hydrocarbon; mineral; oil; sodium chloride; Brines; Carbon dioxide; Concentration (process); Injection (oil wells); Isotopes; Petroleum engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; aquifer; bicarbonate; carbon dioxide; isotopic analysis; oil field; reservoir; aquifer; article; Canada; chemical analysis; data analysis; dissociation; dissolution; environmental monitoring; gas analysis; geochemical analysis; greenhouse gas; ion transport; quantitative analysis; Bicarbonates; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Carbonates; Chemistry, Analytical; Environmental Pollutants; Extraction and Processing Industry; Industry; Ions; Models, Chemical; North Sea; Petroleum; Texas; Canada; North America; Saskatchewan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750891321

It, is focused on fluorinated and perfluorinated molecules and macromolecules used in electrochemical energy sources, i.e. storage and conversion of energy. The latter, which figure indisputably among New Energy Technologies, include lithium batteries and fuel cells based on polymeric membranes both of which have tremendous development potential in terms of performances, safety and cost reductions. The advantages inherent in fluorine, in particular its electron-withdrawing effect and the oxidation stability that it provides to the carbon-fluorine bond, make it an asset in the search for new organic molecular and macromolecular anions with extensive delocalization of the negative charge, usable both in lithium batteries and fuel cells. As for fluorinated and perfluorinated macromolecule backbones, they are currently the reference material in fuel cell ionomeric membranes but some of them are also good candidates for use in lithium-ion batteries.

These findings are supported by experimental studies which indicate that both macro and micronutrient deficiencies have long-term health implications for the offspring. Maternal nutrition directly determines foetal and placental growth and influences the in utero endocrine environment. A reduction in maternal food intake at defined stages of gestation does not necessarily compromise foetal growth but reprogrammes foetal sensitivity to later stress. When nutrient restriction is targeted over the period of maximal placental growth placental size is restricted in conjunction with a reduction in maternal plasma concentrations of counter- regulatory hormones including cortisol. These maternal adaptations appear to be accompanied by an increased sensitivity to these hormones in their resulting offspring. In late gestation, foetal growth can be compromised by a reduction in nutrient supply, but long term outcomes from nutrient restriction in early, early to mid or late gestation are very different. The maternal nutrient and endocrine environments therefore have pronounced influences on foetal endocrine sensitivity that depends on stage of gestation and result in long term outcomes predicted to compromise later health and well being. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Adipose tissue; Blood pressure; Cortisol; Kidney","corticotropin; folic acid; hydrocortisone; leptin; messenger RNA; noradrenalin; uncoupling protein 2; uncoupling protein 3; adipose tissue; birth weight; blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; diabetic obesity; diet restriction; embryo development; energy metabolism; epigenetics; fertilization in vitro; fetus development; fetus growth; fetus outcome; food intake; gene expression; gestation period; gestational age; glucose tolerance; heart rate; human; hydrocortisone blood level; hypertension; lipid storage; maternal nutrition; metabolic disorder; nonhuman; placenta development; placenta weight; priority journal; protein restriction; review; twin pregnancy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750699623

Absolute, total recombination rate coefficients for Si IV were determined using the CRYRING heavy-ion storage ring. Calculated rate coefficients were used to estimate recombination into states that could not be detected in the experiment because of field ionization. Total, as well as separate, radiative and dielectronic plasma recombination rate coefficients were determined. Methods. Stored ions were merged with an expanded electron beam in the electron cooler section of the storage ring. Recombined ions were separated from the stored ion beam in the first dipole magnet after the electron cooler and were detected with unity efficiency. The absolute radiative and dielectronic recombination rate coefficients were obtained over a center-of-mass energy range of 0-20 eV, covering Δ n = 0 core excitations up to the 3s → 3d series limit. The results of an intermediate coupling AUTOSTRUCTURE calculation were compared with the experiment. The theoretical results were also used to estimate the contribution to dielectronic recombination by high Rydberg states, which were not detected because of field ionization. The spectra were convoluted with Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distributions in the 103-10 6 K temperature range. Results. The resulting plasma recombination rate coefficients are presented and compared with theoretical results frequently used for plasma modeling. In the 103-104 K range, a significant underestimation of the calculated dielectronic recombination plasma rate coefficients was observed. Above 3 × 104 K, the agreement between our dielectronic recombination plasma rate coefficients and two of the previously published rate coefficients is better than 20%. Conclusions. The observed differences between the experimental and calculated recombination rate coefficients at low temperatures reflect the need for benchmarking experiments. Our experimentally-derived rate coefficients can guide the development of better theoretical models and lead to more accurately-calculated rate coefficients. © ESO 2006.","Atomic data; Atomic processes; Plasmas","Electron energy levels; Ion beams; Ionization of gases; Magnets; Mathematical models; Plasmas; Atomic data; Atomic processes; Dielectronic recombination; Field ionization; Silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750686014

This hormone is synthesized in adipocytes, and the cell membrane of most cells bears leptin receptors, but it exerts its action mainly in the hypothalamus by inhibiting the production of neuropeptide Y and diminishing appetite. Free and bound leptin is present in plasma, where it has a soluble receptor: sOb-R. The proportion of bound leptin varies during the lifetime according to the amount of fat in the body: the more fat, the higher the production of free leptin. The active form is considered to be free leptin, because it is able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and is the form found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Moreover, the direct injection of leptin in the hypothalamus effectively inhibits appetite and increases thermogenesis. Leptin acts in the cell via interactions with its membrane receptor. Seven isoforms of this receptor have been identified, the short (Ob-Ra) and long (Ob-Rb) forms being the best known. Ob-Ra is the membrane carrier for free leptin across the BBB from the plasma to the CSF. Although this receptor is present in many tissues, the highest concentrations are found in the choroid plexus and especially in the arcuate nucleus. Furthermore, a small proportion of plasma free leptin also reaches the brain by passive diffusion. Once it reaches the CSF, leptin binds to the Ob-Rb receptor in the neuronal membrane. This molecule is then phosphorylated by protein-kinase JAK2 in the cytosol, and the leptin-receptor complex interacts with STAT3 to inhibit peptide Y and reduce energy intake. In the periphery, leptin stimulates the oxidation of fat stores in adipocytes and other cells by means of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, subsequently reducing the lipotoxicity in cells that are not designed to store excess lipids. In addition, leptin has been found to interfere in insulin metabolism, cellular growth, placental tropism, reproduction, and immunity. In lean individuals the ratio of free to bound plasma leptin is 1:1. However, in obese persons this equilibrium is altered and the free/bound ratio can be as high as 25:1. The paradoxical finding that obese people have elevated concentrations of free leptin (an active anorexigenic) can be explained by the existence of resistance to leptin transport across the BBB. It has been shown that hypertriglyceridemia is an important cause of this resistance. The well known existence of hypertriglyceridemia in starvation has been interpreted as a natural mechanism to block the access of leptin to the CSF, which keeps the person hungry and seeking food. During the 20th century, however, a new phenomenon appeared: overnutrition and a sedentary lifestyle in large population groups. As a consequence we now confront widespread hypertriglyceridemia, for which natural evolution has not had the time to create an adaptive mechanism. Humans have fallen into a vicious circle of overfeeding with low access of leptin to the hypothalamus, and as a consequence obesity has reached the dimensions of a global epidemic. A therapeutic solution focused on leptin transport could lessen the severity of obesity in many persons. However, before we can focus on this goal, we need to identify the specific site of triglyceride-induced resistance, and then search for agonistic drugs that can act at this site. Nevertheless, to control the epidemic we also need measures to reduce the amount of fat in our diet. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Leptin; Leptin resistance; Obesity","agouti related protein; carnitine palmitoyltransferase; fatty acid; glucose; isoprotein; Janus kinase 2; leptin; leptin receptor; neuropeptide Y; orexin; proopiomelanocortin; STAT3 protein; suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; triacylglycerol; uncoupling protein 1; uncoupling protein 2; adipocyte; adipose tissue; arcuate nucleus; blood brain barrier; body weight; cerebrospinal fluid; energy balance; energy expenditure; food deprivation; food intake; glucose blood level; hormone blood level; hormone resistance; hormone transport; human; hypertriglyceridemia; hypothalamus; hypothalamus function; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin resistance; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein structure; receptor binding; review; signal transduction; starvation; thermogenesis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750682649

Although the apoplast represents an important storage and reaction space, and engages in the mediation of membrane transport, this extracellular compartment has not yet been granted a role during oxygen shortage. Here, an attempt is made to highlight the importance of the apoplast during oxygen stress and to test whether information about it is transferred systemically in Hordeum vulgare. Methods: Non-invasive ion-selective microprobes were used which, after being inserted through open stomata, directly contact the apoplastic fluid and continuously measure the apoplastic pH and changes to it. Key Results: (a) Barley leaves respond to oxygen stress with apoplastic alkalinization and membrane depolarization. These responses are persistent under anoxia (N2; O2 &lt; 3%) but transient under hypoxia. (b) Being applied to the root, the information 'anoxia' is signalled to the leaf as an increase in pH, whereas 'hypoxia' is not: flooding of the roots within the first 2 h has no effect on the leaf apoplastic pH, whereas anoxia (N 2) or chemical anoxia (NaCN/salicylic hydroxamic acid) rapidly increase the leaf apoplastic pH. (c) Under anoxia, the proton motive force suffers a decrease by over 70 %, which impairs H+-driven transport. Conclusions: Although anoxia-induced apoplastic alkalinization is a general response to stress, its impact on the proton motive force (reduction) and thus on transport mediation of energy-rich compounds is evident. It is concluded that anoxia tolerance depends on how the plant is able to hold the proton motive force and H+ turnover at a level that guarantees sufficient energy is harvested to overcome the crisis. © The Author 2006.

At the reach scale, CPOM storage is dependent on the geomorphic unit structure and physical heterogeneity of the river, and associated energy conditions along the reach. At the geomorphic unit scale, CPOM storage capacity is related to the position of geomorphic units relative to the thalweg (i.e. flow characteristics) and associated roughness attributes. At the hydraulic unit scale, CPOM storage capacity is related to local flow velocity and substrate characteristics (clast size and distribution).","Coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM); Geomorphic template; Geomorphic units; Hydraulic units; River Styles","catchment; flow velocity; fluvial geomorphology; fluvial landform; particulate organic matter; Australasia; Australia; Kangaroo River; New South Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750329518

These include resting metabolic rate (a minimum level of metabolism), maximal metabolic rate (attained during maximal exercise), as well as sustained (and endurance) metabolism, when extended periods of activity are fuelled by either food intake or energy reserves. The factors that determine each type of metabolic rate are not the same; however, all levels of energy expenditure are strongly linked with body size. RECENT FINDINGS: Resting metabolism in different species is related to the fatty acid composition and physical properties of membranes and consequently their influence on the molecular activity of membrane proteins. Maximal metabolism (during aerobic exercise) is primarily limited by oxygen transport and delivery to the working muscles in most animals. In the most metabolically active animals it may be related to design limits of muscles and transport systems. Sustained and endurance metabolism are largely constrained by factors related to supply, storage and utilization of energy substrates. SUMMARY: Animals display great diversity in physical and metabolic performance. The many factors that interact to set the upper limit of performance in different species are set by their evolutionary history and define the metabolic window in which they exist. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Body mass; Exercise; Membrane fatty acids; Oxygen delivery; Substrate metabolism","energy consumption; evolution; human; metabolic rate; nonhuman; physical performance; review; species comparison; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Body Size; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Fatty Acids; Humans; Nutrition Physiology; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Physical Endurance; Species Specificity; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750307505

The proposed ER circuit consists of one energy storage capacitor, two energy recovery inductors, and three insulated-gate bipolar transistors. The circuit operations in the series and parallel resonance modes are similar to conventional ones, except for the leading edge of the first sustain pulse and the trailing edge of the last sustain pulse. To reduce power consumption in the parallel resonance mode of operation, these two pulse edges are generated using a series resonance between the panel capacitance and the energy recovery inductor. The proposed circuit had energy recovery efficiencies in both the series and parallel resonance modes that were nearly the same as the efficiency of the conventional series resonance ER circuit. Experimental results on a 42-inch XGA single-scan PDP show that the proposed ER circuit is suitable for use in a PDP drive circuit. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanical properties of the systems were determined in terms of the fracture toughness, impact strength, and adhesion strength. As a result, the ρ values of the systems were found to decrease systematically as the BB content increased. The fracture toughness and adhesion strength of the systems increased with increasing BB content.

In this paper quantitative indices of electrical energy use were developed which reflect direct on-farm decisions for measures that farmers can adopt to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With commonly available historical agricultural records as inputs, the indices allowed extrapolation backward in time with the same analytical methods as used for current energy use estimates. Each index was derived from one or more literature sources dealing with energy use in operations associated with different farming systems. Development focused on six major Canadian farm types, including two for crop production systems and four for livestock. The scale of application is national with required inputs being populations of pigs, poultry, beef and dairy cows, and crop production for small grain cereals, grain maize and canola, and greenhouse floor area. The indices were initially compared to the 1996 Farm Energy Use Survey (FEUS) of Canada and were within 5% of the FEUS electrical energy value. The integrated index was then converted to equivalent CO2 emissions for comparison with two independent sources CO2 emissions from farm energy. It agreed more closely with the 2004 Energy Use Data Handbook from Natural Resources Canada than with the 1999 Health of our Air report by Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, but was between these two sources. The comparisons of CO2 emissions took account of energy use for household as well as farm operations. The impact of the changing share of electrical energy generated by fossil fuel, rather than by nuclear or hydro-power plants was also considered. Between 1996 and 2001 Canadian farm and household use of electrical energy resulted in GHG emissions from 1·8 to 2·4 Tg of CO2, while use for farm operations only (household excluded) remained at 1·1 Tg from the 1980s to 2001 when electrical generation by fossil fuel was fixed at 1996 levels. The integrated index is well within the required accuracy to be a useful tool for reporting on the Kyoto Protocol.

One main reason therefore is to avoid product losses during transport or between withdrawals. At transport conditions the mixing of the fluid can be assumed to be ideally, which results in a maximum reachable pressurising period. At stationary conditions the pressurising period is expected to be shorter, because a stratification is rising up, so that the heat capacity of the stored fluid cannot be used completely. In a thermodynamic view, an isochore change of state takes place and the heat flux into the vessel rises the internal energy of the fluid. For the representation of the isochore change of state a new developed Δu/v-v-diagram with the 1 × 105 Pa reference as a basis line is introduced. The basis line is linear for the filling rate and functionally connected with the specific volume. For the fluids He and H2 e.g., Δu/v-v-diagrams are pointed out, using the u- and v-values on the saturation lines for the two phase region and those of some isobar lines for the region above the critical pressure. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite a wealth of research on such costs for females, very few studies have looked at the male side. We investigated the costs of reproduction in males of two butterfly species, Bicyclus anynana and Pieris napi. The males of these species differ tremendously in their allocation of nutrients to reproduction: virgin male spermatophores were 18.5 times larger in the latter compared with those in the former. Based on this striking difference, we expected to find a longevity cost of mating in P. napi, but not necessarily in B. anynana. In line with our predictions, we found no evidence for a survival cost of mating in B. anynana, while there was some evidence for such a cost in P. napi. Here, virgin males lived longer than once- or twice-mated ones. However, this overall trend did not hold for all treatment groups, and there was no linear relationship between the number of copulations and longevity. Adult food limitation reduced longevity throughout, but had otherwise very little impact. Spermatophore dry mass decreased in later compared with first spermatophores, while water content increased, indicating that spermatophore production is indeed physiologically costly. Additionally, adult food limitation tended to reduce spermatophore fresh and dry mass, and tended to increase spermatophore water content. Based on our results we tentatively conclude that longevity and reproduction may not always be traded off against each other, as in our study organisms' longevity seems to depend in first place on adult carbohydrate income, while male reproduction seems to be primarily (although not entirely) fuelled by larval storage reserves. © 2006 The Authors.",,"butterfly; copulation; food limitation; life history theory; longevity; nutrient availability; reproductive cost; spermatophore; trade-off; Bicyclus anynana; Papilionoidea; Pieris napi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749852175

The rapid report of the presence of an unstable functional group in the active product and of its potential thermal instability (CHETAH indices) has led to complete this examination by an experimental study of thermal analysis using isotherm exposition measurement (DTA) or with temperature programming by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and oxidability tests (BAM). The apparent kinetics of decomposition of the active matter of the ground insecticide has been represented by a global Arrhenius law. A model designed for the simulation of heterogeneous thermal runaways based on the numerical solution of the transient mass and energy balances has been further applied to define the critical conditions of the storage and simulate its behavior.

The objective of this study was to clarify the role of high versus low IMCL levels at equal initial muscle glycogen on fuel selection during EX. After 3 h of depleting exercise, 11 endurance-trained males consumed in a crossover design a high-carbohydrate (7 g kg-1 day-1) low-fat (0.5 g kg-1 day-1) diet (HC) for 2.5 days or the same diet with 3 g kg-1 day-1 more fat provided during the last 1.5 days of diet (four meals; HCF). Respiratory exchange, thigh muscle substrate breakdown by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and plasma FFA oxidation ([1-13C]palmitate) were measured during EX (3 h, 50% Wmax). Pre-EX IMCL concentrations were 55% higher after HCF. IMCL utilization during EX in HCF was threefold greater compared with HC (P &lt; 0.001) and was correlated with aerobic power and highly correlated (P &lt; 0.001) with initial content. Glycogen values and decrements during EX were similar. Whole-body fat oxidation (Fatox) was similar overall and plasma FFA oxidation smaller (P &lt; 0.05) during the first EX hour after HCF. Myocellular fuels contributed 8% more to whole-body energy demands after HCF (P &lt; 0.05) due to IMCL breakdown (27% Fatox). After EX, when both IMCL and glycogen concentrations were again similar across trials, a simulated 20-km time-trial showed no difference in performance between diets. In conclusion, IMCL concentrations can be increased during a glycogen loading diet by consuming additional fat for the last 1.5 days. During subsequent exercise, IMCL decrease in proportion to their initial content, partly in exchange for peripheral fatty acids. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Fat supplement; High-carbohydrate diet; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Muscle glycogen","fatty acid; glycogen; lipid; palmitic acid derivative; adult; article; athlete; carbohydrate diet; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; correlation analysis; crossover procedure; diet supplementation; endurance; energy consumption; exercise; fatty acid blood level; fatty acid oxidation; glycogen muscle level; human; human experiment; leg muscle; lipid storage; low fat diet; lung gas exchange; male; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; priority journal; simulation; Adult; Anaerobic Threshold; Bicycling; Body Composition; Cross-Over Studies; Diet; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Double-Blind Method; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Glycogen; Humans; Kinetics; Lipid Metabolism; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Muscle Fibers; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Palmitates; Physical Endurance; Physical Fitness; Pulmonary Gas Exchange",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749351730

The evaluations highlight the changing relationship between agriculture and society over the time period studied. A large increase in total emergy supporting the Danish economy was observed, and the 379% rise from 1936 to 1999 in emergy use per capita, a biophysical measure of living standard, came from both imported sources and from the non-renewable storages of the biosphere. In 1936, Danish agriculture was largely based on the use of draft animals for traction and approximately 1,110,000,000 person-hours of direct labor were required for production, while in 1970 and 1999, all traction was mechanized and approximately 415,000,000 and 121,000,000 person-hours were required for production, respectively. Over the same period, the emergy supporting each person-hour of agricultural labor increased by 1600%. The driving forces for agricultural production shifted towards an increased reliance on commercial energy and indirect labor. Given the increase in emergy available to the Danish economy through extraction and use of domestic oil and gas and trade over the period studied, the shift in labor from agriculture to the service and manufacturing sectors represented a nation-wide re-organization for maximum empower. The evaluations also indicate that while agriculture remains an essential way for industrial economies to capture local renewable resources, given the limited net emergy yields of agricultural production, the magnitude of non-agricultural economic activity that agriculture systems can support appears limited in an economy with access to high-net-yield imported energy resources. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the surface modification by graphite and CNTs improves the electrochemical performance of MgNi1 + x alloys, while the carbon black modification slightly decreases the initial discharge capacity and has no effect on the capacity degradation of amorphous MgNi1 + x alloys. CV measurements and the exchange current density of composite electrodes show that the surface electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes increases with graphite or CNT modification. However, carbon black limits the charge-transfer reaction at the surface of the alloy. Potential step measurements for the carbon-modified samples, on the other hand, show that surface modification of MgNi1 + x alloys does not affect the hydrogen diffusion rate (D), indicating that carbon modification on MgNi1 + x does not affect the diffusion process of hydrogen from the surface to the bulk of alloys.

Deactivated samples, i.e. air exposed, are investigated in order to focus on the effect of magnesium oxide (MgO) surface layers, which might be unavoidable for magnesium (Mg)-based storage media for mobile applications. A curved position-sensitive detector covering 120{ring operator} in 2 θ and a rotating anode X-ray source provide a time resolution of 45 s and up to 90 powder patterns collected during an experiment under isothermal conditions. A quartz capillary cell allowed the in situ study of gas/solid reactions. Three phases were identified: Mg, MgH2 and MgO and their phase fractions were extracted by Rietveld refinement or integration of selected reflections from each phase. Dehydrogenation curves were constructed and analysed by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami formalism in order to derive rate constants at different temperatures. The apparent activation energies for dehydrogenation of pure and Ni-doped magnesium hydride were EA ≈ 300 and 250 kJ / mol, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry gave, EA = 270 kJ / mol for dehydrogenation of the Ni-doped sample. The relatively high activation energies are due to MgO surface layers, retarding the diffusion of hydrogen (H2) out of MgH2 / Mg. The observed difference in EA of ca. 50 kJ/mol is likely due to the catalytic effect of Ni on the recombination of H atoms to H2 molecules verified by theoretical considerations. © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Dehydrogenation kinetic; Differential scanning calorimetry; Gas-solid reactions; Hydrogen storage materials; In situ powder X-ray diffraction; Magnesium hydride; Nickel-doped magnesium hydride","Dehydrogenation; Isotherms; Nickel; Quartz; Semiconductor doping; X ray diffraction; Dehydrogenation kinetic; Gas-solid reactions; Hydrogen storage materials; In situ powder X-ray diffraction; Magnesium hydride; Nickel-doped magnesium hydride; Surface layers; Magnesium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748490867

The microstructure and the surface chemical composition have been characterized in order to explain the kinetics of reaction with hydrogen. The presence of benzene in the milled blends induces a finer powder particle size, helps to preserve the structural integrity of the graphite crystals and results to be necessary for a complete transformation of the milled powder to the hydride phase by thermal reaction with hydrogen gas. On the other hand, it induces a more pronounced reaction of the milled Mg-C composites with the air. The transport properties of the resulting surface contamination layer appear to control the kinetics of thermal decomposition of the MgH2 phase, so that the addition of benzene induces a higher reaction temperature owing to a larger thickness of the surface compound. © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","High-energy ball milling; Hydrogen storage; Microstructure; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Ball milling; Benzene; Composite materials; Hydrogen; Microstructure; Reaction kinetics; Surface properties; High-energy ball milling; Hydrogen storage; Surface chemical composition; Magnesium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748484028

The key elements are the DC/DC converters, which control the voltage of the network and optimize the operation of the sources. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, carbonated minerals are not stable in acidic environments. This study was conducted to determine if synthetically carbonated minerals dissolve in acidic rain and release CO2. Synthetic magnesium and calcium carbonates were leached in nitric acid solutions of various acidities, as well as rainwater, and the stability of the minerals was investigated with various methods. The experimental study was complemented with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations using Gibbs energy minimization software (HSC 4.0). The leaching of base ions from the two carbonate minerals was found to behave similarly and depend mainly upon the acidity of the solution. The fraction of Mg and Ca dissolved after several days of stabilization in separate solutions with initial pH 1 was 9% for both carbonates, while the fraction of dissolved minerals in a solution with initial pH &gt; 2 was less than 1%. FT-IR analyses of the reactor atmosphere revealed that CO2 gas was more rapidly released from calcium carbonate than from magnesium carbonate. However, only 1.5% of the CO2 stored in the calcium carbonate was released as gas at pH 1 against 0.0% for magnesium carbonate. No notable CO2 release occurred when leaching magnesium and calcium carbonates in solutions of pH 2. The solid residue analyses showed that the fixed CO2 content of the carbonates that had been exposed to nitric acid was even higher than before the treatment. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

One such technology is the O2/CO2 combustion process (also termed oxy-fuel combustion) that combines a conventional combustion process with a cryogenic air separation process so that the fuel is burned in oxygen and recycled flue gas, yielding a high concentration of CO2 in the flue gas, which reduces the cost for its capture. In this work, the O2/CO2 process is applied using commercial data from an 865 MWe lignite fired reference power plant and large air separation units (ASU). A detailed design of the flue gas treatment pass, integrated in the overall process layout, is proposed. The essential components and energy streams of the two processes have been investigated in order to evaluate the possibilities for process integration and to determine the net efficiency of the capture plant. The electricity generation cost and the associated avoidance cost for the capture plant have been determined and compared to the reference plant with investment costs obtained directly from industry. Although an existing reference power plant forms the basis of the work, the study is directed towards a new state of the art lignite fired O2/CO2 power plant. The boiler power of the O2/CO2 plant has been increased to keep the net output of the capture and the reference plant similar. With the integration possibilities identified, the net efficiency becomes 33.5%, which should be compared to 42.6% in the reference plant. With a lignite price of 5.2 $/MW h and an interest rate of 10%, the electricity generation cost increases from 42.1 to 64.3 $/MW h, which corresponds to a CO2 avoidance cost of 26 $/ton CO2. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This is due to a very high ambient temperature for the long summer period extended from April to October and the low energy cost. This paper gives an overview of the electrical peak and energy consumption in Kuwait, and it has been found that the average increase in the annual peak electrical demand and energy consumption for the year 1998-2002 was 6.2% and 6.4%, respectively. One method of reducing the peak electrical demand of AC systems during the day period is by incorporating an ice cool thermal storage (ICTS) with the AC system. A clinic building has been selected to study the effects of using an ICTS with different operation strategies such as partial (load levelling), partial (demand limiting) and full storage operations on chiller and storage sizes, reduction of peak electrical demand and energy consumption of the chiller for selected charging and discharging hours. It has been found that the full storage operation has the largest chiller and storage capacities, energy consumption and peak electrical reduction. However, partial storage (load levelling) has the smallest chiller and storage capacities and peak electrical reduction.

As expected, the charging-discharging kinetic was significantly improved in the presence of carbon fibres. A Crank-Nicolson's numerical computational model, based on an enthalpy formulation, which describes the phase change is proposed. The model was developed to predict the time and radial behaviors of thermal profiles of a composite material.

The efficiency of such system could be improved by using simultaneous production of electric and thermal energy (CHP), as well as waste heat recovery. Considering the polymerization data in presented article a calculation methodology for evaluating the primary energy consumption for both options i.e. CHP and separate production of heat and power is presented. As a result of proposed combined heat and power scheme (CHP) achieved saving in purchased electric energy is 17.6%. Also, the waste heat streams has been recognized as a potential energy efficiency improving option. Therefore a thermodynamic analysis for conventional and CHP is carried out.

Abundant reactive amino functional groups inside the mesopore channels of NMS can interconnect with numerous polyimide main chains, forming multilinked and complex NMS/PI networks. These multilinkages, NMS inherent nanoporosity, and the uniform dispersion of NMS in polyimide significantly improve thermal stability, mechanical properties, elongation, moisture absorption, and dielectric constant of these novel materials over those of neat polyimide. For instance, the storage modulus is increased by 160%, the decomposition temperature by 35.7°C, and the glass transition temperature by 14.5°C. The maximum elongation increases by 66%, hardly observed in other polyimide nanocomposites, probably because the covalent bond and NMS nanopore can absorb more energy than pristine poyimide before failure.

The battery state of charge (SOC) is expressed in a look-up table relative to the battery open circuit voltage (VOC). This look-up table has been developed through low discharge experiments of the battery modelled. Further, both the internal resistance and self-discharge resistance of the battery are subsequently expressed as functions of the open circuit voltage. By using an electrical model with these characteristics and a temperature compensation element to model different rates of charge and discharge, a relatively simple and accurate battery model has been developed. The new model takes into account battery storage capacity, internal resistance, self-discharge resistance, the electric losses and the temperature dependence of a lead acid battery. It is shown in this paper how the necessary parameters for the model were found. The battery modelled was a Hawker Genesis 42 Ah rated gelled lead acid battery. The simulation results of the new model are compared with test data recorded from battery discharge tests, which validate the accuracy of the new model. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The only degradation product of its use is water, and thus it has played a large role in environmentally friendly methods in the chemical industry. Hydrogen peroxide is produced on an industrial scale by the anthraquinone oxidation (AO) process. However, this process can hardly be considered a green method. It involves the sequential hydrogenation and oxidation of an alkylanthraquinone precursor dissolved in a mixture of organic solvents followed by liquid-liquid extraction to recover H2O 2. The AO process is a multi-step method that requires significant energy input and generates waste, which has a negative effect on its sustainability and production costs. The transport, storage, and handling of bulk H2O2 involve hazards and escalating expenses. Thus, novel, cleaner methods for the production of H2O2 are being explored. The direct synthesis of H2O2 from O 2 and H2 using a variety of catalysts, and the factors influencing the formation and decomposition of H2O2 are examined in detail in this Review. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

It can convert an AC power source with certain voltage and frequency to another AC load with variable voltage and variable frequency directly without a DC-link and bulk energy storage component. Classical modulation methods such as the Venturini method and the space vector modulation method using AC-network maximum-envelope modulation, implement matrix conversion successfully. However, they also cause very high total harmonic distortion (THD). A novel approach, the sub-envelope modulation (SEM) method, is presented to reduce THD of matrix converters effectively. The approach is extended to an improved version of matrix converters and the THD can be reduced further. The algorithm of the SEM method is described in detail. Simulation and experimental results are also presented to verify the feasibility of the SEM approach.

The novel device consists of a double-fed induction machine (DFIM) and a voltage-source pulse width modulation (PWM) rectifier-inverter used as an AC exciter. By changing the speed of the rotating machine, the kinetic energy stored in the rotor with the flywheel will be changed. With an appropriate control strategy, it is able to realize an independent active and reactive power exchanging between the FPC and the grid. Similar to that of the Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES), the FPC can be used to improve the stability of power system as well as the quality of power supply. Additional advantage of the FPC over the SMES based device is that it is easy to develop and to operate. Therefore, the cost will be greatly reduced. In order to increase performance of the proposed device, an improved stator flux linkage orientated control strategy for FPC is proposed in the paper. Simulation result of applying the proposed device in a two-machine and an infinite bus system shows that the proposed control provides excellent dynamic characteristics. Very encouraging results are obtained.","AC excitation; Flywheel energy storage; Stability control; Stator flux linkage orientation; Vector control","Electric excitation; Electric inverters; Electric rectifiers; Energy storage; Flywheels; Kinetic energy; Power control; Pulse width modulation; System stability; AC excitation; Double fed induction machine (DFIM); Flywheel energy storage; Functional Flexible Power Conditioner (FPC); Stability control; Stator flux linkage orientation; Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES); Asynchronous machinery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750158845

This requires that methods to improve power qualify and stability for such systems be found. The static compensator (STATCOM) with hybrid battery energy storage (BES) has great potential to fulfil this role, though considerable advances in the control of this system are still to be made. From an economic point of view, rating the STATCOM for steady-state power-quality improvement duty is appropriate. Rating the STATCOM to absorb large amounts of additional power in excess of its transient overload capability during network faults is inappropriate. A hybrid of BES and braking resistor is therefore proposed. A new hybrid STATCOM-BES control technique is developed and discussed in the context of improving the stability and power quality to fixed speed, induction generator, wind turbines. The variation of the network voltage, active and reactive power with the fluctuation of the wind generation is studied.

In this paper, a new hybrid supercapacitor is fabricated by making use of the benefits of ID nanomaterials consisting of a carbon nanotube (CNT) cathode and a TiO2-B nanowire (TNW) anode, and the preliminary results for such an energy-storage device operating over a wide voltage range (0-2.8 V) are presented. The CNT-TNW supercapacitor is compared to a CNT-CNT supercapacitor, and discussed with regards to available energy densities, power capabilities, voltage profiles, and cycle life. On the basis of the total weight of both active materials, the CNT-TNW supercapacitor delivers an energy density of 12.5 W h kg-1 at a rate of 10 C, double the value of the CNT-CNT supercapacitor, while maintaining desirable cycling stability. The combination of a CNT cathode and a TNW anode in a non-aqueous electrolyte is proven to be suitable for high-performance hybrid supercapacitor applications; this can reasonably be assigned to the interesting synergistic effects of the two nanomaterials.

We establish a general relationship across different materials: the higher the effective H content, the higher the temperatures needed to completely desorb H2. Nevertheless, several systems show promising thermodynamics for H2 desorption; however, the desorption kinetics still needs to be improved by the use of appropriate catalysts. Prompted by the importance of heterolytically splitting stable dihydrogen molecules for proton-hydride technologies, we attempt to theoretically design novel H2 transfer catalysts. We focus mainly on M4Nm4H8 catalysts (M=V, Ti, Zr, Hf, and Nm = Si, C, B, N), which should be able to preserve their functionality in the strongly reducing environment of a H2 storage system. We are able to determine the energy of H2 detachment from these molecules, as well as the associated energy barriers. In order to optimize the properties of the catalysts, we use isoelectronic atom-by-atom substitutions, vary the valence electron count, and borrow the concept of near-surface alloys from extended solids and apply it to molecular systems. We are able to obtain control over the enthalpy and electronic barriers for H 2 detachment. Molecules with the coordinatively unsaturated &gt; Ti=Si &lt; unit exhibit particularly favorable thermodynamics and show unusually small electronic barriers for H2 detachment (&gt; 0.27 eV) and attachment (&gt; 0.07 eV). These and homologous ZrSi frameworks may serve as novel H2 transfer catalysts for use with emerging lightweight hydrogen storage materials holding 5.0-10.4 wt% hydrogen, such as Li 2NH, Li2Mg(NH)2, Mg2Si, and LiH/MgB2 (discharged forms). Catalytic properties are also anticipated for appropriate defects on the surfaces and crystal edges of solid Ti and Zr silicides, and for Ti=Si ad-units chemisorbed on other support materials. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

In order to smooth the DC-bus voltage, the electrolytic capacitors with large capacitance have been used. However, the large electrolytic capacitors are bulky and those lifetime becomes short on high ripple current and high temperature environment. Hence, the electrolytic capacitor is not suitable for the DC capacitor, in the case when high power density and long lifetime are expected. The authors studied two kinds of power decoupling circuits, such the authors call a capacitive storage method and an inductive storage method, those enable to transfer the ripple energy appeared on the DC capacitors into the energy in either small capacitors or additional inductors.

Data sources: We searched in the PubMed database of National Library of Medicine in USA for the articles on negative feedback action of adipocytokine, obesity and type 2 diabetes published from Jan 1962 to Nov 2005, using the key words of ""adipocytokines, obesity, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, leptin, adiponectin, resistin and PGAR"" and limited the language to English. Study selection: The articles of original researches and associated with energy metabolism and fat accumulation were included. The articles of repetitive researches, reviews and little associated with energy metabolism and fat accumulation were excluded. Data extraction: A total of 158 articles were collected, of which 35 were closely correlated with this paper, and the 123 excluded articles were all repetitive studies, reviews and little correlated with this paper. Data synthesis: Researches show that the fat tissue is able to secrete adipocytokines to regulate the fat mass. While the mass of body fat increases, the adipocytokines will inhibit lipogenesis and promote lipolysis. Adipocytokines can either resist the action of insulin or suppress the secretion of insulin. Thus lead to lipogenesis inhibition, lipolysis increasing and suppressing the utilization of blood glucose. Conclusion: When man develops obesity going up to certain degree, the negative feedback action of adipocytokines may lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",,"adipocytokine; glucose; insulin; adipose tissue; article; body fat distribution; energy metabolism; glucose metabolism; human; insulin release; insulin resistance; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; medical literature; metabolic regulation; negative feedback; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pathogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846414657

These high temperatures are often viewed as a considerable disadvantage from a materials point of view because of the occurrence of unwanted interfacial reactions, stresses as a result of thermal expansivity mismatches, etc. However, higher temperatures are also an advantage of SOFC systems. Fuel pretreatment that may involve such processes as reforming is very often highly endothermic in nature. The high operating temperature of an SOFC allows for efficient system energy integration with the waste heat from the fuel cell being used to drive fuel pretreatment processes. Here, we demonstrate this propensity for energy integration by looking at the use of a novel hydrogen-carrier system working with an SOFC. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The availability of abundant, energy-rich processed foods in the last few decades has, however, resulted in a sharp rise in the prevalence of obesity in westernized countries. Although it is the obesogenic environment that has resulted in this major healthcare problem, it is acting by revealing a sub-population with a pre-existing genetic predisposition to excess adiposity. There is substantial evidence for the heritability of obesity, and research in both rare and common forms of obesity has identified genes with significant roles in its aetiology. Application of this understanding to patient care has been slower. Until very recently, the health risks of obesity were thought to be well understood, with a straightforward correlation between increasing obesity and increasing risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, arthritis and cancer. It is becoming clear, however, that the location of fat deposition, variation in the secretion of adipokines and other factors govern whether a particular obese person develops such complications. Prediction of the health risks of obesity for individual patients is not straightforward, but continuing advances in understanding of genetic factors influencing obesity risk and improved diagnostic technologies mean that the future for such prediction is looking increasingly bright. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",,"adipocytokine; beta 2 adrenergic receptor; beta 3 adrenergic receptor; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dopamine 2 receptor; ghrelin; glutamate decarboxylase; guanine nucleotide binding protein; insulin; interleukin 6; leptin; leptin receptor; low density lipoprotein receptor; melanocortin 4 receptor; perilipin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; serotonin 2 receptor; triacylglycerol lipase; tumor necrosis factor; arthritis; article; Bardet Biedl syndrome; correlation analysis; diagnostic procedure; epigenetics; evidence based medicine; food intake; food processing; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; genetic analysis; genetic predisposition; health care; health hazard; heredity; heritability; high risk population; human; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; lipid storage; malignant neoplastic disease; multifactorial inheritance; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; patient care; prediction; prevalence; priority journal; Bardet-Biedl Syndrome; Biological Markers; Cytokines; Epigenesis, Genetic; Ghrelin; Glutamate Decarboxylase; Humans; Isoenzymes; Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase; Obesity; Peptide Hormones; Quantitative Trait Loci; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748991141

These loss rates are much higher than those reported for continental rainforests, for example, in the Amazon basin, where interception is around 9% of rainfall. Higher interception losses have been found in coastal and mountain rainforests and substantial advection of energy during rainfall is proposed to account for these results. This paper uses a process based model of interception to analyse the interception losses at Oliver Creek, a lowland coastal rainforest site in northern Queensland with a mean annual rainfall of 3952 mm. The observed interception loss of 25% of rainfall for the period August 2001 to January 2004 can be reproduced by the model with a suitable choice of the three key controlling variables, the canopy storage capacity, mean rainfall rate and mean wet canopy evaporation rate. Our analyses suggest that the canopy storage capacity of the Oliver Creek rainforest is between 3.0 and 3.5 mm, higher than reported for most other rainforests. Despite the high canopy capacity at our site, the interception losses can only be accounted for with energy advection during rainfall in the range 40-70% of the incident energy. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The efficient numerical terrestrial scheme (ENTS) is designed for long time period simulations and large ensemble studies in Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs). ENTS includes new parameterisations of vegetation fractional cover and roughness length as functions of vegetation carbon, and a relationship between soil carbon storage and soil water holding capacity. We make and justify the approximation that when the solar forcing is a diurnal average, as in our EMIC, the land radiation balance equilibrates with the atmosphere within a few days. This allows us to solve directly for equilibrium land temperature, making ENTS very computationally efficient and avoiding problems of numerical instability that beset many land surface schemes. We tune the carbon cycle parameters towards observed values of global carbon storage in vegetation and soil and estimated global fluxes of net photosynthesis, vegetation respiration, leaf litter and soil respiration. When the model is forced with long term monthly mean fields of NCEP reanalysis climate data, we find ENTS yields broadly accurate patterns of vegetation and soil carbon storage, vegetation fraction, surface albedo, land temperature and evaporation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

DOE plans to remove the waste from the tanks, separate out high-level radioactive waste to be shipped to an off-site geological repository, and dispose of the remaining lower-activity waste onsite. The report concludes that DOE's overall plan is workable, but some important challenges must be overcome-including the removal of residual waste from some tanks, especially at Hanford and Savannah River. The report recommends that DOE pursue a more risk-informed, consistent, participatory, and transparent for making decisions about how much waste to retrieve from tanks and how much to dispose of onsite.

We monitored stand evapo-transpiration by eddy-covariance (E), tree transpiration (T) by heat-dissipative sapflow, soil (G) and stand (J) heat storage during 3 years in a typical coconut palm row-plantation of the humid tropics, displaying a constant leaf area index (LAI = 3) and a grass under-storey. A two-level flux experiment yielded cross-validation of the evapo-transpiration of the under-storey (Eu) with E - T, through energy balance closure for E and sapflow calibration in the laboratory for T. On a yearly time step, E represented 40% of rainfall, the sensible heat flux (H) was 26% of net radiation and the Bowen ratio was 0.39, all indicating that water availability was close-to-optimum. T represented 68% of E, close to the 75% of soil coverage by palms. The inter-annual variability was low for potential evapo-transpiration (ETo), energy and water fluxes. The seasonal variability was more pronounced, driven by radiation and vapour pressure deficit (VPD). The canopy conductance of coconut palms appeared to be strongly controlled by VPD.

The astaxanthin group showed a significant increase in swimming time to exhaustion as compared to the control group. Blood lactate concentration in the astaxanthin groups was significantly lower than in the control group. In the control group, plasma non-esterfied fatty acid (NEFA) and plasma glucose were decreased by swimming exercise, but in the astaxanthin group, NEFA and plasma glucose were significantly higher than in the control group.

We have used Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulation for the modeling of methane storage at 293 K and pressures up to 80 MPa in idealized bundles of (10,10) armchair-type single-walled carbon nanotubes and wormlike carbon pores. We have found that these carbon nanomaterials can be treated as the world's smallest high-capacity methane storage vessels. Our simulation results indicate that such novel carbon nanostructures can reach a high volumetric energy storage, exceeding the US FreedomCAR Partnership target of 2010 (5.4 MJ dm-3), at low to moderate pressures ranging from 1 to 7 MPa at 293 K. On the contrary, in the absence of these nanomaterials, methane needs to be compressed to approximately 13 MPa at 293 K to achieve the same target. The light carbon membranes composed of bundles of single-walled carbon nanotubes or wormlike pores efficiently physisorb methane at low to moderate pressures at 293 K, which we believe should be particularly important for automobiles and stationary devices. However, above 15-20 MPa at 293 K, all investigated samples of novel carbon nanomaterials are not as effective when compared with compression alone since the stored volumetric energy and power saturate at values below those of the bulk, compressed fluid. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon nanotubes; Computer simulation; Energy storage; Mathematical models; Methane; Monte Carlo methods; Ambient temperatures; Carbon nanostructures; Carbon pores; Nanoscale tubular vessels; Nanostructured materials; carbon nanotube; methane; article; chemical structure; chemistry; temperature; Methane; Models, Molecular; Nanotubes, Carbon; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750311818

By utilizing an electroexplosive fuse, a large dl/dt into a coupled load is possible. Our previous work with a nonoptimized fuse has produced ∼100 kV into a 15 n load, which leads into a regime relevant for high power microwave systems. It is expected that ∼300 kV can be achieved with the present two-stage HFCG driving an inductive storage system with electroexploding fuse. In order to optimize the electroexplosive wire fuse, we have constructed a nonexplosive test bed which simulates the HFCG output with high accuracy. We have designed and implemented a capacitor based, magnetic switching scheme to generate the near exponential rise of the HFCG. The varying inductance approach utilizes four stages of inductance change and is based upon a piecewise linear regression model of the HFCG wave form.

It consists of three single-phase symmetrical voltage multipliers, which are connected in series at their smoothing columns like string of batteries and are driven by three-phase ac power source. The smoothing column of each voltage multiplier is charged twice every cycle independently by respective oscillating columns and discharged in series through load. The charging discharging process completes six times a cycle and therefore the output voltage ripple's frequency is of sixth order of the drive signal frequency. Thus the proposed approach eliminates the first five harmonic components of load generated voltage ripples and sixth harmonic is the major ripple component. The proposed cascaded three-phase symmetrical voltage multiplier has less than half the voltage ripple, and three times larger output voltage and output power than the conventional single-phase symmetrical CW-VM.

Photoisomerization of the retinal chromophore from all-trans to 13-cis initiates conformational changes of the protein leading to activation of the cognate transducer protein (pHtrII). Elucidation of the initial photoreaction, formation of the K intermediate of ppR, is important for understanding the mechanism of storage of photon energy. We have reported the K minus ppR Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, including several vibrational bands of the retinal, the protein, and internal water molecules. It is interesting that more vibrational bands were observed in the hydrogen-out-of-plane (HOOP) region than for the light-driven proton pump, bacteriorhodopsin. This result implied that the steric constraints on the retinal chromophore in the binding pocket of ppR are distributed more widely upon formation of the initial intermediate. In this study, we assigned the HOOP and hydrogen-in-plane vibrations by means of low-temperature FTIR spectroscopy applied to ppR reconstituted with retinal deuterated at C7, C8, C10-C12, C14, and C15. As a result, the 966 (+)/ 971 (-) and 958 (+)/961 (-) cm-1 bands were assigned to the C7=C8 and C11=C12 Au HOOP modes, respectively, suggesting that the structural changes spread to the middle part of the retinal. The positive bands at 1001, 994, 987, and 979 cm-1 were assigned to the C15-HOOP vibrations of the K intermediate, whose frequencies are similar to those of the KL intermediate of bacteriorhodopsin trapped at 135 K. Another positive band at 864 cm-1 was assigned to the C14-HOOP vibration. Relatively many positive bands of hydrogen-in-plane vibrations supported the wide distribution of structural changes of the retinal as well. These results imply that the light energy was stored mainly in the distortions around the Schiff base region while some part of the energy was transferred to the distal part of the retinal. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Bacteria; Conformations; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Isomerization; Photons; Proteins; Photoisomerization; Retinal chromophores; Transducer proteins; Chromophores; deuterium; hydrogen; pharaonis phoborhodopsin; rhodopsin; unclassified drug; water; Archaebacterium; article; conformational transition; energy transfer; hydrogen in plane vibration; hydrogen out of plane vibration; infrared spectroscopy; isomerization; low temperature; Natronomonas pharaonis; nonhuman; photoisomerization; photon; photoreactivity; phototaxis; priority journal; protein conformation; protein localization; retina; stereospecificity; structure analysis; vibration; Deuterium; Halobacteriaceae; Halorhodopsins; Isomerism; Photochemistry; Retinaldehyde; Sensory Rhodopsins; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Natronomonas pharaonis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749364966

In the hydrogen economy, chemical hydrides such as NaBH4, KBH4, LiH, NaH have been tested as precursor materials for supplying hydrogen at ambient temperature. Among these chemical hydrides, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) provides a safe and practical mean of producing hydrogen. Sodium borohydride is stable in basic solution; however, hydrolysis generates hydrogen gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst. All of the prior catalysts having been used for this hydrolysis reaction are heterogeneous and, therefore, have limited activity because of the surface area. Here, we report the employment of water dispersible metal(0) nanoclusters as catalyst for the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. The water dispersible ruthenium(0) nanoclusters were prepared from the reduction of RuCl3·3H2O and stabilized by using acetate ion. They provide 5170 turnovers in the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C before deactivation. The acetate stabilized ruthenium(0) nanoclusters of 2.8 ± 1.4 nm particle size were characterized by TEM, XPS, and FTIR spectroscopy. Kinetic study shows that the ruthenium(0) nanocluster-catalyzed hydrolysis of sodium borohydride is first order in catalyst concentration and zero order in substrate concentration. The acetate stabilized ruthenium(0) nanoclusters provide a low activation energy for the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. Even in basic solution, the activation energy was found to be smaller than that obtained by using the carbon-supported ruthenium as catalyst. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed polyconvex stored energies are embedded into the concept of structural tensors and the representation theorems for isotropic tensor functions are utilized. As an example, the medial layer of a human abdominal aorta is investigated, modeled by some of the proposed polyconvex functions and compared with experimental data.

Four basic equilibrium problems are formulated considering incompressible and compressible isotropic bodies under plane stress and plane deformation condition. Depending on the form of the stored energy function, these plane problems, in addition to the obvious symmetric solutions, may admit asymmetric solutions. In other words, the body may assume an equilibrium configuration characterized by two unequal in-plane principal stretches corresponding to equal external forces. In this paper, a mathematical condition, in terms of the principal invariants, governing the global development of the asymmetric deformation branches is obtained and examined in detail with regard to different choices of the stored energy function. Moreover, explicit expressions for evaluating critical loads and bifurcation points are derived. With reference to neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin and Ogden-Ball materials, a broad numerical analysis is performed and the qualitatively more interesting asymmetric equilibrium branches are shown. Finally, using the energy criterion, a number of considerations are put forward about the stability of the computed solutions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) indicated that the Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles attached on the surface of carbon nanotubes has body-centered cubic (bcc) structure, with sizes in the range of 13-25 nm and in the shape of spheroids. Magnetization measurements indicated that both the coercivities and the saturation magnetizations altered with size changes of the Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles. The saturation magnetization decreases with decreasing the Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles' sizes. A decrease in coercivity with increasing Fe-Co size together with a local maximum coercivity at size of ca. 15 nm is visible. A linear relationship between the inverse particle diameter and the coercivity was found for larger particles. These demonstrated that the chemical method here is promising for fabricating Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles coated on carbon nanotubes for magnetic storage applications. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",,"Carbon nanotubes; Coercive force; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Magnetic storage; Magnetization; Nanostructured materials; Synthesis (chemical); Transmission electron microscopy; X ray powder diffraction; Body-centered cubic (bcc) structure; Wet chemistry; Iron alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845673348

However, the effect of aluminium on organoleptic properties of beer has been observed in few papers where it has been stated that aluminium gives beer a »metallic« and bitter flavour without any observations on particular aroma compound changes. Also, the number of reports on precise changes of aroma components throughout different storage conditions is surprisingly scarce. In order to investigate the changes of aluminium concentration along with aroma compound changes, graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectrophotometry (GF-AAS) with Zeeman background correction and gas chromatography with static headspace sampler (GC-HSS) were used in this work. Analyses were conducted periodically throughout seven months of storage on three different brands of beer from name breweries. Samples were taken before and after filling in aluminium cans. One part of samples was stored in a refrigerator (4°C) and the other in a thermostatic chamber (22 °C). The effects of beer brand and storage conditions on aluminium concentration and level of aroma compounds were measured. To prove the effect of aluminium concentration on the changes of aroma compounds, the adequate level of aluminium sulphate was added to bottled beer samples stored at 28°C. Although different beer types showed significantly different aluminium concentration, it could be the result of other factors (different batches of identical beer type showed significantly different aluminium concentration as well). Samples that were stored in the refrigerator were protected from aluminium migration from the can to the beer and showed increased aroma stability. Level of aroma constituents of analyzed beer brands was significantly different. Elevated aluminium concentration did not have any noticeable effect on the level of aroma compounds in beer samples stored at 28°C.","Aluminium; Aroma compounds (esters and higher alcohols); Beer; Storage","Absorption spectrophotometry; Aluminium concentration; Aluminium sulphate; Aroma components; Background correction; Higher alcohols; Organoleptic properties; Storage condition; Beer; Energy storage; Gas chromatography; Odors; Refrigerators; Aluminum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845460334

We proposed a non-combined frame memory motion compensation (CFMMC) for video decoding which facilitates the characteristic of the perfect-matched macroblock (MB) to avoid unnecessary memory access and to save energy. The statistic result confirms that some sequences have more than 70% of MBs being perfect-matched MB. The CFMMC hardware architecture is further evaluated for latency, area, and energy. The hardware architecture shows that with SRAM-base frame memory, the equivalent gate count can be reduced by 37.7%, and the energy consumption and the latency may also be improved for sequences with enough percentage of perfect-matched MBs. Since the benefit of the CFMMC is highly dependent on the percentage of perfect-matched MBs, it is best suited for applications with large portion of static background, such as video surveillance, video telephony, and video conferencing. © 2006 IEEE.","Frame memory; Motion compensation; MPEG-4; Video decoding; Zero-skipping","Computer hardware; Energy utilization; Image coding; Static random access storage; Statistical methods; Video conferencing; Video telephone equipment; Frame memory; MPEG-4; Video decoding; Zero-skipping; Motion compensation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751518542

Tissue distribution and cell-type specificity of Gpbar1 mRNA suggest a potential role for the receptor in the endocrine system; however, the precise physiological role of Gpbar1 still remains to be elucidated. To investigate the role of Gpbar1 in vivo, the Gpbar1 gene was disrupted in mice. In homozygous mice, total bile acid pool size was significantly decreased by 21-25% compared with that of the wild-type mice, suggesting that Gpbar1 contributes to bile acid homeostasis. In order to assess the impact of Gpbar1 deficiency in bile acid homeostasis more precisely, Gpbar1 homozygous mice were fed a high-fat diet for 2 months. As a result, female Gpbar1 homozygous mice showed significant fat accumulation with body weight gain compared with that of the wild-type mice. These findings were also observed in heterozygous mice to the same extent. Although the precise mechanism for fat accumulation in female Gpbar1 homozygous mice remains to be addressed, these data indicate that Gpbar1 is a potential new player in energy homeostasis. Thus, Gpbar1-deficient mice are useful in elucidating new physiological roles for Gpbar1. © 2006 Society for Endocrinology.",,"bile acid; G protein coupled bile acid receptor 1; G protein coupled receptor; unclassified drug; animal experiment; article; bile acid metabolism; controlled study; energy metabolism; female; gene disruption; gene sequence; heterozygosity; homozygosity; in vivo study; lipid diet; lipid storage; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein analysis; protein deficiency; protein localization; tissue distribution; weight gain; wild type; Animals; Base Sequence; Bile; Bile Acids and Salts; Blotting, Northern; Body Composition; Cholesterol; Dietary Fats; Feces; Female; Gallbladder; Homeostasis; Liver; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Models, Animal; Molecular Sequence Data; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Tissue Distribution; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751066787

Human patients with dominant-negative mutations in PPARγ display lipodystrophy and extreme insulin resistance. For this reason it was completely unexpected that mice harboring an equivalent mutation (P465L) in PPARγ developed normal amounts of adipose tissue and were insulin sensitive. This finding raised important doubts about the interspecies translatability of PPARγ-related findings, bringing into question the relevance of other PPARγ murine models. Here, we demonstrate that when expressed on a hyperphagic ob/ob background, the P465L PPARγ mutant grossly exacerbates the insulin resistance and metabolic disturbances associated with leptin deficiency, yet reduces whole-body adiposity and adipocyte size. In mouse, coexistence of the P465L PPARγ mutation and the leptin-deficient state creates a mismatch between insufficient adipose tissue expandability and excessive energy availability, unmasking the deleterious effects of PPARγ mutations on carbohydrate metabolism and replicating the characteristic clinical symptoms observed in human patients with dominant-negative PPARγ mutations. Thus, adipose tissue expandability is identified as an important factor for the development of insulin resistance in the context of positive energy balance. © 2006 by the American Diabetes Association.",,"leptin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; insulin; leptin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; carbohydrate metabolism; controlled study; energy balance; female; gene expression; gene mutation; homozygosity; hyperphagia; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; male; metabolic disorder; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; point mutation; priority journal; protein deficiency; protein function; tissue distribution; tissue expansion; animal; blood; gene expression profiling; genetics; glucose blood level; homozygote; insulin resistance; lethal gene; metabolism; mouse mutant; pathology; physiology; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Blood Glucose; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes, Lethal; Homozygote; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Leptin; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Mice, Obese; PPAR gamma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750856072

The proposed solution is based on the idea of locally performing synchronization operations requiring continuous polling of a shared variable, thus, featuring large contentions (e.g., spin locks and barriers). A hardware (HW) module, the synchronization-operation buffer (SB), has been introduced to queue and to manage the requests issued by the processors. By using this mechanism, we propose a spin lock implementation requiring a constant number of network transactions and memory accesses per lock acquisition. The SB also supports an efficient implementation of barriers. Experimental validation has been carried out by using GRAPES, a cycle-accurate performance/power simulation platform for multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs). Two different architectures have been explored to prove that the proposed approach is effective independently from caches and coherence schemes adopted. For an eight-processor target architecture, we show that the SB-based solution achieves up to 50% performance improvement and 30% energy saving with respect to synchronization based on the caching of the synchronization variables and directory-based coherence protocol. Furthermore, we prove the scalability of the proposed approach when the number of processors increases. © 2006 IEEE.","Embedded systems; Energy-aware systems; Multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC); Network-on-chip (NoC); Synchronization","Energy aware systems; Multiprocessor system on chip (MPSoC); Network on chip (NoC); Computer architecture; Computer hardware; Microprocessor chips; Program processors; Storage allocation (computer); Synchronization; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750598820

This study aimed to evaluate changes in trunk fat with GH treatment. Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients and measurements: Sixty-one Japanese adult GH deficient patients (mean age 37 years) were randomised to either GH, titrated to 0.012 mg/kg/day, (n = 30) or placebo (n = 31) for 24 weeks. Body composition, by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), was evaluated at a central laboratory for trunk fat, total body fat and lean body mass. Serum lipid levels were also determined centrally. Results: At baseline, 26 (42.6%) patients had a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2, the threshold for obesity-related complications for Japanese subjects. Median trunk fat mass (FM) was ≥ 9.0 kg for each treatment and gender group, higher than the cut-off for increased age-adjusted risk for cardiovascular complications reported in the normal Japanese population. After 24 weeks of GH treatment, the change in percentage trunk FM was -3.4 ± 0.6%, versus 0.4 ± 0.6% with placebo (p &lt; 0.001). Change in total body FM was -2.8 ± 0.5% with GH and 0.0 ± 0.5% with placebo, indicating that the decrease in trunk fat was more pronounced than for total body fat. Total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol were both significantly (p &lt; 0.001) decreased compared with placebo. One patient discontinued due to a subdural haematoma and one had GH dose reduced due to hyperglycaemia. Conclusions: Japanese patients with GHD have abnormal central fat accumulation, which is reduced by GH treatment over 24 weeks. This may reduce cardiovascular risk but the GH dose should be individualised to maintain IGF-I in the normal range. © 2006 Librapharm Limited.","Abdominal obesity; GH deficiency; GH treatment; Trunk fat","human growth hormone; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; placebo; adult; article; body fat distribution; body mass; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dose response; double blind procedure; drug effect; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; growth hormone deficiency; human; hyperglycemia; Japan; lean body weight; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; randomized controlled trial; subdural hematoma; trunk; Abdominal Fat; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Body Composition; Double-Blind Method; Female; Growth Disorders; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750502242

Recent work (IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci., vol. 24, no. 3, pp. 1101-1105, 1996) shows that overriding the dependence of performance on the individual parameters listed above is the dependence on a combined parameter called the drive or speed parameter S = (Ip/a)/√ρ. This parameter S appears as most fundamental in the process of nondimensionalization of the magnetohydrodynamic equations coupling the highly supersonic motion of the plasma layer with the electromagnetic circuit equation. The drive parameter S is found to directly control the speed of the plasma layer in both axial and radial phases of the PF. A literature survey (IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci., vol. 24, no. 3, pp. 1101-1105, 1996) first pointed out that neutron-optimized Mather-type PF devices with a range of energies from a few kilojoules to hundreds of kilojoules all operate with a remarkably constant drive parameter. This constancy of S has been extended more recently (Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion, vol. 47, pp. A361-A381, 2005) to PF devices over eight orders of magnitude of storage energies, from a fractional of a joule to megajoules. In this paper, experiments on 2-3-kJ dense PF with modified anodes have been conducted to show that this drive parameter remains fairly constant for the different ratios of the anode length to anode radius. It is also suggested that there may be significant differences in the values of drive parameters for Filippov-type focus devices, Mather-type focus devices, and also hybrid-type devices. © 2006 IEEE.","Neutrons; Plasma focus (PF); Reviews","Magnetohydrodynamics; Neutron sources; Optimization; Plasma sheaths; Electromagnetic circuit equation; Filippov types; Mather types; Nondimensionalization; Plasma focus; Supersonic motion; Plasma devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750424950

A several-kiloampere pulse current was supplied from an 8.28-μF storage capacitor to the titanium foil while simultaneously applying a pressure of 8.3 MPa to the joint. The temperature of the foil rapidly increases owing to ohmic heating with a large current. As a result, the titanium foil melts and vaporizes in a short time. The Al2O3 tiles were successfully bonded when the charged voltage in the capacitor was almost the same value as the energy required for vaporization of the titanium foils. The bonding strength increases with the energy input to the foil. The attainable bonding also increases with increasing shear strength from 150 to 300 kg, which in turn increases with increasing foil width from 1 to 7.5 mm for a 50-μm-thick foil. The main reason of the shear-strength improvement was the increase of the joined area that was measured with image analysis of the joint surface. © 2006 IEEE.","Alumina; Ceramics joining; Exploding; Foil; Pulse current; Titanium","Alumina; Bond strength (materials); Bonding; Ceramic capacitors; Metal foil; Shear strength; Tile; Titanium; Capacitor discharge joining technique; Pulse current; Titanium foil; Ceramic materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750419773

In addition to a rudimentary description of the two sites, the canyon air temperature (CAT) model requires only inputs measured at standard weather stations; yet it is capable of accurately predicting the evolution of air temperature in all weather conditions for extended periods. It simulates the effect of urban geometry on radiant exchange; the effect of moisture availability on latent heat flux; energy stored in the ground and in building surfaces; air flow in the street based on wind above roof height; and the sensible heat flux from individual surfaces and from the street canyon as a whole. The CAT model has been tested on field data measured in a monitoring program carried out in Adelaide, Australia, in 2000-2001. After calibrating the model, predicted air temperature correlated well with measured data in all weather conditions over extended periods. The experimental validation provides additional evidence in support of a number of parameterisation schemes incorporated in the model to account for sensible heat and storage flux.

In the laboratory, summer-diapausing pupae of H. armigera were induced at high temperatures (33-39 °C) with a photoperiod of LD8:16; winter-diapausing and non-diapausing pupae, cultured at 20 °C with a photoperiod of LD8:16 and at 27 °C, LD16:8, respectively, acted as a control. Retention time of eye spots, weight, and lipid and glycogen levels were compared. At high temperatures, both body weight and energy storage capacity were much higher in summer-diapausing pupae than in non-diapausing pupae reared at 33-39 °C. At temperatures (>33 °C) high enough to maintain summer diapause, the eye spots of summer-diapausing pupae did not move during the 30-day experiment. However, eye spots of summer-diapausing pupae placed at 30 °C began to move about 10 days after they were transferred, significantly later than in non-diapausing pupae reared at 33-39 °C or non-diapausing pupae reared at 27 °C, which initiated eye spot movement 2 days after pupation. The differences in retention time of eye spots between summer- and winter-diapausing pupae shows that winter diapause is more intense than summer diapause in this insect. The weight loss, and lipid and glycogen metabolism curves indicate that the summer-diapausing pupae's metabolism is very low. We conclude that summer diapause in the cotton bollworm is a true diapause and that the summer diapause enables the cotton bollworm to withstand the high temperatures of summer. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

As the voltage-restoration process involves real-power injection into the distribution system, the capability of a particular DVR topology, especially for compensating long-duration voltage sags, depends on the energy storage capacity of the DVR. The interline DVR (IDVR) proposed in this paper provides a way to replenish dc-link energy storage dynamically. The IDVR consists of several DVRs connected to different distribution feeders in the power system. The DVRs in the IDVR system share a common energy storage. When one of the DVR compensates for voltage sag appearing in that feeder, the other DVRs replenish the energy in the common dc-link dynamically. Thus, one DVR in the IDVR system works in voltage-sag compensation mode while the other DVRs in the IDVR system operate in power-flow control mode. In principle, IDVR can operate effectively when constituent DVRs are electrically (not necessarily physically) far apart. Closed-loop load voltage and current-mode-control techniques are used as the control strategy in the two modes of operation. Experimental results obtained for a laboratory prototype of the IDVR are presented to show the effectiveness and the efficacy of the proposed IDVR system to improve power quality. © 2006 IEEE.","Current-mode control; Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR); Interline dynamic voltage restoration; Phase advance; Power quality","Closed loop control systems; Electric current control; Energy storage; Power control; Voltage control; Voltage distribution measurement; Current-mode control; Dynamic voltage restorer; Interline dynamic voltage restorer; Phase advance; Power quality; Voltage sags; Voltage regulators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750117276

To fulfill the special needs of each single process stable DC, MF and RF process power ranging from 50W to 200kW is needed. All generators need a high precision process control and a supreme arc management with adaptable parameters to provide minimal disturbances in the plasma process and to obtain optimized results in terms of film quality, homogeneity and uniformity over the whole substrate. The fast and flexible arc handling leads to an improvement in the film quality by minimizing flaws and defects and enables the use of very high sputter rates. To fit DC process demands a new concept for a modular DC system has been realized where up to four 30kW modules can be combined using master slave concept. The arc management and control of the DC module has an intelligent control enabling arc detection times of less than 1μs and a residual energy delivered to the process of only 6 mJ per kW. For MF processes a fast and effective arc management is an even more important tool for keeping reactive processes stable. The new generation of MF power supplies enables arc detection and shut off times of 5μs with a residual energy delivered to the process of only 5 mJ per kilowatt. This yields the additional advantage that even when the cathode material is almost used up and consequently the arc probability increases, the low residual energy values contribute to an extended service life of the cathode and to better utilization of the target material. Essentially, the outstanding feature of effective arc management is an undisturbed plasma during the whole operation time. The fast arc suppression minimizes the interruption in the sputtering process to negligibly small values. However, because arcs also serve to remove unwanted materials on the cathode, power supplies must be able to control and regulate the arc energy precisely. MF power supplies are available for process power up to 200kW. RF systems are based on two different concepts to fit the broad power range between 50W and 50kW. For the low energy range a fully transistorized and μC-controlled RF generator was developed. This generator has been designed for a max. power of 3kW. Important features are the compact size, robustness, reliability and easy maintenance To have a cost effective design for a high power RF generator in this power range an oscillator - amplifier concept has been chosen with a solid state driver in combination with a tube type end stage amplifier. To fit todays demands for advanced etching a dual frequency system consisting of a 13.6MHz and a 3.4MHz unit was developed. This enables the possibility to separately control plasma density and ion energy of the discharge. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, the effect of disc displacement on joint stresses during prolonged clenching was studied. For this purpose, finite-element models of the TMJ, with and without disc displacement, were used. Muscle forces were used as a loading condition for stress analysis during a time-period of 10 min. The TMJ disc and connective tissue were characterized as a linear viscoelastic material. In the asymptomatic model, large stresses were found in the central and lateral part of the disc through clenching. In the retrodiscal tissue, stress relaxation occurred during the first 2 min of clenching. In the symptomatic model, large stresses were observed in the posterior part of the disc and in the retrodiscal tissue, and the stress level was kept constant through clenching. This indicates that during prolonged clenching the disc functions well in the asymptomatic joint, meanwhile the retrodiscal tissue in the symptomatic joint is subject to excessive stress. As this structure is less suitable for bearing large stresses, tissue damage may occur. In addition, storage of excessive strain energy might lead to breakage of the tissue. © 2006 The Authors.","Joint loading; Mathematical model; Parafunction; Retrodiscal tissue; Viscoelasticity","adult; article; audiovisual equipment; bruxism; dental care; dislocation; female; finite element analysis; human; injury; mastication; mechanical stress; pathophysiology; temporomandibular joint; temporomandibular joint disorder; three dimensional imaging; Adult; Bite Force; Bruxism; Dental Stress Analysis; Dislocations; Female; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Models, Anatomic; Stress, Mechanical; Temporomandibular Joint; Temporomandibular Joint Disk; Temporomandibular Joint Disorders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749561924

The lifting steps of a unidimensional wavelet are applied along a local orientation defined on a quincunx sampling grid. To maximize energy compaction, the orientation minimizing the prediction error is chosen adaptively. A fine-grained multiscale analysis is provided by iterating the decomposition on the low-frequency band. In the context of image compression, the multiresolution orientation map is coded using a quad tree. The rate allocation between the orientation map and wavelet coefficients is jointly optimized in a rate-distortion sense. For image denoising, a Markov model is used to extract the orientations from the noisy image. As long as the map is sufficiently homogeneous, interesting properties of the original wavelet are preserved such as regularity and orthogonality. Perfect reconstruction is ensured by the reversibility of the lifting scheme. The mutual information between the wavelet coefficients is studied and compared to the one observed with a separable wavelet transform. The rate-distortion performance of this new transform is evaluated for image coding using state-of-the-art subband coders. Its performance in a denoising application is also assessed against the performance obtained with other transforms or denoising methods. © 2006 IEEE.","Lifting; Multiscale image processing; Quincunx sampling; Wavelets","Image coding; Image reconstruction; Markov processes; Mathematical models; Wavelet transforms; Image denoising; Markov model; Multiscale image processing; Quincunx sampling; Wavelet coefficients; Image compression; algorithm; article; artifact; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; image enhancement; information processing; information retrieval; methodology; signal processing; statistical model; statistics; Algorithms; Artifacts; Computer Simulation; Data Compression; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Stochastic Processes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749183383

This algorithm consists of two stages; namely, a learning-based approximate pattern search and an iterative energy-minimization procedure for matching relative image gradient. The first stage finds some candidate poses of the pattern from the image through a fast nearest-neighbor search of the best match of the relative gradient features computed from training database of feature vectors, which are obtained from the synthesis of the geometrically transformed template image with the transformation parameters uniformly sampled from a given transformation parameter space. Subsequently, the candidate poses are further verified and refined by matching the relative gradient images through an iterative energy-minimization procedure. This approach based on the matching of relative gradients is robust against nonuniform illumination variations. Experimental results on both simulated and real images are shown to demonstrate superior efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm over the conventional normalized correlation method. © 2006 IEEE.","Energy minimization; Illumination variations; Image alignment; Image matching; Industrial inspection; Nearest neighbor search; Robust image matching","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Iterative methods; Optimization; Pattern matching; Vectors; Illumination variations; Image alignment; Image matching; Relative gradient matching; Robust image matching; Image processing; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; image subtraction; information retrieval; methodology; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Subtraction Technique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749172835

Pressurized air receivers are used in solar tower plants to heat the compressed air in the gas turbine to temperatures up to 1000 °C. Therefore solar shares in the design case of 40% up to 90% can be realized and annual solar shares up to 30% can be achieved in base load. Using modern gas turbine systems in recuperation or combined cycle mode leads to conversion efficiencies of the solar heat from around 40% up to more than 50%. This is an important step towards cost reduction of solar thermal power. Together with the advantages of hybrid power plants-variable solar share, fully dispatchable power, 24 h operation without storage-solar gas turbine systems are expected to have a high potential for market introduction in the mid term view. In this paper the design and performance assessment of several prototype plants in the power levels of 1 MW, 5 MW and 15 MW are presented. Advanced software tools are used for design optimization and performance prediction of the solar tower gas turbine power plants. Detailed cost assumptions for the solarized gas turbine, the solar tower plant and further equipment as well as for operation and maintenance are presented.

Due to the energy storage capacity limitation of DC link, it is necessary to minimize energy injection from DVR. The techniques of the supply voltage sag compensation in a distribution feeder are reviewed in this paper. Then a new device which is named Inter-line Dynamic Voltage Restorer (IDVR) is discussed. This device consists of two conventional DVRs which are installed in two different distribution feeders and the DC link capacitor. DVR which is installed in LV feeder operates in voltage sag compensation mode. A novel control technique minimizes the energy flow from DC link capacitor to this feeder.

However, the correct valuation of such contacts and their physical counterparts is still under lively debate.

By means of a minimal set of reasonable assumptions we suggest a framework where the standard change-of-numeraire transformation converts a flow commodity market into a market consisting of zero bonds and some additional risky asset.

Using the volume of components like separator drums or heat exchangers for storage of pressurized hot water is a cost-effective approach to integrate buffer storage capacity. While the basic steam accumulator shows a decline in pressure during the discharge process, there are also concepts maintaining constant pressure. The integration of latent heat storage material allows an increase in volumetric storage capacity. The availability of steam accumulators for compensation of fast transients also helps to reduce the requirements concerning reaction time and discharge rate for storage systems intended for supplying stored energy over longer periods. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In the project WESPE that is described in this paper, solid media sensible heat storage materials have been researched. Two storage systems with a storage capacity of about 350 kW h each and maximum temperatures of 390 °C have been developed. The test storage units of WESPE are erected at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria in Spain. The thermal energy is provided by a parabolic trough loop with a maximum thermal power of 480 kW. The first tests were performed at storage temperatures up to 325 °C by March of 2004; testing will be continued during 2004 to achieve the nominal operation conditions of 390 °C and to gain experience for long term behaviour. These storage systems are composed of modules with two different storage materials to identify the characteristics of these materials. A tubular heat exchanger is integrated into the storage material. This heat exchanger demands a significant share of the investment costs. The selection of geometry parameters like tube diameter and number of tubes therefore play an important role in the optimisation. The design of the WESPE test module is based on results provided by a numerical tool for simulation of the transient performance of storage systems. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a new systems thermodynamics analysis of oxidative- and photo-phosphorylation has been performed. New experimental data has been reported on the inhibition of ATP synthesis by known specific anion channel blockers: the triorganotin compound, tributyltin chloride (TBTCl), and the stilbene compound 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS), and interpreted as supporting the new framework. A bioinformatic analysis of the interacting a-c regions in FO has been carried out to locate the anion binding pocket in the anion-proton symsequenceporter and insights into the coordination chemistry of the bound chloride in its internal cavity at the lipid-water interface have been obtained. The need to look at ATP synthesis in FO as a multisubstrate reaction has been emphasized and a detailed microscopic explanation of the mechanism of inhibition by these blockers and its relationship to the conformational cycle within FO has been postulated. Such detailed explanations of the role of membrane elements in a lipophilic region have been shown to lead to deeper understanding and to offer a more realistic and complete picture of biological energy transduction than considering the bilayer as ""mere insulation"", as in chemiosmotic dogma. Details of the elementary force production events by myosin II have been provided within the novel molecular systems framework of the RUT mechanism in which the S-1, the S-1-S-2 hinge, and the S-2 coiled coil all have essential roles in the in vivo contractile process. The new paradigm is shown to be consistent with the great body of experiments usually considered to support the swinging crossbridge/lever arm models of muscle contraction, because these events also occur during the cycle but as events preliminary to the occurrence of the power stroke. The crucial role of energy storage in mechanically strained nonequilibrium conformational states of myosin, specifically as a high-energy state of S-2 with uncoiled first few N-terminal heptads is highlighted. The propensity of these heptads to recoil and regain the resting state of the coiled coil is postulated to be a primary driving force of the power stroke. The new paradigms of ATP synthesis/muscle contraction have been shown to remove the inconsistencies present in previous theories and to have the sound backing of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, the principle of electrical neutrality, the laws of Newtonian mechanics, and the great conservation laws of mechanics. A systems integration of muscle contraction has been successfully made and a systems electrical analog constructed. The unifying laws and principles in the new theories have been further applied to understand the functioning of other protein molecular machines such as kinesin, ncd and unconventional myosins. Finally, the major physical, chemical, biological and technological implications arising as a result of this research have been discussed. Taken together, the new paradigms have been shown to solve fundamental molecular mechanistic problems in bioenergetics and motility and to offer a most detailed, unified and appealing picture of energy generation, transduction, storage and utilization processes in systems of biological molecular machines. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Memories are responsible for a significant percentage of a system's aggregate energy consumption. Consequently, novel memories as well as novel-memory architectures are being designed to reduce the energy consumption. Caches and scratchpads are two contrasting memory architectures. The former relies on hardware logic while the latter relies on software for its utilization. To meet different requirements, most contemporary high-end embedded microprocessors include on-chip instruction and data caches along with a scratchpad. Previous approaches for utilizing scratchpad did not consider caches and hence fail for the contemporary high-end systems. Instructions are allocated onto the scratchpad, while taking into account the behavior of the instruction cache present in the system. The problem of scratchpad allocation is solved using a heuristic and also optimally using an integer linear programming formulation. An average reduction of 7% and 23% in processor cycles and instruction-memory energy, respectively, is reported when compared against a previously published technique. The average deviation between optimal and nonoptimal solutions was found to be less than 6% both in terms of processor cycles and energy. The scratchpad in the presented architecture is similar to a preloaded loop cache. Comparing the energy consumption of the presented approach against that of a preloaded loop cache, an average reduction of 9% and 29% in processor cycles and instruction-memory energy, respectively, is reported. © 2006 IEEE.","Memory hierarchy; Memory management; Optimizing compilers; SRAM chips","Memory hierarchy; Memory management; Optimizing compilers; SRAM chips; Algorithms; Cache memory; Computer architecture; Energy utilization; Heuristic methods; Microprocessor chips; Problem solving; Random access storage; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748316689

The problems of airflow in an aerated soya bean store and propagation of a cooling zone through a grain bulk were solved consecutively. To calculate airflow lines in silos, a model developed for isothermal flow was used. To simulate the cooling dynamics of the soya bean mass, three models were analysed and compared with experimental data. The first method is based on the solution of system of partial differential equations, describing the heat and mass transfer and conservation of energy. In second method, the deep bed is hypothetically divided into a limited number of thin layers ('homogeneous reactors'), in which the respective temperatures of the grain and of the surrounding air are considered identical. Experimental equipment was developed to study soya bean cooling dynamics for different airflow velocities in deep beds of uniform and variable cross-section. Using a homochronous number as the argument, the dimensionless temperature data in a deep bed of uniform cross-section in different sections at various speeds were satisfactorily described by generalising empirical dependence. The third method of simulating the cooling dynamics of the soya bean mass, based on the use of this dependence, gave the best results in comparison with other methods considered. This method was adapted for a variable section deep bed, tested on experimental data and used for modelling the thermal state of silos. © 2006 IAgrE.",,"Aerodynamics; Algorithms; Computer software; Cooling; Heat transfer; Isotherms; Mathematical models; Partial differential equations; Seed; Airflow; Airflow velocities; Grain Storage; Thermal State; Food storage; Algorithms; Food Storage; Heat Transfer; Isotherms; Seeds; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748312017

The SMB model consists of a superconducting stator of YBCO bulks and a NdFeB permanent magnet circuit. The levitation force density reached 11 N/cm2 at 77 K, and the time decay of levitation force was suppressed in allowable ranges by adopting such techniques as ""pre-loading"" or ""super-cooling"" method. The rotation loss was reduced by means of improving the homogeneity of magnetic field distribution in both permanent magnet circuit and superconducting bulk stator. The availability of radial-type SMB for FESS was investigated by constructing 10 kW h class FESS using both SMB and active magnetic bearings. The operation test resulted in the energy storage of 5.0 kW h at rotation speed of 11,250 rpm.

After galvanostatic hydrogen charging, the carbon material was analyzed by galvanostatic discharge and temperature-programmed desorption in order to determine the nature of the carbon-hydrogen bond and the amount of hydrogen sorbed. The activation energy for hydrogen desorption was estimated to be 110 kJ/mol, that confirms a weak chemical character of the hydrogen-carbon bond. Although the bond is stronger than in the case of physisorption, the fraction of hydrogen irreversibly trapped is low compared to the reversible fraction. Finally, we show that the reversible capacity can be significantly enhanced by increasing the temperature to 60 °C during the electrochemical reduction of water. The well-defined plateau during the oxidation step demonstrates high potentialities of this technique for electrochemical energy storage in nanoporous carbons using an aqueous medium. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Different invariants have been obtained for the existing (entry capsules, parachutes and rovers) and potential martian exploring vehicles (lighter-than-air vehicle, airplane, helicopter and Mars Jumper). These similarity criteria, as non-dimensional numbers, allow to quickly compare if such kind of vehicles can operate in the martian environment, the movement performances, the necessary geometrical dimensions and the power consumption. Following this way of study it was concluded what vehicle is most suitable for the near soil Mars exploration. ""Mars Rover"" has less power consumption on Mars, but due to the rugged terrain the performances are weak. A vacuumed rigid airship is possible to fly with high performances and endurance on Mars, versus the impossibility of such a machine on the Earth. Due to very low density and the low Reynolds numbers in the Mars atmosphere, the power consumption for the martian airplane or helicopter is substantially higher. The most efficient vehicle for the Mars exploration seems to be a machine using the in situ non-chemical propellants: the 95% CO2 atmosphere and the weak solar radiation. A small compressor, electrically driven by photovoltaics, compresses the gas in a storage tank, in time. If the gas is expanded through a nozzle, sufficient lift and control forces are obtained for a VTOL flight of kilometers over the martian soil, in comparison with tens of meters of the actual Mars rovers. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The heat for melting of PCM in the capsule is provided by hot water surrounding it. Since it is observed experimentally that the phase change occurs in a range of temperature, the present analysis considers this range instead of constant phase change temperature and the deviation between the results of these two is presented. The numerical analysis has been carried out by using enthalpy method and the results are verified with the experimental data. The experiments have been done by visualization technique without disturbing the actual process of melting. Three distinct stages of melting process have been identified as revealed by visualization studies. Results indicate that the melting process is chiefly governed by the magnitude of the Stefan number, Ste, phase change temperature range and the capsule radius. The analysis shows that the agreement between analytical and experimental results is significantly improved when the results are obtained considering phase change temperature range and the natural convection in the liquid phase instead of considering the process to be conduction dominated only. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The hybrid thermal energy storage system accumulates solar energy during sunny days and releases it later at night or during cloudy days. It also stores heat from an electric heater during off-peak periods so as to release it later during peak periods. The control model, which makes use of 24-h weather forecasts, comprises two types of controllers: a fuzzy logic controller for estimating the daily amount of thermal electric energy to be stored and a feedforward controller for determining the electricity consumption profile of the heating element during off-peak hours. Results indicate that the proposed control system is far superior to traditional control systems. It maintains a comfortable thermal environment at all times, i.e. the temperature fluctuations are kept within the imposed margins and overheating of the room never occurs. Furthermore, compared to a traditional electric base board heating system, it reduces the electricity consumption for the winter season by 24% and 94% of this electricity is consumed during off-peak hours. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

It has been developed at IPP in order to perform vibration tests with shaft assemblies of large flywheel generators (synchronous machines). The electromagnetic exciter (shaker) needs no fixture to the rotating shaft because the torque is applied by means of the stator winding of an electrical machine. Therefore, the exciter can most easily be applied in cases where a three-phase electrical machine (a motor or generator) is part of the shaft assembly. The oscillating power for the shaker is generated in a separate current-controlled DC circuit with an inductor acting as a buffer storage of magnetic energy. An AC component with adjustable frequency is superimposed on the inductor current in order to generate pulsating torques acting on the rotating shaft with the desired waveform and frequency. Since this torsional exciter does not require an external power source, can easily be installed (without contact to the rotating structure) and provides dynamic torsional forces which are sufficient for multi-megawatt applications, it is best suited for on-site tests of large rotating machinery. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a magnetically controlled Uni-Ball-Mill, small amounts of the iron oxides, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, were ball milled with Mg powder in a hydrogen atmosphere (Mg to Fe atomic ratio; 20:1). Milling products as well as samples used in hydrogen absorption/desorption experiments were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. TG analysis combined with DSC revealed a higher hydrogen storage capacity for the Mg + Fe2O3 + H2-milled product (6 wt% H) compared with 5 wt% H for Mg + Fe3O4 + H2. XRD revealed that during heating, both iron oxides were reduced to pure Fe, a result not previously reported for similar materials milled using different milling devices. For both samples, there was little difference found in the decomposition temperature of the as-prepared MgH2 and rehydrogenated composites. However, storage capacity degradations were observed for the rehydrogenated composites (4 wt% H storage capacity for MgH2 + Fe2O3 and 4.4 wt% H for MgH2 + Fe3O4). The higher capacity degradation of rehydrogenated MgH2 + Fe2O3 composite is also believed to be a result of the reduction reaction, during which more magnesium was consumed than was consumed by the same amount of Fe3O4. The results also were related to the particular ball-milling equipment and low-energy shearing milling mode employed, which promoted the development of a nanostructural hydride product which subsequently changed structure significantly during the first desorption cycle. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, though the various approaches established, preparation of one-dimensional nano-structured PANI with controllable morphologies and sizes, especially well oriented arrays on a large scale is still a major challenge. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms of the nanostructures are still unclear.

Such segregation may be social in nature, or ecological, or both. Grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), like many large mammals, are sexually size dimorphic. In size dimorphic species, allometric differences in morphology, metabolic rate and reproductive costs are likely. Such differences may require the sexes to use different foraging strategies or different habitats. To investigate sexual segregation of habitat in grey seals, we used satellite tracks from 95 (male 46; female 49) adults breeding at Sable Island, Nova Scotia (44 °N, 60 °W) collected from 1995 to 2005. Location estimates were made from satellite fixes using a state-space movement model to estimate true locations and regularize them in time. Location estimates were used to calculate home range kernels of male and female habitat use each month. Month by sex kernel home ranges revealed striking differences and dynamics in habitat use between males and females on spatial scales broader than most terrestrial examples and at temporal and spatial resolutions rarely available for marine species. Differences were most pronounced just before (October-December) and immediately after breeding (February-March). During both periods, males primarily used areas along the continental shelf break, while females mainly used mid-shelf regions. Coupled with previously identified sex-specific seasonal patterns of energy storage, diving and diet, our findings suggest that males and females differ profoundly in their spatial foraging strategies. These differences may serve to maximize fitness by reducing intersexual competition during key foraging periods. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Foraging behaviour; Halichoerus grypus; Home range; Kernel analysis; Seal; Sexual segregation","allometry; foraging behavior; habitat use; home range; metabolism; morphology; pinniped; reproductive cost; satellite imagery; sexual dimorphism; social behavior; allometry; article; breeding; Canada; controlled study; female; foraging; foraging behavior; habitat selection; male; nonhuman; priority journal; seal; sex difference; species difference; species distribution; species habitat; Canada; North America; Nova Scotia; Sable Island; Animalia; Halichoerus grypus; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748664596

The production and utilization stages of the vehicles are taken into consideration. The comparison is based on a mathematical procedure, which includes normalization of economic indicators (prices of vehicles and fuels during the vehicle life and driving range) and environmental indicators (greenhouse gas and air pollution emissions), and evaluation of an optimal relationship between the types of vehicles in the fleet. According to the comparison, hybrid and electric cars exhibit advantages over the other types. The economic efficiency and environmental impact of electric car use depends substantially on the source of the electricity. If the electricity comes from renewable energy sources, the electric car is advantageous compared to the hybrid. If electricity comes from fossil fuels, the electric car remains competitive only if the electricity is generated on board. It is shown that, if electricity is generated with an efficiency of about 50-60% by a gas turbine engine connected to a high-capacity battery and an electric motor, the electric car becomes advantageous. Implementation of fuel cells stacks and ion conductive membranes into gas turbine cycles permits electricity generation to increase to the above-mentioned level and air pollution emissions to decrease. It is concluded that the electric car with on-board electricity generation represents a significant and flexible advance in the development of efficient and ecologically benign vehicles. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This study focused on airflow, turbulence, ventilation rate, evapotranspiration and energy balance in a large commercial flat-roof banana screenhouse in northern Israel. Measurements were made during 14 days. An eddy covariance system, consisting of a one-dimensional sonic anemometer, a fine-wire thermocouple and a Krypton hygrometer, was deployed at 5 m height, in a location allowing a minimum fetch of 100 m in all directions. Net radiation, soil heat flux and storage, soil evaporation, air temperature and humidity and turbulent airflow characteristics were measured. Comparison between wind speed inside and outside of the screenhouse suggests that the logarithmic wind profile model is approximately valid within the screenhouse. Airflow direction inside the screenhouse was usually the same as that of the external wind. Friction velocity scaled with the mean horizontal wind speed inside the screenhouse. Integral length scale calculations showed that eddies were always narrow and long and high air velocities caused eddies to become even narrower, as expected. Average turbulence intensity within the screenhouse for all data was 0.49 ± 0.12 (± standard deviation). Spectral energy density depended on frequency to the power of about -5/3, typical of the inertial subrange in turbulent boundary layers. Air exchange rate increased with wind speed, as expected. Evapotranspiration averaged 5.6 ± 0.47 mm day-1, in accord with the 7-8 mm day-1 irrigation.

The instability is understood as both regular distortions of the jet surface shape and turbulence of the flow as such. The visual manifestations and physical mechanisms determining the development of flow instability are analyzed and classified. The following principal forms of instability are distinguished: small-scale regular surface defects, periodic oscillations with the scale of the jet diameter, the slip-stick periodic transition phenomenon, self-oscillations of the stream, jet spurt, and large-scale distortions passing into stream discontinuities. In all cases, the instability of the jet is due to rubber elasticity of polymer fluids, a property which causes storage of elastic energy during deformation with its subsequent release in the form of stream distortions. Therefore, the general criterion for the onset of instability is a certain critical value of the Weissenberg number. The key factors determining the loss of the flow stability are concentration of stresses at the channel outlet, transition from laminar flow to slip along a solid wall (adhesive ruptures) under certain critical conditions, and mechanical fracture (cohesive ruptures) of a material. In the appearance of hysteresis oscillations, bulk elasticity and compressibility of the melt also play a certain role. Alternative mechanisms proposed in the literature are also discussed. Examples illustrating the possibility of suppressing jet distortions are given; this suppression is important for many industrial applications in polymer processing. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc., 2006.",,"Crystal defects; Elasticity; Industrial applications; Laminar flow; Physical properties; Polymers; Flow instability; Polymer solutions; Stream discontinuities; Surface defects; Flow control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748676448

UV irradiation of planarly oriented films of the mixtures leads to E-Z photoisomerization of dopant, helix untwisting and shift of selective light reflection peak to the longer wavelength spectral region. Kinetics of this process was studied at different temperatures. It was shown that a relative rate of helix untwisting for the mixture with the high molar mass fraction (DP ∼ 87) is 2 orders of magnitude less than for the mixture containing a low-molar-mass fraction (DP ∼ 22), whereas the activation energies of the helix untwisting for both mixtures have almost the same values. The formation of the ordered TDK* phase during annealing of the blend at 50°C for 1 week completely prevents the helix untwisting.

Several different fungal species were found after waste sanitation treatment (70 °C, 1 h), with Aspergillus species dominating in non-inoculated waste. Anaerobic waste degradation decreased the diversity of fungal species for processes run at both 37 and 55 °C, but not total fungal colony forming units. Fungi surviving the mesophilic anaerobic digestion were mainly thermotolerant Talaromyces and Paecilomyces species. T. crustaceus and T. lanuginosus were the only inoculated fungi to survive the thermophilic anaerobic degradation process. Aerobic storage of both types of anaerobic residues for one month significantly decreased fungal counts. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The OA spectra reveal two bands with maxima at 1.0 and 3.2 eV connected with absorption of the Fe3+ and Fe2+ and IR absorption at wavelengths longer than 2700 nm. The ultraviolet absorption varies exponentially with the photon energy following the 'vitreous' empirical Urbach rule indicating exponential distribution of localised states in the forbidden band. The natural TL is peaked at 700 K. Laboratory beta irradiation creates a very broad TL peak with maximum at 430 K. The change of the 430 K TL peak shape under the thermal cleaning procedure and dark storage after irradiation reveals a monotonous increasing of the activation energy that can be explained by the exponential distribution of traps. The IRSL response is weak and exhibits a typical decay behaviour. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",,"article; beta radiation; crystal; experimentation; heating; infrared radiation; light absorption; Mexico; photon; Quaternary (period); spin trapping; temperature; thermally stimulated luminescence; thermoluminescence; volcano; Alkalies; Aluminum Silicates; Computer Simulation; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Light; Materials Testing; Mexico; Models, Chemical; Phosphorus; Radiation Dosage; Thermoluminescent Dosimetry; Volcanic Eruption; Volcanic Eruptions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749659667

The microstructure examined by XRD, SEM and EDX shows that the alloys consist of multi-phases, which are (La, Mg)2Ni7 phase, LaMgNi4 phase, (La, Mg)Ni3 phase and LaNi5 phase. It is can be found that Ca does not appear to segregate. This phenomenon is different from Mg. With increasing Ca content, the main phase varies from (La, Mg)2Ni7 phase (x = 0) to (La, Mg)Ni3 phase (x = 0.3), LaNi5 phase (x = 0.6, 0.8) and (La, Mg)Ni3 phase (x = 1.0, 1.3). The maximum discharge capacities of the alloy electrodes increase from 244.6 mAh/g (x = 0) to 380 mAh/g (x = 1.0), and then decrease to 353.6 mAh/g (x = 1.3). The discharge capacities of the alloys are related to phase content. Cell volumes of LaNi5 phase, (La, Mg)2Ni7 phase and (La, Mg)Ni3 phase all decrease and the high rate dischargeability (HRD) is improved by adding Ca.

By using KrF excimer laser (λ = 248 nm) ablation of borax (Na 2 B 4 O 7 ) target, thin films were deposited on KBr and silicon substrates. Ablation was performed both in vacuum and in hydrogen atmosphere. DC glow discharge technique was utilized to enhance hydrogen gas ionization. Experiments were performed using laser fluence from 5 to 20 J/cm 2 . Films were deposited under gas pressure of 1 × 10 -5 to 5 × 10 -2 mbar and substrate temperatures of 130-450 °C. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of films showed presence of circular particulates. Film thickness, roughness and particulates number increased with increase in laser fluence. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis shows that sodium content in the particulates is higher than in the target. This effect is discussed in terms of atomic arrangements (both at surface and bulk) in systems where ionic and covalent bonds are present and by looking at the increased surface/bulk ratio of the particulates with respect to the deposited films. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements showed presence of B{single bond}O stretching and B{single bond}O{single bond}B bending bonds. Possible reasons for absence of B{single bond}H bonds are attributed to binding enthalpy of the competing molecules. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The ring consists of 32 ten-bend achromat cells and has a natural emittance of 34×10-12 m rad. Simulation showed that the horizontal dynamic apertures at the center of a straight section are -4.2 and +2.9 mm and that they can be increased to -5.4 and +7.9 mm, respectively by changing the strength of sextupole magnets used for chromaticity correction. Emittance growth due to intrabeam scattering and Touschek lifetime were estimated. With 0.1% coupling, the horizontal emittance was 109×10-12 m rad, and the lifetime was 0.17 h for a 0.1-mA bunch current. With 100% coupling, it was 21×10-12 m rad, and the lifetime was 2.0 h.

Ten volunteers randomly underwent three passive coldEx, incorporating a 10-min moderate-exercise period at the 65th min while wearing a liquid conditioning garment (LCG) and military arctic clothing. In PHT, 50°C water was circulated in the LCG before coldEx until core temperature was increased by 0.5°C. In HT, participants regulated the inlet LCG water temperature throughout coldEx to subjective comfort, while the LCG was not operating in Con. Thermal comfort, rectal temperature, mean skin temperature, mean finger temperature (T̄fing), change in Hb (ΔHb), rate of body heat storage, Purdue pegboard test, finger tapping, handgrip, maximum voluntary contraction, and evoked twitch force of the first dorsal interosseus muscle were recorded. Results demonstrated that, unlike in HT and PHT, thermal comfort, rectal temperature, mean skin temperature, twitch force, maximum voluntary contraction, and finger tapping declined significantly in Con. In contrast, T̄fing and Purdue pegboard test remained constant only in HT. Generalized estimating equations demonstrated that ΔHb and T̄fing were associated over time with hand function, whereas no significant association was detected for rate of body heat storage. It is concluded that increasing Hb not only throughout but also before a coldEx is effective in maintaining hand function. In addition, we found that the best indicator of hand function is ΔHb followed by T̄fing.

N9B 3P4, Canada","Chemically reducible micro- and mesoporous Ti oxides with controlled pore sizes from 12 to 26 Å were synthesized. The hydrogen storage and adsorption capacity at 77 K was tested as a function of surface area, pore size, and reducing agent. Surprisingly, the oxidation state of the surface Ti species had an even greater effect on the storage densities than surface area or pore size. For example, the 12 Å material reduced with bis(toluene) Ti possesses a surface area of less than 300 m2/g, but absorbs up to 4.94 wt % and 40.46 kg/m3 of H2 reversibly at 77 K and 100 atm. This volumetric storage capacity is higher than that of AX-21, which has a much higher surface area. The H2 binding enthalpies increased from 4.21 kJ/mol to 8.08 kJ/mol as the surface oxidation state of the Ti decreased. These results suggest that a Kubas-type σ H2 complex may be involved and that further tuning of the H2 binding enthalpies through use of appropriate organometallic reagents may achieve even higher storage levels at more moderate temperature.

At first, the composite mixture of LiH and LiNH2 doped with TiCl3 as a catalyst was prepared by ball milling for 2 h under a H2 gas pressure of 1 MPa. The TDS profile indicated that ∼6 mass% H2 was desorbed by the reaction LiH + LiNH2 ↔ Li2NH + H2 in the temperature range from 150 to 250 °C under a He gas flow at a heating rate of 5 °C min-1, but the H-desorption equilibrium pressure PH2 was ∼0.1 MPa at 250 °C. This temperature is too high for onboard use, indicating that further improvement is necessary to destabilize the above H-storage reaction. For that, we clarified the H-desorption mechanism by the isotopic exchange experiments, on the basis of which we designed a new Li-Mg-N-H composite system with the reaction 8LiH + 3Mg(NH2)2 ↔ 4Li2NH + Mg3N2 + 8H2. This composite materials desorbed ∼7 mass% H2 in the range from 120 to 200 °C and the H-desorption equilibrium pressure PH2 was higher than 5 MPa at 200 °C, indicating that this system has an excellent potential for onboard applications. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Pressure composition (P-C-T) isotherm using water displacement method has been investigated in the temperature and pressure ranges of 308 ≤ T ≤ 338 K and 0.5 ≤ P ≤ 10 bar, respectively. The P-C isotherms show the presence of two single α and β regions one mixed α + β phase. The maximum H (wt%) was found to be around 1.53 at 308 K and around 6 bar.

Recently a series of metal hydrides with unusually short H-H separations has been synthesized in Norway. The origin of this unexpected short H-H separation has been explained and several compounds with even shorter H-H separations have been predicted. From a systematic study on around 100 ZrNiAl-type compounds we have demonstrated that the electron localization function is a powerful tool to predict hydrogen positions in metal, intermetallic and alloy matrices. Based on these observations we have devised a new empirical rule, termed as ""site-preference rule"", for prediction of suitable sites for hydrogen accommodation. First principle total-energy calculations have been carried out for AH, EH2, AEH3, AXH4, and A3XH6 (A = alkali metal, E = alkaline earth metal, X = B, Al or Ga) compounds to study structural phase stability at ambient and high pressures. We have reproduced crystal structures of known phases and predicted structural parameters for other compounds within these series. We have found that, if the cation (A+ or E2+) radius is relatively small, one can expect several pressure-induced structural transitions with huge volume collapse at the first phase-transition point. These materials have mixed chemical bonding character which we have characterized by charge density, charge transfer, electron localization function, site- and angular-momentum projected density of states, crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis, Born effective charges, and Mulliken population analyses. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

For practical applications, operating FCs at temperatures above 100 °C is desired, both for hydrogen and methanol fuelled cells. When hydrogen is used as fuel, an increase of the cell temperature produces enhanced CO tolerance, faster reaction kinetics, easier water management and reduced heat exchanger requirement. The use of methanol instead of hydrogen as a fuel for vehicles has several practical benefits such as easy transport and storage, but the slow oxidation kinetics of methanol needs operating direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) at intermediate temperatures. For this reason, new membranes are required. Our strategy to achieve the goal of operating at temperatures above 120 °C is to develop organic/inorganic hybrid membranes. The first approach was the use of nanocomposite class I hybrids where nanocrystalline ceramic oxides were added to Nafion. Nanocomposite membranes showed enhanced characteristics, hence allowing their operation up to 130 °C when the cell was fuelled with hydrogen and up to 145 °C in DMFCs, reaching power densities of 350 mW cm-2. The second approach was to prepare Class II hybrids via the formation of covalent bonds between totally aromatic polymers and inorganic clusters. The properties of such covalent hybrids can be modulated by modifying the ratio between organic and inorganic groups and the nature of the chemical components allowing to reach high and stable conductivity values up to 6.4 × 10-2 S cm-1 at 120 °C. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The concentration of methanol in the fuel circulation loop of a DMFC system is an important operating parameter, because it determines the electrical performance and efficiency of the system. The methanol concentration in the circulating fuel stream is usually measured continuously with a suitable sensor for the purpose of maintaining optimal power and efficiency in the DMFC system. Various methods of sensing methanol concentration have been proposed over the past decade. This paper reviews these methanol concentration sensors for DMFCs, which are generally classified into two groups: electrochemical and physical. The construction and operating principles of each sensor, as well as its advantages and disadvantages, are described. The sensorless methods for controlling the methanol concentration are introduced briefly. Finally, the perspective on the future of methanol concentration sensors is discussed.

In this study, four crucial parameters of sample conservation were studied: temperature (T), percentage of air chamber in container (%CA), ethanol concentration in blood and post-mortem time. Blood samples from post-mortem cases were stored under different conditions (ethanol levels were known in all cases); factorial design variables: (%CA) 0, 5, 20, 35, 65%; storage temperature: 25, 4 and -10 °C; in a total of 15 experiments. No preserving agent was used in samples. Quantification of ethanol in blood was carried out by gas chromatography with head-space FID detector. Initial ethanol concentration ranged from 0.50 to 4.30 g/L. The kinetics of degradation observed was pseudo-first-order. The parameter that characterised the kinetics of ethanol degradation (k0) ranged from (4 × 10-4 and 5.0 × 10-1 day-1), depending on storage conditions. A strong dependence between ethanol degradation and the content of the air chamber was observed and this dependence was found to be stronger than that between degradation and temperature; there was an experimental relation between (k0) and (%CA). Activation energy for different conditions, i.e. 0, 5, 20, 35 and 65 (%CA), were calculated and contour plots were made. A mathematical equation relating air chamber, temperature and ethanol concentration at a certain time was determined. This equation allowed estimation of initial concentrations of ethanol with minimal error. A good correlation between experimental data and data calculated with the equation was obtained (r2 = 0.9998). The best storage conditions were: 0% CA and storage at -10 °C, obtaining an ethanol degradation of 0.01% after 15 days. However, 33% of ethanol degradation was obtained with 35% CA at 25 °C after 15 days. This equation is useful in forensic cases in which original concentration of ethanol has to be estimated under different sample storage conditions. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The field observations reveal new insights into swash-aquifer coupling not previously gleaned from measurements of pore pressure only. In particular, for the case where the exit point is seaward of the observation point, the pore pressure response is correlated with the distance between the exit point and the shoreline in that when the distance is large the rate of pressure drop is fast and when the distance is small the rate decreases. The observations expose limitations in a simple model describing exit point dynamics which is based only on the force balance on a particle of water at the sand surface and neglects subsurface pressures. A new modified form of the model is shown to significantly improve the model-data comparison through a parameterization of the effects of capillarity into the aquifer storage coefficient. The model enables sufficiently accurate predictions of the exit point to determine when the swash uprush propagates over a saturated or a partially saturated sand surface, potentially an important factor in the morphological evolution of the beach face. Observations of the shoreward propagation of the swash-induced pore pressure waves ahead of the runup limit shows that the magnitude of the pressure fluctuation decays exponentially and that there is a linear increase in time lags, behavior similar to that of tidally induced water table waves. The location of the exit point and the intermittency of wave runup events is also shown to be significant in terms of the shore-normal energy distribution. Seaward of the mean exit point location, peak energies are small because of the saturated sand surface within the seepage face acting as a ""rigid lid"" and limiting pressure fluctuations. Landward of the mean exit point the peak energies grow before decreasing landward of the maximum shoreline position.

A key issue in these materials is to unravel the factors governing electron and ion transport within the lattice. Lithium extraction from LiFePO4 results in a two-phase mixture with FePO4 that limits the power characteristics owing to the low mobility of the phase boundary. This boundary is a consequence of low solubility of the parent phases, and its mobility is impeded by slow migration of the charge carriers. In principle, these limitations could be diminished in a solid solution, LixFePO 4. Here, we show that electron delocalization in the solid solution phases formed at elevated temperature is due to rapid small polaron hopping and is unrelated to consideration of the band gap. We give the first experimental evidence for a strong correlation between electron and lithium delocalization events that suggests they are coupled. Furthermore, the exquisite frequency sensitivity of Mössbauer measurements provides direct insight into the electron hopping rate. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Charged particles; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Lithium batteries; Mossbauer spectroscopy; Phosphates; Thermodynamic stability; Transition metals; Ion transport; Lithium-ion batteries; Transition metal phosphates; Two-phase mixture; Solid solutions; cobalt 57; lithium derivative; lithium ion; metal complex; phosphate; rhodium complex; article; electric battery; electrode; electron; energy; isomer; Mossbauer spectroscopy; oxidation; solid; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748363510

Forecasts of wind power are used for maximizing the expected profit from power exchange in a day-ahead market, also taking into account a penalty cost for unprovided hydrogen demand. During online operation, a receding horizon strategy is applied to determine the setpoints for the electrolyzer power and the fuel cell power. Results from three case studies of a combined wind-hydrogen plant are presented. In the first two cases, the plant is assumed to be operating in a power market dominated by thermal and hydropower, respectively.

In this approach the objective is to find out the optimal amounts of water releases from each hydro-plant during each interval in the interconnected system. Also to minimise and distribute uniformly the energy deficit if any, subject to a number of governing constraints such as demand- supply balance, flow balance equation, bounds on reservoir storage, bounds on water release and coupling constraints. The QPNN method is based on the solution of the ordinary differential equations obtained from the energy function of the control problem. It is noted that the equilibrium of the quadratic programming network is asymptotically stable and is in a neighbourhood of minimisation of the objective function. The network is capable to reach the nearly optimal solution provided the network parameters are judiciously selected.

We then use the method of stationary phase to derive the essential maximum frequency of g(f(x)) bounding the main portion of the energy of its spectrum. This limit is the product of the maximum frequency of g(x) and the maximum derivative of f(x). This leads to a proper sampling of the composition h of the two functions g and f.

A control law of the flywheels is also proposed to accomplish the attitude control and energy storage simultaneously. Aiming at the limitations existing in the power conversion characteristic and the wheel's motor, a new strategy of energy management is proposed. The strategy can not only make the charged/discharged energy reaching balance in each orbital period, but also sufficiently utilize the power provided by the solar arrays.

There are many heat damage problems with the increase of mining depth. The technology of using doublet wells, together with Heat Exchange Machine Systems (HEMSs), to store cold energy is a key to solve the heat damage problems in deep mines. Based on the geological conditions, thermodynamic and hydraulic parameters of Jiahe Mine, the isotherms in the period of cold energy storage and refrigeration and the volumes of cold water within different temperature ranges of the cold energy storage well were numerically analyzed. The results show that 1) with the same pumped and injected water volumes, the lower the temperature of injected water is, the larger the volume of cold water in the cold energy storage well is. With the larger volume, the effect of cold energy storage is better. 2) the larger the volumes of pumped and reinjected water are, the larger the volume of cold water from the cold energy storage well is. With the larger volume, the effect of refrigeration is better. And 3) without disturbance, the volume and temperature of cold water in the cold energy storage well can keep unchanged or have only a little change for a long time. Therefore the technology of doublet wells for cold energy storage is feasible and the cold energy storage aquifers can meet the requirement of the technology.","Aquifer; Cold energy storage; Deep mine; Heat damage treatment; Numerical simulation","Aquifers; Cold storage; Computer simulation; Energy storage; Heat treatment; Hydraulics; Mining; Numerical analysis; Thermodynamics; Cold energy storage; Deep mining; Heat damage treatment; Heat Exchange Machine Systems (HEMSs); Numerical simulation; Coal mines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751395755

It is very useful in several applications when used with micro computed tomography (microCT). The objective of this study is to evaluate the quantitative capability of iterative and analytic reconstruction with and without energy-based beam hardening calibration using a home-made microCT. Due to the fact that the source of X-rays in the microCT is poly-energetic and the linear attenuation coefficient varies with the energy of the X-ray photons, a specific correction is presented in this study that resolves the poly-energetic effect. Then, a 3D distribution of the linear attenuation coefficient is reconstructed from the ordered subsets using the maximum likelihood and T-FDK algorithms. These algorithms were both developed for cone-beam microCT. The images reconstructed by the two algorithms with/without correction are presented. A region of interest analysis is used to evaluate the results from two algorithms and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.

The natural target for CCS has been the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil energy sources. However, CCS has also been suggested in combination with biomass during recent years. Given that the impact on the earth's radiative balance is the same whether CO2 emissions of a fossil or a biomass origin are captured and stored away from the atmosphere, we argue that an equal reward should be given for the CCS, independent of the origin of the CO2. The guidelines that provide assistance for the national greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting under the Kyoto Protocol have not considered CCS from biomass (biotic CCS) and it appears that it is not possible to receive emission credits for biotic CCS under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, i.e., 2008-2012. We argue that it would be unwise to exclude this GHG mitigation alternative from the competition with other GHG mitigation options. We also propose a feasible approach as to how emission credits for biotic CCS could be included within a future accounting framework. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Biomass; Carbon accounting; Carbon capture and storage; CCS; GHG accounting","biomass allocation; carbon dioxide; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; greenhouse gas; mitigation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750368926

The concentration of NabH4 should be as high as possible in order to improve energy density. On the other hand, NaBO2 is produced after the hydrolysis of NaBH4. When the NaBH4 concentration is high enough, NaBO2 will precipitate from the solution, which would block the active sites of the catalysts and bring about the complexity of solution transportation. This paper addressed the issue through thermodynamic modeling. A mathematical model was derived first using the equality of chemical potential of the solute in solution and in its solid state. The parameters in the model were determined using phase-diagram analysis and hydration analysis of the NaBH4-NaOH-H2O and NaBO2-NaOH-H2O systems.

It was found that the temperature of the second-order phase transition of Wyodak coal decreases with an increase in CO2 pressure significantly, indicating that high-pressure CO2 diffuses through the coal matrix, causes significant plasticization effects, and changes the macromolecular structure of the Wyodak coal. Desorption characteristics of CO2 from the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal were studied by temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry. It was found that CO2 desorption from the coal is an activated process and follows a first-order kinetic model. The activation energy for CO2 desorption from the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal increased with the preadsorbed CO2 pressure, indicating that CO2 binds more strongly and demands more energy to desorb from the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal at higher pressures. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Coal structure; Irreversible sorption energy; Plasticization effects; Temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry; Activation energy; Carbon dioxide; Differential scanning calorimetry; Diffusion; Fluid structure interaction; Macromolecules; Mass spectrometry; Phase transitions; Coal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749584668

A treatment process for the sludge waste, which was generated during the operation of the plant and stored in lagoons, was proposed based on the results of an analysis of the sludge characteristics and the thermal decomposition properties. The thermal decomposition rate was observed by a load cell at a given heating rate. The solid waste's stabilization properties were analyzed by TG/DTA and XRD. The nitrate salts in the sludge were decomposed in two steps; the first decomposition occurred at ca. 300 °C and the second at over 600 °C. The low-temperature decomposition was due to ammonium nitrate at 300 °C; the high-temperature decomposition was due to those of sodium and calcium nitrate and calcium carbonate at 900 °C. Alumina should be added for stabilization of the sodium oxide, which arose from decomposition of the sodium nitrate and reacted readily with water. The residual solid waste consisted mainly of Na 2O · 2UO3, calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, and Na2O · Al2O3; these materials are stable compounds for storage. As a result, the volume of the sludge waste could be decreased by over 75 % when using this sludge treatment process.","Nitrate; Sludge; Stabilization; Thermal decomposition; Uranium conversion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749487855

Essentially, the Li buckyballs absorb the hydrogen, which means that one lithium atom can store five hydrogen molecules.

The titanium atoms had a tendency to react with each other and form clusters on the surface of the buckyball, which rendered them ineffective for storing hydrogen in large quantities.

The aim of the present study was to investigate morphological and physiological changes in prairie grass during regrowth to establish a basis for optimum defoliation management of prairie grass pastures. Greenhouse treatments consisted of one preliminary harvest followed by six sequential harvests at each leaf regrowth stage front one to six fully expanded leaves per tiller. Leaf tissue, stubble tissue below 50 mm and roots were collected at each harvest event. Root and stubble samples were analyzed for water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC). Leaf samples were analyzed for P, K, Na, Mg, Ca, and N concentrations and metabolizable energy (ME) was predicted by near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS). This study confirmed that the tiller base in prairie grass is the primary storage organ for WSC and that leaf growth has the highest priority for available energy following defoliation, followed by root growth and tiller initiation. A defoliation interval based on the 4-leaf stage of regrowth enabled adequate time for prairie grass to replenish WSC reserves, resume root growth and initiate new tillers, before the onset of significant leaf senescence and consequent reduction in feed quality. At the 4-leaf stage, feed quality was relatively high (ME &gt; 11.80 MJ kg -1 DM), with concentrations of P, K and Na adequate to meet the needs of a high-producing dairy cow. Concentrations of Ca and Mg were insufficient to meet these requirements throughout the regrowth cycle. © American Society of Agronomy.",,"Concentration (process); Greenhouse effect; Infrared spectrometers; Physiology; Tissue; Vegetation; Grass; Grazing; Grazing management; Optimal grazing; Plants (botany); Bos taurus; Bromus; Bromus catharticus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749183398

In such applications, program memory forms a significant part of the chip area. Hence reducing code size reduces the system cost significantly. A significant part of the total power is consumed in fetching instructions from the program memory. Hence reducing instruction fetch power has been a key target for reducing power consumption. To reduce the cost and power consumption, embedded systems in these applications use application specific processors that are fine tuned to provide better solutions in terms of code density, and power consumption. Further fine tuning to suit each particular application in the targeted class can be achieved through reconfigurable architectures. In this paper, we propose a reconfiguration mechanism, called Instruction Re-map Table, to re-map the instructions to shorter length code words. Using this mechanism, frequently used set of instructions can be compressed. This reduces code size and hence the cost. Secondly, we use the same mechanism to target power reduction by encoding frequently used instruction sequences to Gray codes. Such encodings, along with instruction compression, reduce the instruction fetch power. We enhance Texas Instruments DSP core TMS320C27x to incorporate this mechanism and evaluate the improvements on code size and instruction fetch energy using real life embedded control application programs as benchmarks. Our scheme reduces the code size by over 10% and the energy consumed by over 40%. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Code compression; Embedded DSP systems; Energy reduction; Re-configurable architecture","Codes (symbols); Costs; Data compression; Data storage equipment; Digital signal processing; Energy utilization; Code compression; Embedded DSP systems; Energy reduction; Re-configurable architecture; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748709016

This approach is based on Förster type energy transfer from a photochemically active donor to a highly fluorescent acceptor. For this purpose, a cholesteric mixture containing two fluorescent dopants based on anthracene (Dianthr) and stilbene (DCM) was prepared and studied. The absorbance peak of DCM molecules overlaps the emission peak of Dianthr . The possibility of using energy transfer in cholesteric mixtures containing a photoactive energy donor capable of photobleaching is demonstrated. It is shown that UV irradiation of planarly oriented films of the mixture leads to photodimerization of the Dianthr dopant. This photoreaction results in a significant decrease in the emission intensity of the DCM dopant. In all cases the emitted light is strongly circularly polarized, and the degree of polarization does not change during photoreaction. Such types of photo-patternable glass-forming cholesteric materials combining fluorescent properties, the possibility of energy transfer between two fluorescent dyes and a photoactivity of one fluorescent component, provide new opportunities for optical data recording and storage. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748675533

The Silage maize Ripeness Index (the ratio of dry matter content of maize grains to dry matter content of stover) is more suitable for the determination of harvest date, yield maximum and silage maize quality as the dry matter content of the plant. The analysis is cheaper as well as less material and time-consuming in comparison to the dry matter content of the silage maize of different hybrid maize populations and environments. Ensilage optimum and yield maximum almost correspond to the physiological ripeness of silage maize and are close to the grain dry matter content of 60-65%, to the dry matter content of stover under 24% and a ripeness index from 2.5 and higher. Recently, the silage maize harvest depends on dry matter content of maize plants. This can result in grain ripening rates less than 55 % and low starch as well as energy contents. The dry matter content of the silage maize is at a certain ripeness of grain and/or of starch only expression of aging of the stover. The stover has, together with the grain, a strong influence on the dry matter content of the whole plant maize. On these locations the crop should be harvested before reaching the optimum of ripeness and yield maximum. Therefore only hybrids with a long harvesting time, high starch storage and displaying a high digestibility of plant cell wall with slow drying of the stover, should be grown in the future. The Silage maize Ripeness Index (SRI) is, for whole plant maize, better than the Whole Plant Maize Ripeness Index (SRZ) for the choice of a hybrid in Germany. The dry matter content of grain in interaction with the dry matter of stover are better than dry matter content of the whole plant maize as ripeness indicator in the production of maize.

Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) properties of the blends were evaluated by using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. In the form-stable blends, PEG acted like phase change-LHTES material when the acrylic polymers served as supporting material because of their adhesion property. The maximum percentage of PEG was found 80% w/w for any of the blend in which no leakage of PEG occurred for 100 heating/cooling cycles. The optical microscopy investigations revealed that the phase behavior of the blends was observed as self organized PEG distributed in the matrix of acrylic polymers rather than chain-like structures. The interactions between the blend components (PEG and one of the acrylic polymers) were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and the viscosimetry technique. The key LHTES properties (melting and freezing temperatures, and latent heats of melting and freezing of the blends) were evaluated by DSC. The DSC results indicated that PEG/PMMA, PEG/Eud S, and PEG/Eud E blends as form-stable PCMs were convenient materials for LHTES applications in terms of their satisfying thermal properties.

The vehicle should be able to climb to an altitude of 17-20 km by taking advantage of direct sun radiation and maintaining a level flight; during the night, a fuel cells energy storage system would be used. A computer program has been developed to carry out a parametric study for the platform design. The solar radiation change over one year, altitude, masses and efficiencies of the solar and fuel cells, as well as the aerodynamic performances have all been taken into account. The parametric studies have shown how the efficiency of the fuel and solar cells and mass have the most influence on the platform dimensions. High modulus CFRP has been used in designing the structure in order to minimize the airframe weight. A Blended Wing Body (BWB) configuration of Solar HALE Aircraft Multi Payload & Operation (SHAMPO) with 8 brushless electric motors has been developed, as a result of the parametric study. The BWB solution, compared with conventional designs, seems to provide the best compromise between performance, availability of surfaces for solar-cells, and volume for multi-payload purposes. Several profiles and wing plans have been analyzed using the CFD software Xfoil and Vsaero. The airfoil coordinates at the root and along the wing span as well as the wing planform were optimised to achieve the best efficiency.

By employing an initial value method in combination with the application of a perfect matched layer, the numerical effort and storage size are dramatically reduced due to a significant reduction in both computed domain and number of base functions. In the absence of an electric field, the higher magnetoexcitonic peaks show distinct Fano lineshape due to the degeneracy with continuum states of the lower Landau levels. The magnetoexcitons that belong to the zeroth Landau level remain in bound states and lead to Lorentzian lineshape, because they are not degenerated with continuum states. In the presence of an electric field, the FK effect on each magnetoexcitonic resonance can be identified for high magnetic fields. However, for low magnetic fields, the FK oscillations dominate the spectrum structure in the vicinity of the bandgap edge and the magnetoexcitonic resonances dominate the spectrum structure of higher energies. In the moderate electric fields, the interplay of FK effect and magnetoexcitonic resonance leads to a complex and rich structure in the absorption spectrum. © 2006 Chin. Phys.

The existence of a global minimum makes the algorithm invariant to the initialization of the level set function, whereas the existence of a convergence state makes it possible to set a termination criterion on the algorithm. Furthermore, since the level set function converges to one of the two fixed values which are determined by the amount of the shifting of the Heaviside functions, an initialization of the level set function close to those values can result in a fast convergence. © 2006 IEEE.","Active contour; Image segmentation; Level set; Mumford-shah model; Nonlinear partial differential equation","Algorithms; Convergence of numerical methods; Mathematical models; Nonlinear equations; Partial differential equations; Set theory; Active contour; Bimodal segmentation; Level set function; Mumford-shah model; Nonlinear partial differential equation; Image segmentation; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; nonlinear system; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Nonlinear Dynamics; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747715776

Traditionally, the method for solving such physics-based problems is to discretize and solve a PDE by a purely mathematical process. Instead of using the PDE, we propose to use the global heat principle and to decompose it into basic laws. We show that some of these laws admit an exact global version since they arise from conservative principles. We also show that the assumptions made about the other basic laws can be made wisely, taking into account knowledge about the problem and the domain. The numerical scheme is derived in a straightforward way from the modeled problem, thus providing a physical explanation for each step in the solution. The advantage of such an approach is that it minimizes the approximations made during the whole process and it modularizes it, allowing changing the application to a great number of problems. We apply the scheme to two applications: image denoising and inpainting which are modeled with heat transfer. For denoising, we propose a new approximation for the conductivity coefficient and we add thin lines to the features in order to block diffusion. © 2006 IEEE.","Denoising; Heat transfer process; Image processing; Inpainting; Line edges; Nonlinear and anisotropic diffusion of colors","Approximation theory; Computer vision; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Optimization; Partial differential equations; Image denoising; Inpainting; Line edges; Image processing; algorithm; article; artifact; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; energy transfer; heat; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; painting; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; statistics; Algorithms; Artifacts; Computer Simulation; Energy Transfer; Heat; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Statistical; Paintings; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stochastic Processes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747637156

In this work, the impacts of external convection resistance on thermodynamic behaviour inside the metal hydride tank are examined. A one-dimensional resistive analysis and two-dimensional transient model are used to determine the impact of external fins on the ability of a metal hydride tank to deliver hydrogen at a specified flow rate. For the particular metal hydride alloy (LaNi5) and tank geometry studied, it was found that the fins have a large impact on the pressure of the hydrogen gas within the tank when a periodic hydrogen demand is imposed. Model results suggest that the metal hydride alloy at the centre of the tank can be removed to reduce weight and cost, without detrimental effects to the performance of the system. © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","External; Fins; Heat transfer; Hydrogen storage; LaNi5; Metal hydrides","Fins (heat exchange); Fuel tanks; Hydrogen; Lanthanum compounds; Mathematical models; Thermodynamic properties; Hydride alloys; Hydrogen storage; LaNi5; Metal hydrides; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747298235

The molar compositions Ag / AB5 ≥ 10 and Ni / AB5 ≥ 25 could meet this requirement. After sintering, the alloy in the pellet Ag / AB5 = 10 maintains the original phases, but a second phase appears in the pellet Ni / AB5 = 25. The volume expansions of these two pellets after hydrogenation are 5-8%. The number and size of microholes in the pellet Ni / AB5 = 25 are larger than those in the pellet Ag / AB5 = 10, presumably due to different shapes of Ni powder and Ag flakes. The difference in the shape of the metallic binders also affects the discharge capacity.

Methods: We examined the effects of HCA (1.8% of diet) on food intake, body weight gain, visceral fat accumulation, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperinsulinemia in rats during a 4-wk period of ad libitum access to a 50% fructose diet after a 3-wk period of food restriction in which they lost about 20% of their body weight. Results: HCA decreased food intake and weight gain throughout the test and reduced visceral fat accumulation compared with control rats fed ad libitum (CON). Rats that were pair-fed (PF) to the HCA rats showed similar decreases in weight gain and visceral fat. HCA did not ameliorate the hypertriglyceridemia induced by high-fructose feeding. HCA improved insulin sensitivity on day 10 in comparison with CON rats, but by day 27 insulin levels were similarly higher and liver glycogen levels were similarly lower in HCA and CON rats in comparison with PF rats. Liver lipid content was elevated in HCA rats compared with CON and PF rats. Conclusion: These findings indicate that, although HCA attenuates body weight gain and visceral fat accumulation by reducing food intake under these conditions, it has no lasting beneficial effects on hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia and leads to the accumulation of liver lipids. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Due to the relation between atmospheric temperature and natural gas demand, the variation in the gas demand is very large. Consequently, in case of a more or less constant mole fraction of hydrogen in natural gas the demand for hydrogen will also vary considerably. Injection of ten percent hydrogen into the natural gas (in The Netherlands) requires already the production of about two billion cubic meters of hydrogen per year. Considering the variation in demand, most probably large-scale storage of hydrogen is needed because the flexibility in production is limited for economic and technical reasons. On the other hand, storage of hydrogen will also increase the costs. In this paper, we report on the balance between hydrogen production, demand and storage. A number of variables for controlling the production will be taken into consideration. Also the possibility of production without a buffer will be discussed. © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Demand; Hydrogen; Production model; Storage","Costs; Gas fuel storage; Natural gas; Production control; Atmospheric temperature; Hydrogen injection; Large-scale storage; Natural gas grid; Hydrogen fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747181294

We investigated the effects of dietary genistein at different levels on hepatic lipid levels and mitochondrial functions in mice fed high-fat diets. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups and fed a high-fat diet containing genistein at levels of 0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.4% (HF, HF + 0.1G, HF + 0.2G, and HF + 0.4G) for 12 wk. We measured lipid levels in the blood and liver. We also observed messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of genes encoding proteins related to lipid and energy metabolism and antioxidant defense system and mitochondrial enzyme activities in the liver. Results: The induction of fatty liver by HF was substantially decreased in the HF + 0.2G and HF + 0.4G groups. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ coactivator mRNA was increased by HF + 0.4G. Although genistein did not affect peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA expression, it increased medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner and HF + 0.2G increased uncoupling protein-2 mRNA expression two-fold relative to HF mice. Genistein decreased malondialdehyde levels and increased glutathione levels in liver homogenates, regardless of dose. The HF + 0.1G diet increased mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase activity and mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity. Conclusions: Although genistein at higher levels decreased hepatic fat accumulation possibly by increasing fatty acid oxidation and uncoupling protein, low-dose genistein increased mitochondrial enzyme activities in mice with fatty liver and obesity induced by high-fat diets. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We also examined the distribution of ghrelin-producing cells in the stomachs of bullfrogs using this antibody and a cRNA probe specific for the bullfrog ghrelin gene. Ghrelin levels in plasma and stomach extracts were approximately 150 fmol/ml and 83-135 fmol/mg wet tissue, respectively. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatographic analysis, combined with bullfrog ghrelin RIA, revealed that ghrelin immunoreactivity in the stomach was composed of non-acylated ghrelin (des-acyl ghrelin) and several acylated forms of ghrelin bearing different fatty acid modifications, which could induce increases in intracellular Ca2+ in cells expressing the rat GH secretagogue receptor. In the stomach, the major storage form was acylated ghrelin. In bullfrog plasma, however, the majority of ghrelin immunoreactivity was des-acyl ghrelin and C-terminal fragments of frog ghrelin. Acylated ghrelin forms comprised only minor peaks. Ghrelin-immunopositive and ghrelin mRNA-expressing cells were observed within the mucosal layer of the stomach. Following starvation, significant increases in plasma ghrelin levels and stomach ghrelin mRNA levels were observed as early as 10 days after starvation. These results indicate that ghrelin is present in the stomach and plasma of the bullfrog, which can be detected with our novel antibody. Interestingly, the primary storage form of ghrelin in the stomach differed from the circulating form dominating in the plasma. Furthermore, increases in ghrelin levels in plasma and mRNA levels in the stomach after starvation suggest the possible involvement of ghrelin in energy homeostasis in the bullfrog. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The damping peaks were found to be dependent on the nature of chemical treatment. Both storage modulus and damping values measured experimentally are consistent and point to the effectiveness of silane A174 coupling agent (γ-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane) for improving fibre-matrix adhesion.

They are cheaper than flat plate thermosiphonic units, but their higher thermal losses make them suitable mainly for application in locations with favourable weather conditions. Aiming to the achievement of low system height and satisfactory water temperature stratification, new types of ICS systems with two horizontal cylindrical storage tanks, properly mounted in stationary CPC reflector troughs are suggested. The non-uniform distribution of solar radiation on the two absorbing surfaces is combined with the seasonal sun elevation, resulting to effective water heating. In addition, the inverted absorber concept design can be applied to ICS systems with two storage tanks. In this paper, we present the design and performance of double tank ICS solar systems, which are based on the combination of symmetric and asymmetric CPC reflectors with water storage tanks. The analytical equations of the collector geometry of all models are calculated with respect to the radius of the cylindrical water storage tank and the reflector rim angles. Experimental results for the variation of the water temperature inside storage tanks, the mean daily efficiency and the coefficient of thermal losses during night are given for all experimental models. The tests were performed without water draining and the results show that the double tank ICS systems are efficient in water temperature rise during day and satisfactory preservation of the hot water temperature during night, with the upper storage tank being more effective in performance in most of the studied models. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Heat storage based on the sensible heating of media such as water, rock, and earth represents the first generation of solar energy storage subsystems and technology for their utilization is well developed. However, recently the heat storage based on the latent heat associated with a change in phase of a material offers many advantages over sensible heat storage. The most important characteristic of such a subsystem is its sufficient storage capacity. The PCM (phase change material) behavior is visualized by constructing an idealized model thermal capacitor subjected to simulated solar system environmental conditions which include thermal cycling utilizing the latent heat of paraffin for heating and cooling. The proposed model of the capacitor is of a flat plate geometry consisting of two panel compartments forming the body of the capacitor containing the paraffin, leaving at their inner surfaces a thin passage allowing the water flow. The whole structure is assumed to be insulated to minimize heat loss. Analysis solution is used to generate data about the temperature distribution, the melt thickness, and the heat stored in the PCM under two conditions of: (a) constant mass flow rate tests for various water inlet temperatures, and (b) constant water inlet temperature for various mass flow rates. A FORTRAN computer program is constructed to perform the analysis. It is found that water outlet temperature increases with time until it becomes nearly equal to the inlet temperature. Increasing the mass flow rate for a given inlet temperature, decreases the time required for outlet temperature to reach a given value. Increasing inlet temperature for a given mass flow rate gives a very rapid decrease in the time required for the outlet water temperature to reach a given value. Instantaneous rate of heat storage is determined from the inlet-to-exit temperature differential and measured flow rate. This rate is then integrated numerically to determine the cumulative total energy stored as a function of time. It is found that the instantaneous rate of heat storage decreases till reaching a nearly constant value. The total or cumulative heat storage as a function of time, showed a nearly linear trend in the mid-range time, and it increased with increasing inlet temperature.","Latent heat; Mathematical model 1; Paraffin wax; Phase change material; Sensible heat; Thermal storage","Data acquisition; Energy storage; Flow of fluids; FORTRAN (programming language); Heat storage; Mathematical models; Solar energy; Thermal effects; Phase change material; Sensible heat; Thermal storage; Paraffin waxes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745406308

Form stable paraffin phase change materials (PCM) in which paraffin serves as a latent heat storage material and polyolefins act as a supporting material, because of paraffin leakage, are required to be improved. The form stable paraffin PCM in the present paper was encapsulated in an inorganic silica gel polymer successfully by in situ polymerization. The differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to measure its thermal properties. At the same time, the Washburn equation, which measures the wetting properties of powder materials, was used to test the hydrophilic-lipophilic properties of the PCMs. The result indicated that the enthalpy of the microencapsulated PCMs was reduced little, while their hydrophilic properties were enhanced largely. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A trapezoidal BSSWH without PCM storage unit was used as the control heater (reference) to investigate the effect of two differently configured PCM storage units on the temperature distributions in water tanks. In the first design, myristic acid was filled into the PCM storage tank, which also served as an absorbing plate. In the second design, lauric acid was filled into the PCM storage tank, which also served as a baffle plate. The water temperature changes were followed by five thermocouples placed evenly and longitudinally into each of the three BSSWHs. The effects of the PCMs on the water temperature distributions depended on the configuration of the PCM storage unit and the longitudinal position in the water tanks. The use of lauric acid lowered the values of the peak temperatures by 15% compared to the control heater at the upper portion of the water tanks because of the low melting temperature of lauric acid, but it did not have any consistent effect on the retention of the water temperatures during the cooling period. The ability of the myristic acid storage unit to retain the water temperatures got more remarkable, especially at the middle portion of the water tank. The myristic acid storage increased the dip temperatures by approximately 8.8% compared to the control heater. In conclusion, lauric acid storage can be used to stabilize the water temperature during the day time, while the myristic acid storage unit can be used as a thermal barrier against heat loss during the night time because of its relatively high melting temperature and low heat conduction coefficient in its solid phase. The experimental results have also indicated that the thermal characteristics of the PCM and the configuration of the PCM storage unit can result in advantageous control of the water temperature rise and drop during both day and night time. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in wireless mobile devices, like palmtops and personal digital assistants (PDAs), storage memory is limited or absent due to weight, size, and power constraints, so that swapping over remote memory devices can be considered as a viable alternative. However, power-hungry wireless network interface cards (WNICs) may limit the battery lifetime and application performance if not efficiently exploited. In this paper, we study performance and energy of network swapping in comparison with swapping on local microdrives and flash memories. We report the results of extensive experiments conducted on different WNICs and local swapping devices, using both synthetic and natural benchmarks. Our study points out that remote swapping over power-manageable WNICs can be more efficient than local swapping, especially in bursty workload conditions. Such conditions can be forced where possible by reshaping swapping requests to increase energy efficiency and performance. © 2006 IEEE.","Network virtual memory; Power management; Wireless LAN","Local swapping devices; Network virtual memory; Power management; Wireless LAN; Computer graphics; Flash memory; Laptop computers; Personal digital assistants; Telecommunication networks; Wireless telecommunication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645655513

Distributed energy production has got an increasingly important role in the energy market. In this paper, a model for structural and operational optimisation of DES is presented. In the model, production and consumption of electrical power and heat, power transmissions, transport of fuels to the production plants, transport of water in the district heating pipelines and storage of heat are taken into account. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem where the objective is to minimise the overall cost of DES, i.e., the sum of the running costs for the included operations and the annualised investment costs of the included equipment. An illustrative example is presented for a complex DES situation. The solution gives the DES structure, i.e., which production units, heat transport lines and storages should be built as well as their locations be, together with design parameters for plants and pipelines. The model enables the involved parties-suppliers, consumers, designers and authorities-to form a joint view of different situations as a basis for the decision making. A tool based on the model is built, which can be used in design, in creating guidelines for regional energy policies and for versatile what-if analyses. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The left femurs were elongated in uniaxial tension up to breakdown in order to calculate biomechanical parameters. The densitometric and microarchitectural properties of right femurs were evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and microcomputed tomography, respectively. Results showed no significant difference in the parameters investigated between deep-freezing, alcohol storage and fresh femurs when comparing each parameter separately.

This is largely motivated by the advances in the use of supercritical adsorption in high energy applications, such as hydrogen and methane storage in porous media. Experimental data are reported as mass excess versus pressure, and when these data are matched against the theoretical mass excess, significant errors could occur if the void volume used in the calculation of the experimental mass excess is incorrectly determined [Malbrunot, P.; Vidal, D.; Vermesse, J.; Chahine, R.; Bose, T. K. Langmuir 1997, 13, 539].1 The incorrect value for the void volume leads to a wrong description of the maximum in the plot of mass excess versus pressure as well as the part of the isotherm over the pressure region where the isotherm is decreasing. Because of this uncertainty in the maximum and the decreasing part of the isotherm, we propose a new method in which the problems associated with this are completely avoided. Our method involves only the relationship between the amount that is introduced into the adsorption cell and the equilibrium pressure. This information of ""direct"" experimental data has two distinct advantages. The first is that the data is the ""raw"" data without any manipulation (i.e., involving further calculations), and the second one is that this relationship always monotonically increases with pressure. We will illustrate this new method with the adsorption data of methane in a commercial sample of activated carbon. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Activated carbon; Adsorption; Isotherms; Methane; Microporosity; Size determination; Energy applications; Methane adsorption; Supercritical adsorption; Void volume; Supercritical fluids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748526833

The lead-acid battery is the more commonly used storage technology for PV systems due to its low cost and its wide availability. However, analysis shows that it is the weakest component of PV power systems. Because the batteries can be over discharged, or operated under partial state of charge (PSOC), their service life in PV systems is shorter than could be expected. The working conditions of batteries in remote area installations are worse than those in situations where technical support is readily available. Capacity-loss in lead-acid batteries operated in remote locations often occurs through sulfation of electrodes and stratification of electrolyte. In northwest China, Shandong Sacred Sun Power Sources Industry Co. Ltd. type GFMU valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries are being used in PV power stations. These batteries have an advanced grid structure, superior leady paste, and are manufactured using improved plate formation methods. Their characteristics, and their performance in PV systems, are discussed in this paper. The testing results of GFMU VRLA batteries in the laboratory have shown that the batteries could satisfy the demands of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards for PV systems. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

These new systems require higher power levels closer to the user but the level of availability and reliability cannot be compromised if the network is to provide service in the event of a failure of the public utility. Many parts of these new networks are ac rather than dc powered with UPS systems for back-up power. These generally have lower levels of reliability than dc systems and the network needs to be designed such that overall reliability is not reduced through appropriate levels of redundancy. Mobile networks have different power requirements. Where there is a high density of nodes, continuity of service can be reasonably assured with short autonomy times. Furthermore, there is generally no requirement that these networks are the provider of last resort and therefore, specifications for continuity of power are directed towards revenue protection and overall reliability targets. As a result of these changes, battery requirements for reserve power are evolving. Shorter autonomy times are specified for parts of the network although a large part will continue to need support for hours rather minutes. Operational temperatures are increasing and battery solutions that provide longer life in extreme conditions are becoming important. Different battery technologies will be discussed in the context of these requirements. Conventional large flooded lead/acid cells both with pasted and tubular plates are used in larger central office applications but the majority of requirements are met with valve-regulated lead/acid (VRLA) batteries. The different types of VRLA battery will be described and their suitability for various applications outlined. New developments in battery construction and battery materials have improved both performance and reliability in recent years. Alternative technologies are also being proposed for telecommunications power, either different battery chemistries including lithium batteries, flywheel energy storage or the use of fuel cells. These will be evaluated and the position of lead/acid batteries in the medium term for this important market will be assessed. © 2006.","Lead-acid; Standby batteries; Telecommunications power systems; Valve-regulated","Information services; Internet telephony; Network protocols; Specifications; Standby power systems; Telecommunication systems; Internet Protocol (IP); Standby batteries; Telecommunications power systems; Lead acid batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748095660

This has lead to a growing demand for hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) to reduce air pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. CSIRO Energy Technology has developed the ultra-battery, a new technology that will reduce the cost and boost the performance of batteries in HEVs. The ultra-battery is a hybrid energy-storage device, which combines an asymmetric supercapacitor, and a lead-acid battery in one unit cell, taking the best from both technologies without the need for extra electronic controls. The capacitor will enhance the power and lifespan of the lead-acid battery as it acts as a buffer in discharging and charging. Consequently, this hybrid technology is able to provide and absorb charge rapidly during vehicle acceleration and braking. The ultra-battery has been subjected to a variety of tests. To date, results show that the discharge and charge power of the ultra-battery is ∼50% higher and its cycle-life is at least three times longer than that of the conventional lead-acid counterpart. Furthermore, the ultra-battery is able to be produced as either flooded-electrolyte or valve-regulated designs in the existing lead-acid factory and also able to reconfigure for a variety of applications, such as conventional automobile, power tool, forklift, high-power uninterruptible power supply and remote-area power supply. The prototype ultra-batteries have been constructed and are under laboratory evaluation and field trial. The success of the ultra-battery will obviously make HEVs more affordable and widespread. This, in turn, will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the urban environment and the consumption of limited supplies of fossil fuels. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Different patterns of astaxanthin vertical distribution would be expected from the benefits of photoprotection, the costs of visual predation and the availability of food. Despite a highly resolved sampling approach (4 m depth intervals), no clear pattern of vertical distribution or correlation with chlorophyll a concentrations was found for Calanus helgolandicus astaxanthin concentrations in the German Bight. This may be attributable to photochromatic adaptation in phytoplankton, diurnal rhythms of copepod grazing and, particularly, vertical migration. A 2 x 2 factorial (light x food) experiment showed that total astaxanthin concentrations in C. helgolandicus were entirely determined by the dynamics of esterified astaxanthin. As expected, the concentrations of astaxanthin esters decreased in starved individuals in the dark, while the combined presence of food and light resulted in an increase of esterified astaxanthin. Similar levels of esterified astaxanthin were maintained in both starving individuals exposed to light and feeding individuals in the dark. The latter implies that astaxanthin esterification is per se a process independent of light, although light exposure enhances it. It is proposed that the function of astaxanthin esters is to generally improve the antioxidant protection of storage lipids, also in situations where photoprotection is not required. © Inter-Research 2006.","Astaxanthin; Carotenoids; Photoprotection; Pigments; Vertical migration","carotenoid; crustacean; photoprotection; pigment; vertical distribution; zooplankton; Atlantic Ocean; German Bight; North Sea; Calanoida; Calanus helgolandicus; Copepoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748977612

While studies have demonstrated that sediment conditions characteristic of inshore reefs cause stress in corals, the consequences of such conditions for the physiological status of corals require testing in field situations. Here, I compare the size of energy stores (as lipid content), a proxy for physiological condition, of 2 coral species (Turbinana mesenterina and Acropora valida) between coastal and offshore environments. Corals on coastal reefs contained 4-fold (T. mesenterina) and 2-fold (A. valida) more lipid than conspecifics offshore, despite 1 order of magnitude higher turbidity levels inshore. Results were consistent across 4 sites in each environment. Reproductive investment in A. valida (a seasonal mass spawner) did not vary between environments, suggesting that the larger lipid stores in corals on coastal reefs are mainly somatic energy reserves. These results demonstrate that the environmental conditions on inshore, high-turbidity reefs do not always impact negatively on the physiology of corals. The contrasting lipid levels of T. mesenterina between environments may explain its greater success on coastal reefs. © Inter-Research 2006.","Energy storage; Lipid; Scleractinian coral; Sedimentation; Turbidity","coastal zone; coral; coral reef; energy budget; lipid; sedimentation; turbidity; Acropora valida; Anthozoa; Scleractinia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748952453

Results showed that most REEs are associated with cell wall and proteins, and REEs concentration in the proteins, 2899.5 μg g-1, is much higher than those in the cell wall; in the chloroplast of P. simplex, REEs distribute almost equally in chloroplast membrane and thylakoid, while most REEs in the thylakoid are binding with photosystem II (PS II); a new REE-binding peptide in the lamina of P. simplex, which can accumulate REEs up to 3000 μg g-1 and has higher affinity with light REEs, was characterized, indicating that its molecular mass is 5073 Da, and may have β-sheet structure; isoelectrofocusing electrophoretic photograph indicated that it is acidic peptide with IP of 3.7.

However, characterisation, at the atomistic level, of this material is difficult experimentally; rather the materials are typified by their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Here, we use an evolutionary simulation-amorphisation and recrystallisation (A&amp;R)-to generate atomistic models for γ-MnO 2, which include microstructural detail. These models conform to the pyrolusite polymorph, with small intergrowth domains (structurally similar to brookite-TiO 2) and comprise micro-twinning together with general grain boundaries, stacking faults, dislocations and isolated point defects and defect clusters. Molecular graphics images, showing the atom positions for these microstructural features together with the (simulated) XRD patterns they give rise to, are presented and compare favourably with measured XRD providing valuable validation of the atomistic models. Surprisingly, the atomistic models also include anion sublattice domains conforming to both ccp and hcp, which are separated or facilitated by dislocations. We are not aware of this phenomenon having been reported in the literature for MnO 2 and therefore, our simulations offer the prediction of its existence. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Particular attention is paid for specific features associated with sharp step-like change of a dot magnetic moment caused by the Zeeman splitting of energy levels. For an analysis of the system we employ the randomly jumping interacting moments model including quantum fluctuations due to the discrete level structure, inter-dot coupling and disorder. At the jump anomalies the magnetic state equation is found to indicate an existence of spinodal regions and critical points. In the vicinity of such points magnetization evolves as erratic jumps associated with avalanches of the moment steps in magnetized dots. The model predicts some universal scaling properties for magnetic noise. The considered magnetodynamics is similar to the well-known Barkhausen effect but occurs at conditions far from the magnetization reversal. Such an effect might be employed, therefore, as a tool to analyze the roughness and the disorder in magnetic dot arrays, which are of great importance for advanced electronic devices, nanoscale storage media and magnetic recording technology. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The dehydration behavior of unpulverized calcium lactate pentahydrate (UCLP) and pulverized calcium lactate pentahydrate (PCLP) tablets was investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The hardness of both UCLP and PCLP tablets was significantly decreased after dehydration. The relationship between the extent of dehydration and the tablet hardness of both UCLP and PCLP tablets was linear. The results suggest that the reduction in tablet hardness is dependent on the dehydration of crystal water, and the values of the slopes indicate that the bonding energy of the UCLP was stronger than that of the PCLP. The dehydration of both UCLP and PCLP tablets at 55 °C followed a one-dimensional diffusion mechanism, whereas dehydration at storage temperatures of 60-80 °C followed a three-dimensional diffusion mechanism. UCLP and PCLP tablets contracted in thickness and diameter during dehydration, but final contraction ratios showed that PCLP tablets were more affected than UCLP tablets. In contrast, the micropore radius of both UCLP and PCLP tablets increased after dehydration. Thus, the pharmaceutical properties of calcium lactate pentahydrate (CLP) tablets are affected both by pulverization and by the extent of dehydration of the bulk powder in the tablet formulation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The body weights of IL-1RI-/- mice of both sexes started to deviate from those of wild-type mice at 5-6 months of age and were 20% higher at 9 months of age. Visceral and subcutaneous fat mass, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging, was markedly (1.5- to 2.5-fold) increased. Lean body mass and crown-rump length were also slightly (11 and 5%, respectively) increased, as was serum IGF-I. Obese IL-1RI-/- mice were insulin resistant, as evidenced by hyperinsulinemia, decreased glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity. To elucidate the mechanisms for the development of obesity, young preobese IL-1RI-/- mice were investigated. They showed decreased suppression of body weight and food intake in response to systemic leptin treatment. The decreased leptin responsiveness was even more pronounced in older obese animals. Moreover, spontaneous locomotor activity and fat utilization, as measured by respiratory quotient, were decreased in preobese IL-1RI-/- mice. In conclusion, lack of IL-1RI-mediated biological activity causes mature-onset obesity. This obese phenotype is preceded by decreased leptin sensitivity, fat utilization, and locomotor activity. © 2006 by the American Diabetes Association.","DEXA; Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; IL-1, interleukin-1; IL-1Ra, il-1 receptor antagonist; IL-1RI, IL-1 type I receptor; LBM, lean body mass; MC4-R, melanocortin-4 receptor; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; RER, respiratory exchange ratio","insulin; interleukin 1 receptor; leptin; interleukin 1 receptor; leptin; article; body weight; carbohydrate metabolism; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; food intake; genetic variability; hyperlipidemia; insulin resistance; lipid storage; locomotion; metabolic disorder; mortality; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; prevalence; priority journal; adipose tissue; aging; animal; blood; genetics; histology; mouse mutant; organ size; physiology; radiodensitometry; Adipose Tissue; Aging; Animals; Body Weight; Densitometry, X-Ray; Leptin; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Obesity; Organ Size; Receptors, Interleukin-1",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745302882

We examined whether regional differences in abdominal subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue metabolism in women exist and whether they persist across the spectrum of body fatness and abdominal adiposity values. We measured adipocyte size; lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity; and basal, isoproterenol-, forskolin-, and dibutyryl cAMP-stimulated lipolysis in adipose tissue or mature adipocytes isolated from the omental and subcutaneous fat depots in a sample of 55 healthy women undergoing elective gynecological surgery. Measures of body fat mass and body fat distribution were also obtained by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography. Subcutaneous adipocytes were significantly larger than omental adipocytes (P < 0.0001). LPL activity expressed as a function of cell number was significantly higher in subcutaneous versus omental adipose tissue (P < 0.0001). Basal, isoproterenol-stimulated, dibutyryl cAMP-stimulated (10-3 mol/l) and forskolin-stimulated (10-5 mol/l) lipolysis (expressed as a function of cell number) were all significantly higher in subcutaneous versus omental adipocytes (P < 0.05 to P < 0.0001). However, the response of omental adipocytes to lipolytic stimuli tested (fold increase over basal level) was significantly greater in magnitude compared with subcutaneous adipocytes (P < 0.01). These differences were relatively constant across total body fat mass and visceral adipose tissue area tertiles. In conclusion, compared with adipocytes from the omental fat compartment, subcutaneous adipocytes are larger, have higher LPL activity, and are more lipolytic on an absolute basis, which may reflect a higher fat storage capacity in this depot in women. In contrast, omental adipocytes display greater relative responsiveness to both adrenergic receptor-and postreceptor-acting agents compared with subcutaneous adipocytes. Overall and visceral obesity have only minor effects on regional differences in adipose tissue metabolism. © 2006 by the American Diabetes Association.","FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; LPL, lipoprotein lipase","bucladesine; forskolin; isoprenaline; lipoprotein lipase; bucladesine; forskolin; isoprenaline; lipoprotein lipase; adipocyte; adipose tissue; adult; article; body fat distribution; cell isolation; cell size; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; hyperinsulinemia; insulin resistance; lipid storage; lipolysis; major clinical study; metabolic disorder; priority journal; tissue metabolism; adipose tissue; aged; blood pressure; body fat distribution; body size; body weight; comparative study; drug effect; histology; metabolism; middle aged; omentum; organ size; skin; viscera; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Aged; Blood Pressure; Body Fat Distribution; Body Size; Body Weight; Bucladesine; Female; Forskolin; Humans; Isoproterenol; Lipoprotein Lipase; Middle Aged; Omentum; Organ Size; Skin; Viscera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745297228

Encapsulated phase change materials incorporated into gypsum wallboards of buildings may be suitable for absorbing solar energy directly, reducing temperature rise. Improvement in human comfort is to be expected due to a decrease in the frequency and magnitude of internal air temperature swings, maintaining the temperature closer to the desired set temperature passively for a long period of time. This paper summarises the results of a detailed theoretical investigation and analysis of thermal energy storage and temperature control achieved using passive building construction elements incorporating phase change materials. The predictions detail the effects of using various quantities of different PCM materials with phase change temperatures of 28 and 43 °C incorporated into a selection of wall constructions for selected ambient conditions of temperature and insolation. From this parametric study, optimum arrangements are proposed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, however, PPAR-γ has also been demonstrated to affect proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of different cell types. As we have previously shown that BAY 11-7085-induced synovial fibroblast apoptosis is prevented by PPAR-γ agonist 15d-PGJ2; the expression of PPAR-γ in these cells was studied. Both PPAR-γ1 and PPAR-γ2 isoforms were cloned from synovial fibroblast RNA, but only PPAR-γ1 was detected by Western blot, showing constitutive nuclear expression. Within minutes of BAY 11-7085 treatment, a PPAR-γ1-specific band was shifted into a form of higher mobility, suggesting dephosphorylation, as confirmed by phosphatase treatment of cell extracts. Of interest, BAY 11-7085-induced PPAR-γ1 dephosphorylation was followed by PARP and caspase-8 cleavage as well as by PPAR-γ1 protein degradation. PPAR-γ1 dephosphorylation was followed by the loss of PPAR-DNA binding activity ubiquitously present in synovial fibroblast nuclear extracts. Unlike the phosphorylated form, dephosphorylated PPAR-γ1 was found in insoluble membrane cell fraction and was not ubiquitinated before degradation. PPAR-γ1 dephosphorylation coincided with ERK1/2 phosphorylation that accompanies BAY 11-7085-induced synovial fibroblasts apoptosis. 15d-PGJ2, PGD2, and partially UO126, down-regulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, protected cells from BAY 11-7085-induced apoptosis, and reversed both PPAR-γ dephosphorylation and degradation. Furthermore, PPAR-γ antagonist BADGE induced PPAR-γ1 degradation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and synovial fibroblasts apoptosis. The results presented suggest an anti-apoptotic role for PPAR-γ1 in synovial fibroblasts. Since apoptotic marker PARP is cleaved after PPAR-γ1 dephosphorylation but before PPAR-γ1 degradation, dephosphorylation event might be enough to mediate BAY 11-7085-induced apoptosis in synovial fibroblasts. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Activation analysis; Biological membranes; Degradation; Energy storage; Enzymes; Metabolism; RNA; Dephosphorylation; Peroxisome proliferators; Phosphatase treatment; Synovial fibroblast apoptosis; Cells; 1,4 diamino 1,4 bis(2 aminophenylthio) 2,3 dicyanobutadiene; 15 deoxy delta12,14 prostaglandin J2; bay 11 7085; benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal; caspase 8; cell extract; ether derivative; hydrolase inhibitor; I kappa B; isoprotein; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor antagonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phosphatase; prostaglandin D2; prostaglandin E2; prostaglandin F2; proteasome inhibitor; RNA; unclassified drug; apoptosis; article; cell fractionation; clone; controlled study; DNA binding; down regulation; drug antagonism; drug effect; drug inhibition; enzyme activation; fibroblast; human; human cell; priority journal; protein degradation; protein dephosphorylation; protein expression; ubiquitination; Western blotting; Apoptosis; Cell Line; Cell Nucleus; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression; Humans; Nitriles; Osteoarthritis; Phosphorylation; PPAR gamma; Prostaglandin D2; Sulfones; Synovial Membrane; Transfection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747365595

In the case of hadron beams, whose charge distribution can be considered as ""frozen"" within a cylindrical core of small radius compared to the beam's dynamical aperture, analytical formulas have been recently derived [C. Benedetti, G. Turchetti, Phys. Lett. A 340 (2005) 461] for the contribution of space charges within first order Hamiltonian perturbation theory. These formulas involve distribution functions which, in general, do not lead to expressions that can be evaluated in closed form. In this Letter, we apply this theory to an example of a charge distribution, whose effect on the dynamics can be derived explicitly and in closed form, both in the case of 2-dimensional as well as 4-dimensional mapping models of hadron beams. We find that, even for very small values of the ""perveance"" (strength of the space charge effect) the long term stability of the dynamics changes considerably. In the flat beam case, the outer invariant ""tori"" surrounding the origin disappear, decreasing the size of the beam's dynamical aperture, while beyond a certain threshold the beam is almost entirely lost. Analogous results in mapping models of beams with 2-dimensional cross section demonstrate that in that case also, even for weak tune depressions, orbital diffusion is enhanced and many particles whose motion was bounded now escape to infinity, indicating that space charges can impose significant limitations on the beam's luminosity. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

WAXS and TEM pictures indicate GNC-1 (number indicates percentage (w/w) of om-clay in the nanocomposite) has an exfoliated structure, whereas GNC-3 and GNC-5 have an intercalated structure. FTIR spectra indicate an interaction between om-clay and PANI-DNNDSA shifting the Q=N+H-B or B-N+H-B (Q = quinonoid and B = benzonoid unit of PANI) vibration of quinonoid structure to lower energy.

The compatibility of fatty acids with the Eudragit S is proved by microscopic investigation and infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The melting and crystallization temperatures and the latent heats of melting and crystallization of the form-stable PCMs are measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) method. The maximum mass percentage of all fatty acids in the form-stable PCMs is found as 70%, and no leakage of fatty acid is observed at the temperature range of 50-70°C for several heating cycles.

Having outlined the technical specifications necessary to match the performance of hydrocarbon. fue1, we first outline the inherent difficulties with gas pressure and liquid hydrogen storage. We then outline the history of transition metal hydride storage, leading to the development of metal hydride batteries. A viable system, however, must involve lighter elements and be vacuum-tight. The first new system to get serious consideration is titanium-activated sodium alanate, followed by the lithium amide and borohydride systems that potentially overcome several of the disadvantages of alanates. Borohydrides can alternatively produce hydrogen by reaction with water in the presence of a catalyst but the product would have to be recycled via a chemical plant. Finally various possible ways of making magnesium hydride decompose and reform more readily are discussed. The alternative to lighter hydrides is the development of physisorption of molecular hydrogen on high surface area materials such as carbons, metal oxide frameworks, zeolites. Here the problem is that the surface binding energy is too low to work at anything above liquid nitrogen temperature. Recent investigations of the interaction mechanism are discussed which show that systems with stronger interactions will inevitably require a surface interaction that increases the molecular hydrogen-hydrogen distance. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

IGC results can then be used in regulatory submissions to support other already established techniques for characterising pharmaceutical materials. α-Alumina was chosen because it is inorganic, stable at high temperatures, resistant to hydration and is already established as a system check material for surface area determination by nitrogen adsorption. Two columns (1 and 2) packed from the same reference sample jar of α-alumina and analysed under the same conditions yielded dispersive surface energies of 34.8 ± 0.8 and 35.3 ± 0.8 mJ/m2, respectively, at 15% RH. Column 1 was analysed on a second IGC system, and gave a dispersive surface energy of 34.7 ± 0.2 mJ/m2. No significant change was evident after 7 months storage under laboratory ambient conditions. Analysis of material from a second reference sample jar of α-alumina produced results not noticeably different to those of the first, yielding a dispersive surface energy of 35.3 ± 0.1 mJ/m2.

C. University, Lahore, Pakistan","Conductivity-frequency and capacitance-frequency characteristics of mixed oxides Al-In2O3-SnO2-Al structure are examined to elicit any correlation with the conduction mechanisms most often observed in thin film work. The existence of Schottky barriers is believed to be due to a strong donor band in the insulator established during the vacuum evaporation when a layer of mixed oxides In2O3-SnO2 system is sandwiched between two metal electrodes. Low values of activation energy at low temperatures indicate that the transport of the carriers between localized states is mainly due to electronic hopping over the barrier separating the two nearest neighbor sites. The increase in the formation of ionized donors with increase in temperature during electrical measurements indicates that electronic part of the conductivity is higher than the ionic part. The initial increase in conductivity with increase in Sn content in In2O3 lattice is caused by the Sn atom substitution of In atom, giving out one extra electron. The decrease in electrical conductivity above the critical Sn content (10mol% SnO2) is caused by the defects formed by Sn atoms, which act as carrier traps rather than electron donors. The increase in electrical conductivity with film thickness is caused by the increase in free carriers density, which is generated by oxygen vacancy acting as two electron donor. The increase in conductivity with substrate and annealing temperatures is due to either the severe deficiency of oxygen, which deteriorates the film properties and reduces the mobility of the carriers or to the diffusion of Sn atoms from interstitial locations into the In cation sites and formation of indium species of lower oxidation state (In2+). Calculations of C and σac from tanδ measurements suggest that there is some kind of space-charge polarization in the material, caused by the storage of carriers at the electrodes. Capacitance decreases not only with the rise of frequency but also with the lowering of temperature. At low temperatures the major contribution to capacitance arises from the ionic polarization, however, with the increase of temperature the contribution from orientation polarization would considerably increase. The decrease in capacitance with the increase in frequency may be attributed to interfacial polarization. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","Barrier height; Electron donors; Electron hopping; Indium interstitials; Loss tangent; Molar percent; Orientation and interfacial polarization; Oxygen vacancies; Tin substitution","Activation energy; Annealing; Capacitance; Carrier mobility; Evaporation; Low temperature effects; Polarization; Semiconducting indium compounds; Tin; Tin compounds; Vacuum applications; Barrier height; Electron donors; Electronic hopping; Indium interstitials; Mixed oxides; Oxygen vacancies; Schottky barriers; Vacuum evaporation; Alumina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846393187

We consider (i) the data from ""pulsed"" experiments, where light-triggered enzymes capture or eject protons at the membrane surface, (ii) the electrostatic properties of water at charged interfaces, and (iii) the specific structural attributes of proton-translocating enzymes. The pulsed experiments revealed that proton exchange between the membrane surface and the bulk aqueous phase takes as much as about 1 ms, but could be accelerated by added mobile pH-buffers. Since the accelerating capacity of the latter decreased with the increase in their electric charge, it was concluded that the membrane surface is separated from the bulk aqueous phase by a barrier of electrostatic nature. The barrier could arise owing to the water polarization at the negatively charged membrane surface. The barrier height depends linearly on the charge of penetrating ions; for protons, it has been estimated as about 0.12 eV. While the proton exchange between the surface and the bulk aqueous phase is retarded by the interfacial barrier, the proton diffusion along the membrane, between neighboring enzymes, takes only microseconds. The proton spreading over the membrane is facilitated by the hydrogen-bonded networks at the surface. The membrane-buried layers of these networks can eventually serve as a storage/buffer for protons (proton sponges). As the proton equilibration between the surface and the bulk aqueous phase is slower than the lateral proton diffusion between the ""sources"" and ""sinks"", the proton activity at the membrane surface, as sensed by the energy transducing enzymes at steady state, might deviate from that measured in the adjoining water phase. This trait should increase the driving force for ATP synthesis, especially in the case of alkaliphilic bacteria. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The measured electrical resistivity of SiTiNx films, determined by the nitrogen content x tunable up to 38.68%, is between 0.039-0.69 Ω cm which fulfils the requirements of a suitable heating layer suggested by simulations. SiTiNx films with a medium range of nitrogen content showed excellent thermal stability, very smooth surface and amorphous structure sustaining until at least 800 °C, thus suitable for application in PCRAM. However, SiTiNx films exhibit a high degree of temperature dependent resistivity, and show a different temperature coefficient of resistance with different N contents at the temperature range 400-500 °C. The chemical binding characteristics of SiTiNx films with such higher electrical resistivity were also investigated. The binding energy of Ti 2p spectra in SiTiNx films changes with nitrogen content and shifts to higher energies confirming their susceptibility to oxidation.

Epidemiological studies revealed that there was correlation among insulin, fat and cancer. Through the secretion of growth factors, sex hormones and adipocytokines, insulin and fat showed a significant effect on the physiological and metabolic function, thereby increase the risk of carcinogenesis. Adipose tissue not only serves as storage of excess energy, but also secretes adipocytokines (e.g., leptin, adiponectin, resistine, TNF-α and PAI-1) into circulating blood. These adipocytokines not only have physiological function in metabolism, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, immunity, angiogenesis and haemostasis, but also play an important role in the etiology of cancer. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) showed powerful mitogenic effects, and thus may increase risk of cancer. Recently, studies have shown that the use of insulin-secretors (i.e., sulfonylureas) and exogenous insulin may increase risk of cancer in type 2 diabetic patients, while insulin-sensitizers (i.e., thiazolidinediones) and metformin may reduce risk of cancer although more evidences are needed. A better understanding of diverse range of physiological and metabolic processes and the relationship among insulin, fat and malignancy may be helpful in elucidating more preventive avenues to manage cancer.","Cancer; Fat; Hyperinsulinemia; Insulin; Insulin resistance","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; adipocytokine; adiponectin; glucose transporter; growth factor; insulin; insulin sensitizing agent; leptin; metformin; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; resistin; sex hormone; somatomedin C; sulfonylurea derivative; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adipose tissue; angiogenesis; article; blood pressure; body fat; cancer research; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; correlation analysis; epidemiological data; evidence based medicine; hemostasis; hormone release; human; immunity; insulin sensitivity; malignant neoplastic disease; metabolism; mitogenesis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; protein secretion; risk reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748740751

This study deals with the experimental evaluation of thermal performance of a packed bed latent heat TES unit integrated with solar flat plate collector. The TES unit contains paraffin as phase change material (PCM) filled in spherical capsules, which are packed in an insulated cylindrical storage tank. The water used as heat transfer fluid (HTF) to transfer heat from the solar collector to the storage tank also acts as sensible heat storage material. Charging experiments were carried out at varying inlet fluid temperatures to examine the effects of porosity and HTF flow rate on the storage unit performance. The performance parameters such as instantaneous heat stored, cumulative heat stored, charging rate and system efficiency are studied. Discharging experiments were carried out by both continuous and batchwise processes to recover the stored heat, and the results are presented.","Charging; Discharging; Heat transfer fluid (HTF); Latent heat; Packed bed; Phase change material (PCM); Thermal energy storage (TES)","Energy storage; Heat transfer; Phase transitions; Solar heating; Charging; Discharging; Heat transfer fluid; Latent heat; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage; Packed beds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748704328

The test vessels were instrumented with pressure transducers, liquid space, vapor space, and wall thermocouples, and an instrumented flow nozzle in place of a pressure relief valve (PRV). A computer controlled PRV was used to control pressure. The vessels were heated using high momentum, liquid propane utility torches. Open pool fires were not used for the testing because they are strongly affected by wind. These wind effects make it almost impossible to have repeatable test conditions. The fire conditions used were calibrated to give heat inputs similar to a luminous hydrocarbon pool fire with an effective blackbody temperature in the range of 850°C±50°C. PRV blowdown (i.e., blowdown =pop pressure-reclose pressure) and fire conditions were varied in this test series while all other input parameters were held constant. The fire conditions were varied by changing the number of burners applied to the vessel wall areas wetted by liquid and vapor. It was found that the vessel content's response and energy storage varied according to the fire conditions and the PRV operation. The location and quantity of the burners affected the thermal stratification within the liquid, and the liquid swelling (due to vapor generation in the liquid) at the liquid/vapor interface. The blowdown of the PRV affected the average vessel pressure, average liquid temperature, and time to temperature destratification in the liquid. Large blowdown also delayed thermal rupture.

We know, from previous research, that brachiation is a very efficient locomotor mode that makes use of a pendulum-like exchange of energy, but to date, nothing is known about the dynamics of hylobatid bipedalism. We wondered if gibbons also make use of an efficient gait mechanism during bipedal locomotion. To investigate this, we calculated oscillations of the centre of mass (COM), energy fluctuations, recovery rates and power outputs from the 3D ground reaction forces. These ground reaction forces were collected during spontaneous bipedal locomotion of four untrained white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) over an instrumented walkway (with an AMTI force plate). Excursions of the COM are relatively large during hylobatid bipedalism and the fluctuations of potential and kinetic energy are largely inphase. Together with the low inverted pendulum recovery rates, this points to a spring-mass mechanism during bipedal locomotion. Although the well-developed Achilles tendon of gibbons seems to be a good candidate for the storage and recoil of elastic energy, this is not supported by kinematical data of the ankle joint. Instead, we suggest that the knee extensor muscle tendon unit functions as an energy-saving mechanism during hylobatid bipedalism, but detailed anatomical data is needed to confirm this suggestion. At low speeds gibbons use either pendular or spring mechanics, but a clear gait transition as seen in most quadrupedal mammals is absent. At moderate to high velocities, gibbons use a bouncing gait, generally without aerial phases. This supports the view that aerial phases are not a prerequisite for spring-mass mechanics and reinforces the claim that duty factor alone should not be used to distinguish between a walk and run.","Biomechanics; Energy recovery; Hylobates lar; Primate locomotion; White-handed gibbon","animal; article; biomechanics; gait; Haplorhini; human; locomotion; physiology; Animals; Biomechanics; Gait; Humans; Hylobates; Locomotion; Haplorhini; Hylobates lar; Hylobatidae; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748436501

The system consists of a SRAM-based detector and a radiation-tolerant read-out system. The neutron fluence was measured in several locations of the accelerator. Monitoring of the radiation environment in an accelerator tunnel is necessary to assure reliable long-term operation of electronic systems placed in the tunnel. Monitoring of the chamber is especially important during the design stage of a linear accelerator. The new design of 20 GeV linear accelerator X-ray Free Electron Laser (X-FEL) is currently approved for construction at DESY Research Centre in Hamburg [1], [2]. The presented paper is based on our research and experimental measurement carried out at 1.2 GeV superconducting electron linac driving the Vacuum Ultra violet Free Electron Laser (VUV-FEL). The application of a pair of TLD-700 and TLD-500 or superheated emulsion (bubble) dosimeters enables the supervision of neutron fluence in accelerators [3]. This process requires continuous and arduous calibration of TLDs, therefore this method is not convenient. Moreover, it is impossible to monitor the radiation environment in real-time. The presented system fills the market niche of real-time neutron monitoring for high-energy accelerators. Neutron fluence and gamma dose measured in this way can be used for the detailed analysis of the VUV-FEL or X-FEL environments. Monitoring of the radioactive area in a linear accelerator tunnel could be helpful to the diagnosis and reduction of beam losses [4], [5]. We have conducted experiments with the distributed system dedicated to neutron flux measurement at the DESY Research Centre in Hamburg. The devices were exposed to a neutron field from an Americium-Beryllium (n, α) source 241 AmBe. The systems were installed in two accelerators: Linac II and VUV-FEL. © 2006 IEEE.","Linear accelerator; Neutron fluence; Single event effect; Single event upset; Static random access memory","Neutron fluence; Single event effects; Single event upset; Condition monitoring; Laser applications; Linear accelerators; Radiation effects; Static random access storage; Distributed computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748364150

The ATLAS Trigger System has been designed in three levels in order to select only interesting physics events reducing from that rate of 40 MHz to the foreseen storage rate of about 200 Hz. The First Level reduces the output rate to about 100 kHz. The ATLAS Muon Spectrometer has been designed to perform stand-alone triggering and measurement of Muon transverse momentum up to 1 TeV/c with good resolution (from 3% at 10 GeV/c up to 10% at 1 TeV/c). In the Barrel region of the Muon Spectrometer the Level-1 trigger is given by means of three layers of resistive plate chamber detectors (RPC): a gaseous detector working in avalanche mode composed by two plates of high-resistivity bakelite and two orthogonal planes of read-out strips. The logic of the Level-1 barrel Muon trigger is based on the search of patterns of RPC hits in the three layers consistent with a high transverse momentum Muon track originated from the interaction vertex. The associated trigger electronics is based on dedicated processors, the Coincidence Matrix boards, performing space coincidences and time gates and providing the RPC readout as well. A detailed simulation of the ATLAS Experiment and of both the hardware components and the logic of the Level-1 Muon Trigger in the barrel of the Muon Spectrometer has been performed. This simulation has been used not only to evaluate the performances of the system but also to define the hardware set-up such as the cabling of both the trigger detectors and the trigger electronics modules. A description of both the Level-1 Muon Trigger system in the barrel and the RPC detectors, with their cosmic rays quality tests, will be presented together with the trigger performances and rates calculations evaluated for Muons over a wide range of PT and preliminary studies on the impact of accidental triggers due to low energy background particles in the experimental area. © 2006 IEEE.","Mesons; Trigger circuits; Triggering","Computer simulation; Protons; Readout systems; Spectrometers; Gaseous detector; Luminosity; Muon spectrometer; Transverse momentum; Particle accelerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748344944

We have developed this device (called the AMchip03 processor) for the silicon vertex trigger (SVT) upgrade at the Collider Detector experiment at Fermilab (CDF) using a standard-cell VLSI design methodology. This approach provides excellent pattern density, while sparing many of the complexities and risks associated to a full-custom design. The cost/performance ratio is better by well more than one order of magnitude than an FPGA-based design.

In this paper, a procedure for estimation of the parameters of Kooijman's Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model is introduced and subsequently parameters are estimated for the following Northeast Atlantic bivalve species: the Baltic clam Macoma balthica (L.), the sandgaper Mya arenaria L., the cockle Cerastoderma edule (L.), the blue mussel Mytilus edulis L. and the Pacifc oyster Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg, 1793). For none of the species, a complete set of parameters could be compiled. A special protocol was developed to account for missing values and to achieve consistency between parameters. Species were similar in their optimal temperature range, as reflected in a common Arrhenius temperature of 5800 K, which corresponds with a Q10 of 2. Differences between species were observed in width of the optimal temperature range. The taxonomic relatedness between species was reflected in similar volume-specific maintenance costs, costs for growth and almost similar maximum storage density of energy. Species differed in their maximum surface area-specific assimilation rate by a factor of 6 and in the fraction of energy allocated to reproduction (ranging from 0.15 to 0.50). These differences are reflected in the maximum theoretical total shell length of the species, which varied from about 3 cm in M. balthica, 6 cm in C. edule, 15 cm in M. arenaria and M. edulis and 45 cm in C. gigas. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the parameters of working gas such as pressure, temperature, molecular mass, degree of its contamination, and the duration of the electric energy input in working gas (duration of the current pulse) also influence velocity and efficiency. Changing the duration of the electric energy input by programming the capacitor storage discharge can be performed. The experiments that were carried out showed the following main results. The projectile velocity increases in the range of 7%-10% in the programmed discharge mode compared with the synchronous mode, although the energy inserted in the arc is equal for both modes. The efficiency of energy conversion from internal energy of working gas to the kinetic energy of the projectile at a velocity of 2100 m/s increases from 15% to 17%. Thus, to achieve equal projectile velocity, the pulsed pressure in the programmed mode should be lower than that in the synchronous mode.

Thus, most of the contemporary portable devices feature low-power processors coupled with on-chip memories (e.g., caches, scratchpads). Scratchpads are better than traditional caches in terms of power, performance, area, and predictability. However, unlike caches they depend upon software allocation techniques for their utilization. In this paper, we present scratchpad overlay techniques which analyze the application and insert instructions to dynamically copy both variables and code segments onto the scratchpad at runtime. We demonstrate that the problem of overlaying scratchpad is an extension of the Global Register Allocation problem. We present optimal and near-optimal approaches for solving the scratchpad overlay problem. The near-optimal scratchpad overlay approach achieves close to the optimal results and is significantly faster than the optimal approach. Our approaches improve upon the previously known static allocation technique for assigning both variables and code segments onto the scratchpad. The evaluation of the approaches for ARM7 processor reports, average energy, and execution time reductions of 26% and 14% over the static approach, respectively. Additional experiments comparing the overlayed scratchpads against unified caches of the same size, report average energy, and execution time savings of 20% and 10%, respectively. We also report data memory energy reductions of 45%-57% due to the insertion of a 1024-bytes scratchpad memory in the memory hierarchy of a digital signal processor (DSP). © 2006 IEEE.","Code overlay; Memory aware code optimization; Scratchpad memory (SPM)","Code overlay; Memory aware code optimization; Overlaying scratchpad; Scratchpad memory (SPM); Data storage equipment; Digital signal processing; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Microprocessor chips; Problem solving; Storage allocation (computer); Program processors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747437310

Comprising of a scratchpad memory instead of an instruction cache, the target system dynamically (at runtime) copies into the scratchpad code segments that are determined to be beneficial (in terms of energy efficiency and/or speed) to execute from the scratchpad. We develop a heuristic algorithm to select such code segments based on a metric, called concomitance. Concomitance is derived from the temporal relationships of instructions. A hardware controller is designed and implemented for managing the scratchpad memory. Strategically placed custom instructions in the program inform the hardware controller when to copy instructions from the main memory to the scratchpad. A novel heuristic algorithm is implemented for determining locations within the program where to insert these custom instructions. For a set of realistic benchmarks, experimental results indicate the method uses 41.9% lower energy (on average) and improves performance by 40.0% (on average) when compared to a traditional cache system which is identical in size. © 2006 IEEE.","Embedded system; Scratchpad memory","Code segments; Instruction cache; Scratchpad memory; Algorithms; Benchmarking; Control equipment; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Heuristic methods; Program processors; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747382439

Due to the toxicity of this precursor and to obtain an optimal process control we developed a two-step flow type process. Nickel carbonyl and nickel particles are synthesized in a sequence of reactions. The particles are formed in a hot wall reactor at temperatures below 400°C in different gas compositions. Varying the process conditions enables the adjustment of the particle size in a range from 3 to 140 nm.

Materials and methods: A general energy-minimization electrostatic model was developed in which the interactions between orientations are weighted according to their temporal order during acquisition. In this report, two corruption scenarios were specifically considered for generating relatively uniform schemes of 18 and 60 orientations, with useful subsets of 6 and 15 orientations. The sets and subsets were compared to conventional sets through their energy, condition number and rotational invariance. Schemes of 18 orientations were tested on a volunteer. Results: The optimized sets were similar to uniform sets in terms of energy, condition number and rotational invariance, whether the complete set or only a subset was considered. Diffusion maps obtained in vivo were close to those for uniform sets whatever the acquisition time was. This was not the case with conventional schemes, whose subset uniformity was insufficient. Conclusion: With the proposed approach, sets of orientations responding to several corruption scenarios can be generated, which is potentially useful for imaging uncooperative patients or infants. © ESMRMB 2006.","DTI; Gradients; Motion; Orientations; Patient","article; diffusion tensor imaging; energy; human; in vivo study; model; motion; priority journal; technique; Algorithms; Artifacts; Brain; Databases, Factual; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Movement; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747093020

The optimization is based on a probabilistic approach to vessel operational conditions with regards to blackout prevention and minimization of fuel consumption. The generator commitment problem has been solved using long term probability of sea states and expected values of wave heights based on weather statistics. The problem is analyzed by taking care of proper selection of vessel's operational profile, total installed power, number of generator sets, power rating of each unit, load dependent start/stop tables and load sharing among generators. The cost function is based on fuel consumption and operational requirements. Minimization of fuel consumption has been analyzed with respect to efficient use of fast load reduction technology where generating sets inertia has important influence on the power system speed of response and direct influence on risk of the blackout. Redundancy requirements with respect to blackout prevention are also included in the optimization. The proposed optimization scheme can be used in marine power plant design and application of any technology that influence power system inertia such as flywheel energy storage devices, batteries and fuel cells.","Blackout prevention; Fuel consumption; Power system design; Probability-based optimization","Algorithms; Design; Fuel consumption; Optimization; Probability; Blackout prevention; Power management system (PMS); Ship power system design; Ships",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746904287

The purpose of this paper is to develop a predictive method for debris dispersion around an ammunition storage site in case of an accidental detonation in a reinforced concrete storage structure. The concrete slabs/walls break up into debris when it is overloaded by the internal blast. The debris velocity is one of the important parameters to describe the debris dispersion. The parameters that affect the debris velocity are complex. This study adopts the energy approach to simplify the formulation. The failure process in a relatively thin concrete slab/ wall is treated using the concept of expansion. Based on energy conservation, a general formula is derived for the debris launch velocity in a cubicle structure subjected to internal blast loading. The dynamic strength of concrete and reinforcement are considered in the fracture process. The analytical results are found to be consistent with the relevant experimental results.

Analysis of fatty acid (FA) profiles can reveal trophic relationships in soil food webs, leading to a better understanding of the energy and nutrient flows from microbiota to earthworms. The objective of this study was to determine the origin of FAs assimilated by the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris L. We analysed the pattern of FAs in: (i) the bulk soil, (ii) soil in the earthworm gut, (iii) the absorptive tissue of the earthworm gut wall, and (iv) the muscular layers of the earthworm body wall. Multivariate analyses performed on the FA profiles suggest that the microbial community in the earthworm gut differs from that in bulk soil. Diverse bacterial and fungal derived FAs, which earthworms cannot synthesize, were found in the earthworm gut wall and body wall, and in the neutral lipids (storage lipids) of the gut wall. The major compounds isolated were 20:4ω6, 20:5ω3 and 18:2ω6, followed by the monoenoic 18:1ω7 and 18:1ω9c, and the saturated 18:0. The microbial FA assemblage in the gut wall resembled the gut soil more than the bulk soil, and the body wall of L. terrestris showed the same microbial derived FA pattern as the gut wall, although at reduced concentrations. We propose the existence of a specific microbial community in the earthworm gut that provides FAs to the earthworm. It appears that L. terrestris may derive more of its energy and nutrients from gut specific microbiota than from microbiota already present in the ingested soil, based on the trophic relationships revealed through FA analysis. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In animal models, a restricted or unbalanced maternal diet during gestation can influence susceptibility to atherosclerosis, but the relation in humans between maternal diet during pregnancy and atherogenesis is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS - We measured carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in 216 nine-year-old children whose mothers had participated in a study of nutrition during pregnancy. IMT was greater in boys, in children who were heavier, in those with higher systolic blood pressure, and in those who took less exercise. Increased IMT was associated with a lower maternal energy intake in early (P=0.029) or late (P=0.006) pregnancy, after adjustment for these factors.

Since microorganisms are central to most soil processes, the sustainable management of agricultural soils may need to consider the impact of soil fertility management on the soil microbial community. We tested the hypothesis that different rates of N and P fertilizers, and cropping frequency (modifying C input to soil) influence the size, structure and physiological condition of soil microbial populations residing in the plough layer (top 7.5 cm). For this study, we used a 37-yr old long-term wheat-based rotation experiment located in the semiarid Brown soil zone of Saskatchewan. The experiment included (1) four input treatments: (i) no N or (ii) no P fertilizer application to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in fallow-wheat-wheat (F-W-W) rotations, and (iii) recommended rates of both N and P fertilizer applied to fallow-wheat (F-W) and (iv) to F-W-W; (2) two rotation phases: fallow and wheat-after-fallow; and (3) four sampling times: 8 June, 4 July, 5 August and 16 September 2003. Increased partitioning into storage lipids of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biomarker 16:1ω5 (P=0.04), suggested the accumulation of storage material under low soil N availability. Discriminant analysis detected modifications in soil microbial community structure due to cropping frequency (P=0.001) and sampling time, the effect of which was different in the fallow (P&lt;0.0001) and wheat-after-fallow (P&lt;0.0001) phases of the rotations. Correlation analysis of soil variables conducted in plots growing wheat revealed a dual effect of plants, which stimulated active soil microbial biomass (SMB), possibly through the release of soluble extractable C (Csol-ext) in soil and, at the same time, SMB competed with wheat for soil water and N. The 37 y of different nutrient input treatments had no effect upon the active soil microbial biomass according to PLFA measurements, despite changes in soil resource-related variables (soil water potential, soil PO4-P and NO3-N fluxes, and Csol-ext concentrations) (P≤0.003). The biomass of each of three microbial populations monitored was lowest on 4 July, when the amounts of the soil resources monitored were average, and greatest on 5 August, when N, P and soil moisture availability was lowest. The temporal effect on the biomass of microbial populations seemed unrelated to variation in nutrient or water availability. We conclude that the soil microbial community is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions. We propose therefore that the occurrence of sudden and dramatic events, such as a heavy rainfall on a dry soil, is the most important determinant of seasonal variation in active soil microbial biomass.

We analysed the microbial dustiness of baled straw (cultivated both conventionally and ecologically) and of wood chips from piles that had been stored outdoors for up to 11 months by using total spore counting, cultivation, and measuring of endotoxin and chemical markers of fungal biomass, lipopolysaccharide, and peptidoglycan. The bacterial dustiness of straw was much greater than of wood chips whereas the fungal dustiness did not differ much. In general, samples taken from the inner part of each biofuel material were dustier than samples taken from the surface, except for fungal and bacterial biomass in wood chips and total fungi and fungal biomass in ecological straw. A considerable increase of bacterial dustiness occurred during storage over summer. Dust from ecological straw contained considerably less of bacterial components than from conventional straw and, in addition, exhibited a less pronounced increase upon storage over summer. In summary, biofuels represent sustainable energy resources of growing economic importance but may at the same time pose significant health problems. We found that storage of biofuels outdoors over summer increased the microbiological dustiness and should therefore be avoided, and that ecological straw contained less of microbe-containing dust than conventional straw and should be preferred since it reduces the exposure to harmful microbiological agents.","Bacteria; Cfu; Dustiness; Endotoxin; Fungi; LPS; Muramic acid; Occupational health; Particles; Straw; Wood chips","biochemical marker; biofuel; lipopolysaccharide; mycotoxin; peptidoglycan; article; biomass; dust; economic evaluation; energy resource; fungal spore germination; materials handling; microbial contamination; occupational exposure; occupational hazard; seasonal variation; storage; straw; wood chip; Air Microbiology; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Animals; Bacteria; Biomass; Colony Count, Microbial; Dust; Endotoxins; Fungi; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Lipopolysaccharides; Occupational Exposure; Peptidoglycan; Poaceae; Risk Assessment; Wood; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746470804

Adzuki bean (Vigna angularis) seeds containing weevils of different ages (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 days), were exposed to electrons at an acceleration voltage of 170 kV for 20 min (10 kGy). The radiation sensitivity of the insect decreased with increasing age. The egg stage was highly susceptible to electron radiation whereas the 18-day-old stage (fully developed adults ready for emergence) was the most tolerant, and treatment at a higher energy (200 kV equal to 10 kGy) was necessary to achieve an 80% mortality of this stage. However, the longevity, fecundity and fertility of the surviving adult insects were adversely affected by the electron treatment and they failed to complete their life cycle. The sex ratio of weevils was not significantly affected by the electron treatment, suggesting an equal vulnerability of both sexes.

Each client independently sends requests to inform the server of its desired data items and the server replies with a broadcast channel. We are interested in studying the energy consumption characteristics in such a scenario. First, we define a utility function for quantifying performance. Based on the utility function, we formulate the wireless data access scenario as a noncooperative game - wireless data access (WDA) game. Although our proposed probabilistic data access scheme does not rely on client caching, game theoretical analysis shows that clients do not always need to send requests to the server. Simulation results also indicate that our proposed scheme, compared with a simple always-request one, increases the utility and lifetime of every client while reducing the number of requests sent, with a cost of slightly larger average query delay. We also compare the performance of our proposed scheme with two popular schemes that employ client caching. Our results show that caching-only benefits clients with high query rates at the expense of both shorter lifetime and smaller utility in other clients. © 2006 IEEE.","Caching; Game theory; Invalidation reports; Simulations; Utility; Wireless data access; Wireless protocol design","Invalidation reports; Utility; Wireless data access; Wireless protocol design; Broadcasting; Buffer storage; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Game theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746343316

Here it is reported that this treatment also reduces binding and phagocytosis by macrophages. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Phagocytosis of mepacrine-labeled PLTs by macrophages changes the latter into bright fluorescent particles easily detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. RESULTS: In combination with conventional binding analysis it was found that binding to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-matured THP-1 cells is primarily regulated by PLT P-selectin expression and phagocytosis by combined phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and glycoprotein (GP) lba clustering. It was found that trapping of PLT Ca 2+ and raising cAMP reduces phagocytosis by lowering PS exposure. Chilling of PLTs leads to an increase in binding and PS- and GPIbα-mediated phagocytosis. Prior depletion of PLT energy stores prevents this increase by preserving low Ca2+ concentration, PS exposure, and PS-mediated phagocytosis. CONCLUSION: These data characterize the individual factors that control PLT binding and phagocytosis and might help to define conditions that improve the survival of stored PLTs after transfusion.",,"calcium; cyclic AMP; glycoprotein Ib alpha; PADGEM protein; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; phosphatidylserine; article; human; human cell; macrophage; normal human; phagocytosis; protein expression; survival; thrombocyte; thrombocyte transfusion; Blood Preservation; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Humans; Macrophages; P-Selectin; Phagocytosis; Platelet Adhesiveness; Platelet Transfusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746336947

Accurate knowledge of the enthalpy as a function of temperature, or the storage capacity at each temperature, is the key to design any application. Conventional methods for thermal analysis however often lack sufficient accuracy or sample size to be applied to PCM. The T-history method is a simple method to determine the storage capacity of PCM and allows the use of large sample sizes. The experimental setup and methods of data analysis have been significantly improved in recent years. In this paper, a proper methodology to verify the correct setup and data analysis method of a T-history installation using standard materials with known properties is described and tested. The implementation of the T-history method has been done at the ZAE-Bayern. Three standard materials, gallium, water and hexadecane, were measured, as well as two commercial PCM, RT27 and sodium acetate trihydrate graphite compound (SAT+G).

Eight cyclists performed cycling trials at 15°C (COOL), 25°C (NORM) and 35°C (HOT) (65% humidity throughout), during which they were instructed to cycle at a Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 16, increasing or decreasing their power output in order to maintain this RPE. Power output declined linearly in all three trials and the rate of decline was significantly higher in HOT than in NORM and COOL (2.35 ± 0.73 W min-1, 1.63 ± 0.70 and 1.61 ± 0.80 W min-1, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). The rate of heat storage was significantly higher in HOT for the first 4 min of the trials only, as a result of increasing skin temperatures. Thereafter, no differences in heat storage were found between conditions. We conclude that the regulation of exercise intensity is controlled by an initial afferent feedback regarding the rate of heat storage, which is used to regulate exercise intensity and hence the rate of heat storage for the remainder of the anticipated exercise bout. This regulation maintains thermal homeostasis by reducing the exercise work rate and utilizing the subjective RPE specifically to ensure that excessive heat accumulation does not occur and cellular catastrophe is avoided. © 2006 The Authors.

In this review we highlight a crucial role of RIP140, a transcriptional corepressor for nuclear receptors, in the regulation of energy expenditure. Mice devoid of the RIP140 gene are lean, exhibit resistance to high-fat-diet-induced obesity, and have increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Consistent with these observations, RIP140 suppresses the expression of gene clusters that are involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, including fatty acid oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial uncoupling. Therefore, the functional interplay between transcriptional activators and the corepressor RIP140 is an essential process in metabolic regulation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is often difficult to maintain a long-term compliance to training programs. It is not clear whether leisure-time physical activity is effective in preventing sarcopenia and fat accumulation. Objectives: (i) To investigate longitudinal body composition changes in a population of elderly people in good apparent health. (ii) To evaluate the impact of leisure-time physical activity on muscle mass and characteristic as reflected by total body potassium per fat-free soft tissue (TBK/FFST), and on fat accumulation. Design: Longitudinal evaluation over 3 years, of body composition changes in 74 healthy men and 66 women, over 65 years old. Body fat and FFST were analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and TBK by whole-body 40K counter. Physical activity was analyzed by a specific questionnaire. Results: Despite a stable total body weight, FFST and appendicular skeletal muscle mass slightly decreased (-0.3±1.4 and -0.2±2.2 kg, P &lt; 0.0 1, respectively) as well as the TBK/FFST (-4.1±6.3 mmol/kg, P &lt; 0.0 0 1), over the 3-year period. Body fat increased significantly (0.6±2.2 kg, P &lt; 0.0 0 0 1), and it accumulated mainly in the abdomen (0.4±1.5 kg, P &lt; 0.0 1). Multiple regression analysis showed that body composition changes were related mainly to body weight changes. Nevertheless, positive linear correlations were observed between the degree of engagement in leisure-time physical activity and FFST (P &lt; 0.0 1), appendicular skeletal muscle mass (P &lt; 0.0 5), TBK/FFST (P &lt; 0.0 5), whereas negative correlation was observed with total and truncal fat (P &lt; 0.0 1). Conclusions: Mild but significant decline in muscle mass and its TBK content, and body fat accumulation were observed over a 3-year period in healthy elderly subject: leisure-time physical activity does not seem to prevent them. However, a higher level of physical activity is associated with higher muscle mass and TBK content, and less total and truncal fat. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.","Body composition; Elderly; Muscle mass; Physical activity; Total body potassium","potassium; aged; aging; article; body composition; body fat; body weight; controlled study; correlation analysis; data analysis; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; exercise; female; health status; human; leisure; lipid storage; longitudinal study; male; multiple regression; muscle atrophy; muscle mass; physical activity; questionnaire; skeletal muscle; soft tissue; total body potassium; training; weight change; whole body counter; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adipose Tissue; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Body Composition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Densitometry, X-Ray; Exercise; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Leisure Activities; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Muscular Atrophy; Patient Compliance; Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746041829

RBS and NRA techniques were applied to study compositional transformations induced by ion beam bombardment. Important hydrogen release was observed with increasing ion dose and was correlated with the linear energy transfer (LET). Another important effect observed was the rapid oxidation of samples, which apparently occurs after exposure of implanted samples to the air. Oxygen uptake continues during the prolonged storage of the samples in the air at RT. Up to 10 at.% of oxygen can be incorporated in the implanted layer. Changes of surface layer composition produced important increase in the layer hardness.

A variety of mechanisms may be employed to attain and conserve energy for such periods. Wild grey seals demonstrate seasonal patterns of energy storage and foraging behaviour that appear to maximize the allocation of energy to reproduction-a period characterized by both high energy demand and low food availability. We examined seasonal patterns in resting rates of oxygen consumption as a proxy for metabolic rate (RMR) and body composition in female grey seals (four adults and six juveniles), testing the hypothesis that adults would show seasonal changes in RMR related to the reproductive cycle but that juveniles would not. There was significant seasonal variation in rates of resting oxygen consumption of adult females, with rates being highest in the spring and declining through the summer months into autumn. This variation was not related to changes in water temperature. Adults increased in total body mass and in fat content during the same spring to autumn period that RMR declined. RMR of juveniles showed no clear seasonal patterns, but did increase with increasing mass. These data support the hypothesis that seasonal variation in RMR in female grey seals is related to the high costs of breeding. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Body composition; Grey seal; Resting metabolic rate; Seasonal","adipose tissue; animal; article; basal metabolic rate; body composition; body weight; breeding; economics; female; oxygen consumption; Phoca; reproduction; season; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Body Composition; Body Weight; Breeding; Female; Oxygen Consumption; Reproduction; Seals, Earless; Seasons; Animalia; Halichoerus grypus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745946475

An organism's ability to adjust its physiological traits to changes in environmental conditions is central for its ecological success. However, the effect of ecological interactions on physiological flexibility has rarely been investigated. Here we carry out a factorial experiment to analyse how food limitation (a potential result of competition) and tail loss (a potential result of sub-lethal predation) affect anatomical and physiological traits of the South American lizard Liolaemus nitidus. 2. The size of several internal organs was affected by food availability. Small intestine mass increased with food consumption, allowing animals to keep constant digestibility at greater levels of digesta, which in turn permitted higher rates of food assimilation. Organs related to energy storage reached larger sizes in autotomized animals with high food availability, but tail regeneration rate after 3 weeks did not change with food availability. 3. Metabolic rate was affected by tail loss, and animals regenerating their tail showed higher metabolic rates than tailed ones. Because this increase in metabolic rate was independent of internal organ mass, a local effect of tail regeneration process (e.g. cell proliferation) on metabolic rate is suggested. 4. When anatomical and metabolic data are jointly considered it follows that lizards adopt different physiological strategies, changing both energetic inputs and expenditures. This fact illustrates the complex interplay between ecological factors and physiological flexibility, which ultimately determine an organism's fitness. © 2006 The Authors.","Digestive flexibility; Liolaemus nitidus; Phenotypic plasticity; Tail autotomy","food limitation; lizard; physiological response; Animalia; Liolaemus nitidus; Squamata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745815305

The electrochemical response of all the investigated materials is rather featureless during charging and discharging and does not show any phase transitions or clear redox responses. The maximum discharge capacity, ∼130 mAhg, is measured for an as-produced single-walled carbon nanotube material. Measurements indicate that the electrochemical activity of the matrix material, used to manufacture composite electrodes, should also not be ignored. Highly pure CNTs yield a substantially lower response, indicating that the CNTs itself can only account for a small part hereof. The measured response of CNT materials is related to a number of processes, including the irreversible oxidation of carbonaceous material, the reversible oxidation/reduction of residual metal catalyst or carbonaceous impurities, and an electrostatic charging component. Steady-state impedance measurements, cross-correlated with cyclic voltammetry, show that (dis)charging of the electrical double layer can be directly linked to this electrostatic charging component. Characterization of highly pure CNT materials shows that more than 90% of the total charge was stored in this way. Only about 25% of the total amount of charge could be explained in this way for the as-produced materials. Based on the overall results it is highly unlikely that a significant amount of hydrogen can be stored in CNT material and that the exact amount of charge that can be reversibly stored in CNT material heavily depends on its morphology and the level of purity. © 2006 The Electrochemical Society.

As an example, the core shroud, the structure having the function to maintain the core centered on its axis, is being designed in the Westinghouse AP1000, differently from previous plants, as a highly heterogeneous structure. Its thermal-mechanical sizing must take into due account accuarately determined internal heat generation rates. The latter, if determined by combining 2D and 1D neutron and γ-ray calculations which imply the separation of spatial variables and are mainly applicable for fluxes in the reactor beltline region, may include overly conservative margins. On the other hand, Monte Carlo methods do not allow an easy quantification of the uncertainties related to overall calculation. Three-dimensional deterministic models, based on the discrete ordinate transport theory, have the potential to provide accuarate design data; they can be also effective provided that the well-known difficulty to create and tune a complex geometrical model in a reasonable time is overcome and adequate computer resources are available to perform the calculation (until few years ago [Botta et al., 1996.

The computational power required is massive: 2 GB of RAM and up to 50 GB of swap files peak storage for each run with an S8 full-symmetric angular quadrature and 120 GB of swap files peak storage with an S16 full-symmetric angular quadrature. By using a latest generation workstation based on an INTEL P-IV 3.2 GHz processor under LINUX operating system (both SUSE 9.2 or Red Hat 9.1 and better are suitable), each run requires less than a week of full computer time with the P3 Legendre approximation with an S8 full-symmetric angular quadrature. The code BOT3P has been used both for the preparation of the geometrical model and as post processor of the TORT program outputs. BOT3P permitted to cut the model development time by a significant factor and to retrieve efficiently large amount of data from the TORT binary files, allowing a graphical review of the input and output data and, finally, resulting in a unique tool for Quality Control for complex 3D models. This computational experience can be considered a good working example for the 3D deterministic transport method revival by considering that this method is widely accepted by licensing authorities. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated whether these two phenotypes are linked by studying the metabolic response to SIT4 deletion. Although the sit4 mutant failed to grow on respiratory substrates, in the exponential growth, phase respiration was de-repressed; active respiration was confirmed by measuring oxygen consumption and NADH generation. However, the fermentation rate and the internal glucose 6-phosphate and pyruvate levels were reduced, while glycogen content was high. Respiro-fermentative and respiratory substrates such as galactose, glycerol and ethanol were directed toward glycogen synthesis, which indicates that sit4 mutant deviates metabolism to glycogenesis by activating a glycogen futile cycle and depleting cells of Krebs cycle intermediates. An important feature of the sit4 mutant was the lack of growth under anaerobic conditions, suggesting that respiration is necessary to meet the energy requirements of the cell. Addition of aspartic acid, which can restore Krebs cycle intermediates, partially restored growth on ethanol. Our findings suggest that inhibition of Sit4 activity may be essential for redirecting carbohydrate flux to gluconeogenesis and glycogen storage. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This method provides for both high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen densities, and the potential risk is very small due to the storage and transportation in the liquid state under ambient pressure. It also has the advantage that hydrogen storage and transportation is carried out as a conventional petrochemical product. However, this method has not been technically established because the dehydrogenation catalyst does not have a sufficient stability and performance. We have developed a dehydrogenation catalyst using a simple fixed-bed reactor that has a high stability and sufficient performance. This catalyst can generate hydrogen from methylcyclohexane (MCH: 99.9%) with a conversion &gt; 95 %, toluene selectivity &gt; 99.9 %, hydrogen generation rate &gt; 1000 Nm3 / h / m3 cat under the reasonable conditions of 593 K, ambient pressure, LHSV:2.0/h and co-feed hydrogen 5-20 mol% in the feed. The estimated production cost at a hydrogen station for fuel cell vehicle (FCV) is around 64.7 ¥ / Nm3 H2 (59 ¢ / Nm3 H2). Two possible applications of this method are introduced. One is the utilization of low-grade hydrogen including impurities.

This easy-to-prepare catalyst showed an enhanced activity after being recovered from previous use. The effects of temperature, NaBH4 concentration, NaOH concentration and pressure on the hydrogen generation rate were investigated. Particular importance has the effect of pressure, since the maximum reached pressure of hydrogen is always substantially lower than predictions (considering 100% conversion) due to solubility effects. The solubility of hydrogen is greatly enhanced by the rising pressure during reaction, leading to storage of hydrogen in the liquid phase.

Three of these surfaces are specular reflectors, diffuse emitters and the fourth surface is a diffuse reflector, diffuse emitter. This enclosure can be used as a transplant production unit with artificial lighting for electric energy saving purposes. An image system and the crossed string method are used to derive these relations. The resulting expressions are conceptually simple and similar to the commonly known expressions of the exchange factors between diffuse surfaces, F. The accuracy of the presented FS relations was examined for different numbers of multiple reflections, N, on the specular surfaces and for different aspect ratios (ratio of the width, w to the height, h). The results proved that the relations are accurate and strongly satisfy the well-known relation of the radiation exchange between enclosure surfaces and satisfy the reciprocity relation. For any aspect ratio, considering N of 150 between highly reflective surfaces (ρ = 0.99) is sufficient to estimate the FS factors without any possible error. Using specular reflecting surfaces in such cases significantly reduces the electric energy consumption used for lighting. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, implementation of more and more systems with renewable energies is necessary. Solar systems for single family houses or residential buildings need a big water tank that many times is not easy to locate. This paper studies the modelization of a new technology where PCM modules are implemented in domestic hot water tanks to reduce their size without reducing the energy stored. A new TRNSYS component, based in the already existing TYPE 60, was developed, called TYPE 60PCM. After tuning the new component with experimental results, two more experiences were developed to validate the simulation of a water tank with two cylindrical PCM modules using type 60PCM, the cooldown and reheating experiments. Concordance between experimental and simulated data was very good. Since the new TRNSYS component was developed to simulate full solar systems, comparison of experimental results from a pilot plant solar system with simulations were performed, and they confirmed that the type 60PCM is a powerful tool to evaluate the performance of PCM modules in water tanks. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In general, this has been due to certain energy related characteristics often connected to their very nature as islands. These limitations attempt to prevent the appearance of problems that might affect the stability and safety of the electrical system. The restrictions imposed on the direct penetration of wind sourced energy in the conventional grids of the Canary Islands are an obstacle to meeting the renewable energy objectives set out by the European Union. As a partial solution to the problem, this paper proposes the installation on Gran Canaria island (Canarian Archipelago) of an appropriately administered wind powered pumped hydro storage system. The results obtained from the application of an optimum-sized economic model of such a system indicates that penetration of renewable sourced energy can be increased by 1.93% (52.55 GW h/year) at a competitive cost for the unit energy supplied. These results are obtained on the hypothesis that two of the largest existing reservoirs on the island (with a difference in height between the two of 281 m and a capacity of some 5,000,000 m3 used in each) are employed as storage deposits. Investment, operating and maintenance costs are taken into account, as well as those costs involving health and environmental damage associated with energy production and use (externalities). The system would consist of: a wind farm with a rated output of 20.40 MW; a modular pumping station with a rated output of 17.80 MW, operated so that the variation in the energy demand for pumping is in sympathy with the wind generation; and a hydraulic plant with a rated output of 60.00 MW. The proposed system would have no negative effect on either the reliability of the electrical system or consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, it would mean a fossil fuel saving of 13,655 metric tonnes/year and a reduction in CO2 emissions into the atmosphere of 43,064 metric tonnes/year. For regions that have topographically suitable sites and which suffer energy problems similar to those of the Canary Islands it is thus suggested that an analysis be made of the technical and economic feasibility of the installation of power systems such as that proposed in this paper. Within the general guiding framework of a policy promoting clean and renewable energy, these systems represent an enormous and as yet barely explored potential. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing the efficiency of energy conversion and energy exchange between different kinds of secondary energy sources is very important for the development of hybrid and electric propulsion systems. The capabilities of secondary energy sources to store energy depend on important vehicle parameters: maximum range, gradability and acceleration ability. These parameters affect life cycles of traditional secondary energy sources (electrochemical batteries). Using ultracapacitors (UCAP) as an additional secondary energy source makes it possible to improve the life cycle of a battery and simultaneously to decrease the exploitation costs of electric (EV) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). Such electrochemical elements are called: ultracapacitor, supercapacitor, pseudocapacitor or Electric Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC).",,"Acceleration; Capacitors; Costs; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Electric Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC); Energy exchange; Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV); Ultracapacitors; Energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746359948

The hardening is lower as the strain per cycle decreases. Similar studies under hot working conditions, for a limited number of cycles, also lead to lower hardening, as well as to changes in the shape of the flow curves and to delays in the initiation of Dynamic Recrystallization (DRX) and in the post-processing static softening kinetics. These results point to a decrease in stored energy caused by cyclic straining. A higher number of hot deformation cycles leads to lower steady state stresses (σ SSr) than those corresponding to monotonic deformation (σss). Besides, DRX can be suppressed and replaced by Dynamic Recovery (DRV), and the successive cycles have been associated with the repeated build-up and disintegration of dislocation structures. The present research discusses the hot deformation of an IF steel in the austenitic temperature range, for monotonie torsion or a large number of reversed torsions with various strain amplitudes (Δε). It was confirmed that σ SSr depends on the relative amplitude of the strain cycles (Δε/εp,. where εpp is the strain at the peak stress in the monotonie torsion of the material), and that lower values of Δεlεp eliminate DRX, which is replaced by DRV. The ferritic grain size after deformation into the cyclic steady state stress depends on the value of σSSr, similarly to results in the literature for monotonie torsion of IF steels. © 2006 ISIJ.","Dynamic phenomena; Hot cyclic straining; Interstitial free (IF) steels; Recrystallization and recovery; Strain path change","Deformation; Energy storage; Hardening; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Stained glass; Torsional stress; Dynamic phenomena; Hot cyclic straining; Interstitial free (IF) steels; Recrystallization and recovery; Strain path change; Metals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746074772

We have now extended the same study to the clinical application of this MOSFET as an in-vivo dosimetry system. The MOSFET was used during high dose rate brachytherapy (HDRBT) of internal mammary chain (IMC) irradiation for a carcinoma of the breast. The aim of this study was to measure the skin dose during IMC irradiation with a MOSFET and a TLD and compare it with the calculated dose with a treatment planning system (TPS). The skin dose was measured for ten patients. All the patients' treatment was planned on a PLATO treatment planning system. TLD measurements were performed to compare the accuracy of the measured results from the MOSFET. The mean doses measured with the MOSFET and the TLD were identical (0.5392 Gy, 15.85% of the prescribed dose). The mean dose was overestimated by the TPS and was 0.5923 Gy (17.42% of the prescribed dose). The TPS overestimated the skin dose by 9% as verified by the MOSFET and TLD.

The microstructure and dehydrogenating property of the milled system were examined. Then energy and electronic structure of the hydride phase were investigated by using a first-principles plane-wave pseudopotential method to explain the experimental results from XRD, DSC and TGA analysis. By calculating the heats of formation of MgH2, (MgFe)H2 solid solutions and Mg2FeH6 compound, the forming process of Mg2FeH6 was assumed as that magnesium was first dissolved in some H atoms to form MgH2, second, iron atom progressively dissolved into MgH2 lattice to form (MgFe)H2 solid solutions, finally the (MgFe)H2 solid solution can be changed into Mg2FeH6 phase. For DSC curves as a function of temperature for all the powders milled for different time, a drastic change of dissociation temperature is never found, this kind of relatively sluggish change can be explained using the idea on forming process of Mg2FeH6. Since MgH2 phase is still the major phase in the coexistence mixtures of two types of hydrides β-MgH2 and Mg2FeH6, Mg2FeH6 reduces the negative formation heat of the mixture compared with that of MgH2, which indicates that Mg2FeH6 lowers the desorption temperature of MgH2 through a catalytic effect and the milled powder containing duplex β-MgH2 + Mg2FeH6 exhibits the most rapid desorption rate among all the powders studied from TGA analysis. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The products were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The size of cube-shaped PbS nanocrystals can be controlled by changing the relative amount of Pb(Ac) 23H2O and dithioglycol. Smaller cube-shaped PbS nanocrystals were obtained at higher sulfur content in the reaction system. The nanometre-sized single crystals of PbS measure ∼83nm × 59nm × 22nm and 39nm × 10nm × 7nm, for lead acetate:dithioglycol ratios of 1:0.375 (denoted as PbS-1) and 1:1.5 (denoted as PbS-2), respectively, when a mixture of NaOH solution of lead acetate and ethyl alcohol solution of dithioglycol is maintained at 220 °C for 4h in a Teflon-lined autoclave. XRD patterns and HRTEM images confirm the crystalline structure of the PbS crystals. TEM helped to determine the dimension of the single crystals. Raman, XPS and IR helped to further demonstrate the purity of the as-synthesized samples. The optical absorption spectra of suspensions of the these crystals in glycol show shifts in absorption band edge for as-prepared sample PbS-1 from 246 to 271nm and for PbS-2 from 246 to 275nm, after four days of storage, respectively. The photoluminescence peaks from the two samples are located at 434 and 433nm for photoexcitation radiation of 315-355nm, thus exhibiting a Stokes shift compared with band edge energy. The principal contribution of this work is that the nanometre-size PbS single crystals are prepared without using a surfactant or templating agent. The formation of a five-membered ring via the chelation between the Pb2+ ion and dithioglycol is considered to be crucial in this mechanism. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Autoclaves; Glycols; Infrared spectroscopy; Lead; Nanostructured materials; Raman spectroscopy; Single crystals; Surface active agents; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Crystalline structure; High-resolution TEM (HRTEM); Lead acetate; NaOH solution; Photoexcitation; Photoluminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746608193

Given an orthonormal set made up of occupied orbitals (Hartree-Fock or similar) and suitable correlation orbitals (natural or localized orbitals), a large N-electron target space S is split into subspaces S0,S1,S2,...,S Ṙ. S0, of dimension d0, contains all configurations K with attributes (energy contributions, etc.) above thresholds T0 = {T0egy, T0etc.}; the CI coefficients in S0 remain always free to vary. S1 accommodates KS with attributes above T1≤T0. An eigenproblem of dimension d0+d1 for S0+S 1 is solved first, after which the last d1 rows and columns are contracted into a single row and column, thus freezing the last d1 CI coefficients hereinafter. The process is repeated with successive Sj(j≥2) chosen so that corresponding CI matrices fit random access memory (RAM). Davidson's eigensolver is used R times. The final energy eigenvalue (lowest or excited one) is always above the corresponding exact eigenvalue in S. Threshold values {Tj;j=0, 1, 2,...,R} regulate accuracy; for large-dimensional S, high accuracy requires S 0+S1 to be solved outside RAM. From there on, however, usually a few Davidson iterations in RAM are needed for each step, so that Hamiltonian matrix-element evaluation becomes rate determining.

The spent liquor contains 4000 ppm of COD, 2000 ppm of BOD, 700 ppm of Lignin in dissolved form. The mechanical pulp form a major constituent of the newsprint furnish. In order to achieve high yield of mechanical pulp, pulping is carried out using low chemical dosages. As a result a very small portion of lignin, hemicellulose and resinous materials get solubilised in the pulping process. The low chemical dosage does not make it economically viable to operate a chemical recovery unit.

As these maximum efficiency conditions impose the level of converted power, an intermittent time-modulated operation mode is applied to the thermodynamic converter to obtain a variable converted power. A smoothly variable output power is achieved with the help of a supercapacitive auxiliary storage device used as a filter. The paper describes the concept of the system, the power-electronic interfaces and especially the Maximum Efficiency Point Tracking (MBIT) algorithm and the strategy used to vary the output power. In addition, the paper introduces more efficient hybrid storage systems where the volumetric air machine is replaced by an oil-hydraulics and pneumatics converter, used under isothermal conditions. Practical results are also presented, recorded from a low-power air motor coupled to a small DC generator, as well as from a first prototype of the hydro-pneumatic system.

The in vivo effects of a chronic expression of exogenous ApN restricted to adipose tissue are unclear. Moreover, the regulatory effects of ApN on its own expression and on that of its receptors are still unknown. In this study, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice with moderate expression of exogenous ApN targeted to adipose tissue (native full-length ApN being placed under control of the adipocyte promoter aP2). After a transient overexpression of ApN in young pups, we intriguingly observed a reduction of ApN mRNA levels and protein content in fat depots, together with a decrease of circulating ApN in adult mice. As a result, the phenotype of these adult mice included glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and increased adiposity. Reduced expression of ApN in fat tissue was associated with diminished expression of uncoupling protein 2 involved in energy dissipation, and higher expression of fatty acid synthase, a key enzyme of lipogenesis, and of TNFα implicated in insulin resistance. Concomitantly, the expression of the ApN receptor AdipoR2 that mediates action of full-length ApN was downregulated, while that of AdipoR1 was unaffected. In agreement with the in vivo studies, recombinant ApN added to the culture medium of 3T3-F442A adipocytes caused a decrease in AdipoR2 and ApN mRNA levels. This treatment did not affect the expression of AdipoR1. Eventually, we demonstrated a contrario that AdipoR2 (but not R1) was specifically upregulated in fat of ApN-/- mice.

Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae), an endemic and keystone species living only at 3000-5000 m above sea level on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is a typically high hypoxia and low temperature tolerant mammal with high resting metabolic rate (RMR), non-shivering thermogenesis (NST), and high ratio of oxygen utilization to cope with harsh plateau environment. To explore the molecular mechanism of ecological acclimation in plateau pika, we first cloned pika leptin cDNA and compared its mRNA expression in different altitudes (3200 and 3900 m) using real-time RT-PCR (Taqman probe) technology. The full-length pika leptin cDNA was 3015 with 504 bp open-reading frame encoding the precursor peptide of 167 amino acids including 21 residues of signal peptide. Pika leptin was 70-72% homologous to that of other species and was of similarly structural characteristics with other species. The pika-specific genetic diversity in leptin sequence occurred at twenty sites. With the increase in altitude, there were larger fat store and high level of ob gene expression in plateau pika. Our results indicated that leptin is sensitive to cold and hypoxia plateau environment and may play one of important roles in pika's ecological adaptation to harsh plateau environment. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The heart of these devices is an ion conducting electrolyte which needs to provide high performance at low cost. This thesis focuses on new electrolyte materials for these devices; the first part concerns lithium salts with prospects to increase the performance and safety of lithium batteries, and the second part deals with protic ionic liquids (PILs), a new electrolyte material for low temperature fuel cells. By combining high accuracy quantum mechanical calculations with vibrational spectroscopy, an increased understanding of the properties of these new materials was obtained. This knowledge is important in the development of improved materials. Two promising types of binary lithium salts were investigated: lithium salts incorporating one (azole type) and two (orthoborate type) ring structures with pending electron drawing groups for charge delocalisation. The calculated lithium binding energies of both these types of salts are 10-15% lower than for the lithium salt used in batteries today. From the calculated and characterised salt structures new improved salts have been proposed for synthesis at collaborating laboratories, completing our feedback cycle. An oligomeric lithium salt with single ion conducting properties was investigated to pinpoint structural features limiting the lithium ion transport in these special systems. PILs are non-volatile low temperature melting salts with high proton conductivity, formed by proton transfer from an acid to a base, that can swell polymers even at elevated temperatures. PILs thus have the potential to replace both the role of water and the ionomer part in polymer electrolyte membranes and improve the fuel cell efficiency considerably. By calculating molecular level properties, an increased understanding of important macroscopic properties for fuel cell performance such as melting temperature, fluidity and conductivity was obtained.","Ab initio calculations; Electrolytes; Electron structure calculations; IR spectroscopy; Lithium salts; Protic ionic liquids; Raman spectroscopy","Binding energy; Electrolytes; Electronic structure; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Infrared spectroscopy; Protons; Quantum theory; Raman spectroscopy; Salts; Ab initio calculations; Electron structure calculations; Lithium salts; Protic ionic liquids; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745700314

Unfortunately, exact algorithms for finding the best solutions to the above problem are computationally very expensive.

Average values of synonymous nucleotide substitutions per synonymous site are significantly lower for information processing genes compared to either metabolic or cellular processing genes. These results suggests that synonymous codon usage has been subject to greater constraint in the information storage and processing group of genes compared to other functional categories of genes. For metabolic and cellular processing genes, correspondence analysis based on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values separates the genes along the first major axes according to the genome type; while in the information processing group, genes are separated along the second major axes according to the genome type. Further study on synonymous substitution rate for information processing genes shows a stronger selective constraint on synonymous codon usage of six amino acids, G, A, R, P, Y, F.

Long-term changes in FTP depths are an important indicator of climate change. The FTP is seldom represented explicitly in land surface schemes, but the 0°C isotherm is used as a surrogate for the front. However, when multiple FTFs occur within a soil column or when soil temperature hovers around the freezing point in the spring, the simulated 0°C isotherm exhibits large fluctuations though in reality, the fronts develop rather smoothly. To explicitly simulate the FTP depths, this study couples a Two-Direction Stefan Algorithm (TDSA) in the Community Land Model 3 (CLM3). Several modifications are also introduced to adapt the CLM3 to the northern region, including the addition of a peat cover to the soil column, retention of a minimum unfrozen water content in the frozen soil, and implementation of canopy heat storage. The modified scheme was tested using field data from a boreal forest site. The TDSA enables the simulated FTP to be defined properly. Sensitivity tests demonstrate that the modified scheme (addition of a peat cover, unfrozen water and canopy heat storage) greatly improves the match between the simulated fronts and the 0°C isotherm derived from measured soil temperatures. These modifications and the coupling of the TDSA are applicable to other lands surface schemes for the simulation of ground frost in the cold regions.

The approach taken is to minimize a Landau free energy functional that includes a gradient term to describe the size effects. Landau-Khalatnikov equations together with Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field are then solved simultaneously to describe how the radiation interacts with the film. From this reflectivity curves can be calculated and related to experimental studies. Attention is paid to how the metal substrate can influence the reflectivity curves compared to free standing films without substrates. The significance of the work lies in the fact that ferroelectric ceramic thin films are becoming of increasing technological importance, and films on metal substrates such as electrodes are of obvious relevance to applications such as memory devices which rely on applied electric fields to change the polarization direction. The main conclusion is that terahertz wave measurements in the far-infrared provide an informative and sensitive probe of the size effects and substrate influence. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.","Far infrared; Ferroelectrics; Nanoscale; Size effects; Terahertz; Thin films","Data storage equipment; Electric field effects; Electrodes; Maxwell equations; Nanostructured materials; Reflectometers; Thermodynamics; Thin films; Far infrared; Landau thermodynamic theory; Size effects; Terahertz; Ferroelectric ceramics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750557908

The key power multiplication element of the scheme is an opening switch generating the voltage of inductive origin. The switch represents an additional volume with magnetically accelerated solid-state or plasma conductor between the generator and the load. Motion of the conductor increases the inductance of the volume. A sufficiently fast increase of this inductance at the end of magnetic energy storage time ensures power multiplication. A critical requirement for the accelerated conductor is the possibility of temporal profiling of the inductance increase. A proof-of-principle experiment at GIT 12 shows that such profiling is possible. We suggest a simple analysis of the scheme efficiency and illustrate this analysis for a multi-mega-Ampere class generator.

The glycogen content increased significantly, while the lactate content remained unchanged, in the muscle of P. schlosseri during 48 h of emersion. Thus, emersion led to either a decrease in glycogen utilization or an increase in glycogen synthesis. Because there was no change in energy charge, P. schlosseri probably used energy stores other than glycogen during emersion. The phosphofructose kinase-1 (PFK) from the muscle of P. schlosseri became more sensitive to ATP inhibition after 6 h of emersion, indicating that a transient decrease in the glycolytic flux indeed occurred at this locus that led to an increase in glycogen content. In contrast, such phenomena were not observed in the muscle of B. boddarti during 48 h of emersion. Emersion also led to a significant increase in the muscle fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F26P2) content in P. schlosseri, but not in B. boddarti.

Besides this, Turkey's total electricity capacity increased from 16,318 MW in 1990 to 31,846 MW in 2002. Restructuring of the electricity sector in the country has started with the establishment of the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) upon the law (no. 4628) that came into force on March 3, 2001. The Energy Market Regulatory Board, which runs the EMRA, was commissioned on November 19, 2001. In May 2002, the EMRA issued drafts of the Energy Market Licensing Regulation and the Electricity Market Tariffs Regulation, and these regulations went into effect in August 2002.

After ignition, a moving electric arc generated an autonomous plasma formation. The lifetime of the autonomous plasma formations, measured from video frames of 40 ms in succession, depends approximately linearly on their geometrical size. By applying a cylindrical-symmetrical back projection transformation to the images of the autonomous plasma formations and computing the radiation intensity profiles, a vortexlike structure of the plasma formations was detected. Autonomous plasma vortices 2.5 cm in diameter showed lifetimes of about 120 ms. No significant influence of the ambient air temperature, ranging from 10°C to 30°C, was found, nor on the relative air humidity, ranging from 10% to 100%. The radiation temperature of the plasma vortices were estimated by fitting blackbody radiation curves to the measured intensities at four spectral wavelengths provided by optical-spectrum filters. The average radiation temperature of the autonomous plasma vortices was estimated at about 2000 K, having a temperature decay of about 300 K/ms. The reproducible formation of metastable autonomous plasma vortices as described in the literature can be verified at the laboratory scale. Its geometrical intensity profile and radiation temperature can be approximated and its lifetime measured.

It takes into account the fact that the dielectric constant of the TR target material is a complex function, introduces an expression for the number of passes of an injected electron through the target, and accounts more precisely for the absorption of TR. It is shown that the consideration of the complexity of the dielectric constant results in notable changes of the TR spectrum for emitted photons with energies close to the ionization energies of the target material. Since such TR is used mostly for performing X-ray lithography (XRL), the sensitivity of the photoresist used in XRL is formulated. Maximization of this resist sensitivity can be used for designing optimum targets for XRL. Study of the transmission of TR through a commonly used XRL mask, and its partial absorption in a common photoresist, illustrates that TR emission with E = [490,1860] eV is most useful for performing such XRL, while E ≅ 1 keV is best. It is shown that, for a particular target material, a target consisting of only one foil emits the most TR energy.

The TL curve demonstrates a single high-temperature peak only when CaF2 is doped with a high manganese concentration, being close but still below the decomposition threshold of a solid solution. In case of lower manganese concentrations, the TL curve shows several peaks overlapping with each other. The optimum manganese concentration in thermoluminophor is found to be about 2.1-2.5 mol%. The influence of different factors on the actual Mn concentration in CaF2 : Mn is reported for the case where the material is prepared by the co-precipitation method. The CaF2 crystal lattice stress due to the Mn incorporation is studied by means of the X-ray diffraction technique. The solid solution decomposition threshold is estimated. The EPR studies of both γ-irradiated and non-irradiated samples have demonstrated that the amount of Mn2 + does not change as a result of the irradiation. The model of energy storage is suggested. It is based on a pair of VK and F centres, induced by radiation near Mn2 +, which immediately turns into an exciton-like state with a partial relaxation of the lattice stress caused by the Mn impurity. Partial relaxation of the lattice stress increases the thermal stability of the stored excitation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is also of particular interest where demands are made for long periods of institutional control and monitoring (or staged implementation) of repositories or where a desire exists to keep options open for possible retrieval with regard to spent fuel reprocessing. In this concept, large steel casks containing vitrified High Level Waste (HLW) and/or spent fuel are stored in large rock caverns at depths 500 to 1000 m below surface for approximately 300 years before backfilling to transform this 'store' into a final 'repository'. However, the extreme environmental conditions of a HLW repository cannot guarantee sterility. As a result, the humid, ventilated caverns could provide many potential niches for microbial growth, which could influence both the integrity of the storage casks (and any associated infrastructure) and the subsequent long-term performance of the sealed repository. The storage period is likely to provide the optimum period for microbial colonisation and growth, with the casks and rock walls exposed to constantly circulating air, which would provide oxygen for aerobic microbial processes. In addition, nutrients and energy sources will be introduced from the surface during operational and monitoring procedures. The duration of this storage period may be extended or shortened, depending on changing institutional requirements and it is thus particularly important to know the effects of microbial activity during this time. Simple models of the constraints on such growth can be used to scope the potential for activity to influence repository performance, particularly in relation to changing storage times, and to compare the CES design with conventional repository concepts. © 2005 NERC.","Effects; Microbiology; Predictive modelling; Radioactive waste; Repository","Cavern extended storage (CES) repository; Microbial growth; Microbiological effects; Predictive modelling; Quantitative evaluation; Mathematical models; Microbiology; Radioactive waste storage; Radioactive wastes; Spent fuels; Geological repositories; microbiology; radioactive waste; repository; waste disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748043960

With a floor area of 2.44 × 4.88 m, the pilot scale dryer included a 102-kW propane burner and a 12-kW blower located at the end of the air duct system, thereby creating a negative air pressure. The side walls were made of plastic film which adhered to the bales because of suction. A re-circulation duct returned a variable fraction of the exhaust air to the input to improve thermal efficiency depending on the level of vapor saturation. Part of the dryer's originality lies in its bi-directionality, i.e. heated air can flow alternately from the top plenum downward or from the bottom plenum upward. Bi-directional airflow was automated by two pairs of gate valves installed in two incoming air ducts and two outgoing air ducts. Results showed that one-layer batches reached an average moisture content of 12% in less than 5,9, and 14 h with initial moisture contents of 21%, 24%, or 34%, respectively. Two-layer batches reached an average moisture content of 12% in less than 10 and 24 h with initial moisture contents of 21% and 30%, respectively. Total energy efficiency based on combustion heat and electrical energy for water evaporation ranged from 29% to 49% with an average of 38% in the first half of drying time and from 6% to 31% with an average of 17% in the second half of drying time. The difference between moisture content in the upper half and the lower half of bales was reduced with increased airflow inversion cycles. Because of lateral variation in final moisture content due in part to non-uniform initial moisture and bale density, some over-drying would be required to ensure that all bales are dried to a safe storage moisture level. © 2006 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Airflow; Bale; Drying; Hay; Moisture","Blowers; Drying; Ducts; Energy efficiency; Fuel burners; Moisture; Plastic films; Airflow; Bi-directional dryer; Hay bales; Dryers (equipment)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747768954

The study shows fast programming and erasing times as compared with conventional devices. It is shown that the charge saturation depends on the gate voltage stress in the low electric field regime. For high gate voltages, a saturation of the stored charge is obtained, indicating that the density of trapped carriers in Ge nanocrystals is limited and depends only on the dots size. Capacitance decay measurements exhibits a very long retention time for holes as compared with silicon nanocrystal memories. This is mainly due to the barrier height for holes at the nc-Ge/ 2 interface. A model for simulation of the retention kinetics has been developed and allows to extract the band alignment of the nc-Ge/SiO2/Si system. The simulation results are then used to determine the band gap energy of Ge nanocrystals.

The spatial encoding is based on a frequency division approach. In STA, a major disadvantage is that only a single transmitter (denoting single transducer element or a virtual source) is used in every transmission. The transmitted acoustic energy will be low compared to a conventional focused transmission in which a large part of the aperture is used. By using several transmitters simultaneously, the total transmitted energy can be increased. However, to focus the data properly, the signals originating from the different transmitters must be separated. To do so, the pass band of the transducer is divided into a number of subbands with disjoint spectral support. At every transmission, each transmitter is assigned one of the subbands. In receive, the signals are separated using a simple filtering operation. To attain high axial resolution, broadband spectra must be synthesized for each of the transmitters. By multiplexing the different waveforms on different transmitters over a number of transmissions, this can be accomplished. To further increase the transmitted energy, the waveforms are designed as linear frequency modulated signals. Therefore, the full excitation amplitude can be used during most of the transmission. The method has been evaluated for blood velocity estimation for several different velocities and incident angles. The program Field II was used. A 128-element transducer with a center frequency of 7 MHz was simulated. The 64 transmitting elements were used as the transmitting aperture and 128 elements were used as the receiving aperture. Four virtual sources were created in every transmission. By beamforming lines in the flow direction, directional data were extracted and correlated. Hereby, the velocity of the blood was estimated. The pulse repetition frequency was 16 kHz. Three different setups were investigated with flow angles of 45, 60, and 75 degrees with respect to the acoustic axis. Four different velocities were simulated for each angle at 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.00 m/s. The mean relative bias with respect to the peak flow for the three angles was less than 2%, 2%, and 4%, respectively. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Blood; Natural frequencies; Parameter estimation; Signal encoding; Synthetic apertures; Transducers; Transmitters; Ultrasonic equipment; Beamforming lines; Single transducer element; Spatial encoding; Synthetic transmit aperture ultrasound; Ultrasonic imaging; algorithm; animal; artery; article; biological model; blood flow velocity; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; echography; flow kinetics; human; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; physiology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Animals; Arteries; Blood Flow Velocity; Computer Simulation; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Cardiovascular; Reproducibility of Results; Rheology; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ultrasonography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747260800

To dissect the role of liver fat in the insulin resistance of diet-induced obesity, we altered liver fat using a choline-deficient diet. C57Bl/6 mice were fed a low-fat (10% of calories) or high-fat (45% of calories) diet for 8 weeks; during the final 4 weeks, diets were either choline deficient or choline supplemented. In choline replete animals, high-fat feeding induced weight gain, elevated liver triglycerides (171%), hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance. Choline deficiency did not affect body or adipose depot weights but amplified liver fat accumulation with high-fat diet (281%, P < 0.01). However, choline deficiency lowered fasting plasma insulin (from 983 ± 175 to 433 ± 36 pmol/l, P < 0.01) and improved glucose tolerance on a high-fat diet. In mice on 30% fat diet, choline deficiency increased liver mRNA levels of the ratelimiting enzyme in phosphatidylcholine synthesis and of enzymes involved in free fatty acid esterification, without affecting those of de novo lipogenesis or fatty acid oxidation. We conclude that liver fat accumulation per se does not cause insulin resistance during high-fat feeding and that choline deficiency may shunt potentially toxic free fatty acids toward innocuous storage triglyceride in the liver. © 2006 by the American Diabetes Association.","Acsl, acyl-CoA synthetase long chain; Agpat, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase; AUCgl, area under the glucose curve; CDD, choline-deficient diet; Cpt1a, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1a; DAG, diacylglycerol; Dgat, DAG o-acyltransferase","choline; fatty acid; insulin; lipid; messenger RNA; triacylglycerol; messenger RNA; phosphatidylcholine; animal experiment; animal model; article; controlled study; diet restriction; fat body; fat intake; fatty acid oxidation; fatty liver; glucose intolerance; hyperinsulinemia; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid blood level; lipid diet; lipid storage; lipogenesis; low fat diet; male; mouse; nonhuman; nutritional assessment; obesity; priority journal; weight gain; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; caloric intake; disease model; enzymology; fat intake; fatty liver; genetics; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; kinetics; liver; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; pathophysiology; vitamin deficiency; weight gain; Animals; Blood Glucose; Choline Deficiency; Dietary Fats; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Intake; Fatty Liver; Glucose Intolerance; Kinetics; Liver; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Oxidation-Reduction; Phosphatidylcholines; RNA, Messenger; Weight Gain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747079056

During a 2-week stopover, the body mass of this small shorebird is doubled (∼20 g to 40 g) by feeding on a burrowing amphipod, Corophium volutator, that contains unusually high levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). In mammals, high n-3 PUFA content of membrane phospholipids (PL) is linked to improved exercise performance due to increased membrane fluidity that accelerates transmembrane lipid transport. We hypothesized that dietary n-3 PUFA could be used as a natural 'performance-enhancing substance' by semipalmated sandpipers to prepare their flight muscles for migration. Also, PUFA stored as fuel in neutral lipids (NL) can be mobilized more quickly than saturated fatty acids, but they contain less energy per unit mass. It is therefore unclear whether dietary fatty acids are modified before storage. Birds were collected at various stages of fat loading to examine changes in the composition of tissue PL (membranes) and NL (fuel stores). Results show that dietary n-3 PUFA are incorporated in tissue lipids in less than 2 weeks. During the stopover, the double bond index of muscle PL increases by 25% and the fatty acid profiles of both muscle PL and adipose NL converge with that of the diet. However, >50% of dietary n-3 PUFA are converted to other fatty acids before storage, mainly to oleate (18:1), possibly because monounsaturates offer a compromise between high energy density and ease of mobilization. This study shows that long-distance migrant birds can (1) use natural diets rich in specific lipids to prime flight muscles for endurance exercise, and (2) modify dietary fatty acids before storing them as fuel.","Bird migration; Calidris pusilla; Corophium volutator; Endurance exercise; Fat stores; Fatty acid metabolism; Membrane phospholipids; Nutrition; Sandpiper","omega 3 fatty acid; Amphipoda; animal; article; body composition; Charadriiformes; chemistry; drug effect; fat intake; feeding behavior; metabolism; physiology; population migration; weight gain; Amphipoda; Animal Migration; Animals; Body Composition; Charadriiformes; Dietary Fats; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Feeding Behavior; Weight Gain; Aves; Calidris pusilla; Corophium volutator; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747055830

Although many embedded devices offer more resistance to bus probing attacks due to their compact size, susceptibility to power or electromagnetic analysis attacks must be analyzed. This paper presents a table masking countermeasure to resist differential power analysis (DPA) and differential electromagnetic analysis (DEMA). Real power and EM measurements are used to verify the countermeasure using second- and third-order DPA and DEMA attacks on a popular low-energy embedded ARM processor. Results show that the new table masking countermeasure provides increased security without large overheads of energy dissipation compared with previous countermeasures.

In the area of energy conversion, production and storage devices, these materials have been applied as electrodes for batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells or solar cells, among others. Their importance relies on the wide variety of organic and inorganic counterparts that these hybrids can be made of. The properties from each part can be tailored in order to contribute to a final desired characteristic or the combined properties from both. The unique combination of useful properties found in these materials include electronic conductivity (e- or h+), ionic transport, reversible electroactivity, electrooptical properties typical of semiconductors as well as electrochromic, pH- and composition-dependent properties, all of them to add to their polymeric nature. This is an excellent basis for the design of hybrid materials in which either of these properties or their combinations work to enhance or combine with those of a myriad inorganic phases with electronic, magnetic, photochemical, electrochemical, optical or catalytic properties. A large variety of functional hybrid materials can thus be designed and fabricated in which multifunctionality can be easily built to address specific technological needs. In this work we present our most recent results on new synthesis methodology developed for the chemical synthesis of the hybrid PAni/PMo12 and their application as electrochemical supercapacitors. We also report the synthesis of a new hybrid material of PEDOT/PMo12 synthesized for the first time by chemical methods and applied also in electrochemical supercapacitors.

Thermal and radiative characteristics of urban and rural surfaces as well as atmospheric parameters related to the general synoptic conditions were used as data input. In addition, buildings were modelled as parallelepipeds and the hysteresis of materials was taken into account. The model provides as output skin temperature of buildings, air temperature and humidity within the canopy layer and hence the mean surface temperature and the air temperature at 2 m above surface. The latter parameter was used for the comparison with in situ temperature observations. The model was applied to Rome in radiative summer and winter episodes. The results, which agree with observations, show that the Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a nocturnal phenomenon, present both in winter (the greatest difference between urban and rural temperatures is about 2 °C) and summer (the temperature difference is about 5 °C), mainly resulting from the urban geometry and the thermal properties of materials. The anthropogenic heat does not play an important role in the UHI development. A monthly nocturnal behaviour of temperature differences between urban and surrounding rural areas shows that the maximum mean value of 4.2 °C occurs in August. Moreover, the parks in the city centre, where temperatures are lower, define two distinct heat islands, east and west. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

From the 1970s to the mid-1980s, this region was a source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere due to decrease of soil carbon (C) stocks and high consumption of fuel by intensive tillage. Since then, NT has partially restored the soil C lost and reduced the consumption of fossil fuels. To assess the potential of C accumulation in NT soils, four long-term experiments (7-19 yr) in subtropical soils (Paleudult, Paleudalf, and Hapludox) varying in soil texture (87-760 g kg-1 of clay) in agroecologic southern Brazil zones (central region, northwest basaltic plateau in Rio Grande Sul, and west basaltic plateau in Santa Catarina) and with different cropping systems (soybean and maize) were investigated. The lability of soil organic matter (SOM) was calculated as the ratio of total organic carbon (TOC) to particulate organic carbon (POC), and the role of physical protection on stability of SOM was evaluated. In general, TOC and POC stocks in native grass correlated closely with clay content. Conversely, there was no clear effect of soil texture on C accumulation rates in NT soils, which ranged from 0.12 to 0.59 Mg ha-1 yr-1. The C accumulation was higher in NT than in conventional-till (CT) soils. The legume cover crops pigeon pea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp] and velvet beans (Stizolobium cinereum Piper &amp; Tracy) in NT maize cropping systems had the highest C accumulation rates (0.38-0.59 Mg ha-1 yr-1). The intensive cropping systems also were effective in increasing the C accumulation rates in NT soils (0.25-0.34 Mg ha-1 yr-1) when compared to the double-crop system used by farmers. These results stress the role of N fixation in improving the tropical and subtropical cropping systems. The physical protection of SOM within soil aggregates was an important mechanism of C accumulation in the sandy clay loam Paleudult under NT. The cropping system and NT effects on C stocks were attributed to an increase in the lability of SOM, as evidenced by the higher POC to TOC ratio, which is very important to C and energy flux through the soil. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.",,"Double-crop systems; Energy fluxes; Particulate organic carbon (POC); Crops; Fossil fuels; Soils; Carbon; fertilizer; nitrogen; organic carbon; soil organic matter; soil water; Brazil; carbon storage; clay; conference paper; cover crop; crop production; cropping system; land use; legume; maize; no tillage; oat; particle size; perennial ryegrass; pH; sand; sandy loam; soil; soybean; total organic carbon; wheat; Agriculture; Brazil; Carbon; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Organic Chemicals; Soil; Time Factors; Zea mays; Carbon; Farm Crops; Fossil Fuels; Soil; Cajanus cajan; Glycine max; Mucuna; Stizolobium; Zea mays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746435817

These two different approaches are known to have strengths and weaknesses. The main objective of the present exercise is to compare the prediction of both methods. A two-step procedure is employed here. The first deals with the pure thermal problem, i.e., without moisture calculation. Three different cases of increasing complexity are studied and compared to analytical solutions. The second step focuses on the moisture problem alone by comparing the responses obtained with a two-layer buffer storage model and a finite-volume discretization for moisture transfer. Results show that time step values are determinant even for pure thermal cases where the classical value of 1 h can lead to notable errors. For problems with moisture sorption in the wall, it has been shown that grid refinement is a very decisive parameter, while the time step has to be set, to unusually small values, to achieve a good response. © 2006 SAGE Publications.","Building; Envelope; Finite-volume; Heat; Moisture; Response factor","Computer simulation; Error analysis; Finite volume method; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Moisture; Envelope; Finite-volume; Heat; Response factor; Building materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746383476

The novelty in our approach is to introduce a piecewise constant level set function and use each constant value to represent a unique phase. If 2n phases should be identified, the level set function must approach 2n predetermined constants. We just need one level set function to represent 2n unique phases, and this gains in storage capacity. Further, the reinitializing procedure requested in classical level set methods is superfluous using our approach. The minimization functional for our approach is locally convex and differentiable and thus avoids some of the problems with the nondifferentiability of the Delta and Heaviside functions.

An increase in fructose consumption over the past 10-20 years has been linked with a rise in obesity and metabolic disorders. Fructose/sucrose produces deleterious metabolic effects in animal models. This raises concern regarding the short-term and long-term effects of fructose and its risk in humans. RECENT FINDINGS: In rodents, fructose stimulates lipogenesis and leads to hepatic and extrahepatic insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and high blood pressure. Insulin resistance appears to be related to ectopic lipid deposition. In humans, short-term fructose feeding increases de-novo lipogenesis and blood triglycerides and causes hepatic insulin resistance. There is presently no evidence for fructose-induced muscle insulin resistance in humans. The cellular mechanisms underlying the metabolic effects of fructose involve production of reactive oxygen species, activation of cellular stress pathways and possibly an increase in uric acid synthesis. SUMMARY: Consuming large amounts of fructose can lead to the development of a complete metabolic syndrome in rodents. In humans, fructose consumed in moderate to high quantities in the diet increases plasma triglycerides and alters hepatic glucose homeostasis, but does not appear to cause muscle insulin resistance or high blood pressure in the short term. Further human studies are required to delineate the effects of fructose in humans. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Cardiovascular risk; Dietary sugars; Ectopic lipids; Insulin resistance; Lipogenesis","fructose; glucokinase; glucose; reactive oxygen metabolite; sucrose; triacylglycerol; uric acid; body weight; cell activity; diet; dietary intake; dyslipidemia; energy metabolism; enzyme activation; epidemic; feeding; geography; glucose homeostasis; human; hypertension; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; liver; metabolic disorder; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; molecular dynamics; muscle level; nonhuman; obesity; review; risk factor; stress; synthesis; triacylglycerol blood level; Blood Glucose; Energy Metabolism; Fructose; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Liver; Obesity; Triglycerides; Animalia; Rodentia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746189652

Even though these diets do not harm healthy people in the short term, there is insufficient data to support their safe use and efficiency over a long period. Because of the fact that the proteins in these diets are mainly from animal sources, it induces a higher intake of total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. It is proven that high protein diets cause both physical and pathological abnormalities in the body. However, there exist very few studies about the effects of high protein nutrition on liver glycogen storage. For this study 40 Swiss albino mice consisting of two groups were used. The first group was fed with 25% High Protein; the other was fed with standard meal. The two groups were fed with respect to their diets for 30 days. At the end of 15th, 20th, 25th and 30th days 5 from each group were killed with cervical dislocation. The livers were removed after perfusion then fixated. The routine paraffin pursuit was applied before cutting into 5 μm sections and staining with H-E, PAS and silver. There were major differences in weight loss between the first and the fifteenth days. Glycogen storage was significantly reduced in HP (15) stained with PAS. Hydropic degeneration and regenerative activity was observed in H-E and silver stained HP group. As a result for the high protein diet group, weight loss at the 15th day and a significant decrement in glycogen storage at the 30th day was observed.","Glycogen; High Protein Diet; Liver; Mice","casein; cholesterol; glycogen; saturated fatty acid; analysis of variance; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; carbohydrate metabolism; fat intake; glycogen analysis; glycogen liver level; histopathology; liver regeneration; male; mouse; nonhuman; nutritional assessment; nutritional requirement; protein diet; staining; tissue degeneration; weight reduction; Animal Feed; Animals; Body Weight; Cholesterol; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Humans; Liver; Liver Glycogen; Male; Mice; Perfusion; Animalia; Mus musculus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746163373

In many cases, however, the battery contribution to the initial or the total operational cost is found to be dominant, discouraging further penetration of the available wind resource. This is basically the case for areas possessing a medium-low wind potential. On the other hand, several isolated consumers are located in regions having the regular benefit of an abundant and reliable solar energy supply. In this context the present study investigates the possibility of reducing the battery size of a stand-alone wind power installation by incorporating a small photovoltaic generator. For this purpose an integrated energy production installation based exclusively on renewable energy resources is hereby proposed. Subsequently a new numerical algorithm is developed that is able to estimate the appropriate dimensions of a similar system.

Additionally, this method of storage led to an increase in ozone concentration without the need for any additional energy. When ozone was stored in silica gel, it changed from a gaseous state to a liquid state via a vapor state in narrow capillaries according to Kelvin's law. When ozone was desorbed, it was concentrated depending on the changing of the form from a liquid state to a gaseous state via a supercritical fluids state in the narrow capillaries.

First, and in order to solve the model selection problem, we introduce a novel criterion, which is based on minimising strain energy of fitted surfaces. We then evaluate its performance and compare it with many other existing model selection techniques. Using this criterion, we then present a robust range data segmentation algorithm capable of segmenting complex objects with planar and curved surfaces. The presented algorithm simultaneously identifies the type (order and geometric shape) of each surface and separates all the points that are part of that surface. This paper includes the segmentation results of a large collection of range images obtained from objects with planar and curved surfaces. The resulting segmentation algorithm successfully segments various possible types of curved objects. More importantly, the new technique is capable of detecting the association between separated parts of a surface, which has the same Cartesian equation while segmenting a scene. This aspect is very useful in some industrial applications of range data analysis. © 2006 IEEE.","Model selection; Range data; Robust range data segmentation; Scale estimation","Algorithms; Estimation; Image reconstruction; Mathematical models; Object recognition; Surfaces; Model selection; Range data; Robust range data segmentation; Scale estimation; Surface selection criterion; Image segmentation; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; surface property; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745603769

The ISAC east and west targets use proton beam from the cyclotron to produce various radioactive isotopes, which are then ionized and extracted. The ions are then passed through the mass separator and selected ions are transferred to the low energy experiments or injected into a radio frequency quadrupole accelerator. The accompanying radioactive contamination from the production of radioactive ions requires a complex vacuum system. The main target vacuum space consists of two semiseparate (primary and secondary) volumes pumped by turbo-molecular pumps. The primary volume uses four pumps while the secondary volume uses two pumps. Two hermetic rotary vane pumps are used as backing pumps. The nominal vacuum in both volumes is about 1.33× 10-4 Pa (1.0× 10-6 Torr). The pressure is monitored by two cold cathode and two hot filament ion gauges. The cold cathode gauges are used to interlock the system, which is critical during the bake out of the target and beam production. The exhaust gas from the vacuum pumps can be radioactive. Three gas storage tanks (decay tanks) are used for temporary storage of the radioactive exhaust and its controlled release to the atmosphere. Gas-species insensitive membrane gauges are used for monitoring the pressure in the storage tanks. This article describes the details of the ISAC target vacuum system as well as some procedures related to the handling of the exhaust gas with traces of radioactive contamination produced by the targets. © 2006 American Vacuum Society.",,"Cyclotrons; Exhaust gases; Ionization; Particle accelerators; Proton beams; Radioisotopes; Vacuum pumps; Low energy; Radio frequency quadrupole accelerator; Radioactive contamination; Turbo-molecular pumps; Vacuum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745494175

We used a multiple experimental approach to investigate how diet quality and larval predation risk affected the rates of growth and development in painted frogs (Discoglossus galganoi), and how these changes influence post-metamorphic performance. A high-energy diet entailed growth advantages only if predation risk did not constrain energy acquisition, whereas diet quality affected primarily the extension of the larval period. Predation risk influenced juvenile shape, most likely via the effects on growth and differentiation rates. Juvenile frogs emerging from predator environments had shorter legs and longer bodies than those from the nonpredator tanks. However, these morphological changes did not translate into differences in relative jumping performance. Neither size-adjusted lipid storage nor fluctuating asymmetry was significantly influenced by food quality or predation risk. Our data suggest that the post-metamorphic costs of predator avoidance during the larval phase are mostly a consequence of small size at metamorphosis. © 2006 The Authors.","Developmental stress; Diet quality; Discoglossus galganoi; Energetic constraint; Fluctuating asymmetry; Ontogenetic trade-off; Predation risk","evolution; food quality; frog; growth rate; juvenile; larva; metamorphosis; predation risk; animal; article; food; frog; growth, development and aging; larva; locomotion; physiology; predation; Animals; Food; Larva; Locomotion; Predatory Behavior; Ranidae; Anura; Discoglossus galganoi; Discoglossus pictus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745216689

The study populations differed significantly in SMR. Population means for SMR changed in response to the temperature experienced during the yolk-absorption stage, when the risk of oxygen deficit increases and the vulnerability to hypoxia is highest. We also found a strong negative correlation between the temperature experienced during the first 2 months after yolk resorption and SMR, which supports the hypothesis of countergradient variation. Moreover, we detected a strong negative correlation between an index of growth opportunity and relative lipid content, suggesting that the risk of energy shortfall could be a major force in the evolution of storage strategies. Our results suggest that temperature can shape the evolution of metabolic rate during the yolk-absorptive stage or the first feeding stage, while energy storage levels may be more sensitive to thermal constraints acting on growth rates. © Springer 2006.","Countergradient variation; Habitat size; Metabolic rate; Salmo trutta; Starvation risk; Thermal stress","fish; geographical variation; growth rate; habitat type; temperature effect; Salmo trutta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745057394

Male Wistar rats (60-days-old) were fed with a control (C) and hypercaloric diet (H). Each of the two dietary groups (C and H) was divided into three subgroups (n = 8), sedentary (CS and HS), exercised 2 days a week (CE2 and HE2) and exercised 5 days a week (CE5 and HE5). The swimming was selected as a model for exercise performance. After 8-weeks exercised rats showed decreased lactate dehydrogenase serum activities, demonstrating the effectiveness of the swimming as an aerobic-training protocol. Exercise 5-days a week reduced the body weight gain. Triacylglycerol (TG) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-C) were increased in HD-fed rats. HE5 and CE5 rats had decreased TG, VLDL-C and cholesterol. HE2 rats had enhanced high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) in serum. No alterations were observed in lipid hydroperoxide (LH), while total antioxidant substances (TAS) were increased in serum of exercised rats. HD-fed rats had hepatic TG accumulation. Superoxide dismutase activities were increased and catalase was decreased in liver of exercised rats. The interaction of HD and physical exercise reduced TAS and enhanced LH levels in hepatic tissue. In conclusion, this study confirmed the beneficial effect of physical exercise as a dyslipidemic-lowering component. Interaction of HD and physical exercise had discrepant effects on serum and liver oxidative stress. The interaction of HD and physical exercise reduced the oxidative stress in serum. HD and physical exercise interaction had pro-oxidant effect on hepatic tissue, suggesting that more studies should be done before using physical exercise as an adjunct therapy to reduce the adverse effects of HD. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The measured electrical resistivity of SiTaNx films between 0.069 and 1.21 cm fulfills the requirements of a suitable heating layer suggested by simulations and is determined by nitrogen content which is tunable up to 52.8%. The SiTaNx films with higher nitrogen contents showed excellent thermal stability with amorphous structure sustained until at least 900°C. However, these samples exhibited a high degree of temperature-dependent resistivity and showed a negative temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) at the temperature range 400-500°C. The negative TCR increases with increasing N content and Si(Si+Ta) ratio. The binding energy of SiTaNx films changes with nitrogen content and Si(Si+Ta) ratio, conforming with the performance of electrical resistivity. By considering electrical resistivity at the range 0.1-0.15 cm and low TCR, SiTaNx compositions, 33.5-34.5 Si, 15.0-16.0 Ta, and 48-50 N in atom %, are recommended optimal for PCRAM heating layers.

The key to make good use of the SMES units is to design effective controllers. This paper presents a number of results on the analysis and control of multi-machine power systems with such units via Hamiltonian function method. It has been shown that the multi-machine power systems with SMES units can be made to be a port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) system by using a state feedback control, and that the stability of the resulting system can be established. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel energy-based adaptive L2 disturbance attenuation control scheme for the multi-machine systems with SMES units. The control scheme is a decentralized one and consists of two parts: one is an L2 disturbance attenuation excitation controller for the generators, and the other is an adaptive L2 disturbance attenuation controller for the SMES units. Simulations on a six-machine system with one SMES unit show that the proposed control scheme is very effective. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Sewage sludge is the predominant sewage fertiliser product available today, but the use of sewage sludge in agriculture has been questioned as regards hazardous substances. In this respect, blackwater from separating systems seems to better fulfil agricultural requirements regarding fertiliser products. The objective of this paper was to analyse the environmental impact and resource use in a life cycle perspective for three systems, each including both wastewater handling and agricultural production. In the reference system, food waste disposers were installed in houses. Milled food waste and wastewater were treated in a wastewater treatment plant and the sewage sludge was used for producing a soil conditioner. In the sludge utilisation system, food waste from households was composted, wastewater was treated conventionally and sewage sludge was used in oat production. In the blackwater system, toilet water from low-flush toilets and milled organic waste were digested together and spread in growing oats. Data on the wastewater system were derived from simulations by the substance-flow model URWARE/ORWARE. The blackwater system required slightly more primary energy than the other two systems. In particular, construction of storage facilities contributed considerably to energy use. The emissions of greenhouse gases and SO2 were of the same magnitude for all three systems, while the eutrophying emissions were reduced significantly in the blackwater system. As regards NH3 and NOX, the emissions were highest for the blackwater system. High substitution of mineral fertiliser, optimal spreading technique and well-designed collection and storage facilities were important factors for the environmental outcome in the blackwater system. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The energy balance and environmental load for systems based on rape methyl ester (RME), ethanol and biogas were evaluated using a life cycle perspective. Complete LCAs were not performed. Important constraints when implementing the systems in practice were also identified. The RME scenario showed favourable energy balance and produced valuable by-products but was less positive in some other aspects. The use of land was high and thereby also the emissions associated with cultivation. Emissions, with the exception of CO2, during utilisation of the fuel were high compared to those of the other fuels in the study. The technology for production and use of RME is well known and easy to implement at farm scale. The production of ethanol was energy consuming and the by-products were relatively low value. However, the area needed for cultivation of raw material was low compared to the RME scenario. The production and utilisation of ignition improver and denaturants were associated with considerable emissions. Suitable ethanol production technology is available but is more optimal for large scale systems. The biogas scenario had a low relative need for arable land, which also resulted in smaller soil emissions to air and water. Another advantage was the potential to recycle plant nutrients. On the other hand, the potential emissions of methane from storage of digestate, upgrading of biogas and methane losses during utilisation of fuel produced a negative impact, mainly on global warming. Small scale technology for biogas cleaning and storage is not fully developed and extensive tractor modifications are necessary. The global warming effects of all three systems studied were reduced by 58-72% in comparison to a similar farming system based on diesel fuel. However, the fuel costs were higher for all scenarios studied compared to current diesel prices.

In order to avoid power quality problems to consumers, it would be important to predict flicker emission from wind turbines at a certain site previously to installation. This paper focuses on a method to perform a fast flicker analysis caused by grid-connected fixed-speed wind turbines in continuous operation. The method has been developed completely in the frequency domain, including wind turbines. This method predicts the P st value for each node system. Applying this method there would be no need to perform measurements in every node, which would be nearly impossible or to simulate the whole model in the time domain, demanding an enormous computational effort and storage capacity. The performance of the frequency domain method is applied to analyze different wind energy generation scenarios to assess their influence in a real power system. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

High specific discharge from ice melt often dominates flow for considerable distances downstream, particularly where other sources of runoff are limited, providing a major water resource. Should Himalayan glaciers continue to retreat rapidly, water shortages might be widespread within a few decades. However, given the difference in climate between the drier western and monsoonal eastern ends of the region, future warming is unlikely to affect river flow uniformly throughout. A simple temperature-index-based hydro-glaciological model, in which glacier dimensions are allowed to decline through time, has been developed with a view to assessing, in data-sparse areas, by how much and when climate warming will reduce Himalayan glacier dimensions and affect downstream river flows. Two glaciers having the same initial geometries were located (one each) in the headwaters of two identical nests of hypothetical catchments, representing contrasting climates in the west and east of the region. The hypothetical catchments were nested such that percentage ice cover declined with increasing basin area. Model parameters were validated against available but limited mass-balance and river flow measurements. The model was applied for 150 years from an arbitrary start date (1990), first with standard-period (1961-1990) climate data and then with application of a 0.06°C year-1 transient climatic warming scenario. Under this warming scenario, Himalayan rivers fed by large glaciers descending through considerable elevation range will respond in a broadly similar manner, except that summer snowfall in the east will suppress the rate of initial flow increase, delay peak discharge and postpone eventual disappearance of the ice. Impacts of declining glacier area on river flow will be greater in smaller and more highly glacierized basins in both the west and east, and in the west, where precipitation is scarce, for considerable distances downstream. © Crown Copyright 2006.

Genotype may drive the partitioning of energy metabolism and predispose to site-specific adiposity, culminating in a state of energy imbalance. One candidate gene with a direct link to adiposity is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG) gene. PPARG is a cell nuclear receptor expressed almost exclusively in adipose tissue that regulates adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. PPARγ appears to be a key regulator of energy balance, with polymorphisms on the PPARG gene linked to obesity and effects on body composition. Our research has confirmed an association between the pro12ala allele and reduced incidence of obesity in pre-pubertal children and there are strong associations between genetic variation at the PPARG locus and percentage body fat. Moreover, our evidence suggests that PPARG C-681G and pro12ala polymorphisms display opposing effects in terms of growth phenotype, with pro12Ala associated with deficient energy utilisation, leading to reduced growth and the G-681 variant associated with accelerated growth compared with wildtypes. Common differences in this gene have also been associated with variations in body weight in response to dietary macronutrients. Preliminary evidence suggests that PPARG variants may even be involved in the control of short term energy compensation. Taken together these data suggest that the role of PPARG is varied and complex, influencing fat deposition and growth velocity early in life, with potential impact in the control of energy intake and appetite regulation, and could provide a key target for future research and anti-obesity agents. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents an experimental set-up to study the process employing a new approach of heterogeneous photocatalysis using pellet form of catalyst instead of immobilized catalysts on solid substrates. In the experiment, CO2 mixed with water vapour in saturation state was discharged into a quartz reactor containing porous TiO2 pellets and illuminated by various UV lamps of different wavelengths for 48 h continuously. The gaseous products extracted were identified using gas chromatography. The results confirmed that CO2 could be reformed in the presence of water vapour and TiO2 pellets into CH4 under continuous UV irradiation at room conditions. It showed that when UVC (253.7 nm) light was used, total yield of methane was approximately 200 ppm which was a fairly good reduction yield as compared to those obtained from the processes using immobilized catalysts through thin-film technique and anchoring method. CO and H2 were also detected. Switching from UVC to UVA (365 nm) resulted in significant decrease in the product yields.

We show that in a single atom there is no perfect CPT when the atomic transitions are affected by the thermal field. The perfect CPT may occur when only one of the two atomic transitions is affected by the thermal field. In the case when both atomic transitions are affected by the thermal field, we demonstrate that regardless of the intensity of the thermal field the destructive effect on the CPT can be circumvented by the collective behavior of the atoms. An analytic expression was obtained for the populations of the upper atomic levels which can be considered as a measure of the level of thermal decoherence. The results show that the collective interaction between the atoms can significantly enhance the population trapping in that the population of the upper state decreases with an increased number of atoms. The physical origin of this feature is explained by the semiclassical dressed-atom model of the system. We introduce the concept of multiatom collective coherent population trapping by demonstrating the existence of collective (entangled) states whose storage capacity is larger than that of the equivalent states of independent atoms. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,"Atomic physics; Electron energy levels; Ground state; Thermodynamic properties; Coherent population trapping; Coherent population trapping (CPT); Storage capacity; Thermal decoherence; Electron traps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745291022

However, to our knowledge, no systematic work has been done in this area so far.

The 0.6 mg animals were flown under tethered flight conditions in a flight simulator that allowed modulation of power production by employing an open-loop visual stimulation technique. At maximum locomotor capacity, flight muscles of Nasonia are capable to sustain 72.2 ± 18.3 W kg-1 muscle mechanical power at a chemo-mechanical conversion efficiency of approximately 9.8 ± 0.9%. Within the working range of the locomotor system, profile power requirement for flight dominates induced power requirement suggesting that the cost to overcome wing drag places the primary limit on overall flight performance. Since inertial power is only approximately 25% of the sum of induced and profile power requirements, Nasonia spp. may not benefit from elastic energy storage during wing deceleration phases. A comparison between wing size-polymorphic males revealed that wing size reduction is accompanied by a decrease in total flight muscle volume, muscle mass-specific mechanical power production, and total flight efficiency. In animals with small wings maximum total flight efficiency is below 0.5%. The aerodynamic and power estimates reported here for Nasonia are comparable to values reported previously for the fruit fly Drosophila flying under similar experimental conditions, while muscle efficiency of the tiny wasp is more at the lower end of values published for various other insects. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Ilmenite is an abundant mineral, and ferrotitanium alloys are among the earliest known hydrogen-storage materials. At present, industrial production of ferrotitanium alloys goes through separate extraction of individual metals, followed by a multistep arc-melting process. In particular, the extraction of titanium from ilmenite is highly energy intensive and tedious, accounting for titanium's high market price and restricted uses. This article reports the electrochemical synthesis of various ferrotitanium alloy powders directly from solid ilmenite in molten calcium chloride. More importantly, it demonstrates, for the first time, that such produced alloy powders can be used without further treatment for hydrogen storage and perform comparably with or better than similar products by means of other methods, but cost just a fraction. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Since the beginning of 1990s, our team in CEA has been working on the development of a method based on interrogation with high-energy photons to assay actinides in large concrete waste package. The method consists in using photons of high energy (bremsstrahlung radiation) in order to induce photofission reactions on the fissile nuclei present in the wastes. The measurement of the delayed neutrons emitted by fission products allows us to quantify the actinides present in the wastes. The accuracy of the method can be deeply improved by carrying out a tomography, i.e. computing the three-dimensional spatial distribution of the actinide mass inside the nuclear waste package. This paper presents the first experimental results of a tomography carried out on a 1.2 t real concrete waste package. Measurements associated with reconstruction algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations have allowed to locate an equivalent mass of 690 mg of uranium 238 centered in a disc of 20-25 cm of diameter at 75 cm height. These measurements have been performed in the SAPHIR irradiation facility at CEA/Saclay. This facility houses a pulsed linear electron accelerator (energy range from 15 to 30 MeV, pulse duration of 2.5 μs, peak current of 130 mA). The located mass has been subsequently confirmed by a destructive analysis of the package. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This is illustrated by ferroelectric 'relaxors' such as Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO 3 (PMN-PT; refs 5, 6): these materials exhibit a giant electromechanical (piezoelectric) response that is finding use in ultrasonic and medical applications, as well as in telecommunications. The origins of this effect are, however, still unclear. Here we show that the giant electromechanical response in PMN-PT (and potentially other ferroelectric relaxors) is the manifestation of critical points that define a line in the phase diagram of this system. Specifically, in the electric-field-temperature- composition phase diagram of PMN-PT (the composition being varied by changing the PT concentration), a first-order paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition terminates in a line of critical points where the piezoelectric coefficient is maximum. Above this line, supercritical evolution is observed. On approaching the critical point, both the energy cost and the electric field necessary to induce ferroelectric polarization rotations decrease significantly, thus explaining the giant electromechanical response of these relaxors. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Electric energy storage; Electric field effects; Ferroelectric devices; Polarization; Relaxation processes; Ultrasonic applications; Electromechanical response; Ferroelectric relaxors; Electromechanical devices; lead titanate; magnesium; niobium; titanium derivative; unclassified drug; electrical property; mechanical property; piezoelectricity; telecommunication; ultrasonics; article; electric field; electromechanical response; energy; ferroelectric relaxor; high temperature; materials; mechanics; phase transition; piezoelectricity; polarization; pressure; priority journal; rotation; temperature dependence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745567862

With this gargantuan quantities of different solid wastes in the form of mine refuse, coal fines, middlings and tailing from coal washeries pose multitude of handling, transportation, storage, disposal and environmental problems. Furthermore, the generation of solid waste is encountered at every stage of coal fuel cycle, right from mining through coal washing to different end uses of coal, especially combustion and carbonization. Today mankin d is trapped in a vicious cycle, both of increasing numbers and increasing wants. The result is increasing wastes and declining resources, making the situation unsustainable. There is indeed growing consciousness, in tune with the philosophy of converting waste into wealth. Zero Waste is a new vision for a new millennium. It is a goal, a process, a way of thinking that profoundly changes our approach to resources and production. Not only is Zero Waste about recycling and diversion from landfills, it also restructures production and distribution systems to prevent waste from being manufactured in the first place. What materials are still required in these redesigned, resource-efficient systems will be recycled right back into production. Today is a splendid time to put forward this large, generous, hopeful vision for our future. It is firm belief that Zero Waste is both feasible and required if we are to convert to a sustainable human culture for our shared planet Earth and beyond. In this paper a brief discussion has been made to adopt zero waste by utilizing all the waste and rejects generated by the production system of mining and its allied industries for various application and construction effectively with techno-economic possibility.

After extensive experimentation carried out particularly at synchrotron radiation (SR) facilities, the scientific community agrees that it is now time to translate these ideas towards the first clinical implementations. In this framework, a complete model, based on Fresnel/Kirchoff diffraction integrals, was devised. This model accounts for source dimensions, beam spectrum and divergence and detector point spread function (PSF), and can thus be applied to any x-ray imaging system. In particular, by accepting in input the above parameters along with the ones describing the sample, the model can be used to optimize the geometry of the set-up, i.e. to assess the source-to-sample and sample-to-detector distances which maximize feature detection. The model was evaluated by acquiring a range of images of different samples with a laboratory source, and a good agreement was found between simulated and experimental data in all cases. In order to maximize the generality of the results, all acquisitions were carried out using a polychromatic source and an energy-resolving detector; in this way, a range of monochromatic images could be obtained as well as polychromatic images, which can be created by integrating different parts of the acquired spectra. One of the most notable results obtained is that in many practical cases polychromatic PC imaging can provide the same image quality as its monochromatic counterpart. This is an important step in the wider application of PC using conventional sources. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Diffraction; Feature extraction; Optical transfer function; Optimization; Radiology; Synchrotron radiation; X ray analysis; Energy resolving detectors; Feature detection; Monochromatic images; Phase contrast (PC) imaging; X ray imaging system; Imaging systems; article; geometry; image quality; imaging system; mathematical model; prediction; priority journal; simulation; synchrotron radiation; validation process; X ray; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Biological; Refractometry; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; X-Ray Diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745085977

Permeable sand was placed in an 11.2-m-long chamber between the bulkheads. The chamber was first pressurized with water to 4 MPa to simulate the conditions likely to develop in the period following installation of seals in an actual repository. A stage of circulating hot water in the chamber began on 2002 September 24. The maximum design temperature of 85 °C at the interior face of the bulkheads could not be achieved in the time available. The actual maximum temperature was 65 °C. The purpose of heating was to investigate the thermohydromechanical responses in the bulkheads and surrounding rock to increased temperature. A passive cooling stage followed the heating stage. To help understand the influence of natural cooling on the thermohydromechanical response, a series of coupled thermohydromechanical modelling exercises was carried out using the finite element program, Model Of Transport In Fractured/porous media (MOTIF), and the results were compared with measured data.

The observed variation of the Fermi level position at the ITO surface with experimental conditions is accompanied by a large apparent variation of the core level to valence band maximum binding energy difference as a result of core-hole screening by the free carriers in the surface states.

We compared this bond to that formed between (Im)PorFe and other adsorbates, i.e., O2, NO and CO. The Im nitrogen does not exhibit back-bonding characteristics. This can be attributed to the longer bond length between the imidazole and the heme plane. The interactions with the two histidines are not strong enough to cause significant ruffle-type distortion on the porphyrin plane; on the other hand, the distance of the imidazole groups is limited by the electron repulsion between the hydrogen atoms of imidazole and the porphyrin plane. The resulting energy of the Im-PorFe bond is stronger but is in the same order as that of O2-PorFe.

Supercapacitors are able to store and deliver energy at relatively high rates (beyond those accessible with batteries) because the mechanism of energy storage is simple charge-separation (as in conventional capacitors). The vast increases in capacitance achieved by supercapacitors are due to the combination of: (i) an extremely small distance that separates the opposite charges, as defined by the electric double-layer; (ii) highly porous electrodes that embody very high surface-area. A variety of porous forms of carbon are currently preferred as the electrode materials because they have exceptionally high surface areas, relatively high electronic conductivity, and acceptable cost. The power and energy-storage capabilities of these devices are closely linked to the physical and chemical characteristics of the carbon electrodes. For example, increases in specific surface-area, obtained through activation of the carbon, generally lead to increased capacitance. Since only the electrolyte-wetted surface-area contributes to capacitance, the carbon processing is required to generate predominantly 'open' pores that are connected to the bulk pore network. While the supercapacitors available today perform well, it is generally agreed that there is considerable scope for improvement (e.g., improved performance at higher frequencies). Thus it is likely that carbon will continue to play a principal role in supercapacitor technology, mainly through further optimization of porosity, surface treatments to promote wettability, and reduced inter-particle contact resistance. © 2006.","Activated carbon; Capacitance; Porosity; Supercapacitor; surface-area; Ultracapacitor","Activated carbon; Capacitance; Capacitors; Electric resistance; Energy storage; Porosity; Electric double-layers; Supercapacitors; Surface-area; Ultracapacitors; Carbon",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646861617

The most stable configurations of the complexes have a linear geometry, while the t-shaped complexes are saddle points on the potential energy surface, opposite to what is observed for alkali cations. An electrostatic analysis conducted on the resulting adducts has highlighted the predominance of the electrostatic term in the complexation energy and, in particular, of the quadrupole- and dipole-polarizability dependent contributions. Another striking difference with respect to the positive ions, is the fact that although the binding energies have similar values (ranging between 25 and 3 kJmol for F- and I-, respectively), the vibrational shift of the ̃H-H and in general the perturbation of the hydrogen molecule in complexes are much greater in the complexes with anions (Δ ̃ H-H ranges between -720 and -65 cm-1). Another difference with respect to the interaction with cations is a larger charge transfer from the anion to the hydrogen molecule. The Δ ̃ is the result of the cooperative role of the electrostatics and of the charge transfer in the interaction. The correlation between binding energies and vibrational shift is far from linear, contrary to what is observed for cation complexes, in accordance with the higher polarizability and dynamic polarizability of the molecule along the molecular axis. The observed correlation may be valuable in the interpretation of spectra and thermodynamic properties of adsorbed H2 in storage materials. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",,"Binding energy; Complexation; Electrostatics; Hydrogen; Negative ions; Polarization; Positive ions; Potential energy; Thermodynamic properties; Binding energies; Cation complexes; Dihydrogen adducts; Dynamic polarizability; Halogen elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745137423

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the absence or constitutive physiological overexpression of UCP3 on whole body energy metabolism, glucose tolerance, and muscle triglyceride content. Congenic male UCP3 knockout mice (Ucp3 -/-), wild-type, and transgenic UCP3 overexpressing (UCP3Tg) mice were fed a 10% fat diet for 4 or 8 mo after they were weaned. UCP3Tg mice had lower body weights and were less metabolically efficient than wild-type or Ucp3-/- mice, but they were not hyperphagic. UCP3Tg mice had smaller epididymal white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue (BAT) depots; however, there were no differences in muscle weights. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests revealed that both UCP3Tg and Ucp3-/- mice were protected from development of impaired glucose tolerance and were more sensitive to insulin. 2-Deoxy-D-[1-3H]glucose tracer studies showed increased uptake of glucose into BAT and increased storage of liver glycogen in Ucp3-/- mice. Assessments of intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG) revealed decreases in quadriceps of UCP3Tg mice compared with wild-type and Ucp3-/- mice. When challenged with a 45% fat diet, Ucp3-/- mice showed increased accumulation of IMTG compared with wild-type mice, which in turn had greater IMTG than UCP3Tg mice. Results are consistent with a role for UCP3 in preventing accumulation of triglyceride in both adipose tissue and muscle.

In the ocean, they tend to dominate the phytoplankton assemblage under nutrient-rich conditions; whereas, in freshwater ecosystems, high turbulence and the combination of low temperature/high nutrients favour diatom blooming. Their fascinating biodiversity with approximately 10,000 species has been recently taxonomically revised giving evidence that the diatoms form two clades: the Coscinodiscophytina and the Bacillariophytina, the latter containing two subclades Bacillariophyceae and Mediophyceae; all the more this tremendous species diversity evolved during the last 250 Ma and there is likely no phylogenetic group in which the evolutionary rate has occurred faster (Medlin and Kaszmarska 2004). Therefore, the diatoms can be considered as one of the most successful taxonomic groups with respect to evolution and ecology. However, the genetic and physiological basis why diatoms became so ecologically successful is still a matter of debate. The recently published genome of Thalassiosira pseudonana (Armbrust et al. 2004) and the EST sequence data available from Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Maheswari et al. 2005) have opened new perspectives in diatom research to understand in more detail their physiological peculiarities. The metabolism in oxygenic phototrophs depends on gene expression processes coordinated between the three different compartments: the nucleus, the plastid, and the mitochondrion. Diatoms originate from a secondary endosymbiotic event (see Fig. 1) as opposed to the primary endosymbiotic origin of the ""Chloroplastida"" (Adl et al. 2005), including among others, the charophytes, chlorophytes and prasinophytes. There is convincing evidence that the ancestral diatom derived from a putatively non-photosynthetic eukaryote which domesticated a eukaryotic cell phylogenetically close to a red alga: this ""red line phylogenetics is clearly a work in progress"" (Palmer 2003) because we neither know the nature of the secondary host nor whether all ""chromophytes"" originate from one single endocytobiotic event (Patron et al. 2004). Gene analyses based on whole genome sequencing of T. pseudonana revealed that the diatom genome contains about 800 proteins which align with proteins of animals but do not have homologues in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana and the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae (Armbrust et al. 2004). This suggests that in diatoms the cytosolic metabolic pathways might be closely related to an animal-like rather than to a plant-like cell, which would likely affect the physiological regulation of photosynthesis. Considering the obligatory intracellular gene transfer in chromophytic phototrophs from the vanishing nucleus of the endosymbiont to the nucleus of the secondary host cell, various genes for proteins involved in photosynthesis had to be integrated into the new, more animal-like nucleus. Therefore, we would expect a different pattern in the nucleome-chondriome-plastome interaction with the consequence that metabolic pathways related to these compartments had been lost or that the respective genes had been transferred to the nucleus of the secondary endosymbiont. Therefore, the plastid had to develop a completely new interaction pattern with its genetic partners. To date, this regulatory network in diatoms is not yet understood. The stabilisation of a secondary endosymbiosis did not only require the development of protein targeting from the cytosol into the plastids crossing four membranes (Kilian and Kroth 2004), but also required a signal exchange in the reverse direction from the organelle to the nucleus. In the last few years it has been shown that in green plant cells photosynthesis-related nuclear genes are under chloroplast redox control by a new class of plastid signals (Goldschmidt-Clermont 1998). The sensor for this signal is the redox state of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool which depends on the relative activity of photosystems II and I (PS II and PS I). However, the redox state of the chloroplast does not only depend on the membrane-bound reactions, but also on the oxidative state of the stroma which is under the control of the antioxidative system via thioredoxin (TR), gluthathione, ascorbate, and their related metabolising enzymes. Although the biochemical nature of this retrograde signalling from the plastid to the nucleus is still not understood, the importance of this redox-controlled nuclear gene expression has recently been shown by Fey et al. (2005) demonstrating that this signal triggers the whole cellular network of gene expression. This retrograde plastid to nucleus signalling must be basically different in green algae and diatoms because of two reasons: first, the cooperating nuclei are of different phylogenetic origin, and second, the redox control in green algae and diatoms is found to be basically different as outlined below (see sections on ""Regulation of photosynthetic electron flow and the fate of photosynthetic electrons"" and ""Regulation of the enzyme activity in the Calvin cycle in diatoms""). However, we do not know what the consequences of the secondary endocytobiosis on the metabolic regulations were, nor whether the physiological peculiarities of diatoms observed in the past reflect this different host-endosymbiont relationship. In this review, we focus on cell functions which clearly separate the diatoms physiologically from algae of the chloroplastidic lineage. •The thylakoid membranes in diatoms are arranged in groups of three and are not differentiated into grana/stroma lamellae (Berkaloff et al. 1990; Owens 1988) having consequences not only for the PSII/PSI ratio and the regulation of the wavelength-dependent energy distribution between both PSs via so-called state 1-state 2 transitions, but also for the redox signalling (Owens 1986).•The light-harvesting proteins of diatoms are not differentiated into minor and major complexes and the protein domains which trigger membrane stacking in Chloroplastida by modulation of phosphorylation do not exist (Larkum and Vesk 2003; Westermann and Rhiel 2005).•In Chloroplastida, photoprotection is supported by cycling of xanthophylls bound to the minor antenna proteins in the presence of the PsbS protein. In diatoms, xanthophylls contribute even more to the photoprotection; however, in the genome of T. pseudonana, neither a psbS gene nor genes encoding for minor light-harvesting units could be identified.•Diatoms lack the α-carotene pathway with the consequence that photoprotective and light-harvesting pigments are synthesised on the same metabolic branch asking for sophisticated mechanisms of regulation (Lohr and Wilhelm 1999).•In contrast to Chloroplastida, metabolic activity in long dark periods leads to an enhanced reduction state of the PQ pool which is accompanied by the build-up of a proton gradient strong enough to drive the de-epoxidation reaction of xanthophyll cycle (XC) pigments (Jakob et al. 1999). Here again, the impact of unusual redox control of gene expression is obvious.•In chloroplasts of the Chloroplastida, photosynthetic CO2 fixation is regulated by light via the redox state of thiol groups. There is now evidence that in diatoms, the Calvin cycle is controlled by a different mechanism and that the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle (OPP) is not present (Michels et al. 2005).•It has been observed that inhibitory effects of a high concentration of oxygen/low concentration of CO2 on photosynthetic activity are less pronounced in diatoms than in green algae (Beardall 1989; McMinn et al. 2005). This has been discussed in the light of an active transport and accumulation of inorganic carbon within the cell (Beardall 1989) and the C4 fixation metabolism in diatoms (Reinfelder et al. 2004). However, some crucial plastid-localised enzymes being prerequisites in this metabolic pathway could not be identified in the diatom genome.•The metabolic carbon flow in diatom photorespiration is not yet elucidated. However, there is clear evidence that in diatoms, the photorespiratory carbon flux is not coupled to the nitrogen flux as in the typical carbon-oxidation cycle in green algae. Surprisingly, the genome analysis of T. pseudonana revealed that in contrast to green phototrophs, the diatoms possess a complete set of genes for a functional urea cycle (Armbrust et al. 2004). In this context, it might be noteworthy that the genes encoding the enzymes for ß-oxidation and catalase were found in the genome (Armbrust et al. 2004); however, it is not yet clear whether this pathway is located in the peroxisome.•Diatoms synthesise lipids and the ß-1,3 glucan chrysolaminarin as energy storage products. In contrast to starch, this polymer does not form crystals. In green algae, the carbon storage product starch induces cell sinking; whereas in diatoms, the storage product lipid can increase the cell′s buoyancy.•Several in situ iron fertilisation experiments have demonstrated that diatoms can survive even in areas that are severely iron limited (e.g. high nutrient low carbon [HNLC] regions), and have the potential to form large blooms upon relief of the iron limitation (Boyd et al. 2000). This response can in part be explained by the plasticity of the Fe:C ratio in diatoms, possibly achieved by changes in the stoichiometry of photosynthetic proteins and the replacement of ferredoxin by flavodoxin (LaRoche et al. 1996; Strzepek and Harrison 2004).",,"algae; Animalia; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Bacillariophyceae; Bacillariophyta; Characeae; Chlorophyta; Chromophyta; Cyanidioschyzon merolae; Eukaryota; Phaeodactylum tricornutum; Prasinophyceae; Rhodophyta; Thalassiosira pseudonana; Viridiplantae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747415749

It was found that the photoluminescence (PL) intensities of the coupled system irradiated with an electron dose of 1015 cm-2 and energy of 0.5 MeV more than doubled compared to the untreated materials and then the intensities diminished with storage time in air. After 13 days, the PL intensities reached stable values that were higher than those observed from the untreated sample. Spectral analysis and ultraviolet ozone irradiation experiments on the coupled systems suggest that the formation of self-trapped excitons at the surfaces of the silicon nanocrystals with a higher density is responsible for the enhanced blue PL.

The enthalpy changes of possible reactions between Ti and NaAlH4 were calculated. The Ti substitution for Al or Na in NaAlH4 was found to be unfavorable, while the formation of TiAl3 was favorable thermodynamically. It is theoretically expected that the Ti substitution for Na and Al in NaAlH4 caused the lattice parameter to decrease, which contradicts the experimental observation that the lattice parameter did not significantly change by adding Ti.

Contrary to conventional treatments, betatron acceleration terms appear in both the energy and phase equations. We derive one-turn difference equations in the linear and adiabatic approximations. By a smooth approximation instead of the traveling-wave approximation, and by combining the two equations, we obtain a differential equation where the betatron acceleration terms are canceled.

Therefore, animals cannot 'have it all' - combine high rates of fecundity with extended lifespans. The idea of life-history trade-offs was recently challenged by the discovery that ageing may be governed by a small subset of molecular processes independent of fitness. We tested the 'trade-off' and 'having it all' theories by examining the fecundities of C57BL/6J mice placed onto four different dietary treatments that generated caloric intakes from -21 to + 8.6% of controls. We predicted body fat would be deposited in relation to caloric intake. Excessive body fat is known to cause co-morbidities that shorten lifespan, while caloric restriction enhances somatic protection and increases longevity. The trade-off model predicts that increased fat would be tolerated because reproductive gain offsets shortened longevity, while animals on a restricted intake would sacrifice reproduction for lifespan extension. The responses of body fat to treatments followed our expectations, however, there was a negative relationship between reproductive performance (fecundity, litter mass) and historical intake/body fat. Our dietary restricted animals had lower protein oxidative damage and appeared able to combine life-history traits in a manner contrary to traditional expectations by having increased fecundity with the potential to have extended lifespans. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Life history; Oxidative stress; Resource allocation; Trade-off","fat; fecundity; fitness; life history theory; life history trait; longevity; nutrient limitation; oxidation; protein; resource allocation; rodent; trade-off; aging; animal experiment; article; body fat; caloric intake; controlled study; diet restriction; female; fertility; lifespan; lipid storage; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; weaning; animal; body weight; chemistry; liver; longevity; physiology; protein carbonylation; skeletal muscle; Animalia; Mus; Animals; Body Weight; Energy Intake; Female; Fertility; Liver; Longevity; Mice; Muscle, Skeletal; Protein Carbonylation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746199892

The test results show that the effective storage time of raw NR can be estimated more conveniently in relatively shorter time by this method. It is found that the effective storage time of raw NR is associated with rubber processing technology and with ambient temperature during storage, but it has little relation with P0, and PRI. At ambient temperature, the effective storage time of the natural-coagulated and biological-coagulated NR is obviously higher than the acetic acid-coagulated NR; the lower the ambient temperature, the longer the effective storage time. The effective storage time of the acetic acid-coagulated NR is 12.2-13.4 years at ambient temperature of 30°C, 23.8-25 years at 25°C, and 47.4-47.9 years at 20°C.

Thermal storage plays an important role in building energy conservation, which is greatly assisted by the incorporation of latent heat storage in building products. Latent heat storage in a phase change material (PCM) is very attractive because of its high storage density with small temperature swing. It has been demonstrated that for the development of a latent heat storage system (LHTS) in a building fabric, the choice of the PCM plays an important role in addition to heat transfer mechanism in the PCM. Thermal energy storage in the walls, ceiling and floor of buildings may be enhanced by encapsulating or embedding suitable phase change materials (PCMs) within these surfaces. They can either capture solar energy directly or thermal energy through natural convection. Increasing the thermal storage capacity of a building can increase human comfort by decreasing the frequency of internal air temperature swings so that the indoor air temperature is closer to the desired temperature for a longer period of time. This paper aims to submit the information on the developments of PCM incorporation in buildings for energy saving, the problems associated with the selection of phase change material and the various methods used to contain them for space heating and cooling applications.","Building energy conservation; Encapsulation; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Phase change material; Space heating and space cooling","Air temperature; Building energy conservation; Cooling applications; Energy saving; Heat transfer mechanism; High storage density; Human comforts; In-buildings; Indoor air temperature; Latent heat storage system; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Temperature swings; Thermal storage; Atmospheric temperature; Buildings; Cooling; Encapsulation; Energy conservation; Flywheels; Heat storage; Heating; Historic preservation; Latent heat; Phase space methods; Solar energy; Space heating; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951686805

NiCd batteries are not very energy-dense, but they are inexpensive, lightweight, and extensively proven [1]. This paper describes the development of a simulation electrical and thermal model for a sealed rechargeable NiCd battery. Based on the concept of this battery type, a mathematical description of the various electrochemical and thermal processes occurring inside the battery can be given. A family of curves was introduced as a result of the modelling and simulation work in this paper. Some of these curves are verified with an experimental work results. The validation phases and the dynamics of the battery parameters convergence are extremely high and acceptable. The electrical and thermal properties are shown. One aim of the present research is to study the thermal behavior of a NiCd battery for space applications. After a description of the effect of temperature on NiCd cell electrical properties, a thermal model has been developed to calculate the temperature profile in a NiCd cell stack during charging and discharging processes during ground testing. The equations describing the temperature distribution of the cell stack are derived and then the temperature results are presented. Finally, the calculated temperatures are compared to those measured during ground testing. When selecting batteries for space flight applications, the following requirements should be considered: amperehour capacity, recharge-ability, depth of discharge (DOD), lifetime, temperature environments, ruggedness, and weight. Many batteries have been qualified and used for space flight, enhancing the ease of selecting the right battery.","Microsatellite; Modelling and simulation; NiCd batteries; Storage subsystem","Charging (batteries); Computer simulation; Electrochemistry; Mathematical models; Space applications; Temperature distribution; Temperature measurement; Thermodynamic properties; Amperehour capacity; Depth of discharge; Microsatellite; Storage subsystem; Nickel cadmium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751563841

The maximum composition ratio of all fatty acids in the shape-stabilized PCMs has been found as 50 wt% in which no leakage of fatty acid is observed over their melting temperatures for several heating cycles. The miscibility of fatty acids with the PVC and the interaction between the blend components which is responsible for the miscibility has been proved by microscopic investigation and Infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The melting temperature and the latent heat of fusion of the shape-stabilized PCMs are measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis method. The melting temperatures and latent heats of the shape-stabilized PVC/LA, PVC/MA, PVC/PA and PVC/SA (50/50 wt%) PCMs are determined as 38.8, 49.2, 54.4 and 64.7°C and 97.8, 103.2, 120.3 and 129.3 J/g, respectively.

We observe that oxygen plasma treatment improves the stoichiometry of the surface and enhances ITO wetting, so as to improve the surface properties of ITO substrates. With the increment of storage time, however, the improved ITO surface properties tend to decay and the surface energy decreases. Furthermore, we studied the effect of aging variation of surface properties of treated ITO substrates on the performance of OLEDs, in terms of driving voltage, luminance, and efficiency.

However, sustainability and limited life cycles of batteries are often inhibiting factors. This paper presents a hybrid energy storage system with high life cycle, which is mainly based on compressed air, where the storage and discharge are done within maximum efficiency conditions. As the maximum efficiency conditions impose the level of converted power, an intermittent time-modulated operation mode is applied to the thermodynamic converter to obtain a variable converted mean power. A smoothly variable output power is achieved with the help of a supercapacitive auxiliary storage device used as a filter. This paper describes the concept of the system, the power-electronic interface circuits, and especially the maximum efficiency point tracking (MEPT) algorithm and the strategy used to vary the output power. In addition, this paper presents the characteristics of high-efficiency storage systems where the pneumatic machine is replaced by an oil-hydraulic and pneumatic converter, which is used under isothermal conditions.

It plays an important role in the energy metabolism of many tissues. Iron acts as a co-factor for the synthesis of carnitine. However, the importance of iron deficiency as a cause of secondary carnitine deficiency is not well established. The aim of this study was to investigate the serum levels of carnitine in children with iron-deficiency anemia compared to those of healthy children and to determine if serum carnitine levels in with or without pica differ. The mean serum carnitine concentration in the iron-deficiency group was significantly lower than that in healthy children (12.44 ± 5.09 and 32.48 ± 7.92 μmol/L, respectively, p < .001). In the iron-deficient group, serum carnitine levels, ferritin levels, and other hematological parameters were lowest in patients with pica (p < .001). Pearson correlation test indicated a positive correlation between serum carnitine and ferritin levels in iron-deficient patients. Based on the evidence about the effect of low iron on carnitine stores in animal studies, the authors propose that low serum carnitine levels in these children may be secondary to iron-deficiency anemia. However, further large-scale studies are needed to establish the frequency of carnitine deficiency in children with iron-deficiency anemia.

Therefore, huge efforts are being currently devoted in studying new types of hypoenergetic diets and their composition, in order to characterise more specific, long-lasting and safe slimming protocols. A number of investigations are trying to determine the specific influence of the macronutrient distribution in energy-restricted diets on the management of excessive body weight. In this context, very-low-energy diets supplying between 1670 and 3350 kJ (400 and 800 kcal)/d have been beneficial in short-term treatments causing a weight loss of 300-500 g/d. Such strategies place more emphasis on energy restriction than on the macronutrient composition of the diet prescription. Weight loss produced by either low-carbohydrate or low-fat moderately energy-restricted diets ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 kg/week, while diets with high or moderately high protein content have also been applied in weight-reducing programmes by inducing losses of 0.2-0.4 kg/week. Other factors that determine weight loss by dieting are sex, age, initial body weight, race, genetics, regional fat deposition, etc, which must be taken into account to explain the variability in the outcomes of different low-energy diets. Therefore, more research is needed about the impact of diets with different fuel substrates and foods on the characteristics of the weight-loss process. © The Authors 2006.","Energy-restricted diets; Low-carbohydrate diets; Low-fat diets; Macronutrient distribution; Obesity; Weight loss","carbohydrate; protein; age; caloric intake; carbohydrate diet; diet restriction; diet therapy; dietary intake; energy consumption; energy metabolism; fat intake; gender; genetics; health program; human; lipid diet; lipid storage; low fat diet; macronutrient; nutritional assessment; obesity; outcome assessment; protein content; protein diet; race; review; safety; weight gain; weight reduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746825135

The objective of this work is to discuss the concept of a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) incorporated into a back-to-back interconnection. In this case, the back-to-back system is used as a power conditioning system for the SMES coils. Since the AC/DC converter can be designed independently of the frequency of the power system, a two-way switch is connected to the AC side of each converter. This two-way switch can select the interconnected power system. By using the two-way switches, this system can increase the availability factor of the back-to-back interconnection during the SMES operations and also enables the flexible power interchange between interconnected power networks with an optimal time interval for the power demand of each interconnected power network. This work discusses the design considerations of the back-to-back interconnection with the SMES that enables the replacement of a pumped hydro storage. In this case, the SMES system is composed of a number of superconducting coils in order to decrease the risk of the superconducting coil constructions by the effect of mass production. In this work, the SMES coils are optimized from the required mass of the structure and the leakage magnetic field. © 2006 IEEE.","Back-to-back; Electromagnetic force; Helical coil; Power interconnection; SMES","Back-to-back; Electromagnetic force; Helical coil; Power conditioning system; Power interconnection; SMES; Electric coils; Energy storage; Frequencies; Magnetic fields; Superconducting devices; Electric power system interconnection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746648185

In such applications, the Bi-2223 tape carries time varying transport current and in addition experiences time varying external magnetic field. It is well known that the external magnetic field not only causes magnetization loss in the Bi-2223 tape, but also drastically increases transport loss due to a so-called ""dynamic resistance"". We developed an evaluation setup, which can measure transport loss in an external AC magnetic field. Using this equipment, we measured the dynamic resistances for various amplitudes and frequencies of external AC magnetic field perpendicular to the face in the tape. Simultaneously we investigated the effect of external AC field on transport loss with different experimental conditions.

A shunt active power filter, with a current-source PWM inverter and a conventional copper inductor as its energy storage, has a significant power loss. The power loss in this copper inductor can be substantially reduced by replacing the inductor with a high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnet. Several solenoid design alternatives using silver-sheathed BSCCO-2223 tape have been made for the HTS magnet that has an inductance of 0.5 H for this application. A liquid-nitrogen-cooled HTS magnet has been built and tested for use in an active power filter.

The shielding coil system is consisted of a main superconducting coil and a normal conducting shielding coil connected in parallel. If a mutual inductance between them is equal to a self inductance of the latter, fluctuated current at energy transfer is diverted to the shielding coil and constant current flows in the main superconducting coil. In addition to the above inductance condition, to work the shielding operation completely, it is necessary to compensate the voltage decent due to the normal resistance of the shielding coil. We have been studying about the compensation system for the voltage decent in the shielding coil and have made an experimental shielding coil system to verify the operation of the voltage compensator.

The accelerator complex is composed of a 600 MeV linac, a 3 GeV rapid cycling synchrotron, and a 50 GeV main synchrotron. In Phase I, the main synchrotron will be operated at energy of 40 GeV with pulse operation. The proton energy is to be increased up to 50 GeV in Phase II, and a large amount of pulse electric power, which is + 115 MW and -55 MW peak-to-peak with 3.4-second repetition, will be demanded. Such large pulse power will give un-allowed disturbances to the power network. Some means will be required for compensating the pulse electric power and reducing the disturbances.

The prototype coil has demonstrated excellent thermal characteristics during cooling and exciting tests. In this paper, measurements of the temperature in the coil during experiments and thermal analysis by using two-dimensional finite element methods were compared to clarify the high heat transfer properties of this prototype coil. This coil was wound with a NbTi/Cu Rutherford cable, which is extruded with aluminum. In order to realize the conduction cooled LTS pulse coil, FRP with polyethylene fibers (Dyneema FRP) and Litz wires were used as spacers. Dyneema FRP improves the heat transfer from layer to layer in the windings. Litz wires increase the heat transfer from turn to turn in the windings and enable conduction cooling of the coil by attaching the end of the Litz wires directly to the cold heads of the cryocoolers. It was clarified that these spacers were very effective and the coil has a large stability margin in terms of the design values. © 2006 IEEE.","AC loss; Conduction cooling; SMES; Stability","Electric cables; Energy storage; Heat transfer; Polyethylenes; Stability; Uninterruptible power systems; AC loss; Conduction cooling; Cryocoolers; SMES; Electric coils",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746590805

In this work, the design considerations for the SMES systems using MgB 2 and/or HTS coils have been discussed.

Attempts to modify the egg's fat component have tended to focus on the means by which the cholesterol level in the egg may be reduced or the ratio of n-3 to n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) manipulated. The cholesterol content of the egg has been lowered by either reducing the mass of the yolk relative to the egg (i.e. a non-specific reduction) or by using feed additives such as beta-cyclodextrin that have a specific effect on the cholesterol content of the yolk. The ratio of n-3:n-6 PUFAs in the diet is important not only because of their role in energy metabolism and biological membranes but because they affect eicosanoid metabolism, gene expression and intercellular communication. Eggs produced from hens receiving conventional feeds tend to be relatively high in n-6 PUFA but dietary manipulation can be used to either increase the amount of the n-3 PUFAs directly (using fish oil) or indirectly by increasing the levels of the precursor n-3 PUFA by feeding alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in the form of linseeds, flaxseeds or similar. Of particular interest is the n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The relatively high degree of unsaturation makes this PUFA susceptible to oxidation during storage and cooking but this can be resolved, at least in part, by enriching the egg yolk with antioxidants such as vitamin E. Apart from reducing the rate of PUFA oxidation, enriching the level of antioxidant in the egg can also enhance levels of antioxidants in the consumer. The effect on the consumer of consuming modified and conventional eggs is considered. © World's Poultry Science Association 2006.","Antioxidants; Cholesterol; Enriched eggs; n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; Selenium",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746268439

A simple current-balance control method via DC current feedback is presented here to implement the current-balance control between different levels.

Depth-dose measurements in a water phantom were carried out with a radiation survey meter in the bremsstrahlung photon radiation fields from a 450 MeV electron storage ring to find out the magnitude of the underestimation. Dose equivalent indicated by the survey meter was found to build up with increase in thickness of water placed in front of the meter up to certain depth and then reduce with further increase in thickness. A dose equivalent build up factor was estimated from the measurements. An absorbed dose build up factor in a water phantom was also estimated from calculations performed using the Monte Carlo codes, EGS-4 and EGSnrc. The calculations are found to be in very good agreement with the measurements.

Recombinant Escherichia coli harboring the heterologous P(3HB) biosynthesis genes accumulates large amounts of P(3HB) granules, yet the granule-associated proteins have not been identified. Therefore, this study reports on an analysis of the P(3HB) granule-associated proteome in recombinant E. coli. Five proteins out of 7 spots identified were found to be involved in functions of translation, heat-stress responses, and P(3HB) biosynthesis. Two of the major granule-associated proteins, IbpA/B, which are already known to bind to recombinant proteins forming inclusion bodies in E. coli, were further analyzed. Immunoblotting and immunoelectron microscopic studies with IbpA/B antibodies clearly demonstrated the binding and localization of IbpA/B to P(3HB) granules. IbpA/B seemed to play an important role in recombinant E. coli producing P(3HB) by stabilizing the interface between the hydrophobic P(3HB) granules and the hydrophilic cytoplasm. Thus, IbpA/B were found to act like phasins in recombinant E. coli, as they are the major proteins bound to the P(3HB) granules, affect the morphology of the granules, and reduce the amount of cytosolic proteins bound to the P(3HB) granules. © The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.","Escherichia coli; IbpA/B; P(3HB); P(3HB) granule-associated proteome; Small heat-shock proteins","bacterial protein; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); protein ibpA; protein ibpB; proteome; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; biosynthesis; cytoplasm; Escherichia coli; heat stress; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; immunoelectron microscopy; in vivo study; morphology; nonhuman; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; polymerase chain reaction; protein analysis; protein binding; protein function; protein localization; translation regulation; Western blotting; Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745625630

Two wheat cultivars (Abbott and Equinox) were grown using the same crop husbandry conditions. Batches of each cultivar were stored at ambient temperature (AT) for 0, 6, 12, 18 or 24 weeks. Those stored at AT for less than 24 weeks were then stored at -20°C up to the end of the storage period. The 24 week (AT) samples were divided into two lots and one lot was frozen to -20°C for 24 h. 2. Each of the 12 wheat samples was included (650 g/kg) in a nutritionally complete diet and fed to broiler chickens from 7 to 21 d of age. The apparent metabolisable energy (AME) of each sample was determined using a rapid bioassay with adult cockerels. 3. The Equinox cultivar sample had a high proportion (92/1000) of visibly sprouted grains and had a low Hagberg falling number (high amylase activity) and high content of free sugars compared to the Abbott sample. There were no major changes in dry matter, free sugar content, water extract viscosity or Hagberg falling number due to the different times of ambient storage of either of the two wheat cultivar samples. 4. The chickens fed on the Abbott cultivar wheat had a greater weight gain, although there were no differences in the determined AME of the two wheat cultivars. 5. The Abbott sample stored at ambient temperature for 6 weeks had a greater AME than the sample given no ambient storage and the samples given 18 and 24 weeks ambient storage. There were no significant differences between the Equinox cultivar samples. There were no effects of storage time on the growth performance of the broiler chickens. 6. The AME of the unfrozen Abbott cultivar was greater than the frozen (for 24 h) sample but there was no effect on broiler growth performance. This study suggests that, in some wheat samples, there may be a benefit in avoiding freezing during storage. © 2006 British Poultry Science Ltd.",,"animal; animal food; article; chicken; diet; evaluation; metabolism; nutritional value; physiology; temperature; time; weight gain; wheat; Animal Feed; Animal Nutrition Physiology; Animals; Chickens; Diet; Nutritive Value; Temperature; Time Factors; Triticum; Weight Gain; Gallus gallus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745625107

Of particular interest is the change in the reactivity of the fuel as a function of burnup and the capability of modern codes to predict this change. In addition, the neutron emission from burnt fuel has important implications for the design of transport and storage facilities. Measurements have been made of the reactivity effects and the neutron emission rates of highly burnt uranium oxide and mixed oxide fuel rod samples coming from a pressurised water reactor (PWR). The reactivity measurements have been made in a PWR lattice in the PROTEUS zero-energy reactor moderated in turn with: water, a water and heavy water mixture and water containing boron. A combined transport flask and sample changer was used to insert the 400 mm long burnt fuel rod segments into the reactor. Both control rod compensation and reactor period methods were used to determine the reactivities of the samples. For the range of burnup values investigated, an interesting exponential relationship has been found between the neutron emission rate and the measured reactivity. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, the lactate increase normalized to the mechanical energy production in NIFET was suggested to have a intermediate sensitivity and satisfactory specifity for the screening of mitochondrial disorders. Methods: NIFET at 80% maximal contraction force (MCF) was performed in normal controls (n = 41), patients with mitochondrial disorders (n = 15) and other myopathies (diseased controls, n = 20). 26 healthy volunteers also underwent IFET at 80% MCF. The ratio of lactate increase and workload was defined as specific lactate production (mmol x s/N x l). Results: In normal controls there was no significant different lactate increase during NIFET and IFET. The workload performed showed only a weak significant positive correlation with the lactate increase in the NIFET in normal controls (r 2 = 0.20) but not in IFET and NIFET with patients. A moderate negative correlation of specific lactate production and the absolute workload was found in all groups and in both protocols (r2 = 0.22-0.34). The specific lactate production was highest in patients with other myopathies, intermediate in patients with mitochondrial disorders and lowest in normal controls. NIFET showed a sensitivity of only 20 % and a specifity of 95% for normal controls, but only 75 % for diseased controls. Conclusion: The specific lactate production during NIFET is neither sufficently specific nor sensitive for the diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders. Increased specific lactate production during rest-to-work transition period might be caused by increased acetyl group deficits.","Mitochondrial myopathy; Nonischemic/ischemic forearm exercise test; Serum lactate","lactic acid; adolescent; adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic procedure; diagnostic value; disorders of mitochondrial functions; energy yield; exercise test; female; glycogen storage disease type 5; human; ischemic forearm exercise test; male; muscle contraction; muscle force; myopathy; non ischemic forearm exercise test; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; weight bearing; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Analysis of Variance; Exercise; Exercise Test; Female; Forearm; Humans; Lactic Acid; Male; Middle Aged; Mitochondrial Diseases; Muscular Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745556929

In addition, leptin also has direct effects on peripheral cell types involved in regulation of diverse body functions including immune response, bone formation and reproduction. Previous studies have demonstrated the important role of SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signalling 3) in leptin physiology. Here, we show that CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2 protein) and SOCS2 can also interact with the leptin receptor. Using MAPPIT (mammalian protein-protein interaction trap), a cytokine receptor-based two-hybrid method operating in intact cells, we show specific binding of CIS with the conserved Y985 and Y1077 motifs in the cytosolic domain of the leptin receptor. SOCS2 only interacts with the Y1077 motif, but with higher binding affinity and can interfere with CIS and STAT5a prey recruitment at this site. Furthermore, although SOCS2 does not associate with Y985 of the leptin receptor, we find that SOCS2 can block interaction of CIS with this position. This unexpected interference can be explained by the direct binding of SOCS2 on the CIS SOCS box, whereby elongin B/C recruitment is crucial to suppress CIS activity.","Cross-regulation; Leptin receptor; Signalling; SOCS proteins","cell protein; cytokine inducible SH2 protein; cytokine receptor; elongin BC; leptin receptor; STAT5a protein; suppressor of cytokine signaling; suppressor of cytokine signaling 2; unclassified drug; article; binding affinity; controlled study; cytosol; human; human cell; priority journal; protein binding; protein domain; protein motif; protein protein interaction; two hybrid system; Animals; Cell Line; Cells, Cultured; Gene Transfer Techniques; Humans; Mice; Models, Biological; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Mapping; Receptors, Cell Surface; Receptors, Leptin; Signal Transduction; STAT5 Transcription Factor; Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745510082

Different Si/Al loadings (1/1, 3/1, 5/1, and 11/1) were considered, and for each of them the most stable aluminum distribution and location of the acidic proton, needed as charge balancer, were identified. With the optimal structures, the energy of formation and the anharmonic O-H stretching frequency were calculated with the latter being in good agreement with the experimental data. The B3LYP optimal position of H2 physisorbed at the acidic Brönsted sites of chabazite (Si/Al = 11/1 and 5/1) brings about an interaction energy definitely smaller than that derived from infrared spectroscopy, because of the known deficiencies of this functional to cope with dispersive interactions. The latter was included by means of an ONIOM-like procedure that combines periodic B3LYP energy with results at the MP2 level on selected clusters cut out of the chabazite framework. Adsorption of two H2 molecules for Si/Al = 5/1 chabazite showed a complete independence of each Brönsted site, and neither through-space nor infrastructure polarization effects are present. Within the periodic B3LYP approach shifts in both O-H and H-H anharmonic frequencies were also computed and compared with unperturbed values and with the available experimental results. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Chemical bonds; Hydrogen; Infrared spectroscopy; Polarization; Protons; Acidic chabazite; Dihydrogen storage; Stretching frequency; Aluminum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745436187

Although tail autotomy can increase the likelihood of surviving a predatory encounter, it may entail subsequent costs, including reduced growth, loss of energy stores, a reduction in reproductive output, loss of social status and a decreased probability of survival during subsequent encounters with predators. To date, few studies have investigated the potential fitness costs of tail autotomy in natural populations. I investigated whether tail loss influenced survival, growth and territory occupation of juvenile velvet geckos Oedura lesueurii in a population where predatory snakes were common. During the 3-year mark-recapture study, 32% of juveniles voluntarily autotomized their tails when first captured. Analysis of survival using the program mark showed that voluntary tail autotomy did not influence the subsequent survival of juvenile geckos. Survival was age-dependent and was higher in 1-year-old animals (0.98) than in hatchlings (0.76), whereas recapture probabilities were time-dependent. Growth rates of tailed and tailless juveniles were very similar, but tailless geckos had slow rates of tail regeneration (0.14 mm day-1). Tail autotomy did not influence rock usage by geckos, and both tailed and tailless juveniles used few rocks as diurnal retreat sites (means of 1.64 and 1.47 rocks, respectively) and spent long time periods (85 and 82 days) under the same rocks. Site fidelity may confer survival advantages to juveniles in populations sympatric with ambush foraging snakes. My results show that two potential fitness costs of tail autotomy - decreased growth rates and a lower probability of survival - did not occur in juveniles from this population. However, compared with juveniles, significantly fewer adult geckos (17%) voluntarily autotomized their tails during capture. Because adults possess large tails that are used for lipid storage, the energetic costs of tail autotomy are likely to be much higher in adult than in juvenile O. lesueurii. © 2006 Ecological Society of Australia.","Cost; Fitness; Lizard; Mark-recapture; Predation","antipredator defense; autotomy; growth; lizard; survival; territory; Animalia; Gekkonidae; Oedura lesueurii; Serpentes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745119779

It is poorly understood why rodents creating long-term reserves, especially those in the tropics, incorporate seeds from plant species that germinate rapidly and hence seem unsuitable for long-term storage. We carried out a series of experiments to understand why red acouchies (Myoprocta exilis) scatter-hoard Carapa procera (Meliaceae) seeds, which lack dormancy and germinate rapidly. Hypotheses tested were: (1) even germinated seeds are still significant long-term energy reserves for acouchies, (2) acouchies use the seeds only as short-term supplies, and (3) acouchies manipulate the seeds to slow down germination. The first two hypotheses were not supported; seed reserves were rapidly depleted during experimental planting, and acouchies did use seeds for long-term storage. We did find support for the third hypothesis. Acouchies intervened in germination by removing the protruding radicle and epicotyl after which they re-cached seeds. Pruning stopped further seedling development, yet the pruned seeds did not decay. The cotyledons apparently stayed alive and physiologically active as ""zombie seeds"" that only formed undifferentiated calli. Pruned seeds were suitable for long-term storage, with negligible loss of endosperm over time. Pruning was most effective after sprouting of the epicotyl, and germinating seeds were most susceptible to pruning during two weeks upon emergence. Acouchies actively managed their food supplies and must continuously survey for germinating seeds to timely intervene in seed reserve depletion, within the brief period of seedling emergence. We suggest that the trees use the rodents to achieve seed dispersal, and gain from imperfect intervention in germination by the rodents. Because scatter-hoarding rodents and large-seeded plant species with similar germination co-occur in tropical forests world-wide, it is plausible that the phenomenon of seed pruning to preserve seeds is more general than currently appreciated.

For the logic operation, they have estimated the power and the speed for inverter gates with a fan out = 3. They find that the optimum Vdd is very sensitive to switching activity in addition to the operation frequency. They propose to integrate two sets of transistors having different Vdds on a chip. In portions of the chip with high frequency or high switching activity, the use of H transistors in which Vdd and Vth are moderately scaled is helpful. On the other hand, in low switching activity blocks or relatively low frequency portions, the use of L transistors in which Vdd should be kept around 1-1.2 V is advantageous. A combination of H and L is beneficial to suppress power consumption in the future. They have investigated the yield of SRAM arrays to study the optimum Vdd for SRAM operation. In high-density SRAM, low Vth causes yield loss and an area penalty because of low static noise margin and high bit leakage especially at high temperature operation.

The two plasmids were inserted into Bacillus subtilis DB104 and generated Bacillus subtilis/pBE2C1 and Bacillus subtilis/pBE2C1AB. The two recombinant strains were subjected to fermentation and showed PHA accumulation, the first reported example of medium-chain-length-PHA production in Bacillus subtilis. GC analysis identified the compound produced by Bacillus subtilis/pBE2C1 was a hydroxydecanoate-co-hydroxydodecanoate (HD-co-HDD) polymer while that produced by Bacillus subtilis/pBE2C1AB was a hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxydecanoate-co- hydroxydodecanoate (HB-HD-HDD) polymer.

The basic idea of the compensation procedure stems from the condition for the minimum rms value of line currents. The application of optimization procedure, observing the above criterion, results in the required compensator. Three different compensators are derived: total non-active power compensator, compensator without energy storage, and reactive compensator. The paper introduces the factors which define the amount of active power in total power before and after the non-active power compensation. The compensation procedure is valid for single-phase and polyphase systems.

A battery simulation model that was developed for this purpose is presented in the paper. The model takes into account the battery voltage dependency on the capacity and current, and is based on the performed battery measurements at constant discharging currents.

The PSL arises from orthorhombic BaCl2 nanocrystallites in the glass ceramics, which also contain a PSL-inactive phase of cubic BaCl2. The relative PSL efficiency of the glass ceramics has a strong dependence on gamma energy, which correlates with relative half-thickness.

In static analyses, the current-voltage (I-V) curves showed the hysteresis characteristics. For CNT, diameters (Dcnt) were below 2 nm, turn-on voltages almost linearly increased with the increasing of the depth (H) of the trench for the separation between the suspended CNT and the gate surface. As Dcnt increased above 2 nm, turn-on and turn-off voltages nonlinearly increased with the increasing of H. For Dcnt {greater than or slanted equal to}2 nm, as H increased, the ranges of the hysteresis regions in the I-V curves decreased. Nonvolatility of the NRAMs could be increased by small Dcnt and small H. Dcnt, the suspended length (Lcnt), and H of the CNT should be carefully considered to operate NRAMs as the nonvolatile memory devices. Structural conditions for the nonvolatile NRAMs were summarized by Dcnt:H:Lcnt=1-2:5-15:100. Dynamic analyses showed that CNTs with small diameters were effective to operate the NRAMs with low turn-on voltages and high throughput rates. Although the static analyses of the NRAMs showed the nonvolatility, the dynamic analyses of the NRAMs did not show the nonvolatility because of the thermal fluctuation and the CNT-gate binding energy when the magnitudes of the turn-off voltage were less then 0.2 V. © 2006.","Carbon nanotube; Nanoelectromechanical memory; NEMS; NRAM","Binding energy; Current voltage characteristics; Hysteresis; Nanostructured materials; Nonvolatile storage; Random access storage; Throughput; Nanoelectromechanical memory (NEM); Nanotube random access memory (NRAM); Nonvolatile memory devices; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646909418

Ranking of biomass collection systems is based on cost of delivered biomass, quality of biomass supplied, emissions during collection, energy input to the chain operations, and maturity of supply system technologies. The assessment methodology is used to evaluate alternatives for collecting 1.8 × 10 6 dry t/yr based on assumptions made on performance of various assemblies of biomass collection systems. A proposed collection option using loafer/ stacker was shown to be the best option followed by ensiling and baling. Ranking of biomass transport systems is based on cost of biomass transport, emissions during transport, traffic congestion, and maturity of different technologies. At a capacity of 4 × 106 dry t/yr, rail transport was shown to be the best option, followed by truck transport and pipeline transport, respectively. These rankings depend highly on assumed maturity of technologies and scale of utilization. These may change if technologies such as loafing or ensiling (wet storage) methods are proved to be infeasible for large-scale collection systems. Copyright © 2006 by Humana Press Inc.

This study integrates the two metabolic pathways with the genetic regulatory circuit using the GEPASI 3.30 simulation environment, and investigates the model behavior under various nutrient conditions.

A variety of applications have been described in the literature, e.g. for cold-start vehicle assist, in hybrid load-leveling configurations with batteries, fuel-cells, as well as directly with internal combustion engines. Additionally, high capacitance C electrodes have been usefully employed as anodes coupled with battery-type cathodes, e.g. Pb/PbO2, in so-called ""asymmetric"" capacitor cells. On account of these perceived various applications, requirements for performance evaluation must be developed in systematic and complementary ways. In the present paper, we examine experimentally the following test procedures as exemplified by application to an high specific-area (ca. 2500 m2 g-1) woven C-cloth capacitor electrode material: (i) evaluation of the specific capacitances as a function of charge/discharge rates employing cyclic-voltammetry and dc charging curves; (ii) as in (i), examination of reversibility and energy-efficiency as a function of electrolyte (H2SO4) concentration, i.e. conductivity; (iii) interpretation of effects in (i) and (ii) in terms of distributed resistance and capacitance in the porous C matrix according to the de Levie model; (iv) interpretation of data obtained in (i) in terms of Ragone plots which, for capacitor devices, require special treatment owing to the fundamental dependence of electrode- (or device) potential on state of discharge; (v) interpretation of self-discharge (SD) kinetics in terms of porous-electrode structure.

The boost conversion replaces the normal inductor for energy storage in a magnetic field by energy storage in a mechanical system. The mechanical design of the MEMS voltage converter is presented with good agreement between analytical and finite-element modelling (FEM) methods. A discrete analytical model for the converter output voltage at each MEMS actuation cycle is developed and results are compared with electrical device simulation in the PSpice environment. The model takes account of parasitic components in the system implementation, in particular in the blocking diode/switch. Typical MEMS and diode capacitance values are investigated and the voltage gain in these conditions is found to be negligible. The use of a MEMS switch in the blocking diode role can minimize these problems at the cost of more expensive control circuitry and increased power consumption. A suitable application in an RF receiver with intermittent electrostatic actuation of an array of MEMS resonators requiring high transient voltages is described. The efficiency of operation is less than 1.4% but total power consumption is around 1 mJ and this may be acceptable in this intermittent mode of operation. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"DC machinery; Electric field effects; Electric potential; Finite element method; Magnetic field effects; Microelectromechanical devices; Discrete analytical model; MEMS resonators; Parasitic components; Electric converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646736542

Magnetic rigidity analysis in combination with atomic energy loss (Bρ-ΔE-Bρ method) in profiled matter placed at dispersive focal planes represents the tool for spatial separation in flight. The next-generation in-flight separators at high energies will consist of multiple degrader stages to provide intense monoisotopic fragment beams of all elements up to uranium. The pre-separator layout with the first degrader system holds many technical challenges, e.g. to handle the high-power primary beams characterized by a large range in time structure, from a DC beam to very short bunches. The latter requirement is particularly necessary for high-intensity primary beams bunched in short pulses (50 ns) for experiments with storage-rings. Large acceptance and high-separation power for uranium fission fragments and for exotic nuclei far from stability are the keys to serve the nuclear structure and astrophysical research at the frontiers. Consequently, large aperture magnets have to be applied to handle the inevitable large phase-space volume. The correction of higher-order image aberrations is a challenge and essential to achieve a high-separation power for the Bρ-ΔE-Bρ method. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The main focus of the paper is to examine the stakeholders' reactions to the mitigation option of capturing CO2 from power stations and storing it in suitable off-shore geological reservoirs. Five energy scenarios were developed which involved a range of levels of CO2 capture and storage (CCS): Fossilwise, Nuclear Renaissance, Renewable Generation and Spreading the Load high and low scenarios. A multi-criteria assessment method (MCA) was used as a way of elucidating stakeholders' views on the desirability or otherwise of each scenario against nine stakeholder-derived criteria. We found that stakeholders were either business-focused or environment/society-focused with respect to weighting of the criteria. Scoring of the scenarios did not follow such a straightforward pattern. Most respondents scored and weighted strategically and tended to express a clear preference for a form of energy generation. The results suggest that there is unlikely to be a wide-ranging consensus amongst energy stakeholders on the desirability of specific future forms of energy generation. On balance, the results support the inclusion of CCS within scenarios of a low-carbon energy system. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to reduce imports of fossil fuel and emissions of dangerous pollutants, solar energy could be used for the above-mentioned needs. That would require large collector areas and volumes for seasonal heat storage. In wintertime the wind speed velocity is much higher than in summertime in Lithuania. Therefore, it is advisable to study meeting the thermal needs of single family houses by combining use of wind and solar energy. To this end analytical research has been made by using deterministic method. The analysis has been carried out for the case when 1 m2 of heated room area requires 0.25 m2 of solar collector area and 0.5 m2 working area of wind turbine rotor. Heat storage is planned for 24 h. By using such a hybrid system during the heating season 42.6-56.2% of heating needs for space and domestic hot water are satisfied. However, for individual days (especially from May to October) a surplus of generated heat is formed and it reaches about 53.6% of space heating needs per year.

The phase transition temperature and values of latent heat of eutectic mixtures of CA and LA are suitable for being incorporated with building materials to form phase change wallboards used for building energy storage. 120, 240 and 360 accelerated thermal cycle tests were conducted to study the changes in latent heat of fusion and melting temperature of phase change wallboards combined with the eutectic mixtures of CA and LA. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tested the transition temperature and latent heat. The results showed that the melting temperature and latent heat of these phase change wallboards with eutectic mixtures have not obvious variations after repeated 360 thermal cycles, which proved that these phase change wallboards have good thermal stability for melting temperature and variations in latent heat of fusion for long time application. Therefore, they can be used for latent heat storage in the field of building energy conservation. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A solution to increase this inertia is to incorporate a phase change material (PCM) in this envelope. This paper presents the performance of a test-cell with a new structure of light wallboards containing PCMs submitted to climatic variation and a comparison is made with a test-cell without PCMs. To improve the wallboard efficiency a vacuum insulation panel (VIP) was associated to the PCM panel. This new structure allows the apparent heat capacity of the building to be increased, the solar energy transmitted by windows to be stored without raising the indoor cell temperature, and the thickness of the wallboard to be decreased compared with that of traditional wallboards. An experimental study was carried out by measuring temperature and heat fluxes on and through the wallboards. The indoor temperature, which has a special importance for occupants, was also measured. A numerical simulation with the TRNSYS software was carried out in adding a new module representing the new wallboard. It showed a good agreement with experimental results. This new tool will allow users to simulate the thermal behaviour of buildings having walls with PCMs. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The design of a ground heat exchanger for UTES applications requires knowledge of the thermal properties of the soil (thermal conductivity λ and borehole thermal resistance Rb), which can be done performing the so-called Thermal Response Test (TRT). The present article describes the results of a cooperative work between research groups of Chile and Argentina, which led to the realization of a TRT and of a charge/discharge experiment with solar collectors on a shallow single borehole. The tests are the first of its kind performed in South America. An installation for realizing the Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES) was prepared at the 'Solar Energy Laboratory' of the Technical University Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile. A comparison by means of different methods in order to evaluate λ and Rb was made. Time evolution of measured and predicted temperatures during charging and discharging was performed.

To this end, an agitated fluidised bed thermochemical reactor system has been proposed and investigated. The model results showed considerable enhanced adsorption capacities and heat transfer rates. However in order to promote effective exothermic reaction and heat transfer the thermophysical parameters that affect the minimum fluidising velocity (umf) in the adsorption column would have to be optimised.

The degradation of the maltodextrins is followed colorimetrically and state of water in the thermally treated samples is investigated using NIR spectroscopy. The results are discussed in terms of kinetic models including matrix viscoelasticity and reaction order.

These chromatographic data and other surface parameters (surface area, oxygen storage capacity, surface acidity, and reducibility) are correlated with the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. As a result, for n-hexane, the catalytic activity is mainly correlated with the adsorption capacity of the solids, whereas the activity for chlorinated compounds oxidation (as well as the selectivity to oxidation products) depends on both oxygen storage capacity and specific interaction of the chlorinated compound with the surface. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Water samples were filtered and target analytes were extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Supelco LC-18 and Oasis HLB SPE cartridges were used to pre-concentrate samples for acidic drugs and caffeine, respectively. A methylation process was applied to acidic drugs prior to analysis while caffeine was analyzed directly. A method of gas chromatography-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (IT-MS/MS) for analysis of the target acidic pharmaceuticals and caffeine is presented here in detail. Such parameters as collision-induced dissociation (CID) voltage, isolation time, excitation time, excitation storage level, and electron energy were adjusted in order to optimize the instrument analytical performance. After optimization, an instrument detection limit of 0.5-20 pg/μL with signal-to-noise (S/N) not less than 5 was achieved for all target analytes. It was shown that this method has good linearity within the range of 10-2000 pg/μL. The application of the optimized IT-MS/MS parameters conjointly with the sample preparation procedure resulted in method detection limits (MDLs) of 0.1-1.0 and 20 ng/L for the determination of acidic drugs and caffeine, respectively in such samples as surface water, effluent from municipal wastewater plants, as well as receiving waters. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In part A, TLM was applied immediately after procurement and the energetic profile was compared to a group treated with UW solution only (control) throughout 24-h storage. In part B, cadaveric human pancreata were procured and subjected to a TLM after cold storage in UW solution (TLM group) or UW solution (control group). Energetics, lipid peroxidation, and islet recovery/function were assessed after preservation at 4°C. In part A, after 9-h storage, the energetic profile (ATP, ATP/ADP, energy charge) for the TLM group was superior to controls. In part B, TLM treatment resulted in consistently greater ATP, ATP/ADP, and energy charge values than with storage in UW solution alone (p < 0.05). UW treatment resulted in 40% greater peroxidative damage than in the TLM group (p < 0.05). Islet recovery and functional viability were 30-40% higher following TLM treatment (p < 0.05). These data support the hypothesis that islet viability and yields can be significantly improved using a brief period of TLM treatment following conventional UW storage; reduced energetic and oxidative stress are implicated as potential mechanisms.

The method is two fold: the image is first deconvolved using the Richardson-Lucy algorithm and is then divided with a signal modelling the soft-tissue distribution to increase the overall contrast. Each step has its own merits but the power of the restoration method lies in their combination. The originality of the method is its reliance on a priori information at each step in the processing. We have measured and modelled analytically the point-spread function of a low-dose gas microstrip x-ray detector at several beam energies. We measured the relationship between the local image intensity and the noise variance for these images. The soft-tissue signal was also modelled using a minimum-curvature filtering technique. These results were then combined into an image deconvolution procedure that uses wavelet filtering to reduce restoration noise while keeping the enhanced small-scale features. The method was applied successfully to images of a human-torso phantom and improved the contrast of small details on the bones and in the soft tissues. We measured a mean 54% increase in signal to noise ratio and a mean 105% increase in contrast to noise ratio in the 70 and 140 kVp images we analysed. The method was designed to facilitate the analysis of radiographs by relying on two levels of visual inspection. The contrast of the full image is first enhanced by division with the signal modelling the soft-tissue distribution. Based on the result, a radiologist might decide to zoom in on a given image section. The full restoration method is then applied to that region of interest. Indeed, full image deconvolution is often unnecessary since enhanced small-scale details are not visible at large scale; only the section of interest is processed which is more efficient. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Algorithms; Bone; Image reconstruction; Microstructure; Radiation detectors; Image sharpness; Richardson-Lucy algorithm; X-ray imaging; Radiography; analytic method; article; digital imaging; image analysis; image enhancement; image processing; optical resolution; phantom; priority journal; radiation detection; radiography; soft tissue; technique; tissue distribution; Algorithms; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646466514

Indeed, it could be used for many different applications thanks to its goods performances. Nevertheless, the present high cost of a FC requires an optimal power flow of the power provided by the FC to make its development easier. So, the FC must fit each application fulfilling the imposed requirements in an optimal way. As a consequence, the energy management made by the power interface of the FC based generator appears as a vital element: it regulates the power flow between the FC and the auxiliary energy storage. Consequently, it has a major influence on the size of this storage element. This paper focuses on this control level. It presents three algorithms for the energy management developed by the authors. Each of the algorithms optimizes one criterion for the generator. The controls allow a good rate performances/simplicity. Furthermore, they give a good overview of the existing algorithms. The paper tests and compares the three controls with three applications, which are the best adapted ones concerning the use of FC. The data of the applications are obtained from real installations. The comparison is done thanks to simulation.

The first type of samples displays an hydrogen desorption kinetics better than the second one. Pressure composition isotherm measurements exhibit for both type of samples two plateaux, the lower and wider corresponding to the MgH2 phase and the upper and shorter corresponding to the Mg2NiH4 phase. The presence of the two types of hydrides is confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Mössbauer spectroscopy shows that in melt spun and subsequently milled samples iron is mainly in a disordered structure and segregates after hydrogenation, while in directly milled powders remains mainly unalloyed. After multiple hydrogen absorption/desorption cycles the main part of iron is in metallic state in samples of both types, those of first type preserving better hydrogen desorption kinetics. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Microelectronic fabrication technologies and the environmental sciences both require light sources with shorter emission wavelengths: the former for improved resolution in photolithography and the latter for sensors that can detect minute hazardous particles. In addition, ultraviolet solid-state light sources are also attracting attention for potential applications in high-density optical data storage, biomedical research, water and air purification, and sterilization. Wide-bandgap materials, such as diamond and III-V nitride semiconductors (GaN, AlGaN and AlN; refs 3-10), are potential materials for ultraviolet LEDs and laser diodes, but suffer from difficulties in controlling electrical conduction. Here we report the successful control of both n-type and p-type doping in aluminium nitride (AlN), which has a very wide direct bandgap of 6 eV. This doping strategy allows us to develop an AlN PIN (p-type/intrinsic/n-type) homojunction LED with an emission wavelength of 210 nm, which is the shortest reported to date for any kind of LED. The emission is attributed to an exciton transition, and represents an important step towards achieving exciton-related light-emitting devices as well as replacing gas light sources with solid-state light sources. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Aluminum nitride; Biomedical engineering; Energy gap; Gas lasers; Hazardous materials; Microelectronics; Optical data storage; Photolithography; Sterilization (cleaning); Exciton transition; Exciton-related light-emitting devices; Gas light sources; Solid-state light sources; Light emitting diodes; aluminum derivative; aluminum nitride; unclassified drug; electronic equipment; laser; resolution; ultraviolet radiation; wavelength; article; gas; laser; light; light emitting diode; priority journal; semiconductor; solid state; spectral sensitivity; ultraviolet radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745627020

In this article, the metabolic changes that follow in ageing have been analysed, and in accordance with that, an evolutionary explanation for the senescence program has been proposed. Ageing is characterised by a set of metabolic features all of them designed to reduce energy expenditure and to promote energy storage. Otherwise, the undoubted beneficial effect to fitness that means to live longer could generate a conflict between parents and offspring for energy resources. The solution to that conflict is an adult economical individual, a ""thrifty aged"". The way to obtain this cheaper individual is through the genetically induced physiological changes that finally lead the process.

In converters that have no energy storage, for example in a matrix converter, the maximum voltage transfer ratio will be limited if one or more input lines is at a reduced voltage. Control techniques to compensate the effect of unbalanced voltage supply for matrix converters allow for a limited output voltage and power capabilities, which depends on the level of unbalance. This paper proposes the utilization of the clamp capacitor, which is normally needed to protect a Direct Power Converter (DPC), to extend the operating range of a Two-Stage DPC during unbalanced supply conditions preserving its theoretic maximum voltage transfer ratio capability. A new topology based on a hybrid approach, consisting of an H-bridge inverter inserted into the intermediary link, which is also able to preserve the output voltage capability under unbalanced supply conditions, is proposed. Both solutions are validated through simulations.","Active compensation; Clamp circuit; Direct power conversion; H-bridge inverter; Hybrid converter; Unbalanced supply","Computer simulation; Electric energy storage; Electric potential; Electric power systems; Voltage control; Active compensation; Clamp circuit; Direct power conversion (DPC); H-bridge inverter; Hybrid converters; Unbalanced supply; Electric converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646383374

Emphatically, no nauseous scent (H2S) appeared in our experiments, which could not be avoided in other previous reports. The morphology, structure, and phase composition of the as-prepared Bi2S3 products were characterized using various techniques (scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy). The formation mechanism for the bismuth sulfide flowerlike assemblies with well-arranged nanorods was also discussed. In addition, other Bi 2S3 homogeneous nanostructures (e.g., networklike nanoflakes, nanorod-based bundles, and nanoflakes) were obtained through varying the experimental parameters. Interestingly, we have found that these synthesized bismuth sulfide nanostructures using the biomoleucle-assisted approach could electrochemically charge and discharge with the capacity of 142 (mA h)/g (corresponding to 0.51 wt% hydrogen in single-walled carbon nanotubes) under normal atmosphere at room temperature. A novel two-plateau phenomenon was observed in the synthesized Bi2S3 nanostructures, suggesting that there were two independent steps in the charging process. It has been demonstrated that the bismuth sulfide's morphology and the constant charge-discharge current density had a noticeable influence on their capacity of electrochemical hydrogen storage. These differences in hydrogen storage capacity are likely due to the size and density of space/pores as well as the morphology of different Bi2S3 nanostructures. The novel Bi2S3 nanomaterials may find potential applications in hydrogen storage, high-energy batteries, luminescence, optoelectronic and catalytic fields, as well as in the studies of structure-property relationships.

The textural characterization using Ar, N2, and CO2 adsorption combined with neutron diffraction showed that the two samples exhibit a significant microporous volume close to 0.5 cm3/g and an ordered network of mesopores. For both MCM48 and SBA15 templated carbons, adsorption first proceeds with the filling of micropores and then by the filling of mesopores with an adsorption energy close to the enthalpy of vaporization of bulk hydrogen. The hydrogen isosteric heat of adsorption in the micropores (6-8 kJ/mol) is significantly larger than that on the graphite surface (∼4 kJ/mol) but still too small for a reasonable use of these MOCs as hydrogen adsorbents for storage at room temperature. The neutron scattering study showed that the structure at 10 K of the adsorbed deuterium phase is poorly organized; it exhibits short and medium range orders of about 13 Å in micropores and about 20 A in mesopores, respectively. The average distance between adsorbed molecules decreases with coverage by about 10%.

The resulting birefringence reached 146% of the value at the interception. Because the saturation value of birefringence was proportional to the value induced optically, it can easily be controlled by exposure energy. In addition, the enhanced birefringence showed a high recording stability. In other words, the recovery of birefringence was performed by heat treatment after an erasing process in which the film was irradiated with a circularly polarized beam at room temperature. In contrast, the circularly polarized beam irradiation at Tg eliminated birefringence completely. Hence, the thermally enhanced birefringence was reversed by the irradiations at Tg. These properties enable the photocontrol of thermally enhanced birefringence, which is highly useful for reversible holographic storage. © 2006 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","Azobenzene; Azobenzene-containing polymer; Optically Induced birefringence","Benzene; Birefringence; Glass transition; Heat treatment; Holography; Irradiation; Light polarization; Azobenzene; Azobenzene-containing polymer; Optically Induced birefringence; Recording stability; Plastic films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646887248

The diffusion of guest species in mesoporous networks plays an important role in these applications, especially for energy storage, such as supercapacitors based on ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs). The ion diffusion behavior in two different 2-D hexagonal OMCs was investigated by using cyclic voltametry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In addition, transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray diffraction, and nitrogen cryosorption methods were used to study the pore structure variations of these two OMCs. It was found that, for the OMC with defective pore channels (termed as pore packing defects), the gravimetric capacitance was greatly decayed when the voltage scan rate was increased. The experimental results suggest that, for the ion diffusion in 2-D hexagonal OMCs with similar mesopore size distribution, the pore packing defect is a dominant dynamic factor. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Diffusion; Gravimetric analysis; Ions; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction analysis; 2-D ordered mesoporous carbons; Packing defects; Small-angle X-ray diffraction; Mesoporous materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744459249

The irradiation with linearly polarized (LP) 405 nm light was performed to investigate the photoinduced reorientation behavior of the thin films. On the basis of the polarization-preserved excited energy transfer from the photosensitizing groups to the MCB groups, a photoinduced optical anisotropy due to the axis-selective photoreaction of the MCB groups accompanied the photoreaction of the film. In all cases, annealing the film reversely amplified the photoinduced optical anisotropy and an in-plane order parameter greater than 0.7 was achieved for the NB-containing copolymer films. The axis-selectivity of the photoabsorption of the photosensitizing groups and the effective energy transfer played important roles in generating the large photoinduced optical anisotropy and the effective thermal enhancement.

Adipose tissue was for a long time considered an inert storage depot of unused energy; its plasticity attracted biomedical interest only for its pathological consequences. The abnormal rise in the incidence of obesity in industrialized countries led to coinage of the term ""civilization syndrome"". Fat has found applications in plastic surgery as a filler material, but until recently, the long-term regenerative effects of its heterotopic transplantation have been neglected. In the last few years it has emerged that the plasticity of adult fat is due to the presence of multipotent stromal populations endowed with immunophenotypical and differentiative properties that are similar, although not identical, to those of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). Several investigations explored BM-MSCs as an effective tool for the therapy of several diseases. Although the identification of adipose derived adult MSCs (ADAS) as functionally equivalent to BM-MSCs is still controversial, preliminary studies encourage the use of adipose tissue as an elective source of MSCs for therapeutic application, due to its abundance and extreme accessibility by minimally invasive procedures.

Method: We assessed the efficacy and safety of a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach for treating morphological and metabolic alterations of the lipodystrophy syndrome in consecutive patients attending the Metabolic Clinic (MC) of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia who had at least 2 evaluations over a 48-week period. 245 patients were evaluated: 143 (62.4%) were men, 74 (36.1%) presented with lipoatrophy, 10 (4.9%) with fat accumulation, 93 (45%) with mixed forms, 24 (11.3%) had hypercholesterolemia (LDL >1 60 mg/dL), 87 (38%) had hypertriglyceridemia (TG >150 mg/dL), 13 (5.7%) had diabetes (glucose >126 mg/dL), and 78 (44%) had insulin resistance (HOMA-IR >4). Results: At follow-up, a significant improvement was observed in both objective and subjective variables. Anthropometric improvement was observed in waist to hip ratio, waist circumference, and right and left cheek dermal thickness measurements. A nonsignificant improvement was observed in fat and lean regional mass by DEXA; CT showed improvement in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Glucose, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, and APO B improved. Subjective variables improved in aesthetic satisfaction. Conclusion: We conclude that the medical and surgical interventions proposed in this multidisciplinary therapeutic approach are efficacious and safe in the management of lipodystrophy. © 2006 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.","Antiretroviral therapy; HIV; Lipodystrophy","abacavir; apolipoprotein B; atazanavir; cholesterol; glucose; proteinase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; tenofovir; adult; AIDS related complex; anthropometry; article; cholesterol blood level; clinical feature; clinical trial; computer assisted tomography; diabetes mellitus; diet therapy; drug substitution; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; esthetics; face surgery; female; follow up; glucose blood level; HIV associated lipodystrophy; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertriglyceridemia; insulin resistance; interdisciplinary communication; Italy; lean body weight; lifestyle; lipid storage; lipoatrophy; liposuction; major clinical study; male; patient safety; patient satisfaction; physiotherapy; priority journal; protein blood level; treatment outcome; waist circumference; waist hip ratio; Adult; Anti-HIV Agents; Apolipoproteins B; Body Fat Distribution; Cholesterol; Combined Modality Therapy; Counseling; Exercise; Female; Food Habits; Glucose; HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy Syndrome; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Surgery, Plastic; Treatment Outcome; Waist-Hip Ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748205473

Treatments were either a control diet or diets containing 25 g/kg of additional ether extract from rumen-protected fat, coconut oil, rapeseed, sunflower seed or linseed. Fat supplementation resulted in trends for higher apparent nitrogen digestibilities (significant with coconut oil; P < 0.05, post hoc test) and body nitrogen retention (P < 0.1). Urinary nitrogen losses and their proportion of manure nitrogen did not differ significantly among groups as was also true for C / N ratio, dry matter, nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen contents of the manure. In the first week of manure storage, most fat supplements tended to decrease gaseous nitrogen emission as assessed by respiration chamber and mass balance measurements. These differences tended to be mitigated after 7 weeks of manure storage. Only the coconut-oil treatment still resulted in numerically lower nitrogen emissions. In conclusion, addition of fat source in the diet, in addition to increasing dietary energy and suppressing methanogenesis, can under certain circumstances decrease gaseous nitrogen emission from the manure. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The interest of having small particle sizes is to be able to circumvent the low intrinsic ionic conductivity of these materials through the increase of the active volume proportion of the operating grain, during the insertion process. Low temperature synthesis routes, in aqueous media, were thus used to obtain such crystallites with nanometer dimensions. The theoretical specific capacity of these materials is as high as 300 mA h g-1 which is actually very interesting for lithium batteries applications. However, the electrochemical behaviour greatly depends on the structure of the compounds. A phase transformation was, for example, evidenced in the case of γ-FeOOH first lithiation whereas the best performance were obtained with β-FeOOH, which develops a stable capacity of 180 mA h g-1, after 10 cycles, at C/10. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

For high-speed applications, most RS decoders are implemented as dedicated application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs) based on parallel architectures, which can deliver high data throughput rate. For lower-speed applications, the RS decoding operations are usually performed by using fine-grained processing elements (PE) controlled by a programmable digital signal processing (DSP) core, which provides high flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel m-PE multi-symbol-sliced (MSS) RS datapath structure. The m-PE RS architecture is a highly scalable design and can be dynamically reconfigured at 1-PE, 2-PE,. . . , m/2-PE, and m-PE modes to deliver necessary data throughput rate. With the help of the gated-clock scheme to turn off the idle PEs, the proposed runtime configurable ASIC design provides good tradeoff between the data throughput rate and the power consumption. Hence, it can save energy to extend the battery life of the portable devices. We demonstrate a prototyping design using 4 PEs by using UMC 0.18-μm CMOS technology. The design can be dynamically reconfigured to be operated at 1-PE, 2-PE, and 4-PE modes, with performance of 140 Mb/s at 18.91 mW, 280 Mb/s at 28.77 mW, and 560 Mb/s at 48.47 mW, respectively. Compared with existing RS designs, the proposed m-PE RS decoder has better normalized area/power efficiency than most DSP-type and ASIC-type RS designs. The reconfigurable feature makes our design a good candidate for the error control coding (ECC) unit of the storage system in power-aware portable devices. © 2006 IEEE.","Dynamically reconfigurable architectures; Multi-symbol-sliced; Processing elements; Reed-Solomon codes","Dynamically reconfigurable architectures; Multi symbol sliced; Processing elements; Reed Solomon codes; Codes (standards); Computer aided design; Computer architecture; Data acquisition; Digital signal processing; Error correction; Integrated circuits; Multi agent systems; Storage allocation (computer); Decoding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746406845

However, HAART regimens, especially those including protease inhibitors (PIs) have been shown to cause in a high proportion of HIV-infected patients a metabolic syndrome that may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (about 1.4 cardiac events per 1000 years of therapy according to the Framingham score). Metabolic features associated with somatic changes (lipodystrophy/lipoatrophy) include dyslipidemia (about 70% of patients), insulin resistance (elevated C-peptide and insulin), type 2 diabetes mellitus (8%-10% of the patients), hypertension (up to 75% of patients), coagulation abnormalities (25% of patients), lactic acidemia, and elevated hepatic transaminases (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis). HAART-associated metabolic syndrome is an increasingly recognized clinical entity. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for this syndrome will lead to the discovery of new drugs that will reduce the cardiovascular risk in patients under HAART. A careful stratification of the cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular monitoring of patients under HAART is needed according to the most recent clinical guidelines. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Cardiovascular disease; Highly active antiretroviral therapy; Human immunodeficiency virus; Metabolic syndrome","adiponectin; amiodarone; amprenavir; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; antiarrhythmic agent; anticoagulant agent; atorvastatin; bepridil; calcium channel blocking agent; delavirdine; efavirenz; fibric acid derivative; flecainide; fluindostatin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; indinavir; insulin; lopinavir; mevinolin; nelfinavir; nevirapine; pravastatin; propafenone; proteinase inhibitor; quinidine; ritonavir; saquinavir; simvastatin; unindexed drug; warfarin; acute coronary syndrome; adipocyte; artery intima proliferation; atherogenesis; blood clotting disorder; body fat distribution; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; CD4 lymphocyte count; cell culture; chromosome 3q; comorbidity; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery disease; disorders of mitochondrial functions; dizziness; drug accumulation; drug induced headache; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; dyslipidemia; endothelial dysfunction; gastrointestinal symptom; heart infarction; highly active antiretroviral therapy; HIV associated lipodystrophy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypertension; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lactic acidemia; lipid storage; liver toxicity; metabolic syndrome X; muscle disease; myositis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; peripheral vascular disease; priority journal; proadipocyte; protein expression; quantitative trait locus; review; risk assessment; sequence homology; triacylglycerol blood level; unstable angina pectoris; Adolescent; Adult; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Drug Interactions; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Male; Metabolic Syndrome X; Protease Inhibitors; Risk Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745834346

Adipose tissue has been considered until recently, just a depot for ene rgy storage, which has the sole function of accretion in the form of triacylglycerols of excess energy. However, adipose tissue is now considered an active endocrine organ that releases a wide range of endocrine, paracrine and metabolic signals. Although obesity increases in adipose tissue the expression of genes is related with inflammation and immunity (and, conversely, caloric restriction improves this inflammatory profile), these genes are expressed mainly in the cells of the stromal vascular fraction of the adipose tissue rather than in the adipocytes. Adipose tissue structure is not uniform. More than half of the adipose tissue cells belong to a heterogeneous stromal vascular fraction, which includes stem cells, preadipocytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages. The strong relationship between adipose tissue, macrophage content and the indicators of adiposity hit at their implication in the increased adipose tissue production of proinflammatory molecules and acute phase proteins associated with obesity. The growing knowledge of the implicat ion of adipose tissue in inflammation, response to immune challenge, and tissue proliferation may be directly traced to cell types not directly related to the energy storage function. Thus, we can conclude that white adipose tissue is something more than simply adipocytes. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Adipocytes; Adipokines; Endothelial cells; Inflammation; Macrophages; Obesity","adipocytokine; adiponectin; cytokine; estrogen; glucocorticoid; interleukin 1; interleukin 6; leptin; resistin; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adipocyte; adipose tissue; atherosclerosis; cell heterogeneity; cell type; correlation analysis; endocrine system; endothelial dysfunction; endothelium cell; gene expression; human; immunity; inflammation; insulin resistance; macrophage; obesity; paracrine signaling; priority journal; proadipocyte; review; stem cell",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745828332

The aim of this brief review is to highlight some of the mounting evidence indicating that augmented superoxide, related reactive oxygen species and other free radicals contribute to the oxidative stress evident during the progression of heart failure. While much of the source of increased reactive oxygen species is mitochondrial, there are other intracellular sources, which together are highly reactive with functional and structural cellular lipids and proteins. Bioenergetic defects limiting ATP synthesis in the failing myocardium relate not only to post-translational modification of electron transport respiratory chain proteins but also to perturbation of Krebs Cycle enzyme-dependent synthesis of NADH. Accumulation of pathological levels of lipid peroxides relate to dysfunction in the intrinsic capacity to clear and renew dysfunctional proteins. This review also features key limitations of human heart failure studies and potential clinical therapies that target the elevated oxidative stress that is a hallmark of human heart failure. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Dietary campestenone dramatically increased the activities and the mRNA expressions of mitochondrial and peroxisomal enzymes involved in β-oxidation in the liver. Campestenone activated human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α as determined using the novel GAL4 ligand-binding domain chimera assay system with coactivator coexpression. In contrast, dietary campestenone reduced the activities and the mRNA expressions of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, except for the malic enzyme. Dietary campestenone decreased the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) mRNA level. Energy expenditure was significantly higher in the feeding of campestenone in rats. Dietary campestenone reduced hepatic cholesterol concentration and increased fecal excretion of neutral steroids originated from cholesterol. Lymphatic absorption of cholesterol was reduced by the coadministration of campestenone in rats cannulated in the thoracic duct.

It came into operation 1958, being the first alternating gradient synchrotron in Europe. After five years of performing photoproduction experiments at this accelerator, a larger 2.5GeV electron synchrotron was built and set into operation in 1967. Both synchrotrons were running for particle physics experiments, until from 1982 to 1987 a third accelerator, the electron stretcher ring ELSA, was constructed and set up in a separate ring tunnel below the physics institute. ELSA came into operation in 1987, using the pulsed 2.5GeV synchrotron as pre-accelerator. ELSA serves either as storage ring producing synchrotron radiation, or as post-accelerator and pulse stretcher. Applying a slow extraction close to a third integer resonance, external electron beams with energies up to 3.5GeV and high duty factors are delivered to hadron physics experiments. Various photo- and electroproduction experiments, utilising the experimental set-ups PHOENICS, ELAN, SAPHIR, GDH and Crystal Barrel have been carried out. During the late 90's, a pulsed GaAs source of polarised electrons was constructed and set up at the accelerator. ELSA was upgraded in order to accelerate polarised electrons, compensating for depolarising resonances by applying the methods of fast tune jumping and harmonic closed orbit correction. With the experimental investigation of the GDH sum rule, the first experiment requiring a polarised beam and a polarised target was successfully performed at the accelerator. In the near future, the stretcher ring will be further upgraded to increase polarisation and current of the external electron beams. In addition, the aspects of an increase of the maximum energy to 5GeV using superconducting resonators will be investigated.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745537037

We preserved rat livers either by cold storage (UW) for 10 h, or by perfusion for 3 h (oxygenated modified UW) after 10 h cold storage. We assessed viability of livers after preservation and after ischemic rewarming + normothermic reperfusion ex vivo. Ten hour cold storage reduced mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and metabolically depleted the livers. Oxygenated perfusion after cold storage resulted in uploaded cellular energy charge and oxidized mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. Reperfusion after 10 h cold storage increased formation of superoxid anions, release of cytosolic LDH, lipid peroxidation, caspase activities and led to disruption of sinusoidal endothelial cells. In contrast, reperfusion after 10 h cold storage + 3 h hypothermic oxygenated perfusion resulted in no changes of lipid peroxidation, bile flow, energy charge, total glutathione, LDH release and of caspase activation, as compared to fresh resected livers. This study demonstrates, that a metabolically depleted liver due to cold storage can be energy recharged by short-termed cold machine perfusion.

Several studies have evaluated its accuracy in healthy persons; however, little attention has been directed to the same issue in patients. Objective: The objective was to compare the accuracy of the Lunar Prodigy DXA for body-composition analysis with that of the reference 4-component (4C) model in healthy subjects and in patients with 1 of 3 disease states. Design: A total of 215 subjects aged 5.0-21.3 y (n = 122 healthy nonobese subjects, n = 55 obese patients, n = 26 cystic fibrosis patients, and n = 12 patients with glycogen storage disease). Fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and weight were measured by DXA and the 4C model. Results: The accuracy of DXA-measured body-composition outcomes differed significantly between groups. Factors independently predicting bias in weight, FM, FFM, and percentage body fat in multivariate models included age, sex, size, and disease state. Biases in FFM were not mirrored by equivalent opposite biases in FM because of confounding biases in weight. Conclusions: The bias of DXA varies according to the sex, size, fatness, and disease state of the subjects, which indicates that DXA is unreliable for patient case-control studies and for longitudinal studies of persons who undergo significant changes in nutritional status between measurements. A single correction factor cannot adjust for inconsistent biases. © 2006 American Society for Nutrition.","Body composition; Clinical practice; Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; DXA; Fat mass; Fat-free mass; Obesity","adolescent; adult; anthropometry; article; body composition; body fat distribution; body weight; child; clinical assessment; controlled study; cystic fibrosis; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; glycogen storage disease; human; major clinical study; male; nutrition; obesity; aging; body composition; body mass; body water; comparative study; cystic fibrosis; epidemiology; evaluation; glycogen storage disease; obesity; pathophysiology; preschool child; radiodensitometry; sensitivity and specificity; sexual development; deuterium; diagnostic agent; Adolescent; Adult; Aging; Anthropometry; Bias (Epidemiology); Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Body Water; Child; Child, Preschool; Cystic Fibrosis; Densitometry, X-Ray; Deuterium; Female; Glycogen Storage Disease; Humans; Male; Obesity; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sex Characteristics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745136107

Adsorption isotherms of H2 on activated carbon AX-21 and multi-wall carbon nanotubes were collected with a volumetric method for the temperature range of 77, 233-298 K and pressures up to 7 or 10 MPa. Based on the experimental data for 233-298 K, the limiting heats of adsorption of 7.6 and 1.8 kJ/mol were obtained for activated carbon and carbon nanotubes, respectively. The absolute adsorption was determined with a recently presented method, and the adsorption behavior of H2 on carbon nanotubes was thus reasonably explained. A comparison was given for the storage capacities of compression alone and of filling powder or pellets of the two materials. It was concluded that adsorption of H2 on carbon nanotubes is too weak to enhance storage, but activated carbon enhances storage capacity considerably.

The activation energy for the voiding failure of aluminum interconnects, assuming that the lattice diffusion of atoms is the primary diffusion mechanism of stress-induced migration, was calculated to be approximately 0.8 eV, which was close to the activation energy obtained from actual high-temperature storage tests (i.e., 0.5-0.6 eV). This agreement implies that for aluminum interconnects the assumption is correct, and the lattice diffusion is the primary diffusion mechanism for stress-induced migration. The computed activation energy for voiding failure of copper interconnects was less than 1.5 eV and did not agree with the activation energy obtained from high-temperature storage tests (0.74 eV).

The penetration depth can be increased by using all transmitters in every transmission. In this paper, a method for exciting all transmitters in every transmission and separating them at the receiver is proposed. The coding is done by designing narrow-band linearly frequency modulated signals, which are approximately disjointed in the frequency domain and assigning one waveform to each transmitter. By designing a filterbank consisting of the matched filters corresponding to the excitation waveforms, the different transmitters can be decoded at the receiver. The matched filter of a specific waveform will allow information only from this waveform to pass through, thereby separating it from the other waveforms. This means that all transmitters can be used in every transmission, and the information from the different transmitters can be separated instantaneously. Compared to traditional synthetic transmit aperture (STA) imaging, in which the different transmitters are excited sequentially, more energy is transmitted in every transmission, and a better signal-to-noise-ratio is attained. The method has been tested in simulation, in which the resolution and contrast was compared to a standard synthetic transmit aperture system with a single sinusoid excitation. The resolution and contrast was comparable for the two systems. The method also has been tested using the experimental ultrasound scanner RASMUS. The resolution was evaluated using a string phantom. The method was compared to a conventional STA using both sinusoidal excitation and linear frequency modulated (FM) signals as excitation. The system using the FM signals and the frequency division approach yielded the same performance concerning both axial (of ≈ 3 λ) and lateral resolution (of ≈ 4.5 λ). A SNR measurement showed an increase in SNR of 6.5 dB compared to the system using the conventional STA method and FM signal excitation. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Excitation waveforms; Frequency modulated signals; Matched filter; Penetration depth; Synthetic transmit aperture (STA); Computer simulation; Frequency modulation; Image reconstruction; Optical resolving power; Signal to noise ratio; Transducers; Transmitters; Imaging techniques; algorithm; article; computer assisted diagnosis; echography; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; radiofrequency radiation; Algorithms; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Radio Waves; Ultrasonography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744769108

We investigated if the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone influences substrate usage, energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI) and, thereby, how PPARγ activity contributes to susceptibility to obesity. Methods: Twenty healthy males (20-29 years) were randomly assigned to receive a placebo (n = 10) or rosiglitazone (8 mg/d) (n = 10) for seven consecutive days, while staying in a respiration chamber. Food intake was ad libitum. Body composition was determined by underwater weighing (day 1) and deuterium dilution (day 1 and 8). Results: Mean (±SE) EI w as 15.9 ± 0.9 MJ/d in the placebo group and 18.9 ± 1.2 MJ/d in the rosiglitazone group. Mean EE was 11.3 ± 0.3 MJ/ d and 12.5 ± 0.5 MJ/d for the placebo and rosiglitazone groups respectively. This resulted in a cumulative positive energy balance (EB) of 32.3 ± 5.1 MJ for placebo and 44.7 ± 6.9 MJ for rosiglitazone. There were no significant differences in EI, EE, and EB between treatments. Both groups did not adjust their fat oxidation to the increased fat intake, but fat oxidation decreased faster in the rosiglitazone group (significantly lower on days 6 and 7). During treatment with rosiglitazone, significantly more fat storage was seen in overweight subjects while this was not the case in the placebo group. Conclusions: Our results suggest a shift in substrate usage during PPARγ stimulation leading to a preference for fat storage, especially in subjects with a higher BMI.

A real-size room which is at temperature conditions typical in a desert region in summer is considered. The idea is to use a phase change material which could melt during the day hours, absorbing heat from the room, while at night it solidifies due to a low night temperature. The heat from the room air to a PCM unit is free or forced-convected. The numerical model includes the transient heat conduction inside the walls/ceiling, free/forced convection of air, and radiation inside the room. The processes inside the PCM are modeled by the effective heat capacity (EHC) method. The PCM is assumed to melt and solidify within a certain temperature range, which represents the true situation for most commercial-grade phase-change materials. The numerical calculations are performed for the transient temperature fields inside the three-dimensional room, including PCM in the units, walls/ceiling, and the interior of the room. The boundary conditions for the room are chosen according to the experimental data which were obtained in previous works. The basic conservation equations of continuity, momentum, and energy are solved numerically, using the FLUENT 6.1 software. The numerical simulations are performed for at least one full 24-h cycle. Effect of different parameters on the behavior of the system is discussed, including the mass of the PCM and radiation effects inside the room. The night cooling by free and forced convection is analyzed. It is shown that a complete 24-h cycle is feasible in a properly designed configuration with a suitable PCM.

With this configuration, the whole process can be carried out in a single solar energy converter, the process temperature can be significantly lowered compared to other thermo-chemical cycles and the recombination of oxygen and hydrogen is prevented by fixing the oxygen in the metal oxide. For the realization of the integrated concept, research work proceeded in three parallel directions: synthesis of active redox systems, manufacture of ceramic honeycomb supports and manufacture, testing and optimization of operating conditions of a thermochemical solar receiver-reactor. The receiver-reactor has been developed and installed in the solar furnace in Cologne, Germany. It was proven that solar hydrogen production is feasible by this process demonstrating that multicycling of the process was possible in principle.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether the degradation rate of insulin in lyophilized formulations is determined by matrix mobility, as reflected in glass transition temperature (T g), or by β-relaxation, as reflected in rotating-frame spin-lattice relaxation time (T1ρ). Methods. The storage stability of insulin lyophilized with dextran was investigated at various relative humidities (RH; 12-60%) and temperatures (40-90°C) and was compared with previously reported data for insulin lyophilized with trehalose. Insulin degradation was monitored by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Furthermore, the T 1ρ of the insulin carbonyl carbon in the lyophilized insulin-dextran and insulin-trehalose systems was measured at 25°C by 13C solid-state NMR, and the effect of trehalose and dextran on T1ρ was compared at various humidities. Results. The degradation rate of insulin lyophilized with dextran was not significantly affected by the T g of the matrix, even at low humidity (12% RH), in contrast to that of insulin lyophilized with trehalose. The insulin-dextran system exhibited a substantially greater degradation rate than the insulin-trehalose system at a given temperature below the T g. The difference in degradation rate between the insulin-dextran and insulin-trehalose systems observed at 12% RH was eliminated at 43% RH. In addition, the T1ρ of the insulin carbonyl carbon at low humidity (12% RH) was prolonged by the addition of trehalose, but not by the addition of dextran. This difference was eliminated at 23% RH, at which point the solid remained in the glassy state. These findings suggest that the β-relaxation of insulin is inhibited by trehalose at low humidity, presumably as a result of insulin-trehalose interaction, and thus becomes a rate determinant. In contrast, dextran, whose ability to interact with insulin is thought to be less than that of trehalose, did not inhibit the β-relaxation of insulin, and thus, the chemical activational barrier (activation energy) rather than β-relaxation becomes the major rate determinant. Conclusions. β-Relaxation rather than matrix mobility seems to be more important in determining the stability of insulin in the glassy state in lyophilized formulations containing trehalose and dextran. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.","β-relaxation; Glass transition; Insulin; Lyophilized formulation; Molecular mobility; Solid-state stability","carbon 13; carbonyl derivative; dextran; human insulin; trehalose; article; beta relaxation; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; degradation; drug degradation; drug formulation; drug stability; freeze drying; glass transition temperature; humidity; matrix mobility; priority journal; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; solid state; statistical significance; storage temperature; tablet matrix; temperature; water absorption; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Dextrans; Drug Stability; Excipients; Freeze Drying; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Protein Structure, Secondary; Technology, Pharmaceutical; Temperature; Trehalose; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646858787

This overspill of fat occurs in apparently opposite pathological states such as lipodistrophy or obesity. When the excess of energy is redirected towards peripheral organs, their initial response is to facilitate the storage of the surplus in the form of triacylglycerol, but the limited triacylglycerol buffer capacity becomes saturated soon. Under these conditions excess of lipids enter alternative non-oxidative pathways that result in production of toxic reactive lipid species that induce organ-specific toxic responses leading to apoptosis. Reactive lipids can accumulate in non-adipose tissues of metabolically relevant organs such as pancreatic β-cells, liver, heart and skeletal muscle leading to lipotoxicity, a process that contributes substantially to the pathophysiology of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, steatotic liver disease and heart failure. The effects of this lipotoxic insult can be minimised by several strategies: (a) decreased incorporation of energy, (b) a less orthodox approach such as increased adipose tissue expandability and/or (c) increased oxidation of fat in peripheral organs. Aging should be considered as physiological degenerative process potentially accelerated by concomitant lipotoxic insults. Conversely, the process of aging can sensitise cells to effects of lipid toxicity. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Scanning electronic microscope photos showed that wool powder had good compatibility with PU in the solvent N,N-dimethylformamide. The wool powder was uniformly distributed in the films without apparent agglomeration. In the X-ray diffraction results, the height of the X-ray diffraction peak decreased gradually with the addition of the wool powder, which implied that the addition of the wool powder could increase the amorphous ratio of the films. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that the thermal stability of the PU resin decreased with the increase in the wool powder ratio in it. Additionally, the dynamic mechanical analysis result indicated that the ratio of the wool powder had no significant influence on the soft-segments, but the dynamic storage modulus of the PU films would increase with the increase in wool powder ratio. In addition, the crystal of the PU was destroyed by the wool powder during the drying process at a certain temperature, and this increased the moving probability of the macromolecule chains in PU.

We quantified the responses of extracellular metabolites, intracellular intermediates in primary metabolism, intracellular free amino acids, and in vivo rates of O2 uptake and CO2 evolution. With these measurements, dynamic carbon, electron, and ATP balances were set up to identify major carbon, electron, and energy sinks during the postpulse period. There were three distinct metabolic phases during this time. In phase I (0 to 50 seconds after the pulse), the carbon/electron balances closed up to 85%. The accumulation of glycolytic and storage compounds accounted for 60% of the consumed glucose, caused an energy depletion, and may have led to a temporary decrease in the anabolic flux. In phase II (50 to 150 seconds), the fermentative metabolism gradually became the most important carbon/electron sink. In phase III (150 to 300 seconds), 29% of the carbon uptake was not identified in the measurements, and the ATP balance had a large surplus. These results indicate an increase in the anabolic flux, which is consistent with macroscopic balances of extracellular fluxes and the observed increase in CO2 evolution associated with nonfermentative metabolism. The identified metabolic processes involving major carbon, electron, and energy sinks must be taken into account in in vivo kinetic models based on short-term dynamic metabolome responses.

In this kinematic regime other methods such as lattice QCD or effective field theories are more appropriate to investigate the appearance of a still unsettled phenomena: confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the confinement of quarks and gluons to hadrons allows crucial tests of fundamental symmetries that are inherent to the QCD Lagrangian but are broken in hadronic systems. Thus, high precision measurements of the production and decay of specific hadronic states provides decisive benchmarks to investigate the properties of QCD in this regime. A new series of experiments are being prepared using nearly full acceptance detector's for neutral and charged particles around internal targets in high intensity, phase-space-cooled hadronic beams. Later this year, it is planned to transfer the WASA detector from the CELSIUS to the COSY ring in order to measure the production and various decay channels of the η and η′ mesons, thereby investigating the violation of P, C. T. and combinations thereof, as well as isospin violation. The experimental and theoretical techniques employed here will provide an important basis to extend these investigations to the static and dynamical properties of hadrons with charm quark content with the high energy storage ling for antiprotons at the new GSI/FAIR facility. Additional related perspectives will be opened at the new facility ranging from the properties of hadrons in dense nuclear matter' to measurements of the nucleon's transverse spin distribution in the valence quark region using polarized antiprotons. © Indian Academy of Sciences.","Antiprotons; Charmonium; D mesons; Eta mesons; New facilities","Antiprotons; Charmonium; D mesons; Eta mesons; New facilities; Benchmarking; Electron energy levels; Kinematics; Perturbation techniques; Polarization; Quantum theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646434558

This relationship is based on the hypothesis postulating that a higher serum glucose and insulin response induced by high-glycaemic carbohydrates promotes lower fat oxidation and higher fat storage in comparison with low-glycaemic carbohydrates. Thus, high-glycaemic index meals could contribute to the maintenance of excess weight in obese individuals and/or predispose obesity-prone subjects to weight gain. Several studies comparing the effects of meals with contrasting glycaemic carbohydrates for hours, days or weeks have failed to demonstrate any differential effect on fuel partitioning when either substrate oxidation or body composition measurements were performed. Apparently, the glycaemic index-induced serum insulin differences are not sufficient in magnitude and/or duration to modify fuel oxidation. © 2006 The International Association for the Study of Obesity.","Body composition; Fuel oxidation; Glycaemic index; Obesity","fatty acid; fructose; glucose; lactose; body composition; carbohydrate metabolism; dietary intake; fatty acid oxidation; food intake; genetic predisposition; glucose blood level; human; insulin blood level; insulin response; lipid storage; measurement; obesity; review; Area Under Curve; Blood Glucose; Body Composition; Body Weight; Energy Metabolism; Glycemic Index; Humans; Insulin; Oxygen Consumption",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646010656

In this paper, we review the effect of diet, the intrauterine environment, and the genetic inheritance on obesity. We described a study in detail that used experimental animals as a model to investigate the effect of a parental high-fat diet on body-fat accumulation in their offspring. Fertilized eggs were transplanted in that study, and body-fat accumulation in the offspring of the parents fed a high-fat diet was found to be greater than in the offspring of the parents fed a low-fat diet, even when the experimental conditions were the same in the intrauterine and subsequent environment. The results suggested that a parental high-fat diet before intrauterine developmental stage may increase body-fat accumulation in the offspring. We discuss the possibility that parental diet may influence the lifelong health of offspring and epigenetic inheritance may be occurred. © 2006 The International Association for the Study of Obesity.","Epigenetic inheritance; High-fat diet; Offspring; Parental obesity","body fat; developing country; diabetes mellitus; DNA methylation; genetic epigenesis; heredity; human; infant nutrition; inheritance; lipid diet; lipid storage; maternal nutrition; mother child relation; obesity; prenatal growth; prevalence; progeny; review; Adult Children; Dietary Fats; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Maternal Nutrition Physiology; Obesity; Parents; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645991225

In contrast to other technologies, MAPS are fabricated using standard CMOS processes, which allows to implement on-chip data processing (system-on-chip). The paper concentrates on two aspects of the current R&D programme: the prototype for the upgrade of the vertex detector of the STAR experiment at the Brookhaven National Laboratory; architectures to handle the event rates expected at the International Linear Collider (ILC). The STAR experiment requires a sensor which operates at ambient temperatures. For this application, CMOS processes optimised for low leakage currents may be best suited.

Massive iron deposition in parenchymal organs, particularly in the liver, causes organ dysfunction, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and also hepatocellular carcinoma. To obtain deeper insight into the poorly understood and complex cellular response to iron overload and consequent oxidative stress, we studied iron overload in liver-derived HepG2 cells. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were exposed to a high concentration of iron for 3 days, and protein expression changes initiated by the iron overload were studied by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. From a total of 1,060 spots observed, 21spots were differentially expressed by iron overload. We identified 19 of them; 11 identified proteins were upregulated, whereas 8 identified proteins showed a decline in response to iron overload. The differentially expressed proteins are involved in iron storage, stress response and protection against oxidative stress, protein folding, energy metabolism, gene expression, cell cycle regulation, and other processes.

A detailed 2-D mathematical model is developed and validated against experimental and theoretical literature results. Based on recent advances in dynamic optimization, the objective is then to find the optimal process design (e.g. cooling systems design) and operating strategy (e.g. cooling fluid profile over time, hydrogen charging profile, etc.) so as to minimize the storing time, while satisfying, a number of operating constraints. Such constraints account for pressure drop limitations, cooling fluid availability and maximum tank temperature. Optimization results indicate that almost 60% improvement of the storage time can be achieved, over the case where the system is not optimized, for a minimum storage capacity of 99% of the total bed capacity. Trade-offs between various objectives, alternative design options and optimal cooling control policies are systematically revealed illustrating the potential offered by modern optimization techniques. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.",,"Mathematical models; Optimization; Pressure drop; Metal hydride beds; Optimal design; Storage capacity; Gas fuel storage; Hydrogen; Mathematical Models; Optimization; Pressure Gradient; Storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645737560

The experimental results show that the device may operate under either the fluid to fluid heat transfer with charging heat to the phase change material (PCM) or the fluid to fluid heat transfer with discharging heat from the PCM modes according to the initial temperature of the PCM. The melting/solidification curves, the performances of the heat pipes and the device, the influences of the inlet temperature and the mass flow rate of the cold water on the operation performance are investigated by extensive experiments. The experimental results also disclose that under the simultaneous charging/discharging operation mode, although the heat transfer from the hot water directly to the cold water may vary, it always takes up a major part of the total heat recovered by the cold water due to the very small thermal resistance compared with the thermal resistance of the PCM side. The melting/solidification processes taking place in the simultaneous charging/discharging operation are compared with those in the charging only and discharging only processes. By applying a simplified thermal resistance analysis, a criterion for predicting the exact operation modes was derived and used to explain the observed experimental phenomena. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Methane storage within dry and wet active carbons: a comparative study. Energy and Fuels 2003;17(5):1283-1291), methane storage by formation of methane hydrates within wet commercial active carbons (wetting ratio R=mass ratio water/carbon≈1) was investigated at 2 °C and up to 8 MPa. It was suspected from this study that more methane hydrate could be formed if more water was added. The present article is the continuation of this former work, and the pore volumes of the same materials were now saturated by water and investigated in the same T-P conditions. It is shown that, doing this, hydrate formation occurs at the lowest possible pressures (i.e. corresponding to those observed in bulk water) but poor results in terms of stored amounts are obtained. An optimal wetting ratio leading to the highest stored amounts was evidenced and found to be close to 1 whatever the pore texture of the carbon materials. Additionally, saturating the pore space with water further slows down the formation kinetics, which were already very long at R≈1. Finally, the role of an additive like sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) was investigated in one carbon; it is found that hydrates are formed at a rather low methane pressure, but the final amount stored is not higher than that previously obtained without adding SDS. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The system was filled with salty water of various densities to form three salty water zones (upper convective, non-convective and heat storage). During the months of January, May and August, a data acquisition device was used to measure and record the temperature readings at various locations in the pond (distributed vertically within and at the bottom of the pond, and horizontally and vertically within the insulated side-walls). In the theoretical part, we developed a performance model to determine the thermal efficiencies of the pond and its various zones. Temperature difference was seen to be the key driving force in heat transfer, particularly in heat rejection.

One-year-old Crassostrea gigas oysters were fed two different dietary rations (4% and 12% of oyster dry weight in algal dry weight per day) in controlled experimental conditions over an annual cycle. Oyster dry weights, carbohydrate and lipid contents, energetic adenylate charge, and hemocyte parameters of oysters were significantly affected by reproductive processes related to seasonal temperature variation and, to a lesser extent, by the dietary rations. Energy parameters decreased during gametogenesis as gonads developed then increased during the gonad resorption phase. The additional energy provided to oysters fed the 12% diet compared to oysters fed the 4% diet was allocated mainly to the development of more gonad tissue. Regardless of diet, hemocyte concentrations were also seasonally affected. Hemocyte concentrations were low during gametogenesis and significantly increased during the gonadal resorption and tissue restoration phase. Phagocytic activity and adhesive capacity of hemocytes were temporarily inhibited during gametogenesis and were at their lowest levels in June. Oysters fed the 12% diet had significantly higher hemocyte concentrations and lower phagocytosis activity and reactive oxygen species production compared to those fed the 4% diet. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In developmental steps spanning over 50 years the Rostock team investigated the energy metabolism and utilization of nutrients for fat synthesis (net energy fat (NEF)) in cattle, sheep, pigs, rabbits and poultry. The experiments, including 'pure nutrients' and different groups of feedstuffs and substrates, evaluated the relation between intake of a wide range of digestible nutrients and measured energy retention (ER) and maintenance energy requirement using a multiple regression model. A study based on a mathematical-biochemical model of intermediary nutrient utilization found that the relative utilization of the nutrients, protein and carbohydrates, for fat synthesis and for (non-thermic) maintenance and work (adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis) are similar; verified the higher efficiency (22%) of utilization of dietary fat for fat synthesis compared with oxidation for maintenance (ATP synthesis) as a result of the direct incorporation of fatty acids into body fat; developed a model of whole intermediary metabolism (ATP concept), which demonstrates that: (i) except for chemical heat regulation, all energy metabolic processes consume or produce ATP-bound energy; (ii) energy metabolism (heat production (HP)) is determined both quantitatively and qualitatively only by the efficiency with which substrates are used for ATP synthesis; (iii) the gain or secretion of body nutrients is only a storage or exchange of ATP potentials, misleadingly expressed in gross energy; and (iv) the incorporation of fatty acids and amino acids is seen only as a transfer of substrates and of their ATP potential with consumption of ATP-bound energy and not as the result of metabolic substrate synthesis. Therefore it follows for practical application that the basis for energetic feed efficiency has to be the potential in catabolic processes but not in anabolic processes. The ATP-related NE is to be used as the scale to characterize the energetic potential of nutrients and feedstuffs in the ATP pool, available for all performances (activities). The use of the ATP pool is mostly determined by animal factors (physiological state), which consequently must be defined by standards for nutritional requirements. As a final conclusion, the new revised Rostock Feed Evaluation System decided on 'net energy retention (NER)' as the measure of the relative utilization of the metabolizable energy (ME) of digestible nutrients for ATP synthesis (catabolic processes), derived from measurements of fat synthesis and, based on metabolism modelling, with the reduction of fat utilization to 92% of the utilization of carbohydrates. Consequently the equations for estimation of energetic values of feedstuffs and rations for cattle (c), pigs (p) and poultry (fowl; f) for practical use are: NERc= (7.2dCP+20dCF+10.1dSt+8.3dSu+8.2dNFR)-0 5574+0 0405DE-0 0002633DE2) NERp=11.0dCP+27dCF+ 12.7dSt + 11.6 dSu + 712 - 0.14 (80 - DE)dNFRA NERf=10.8dCP+29dCF+ 13.5dSt + 12.4 dSu + 10.5dNFR NERp=11.0dCP+27dCF+ 12.7dSt + 11.6 dSu + 712 - 0.14 (80 - DE)dNFRA NERf=10.8dCP+29dCF+ 13.5dSt + 12.4 dSu + 10.5dNFR where d = digestible, C = crude, P = protein, F = fat, St = starch, Su = sugar, NFR = nitrogen-free residue (fibre), DE = energy digestibility © CAB International 2006.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890288834

We introduce a new route to search for alloys that can yield superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen absorption, using an optical technique to measure the catalytic activity for hydrogen sorption of thin films. The catalytic activity of the noble metals Pd, Ni, Cu, Ag, Pt, and Au is studied as a function of hydrogen pressure and temperature. The rate-limiting step is identified by the pressure dependence and the normal isotope effect for hydrogen absorption. The measured rates and activation energies are correlated to such physical properties as activation barrier for dissociation and heat of solution. The observed compensation effect is explained in the framework of interplay between surface and bulk processes.

The operating variables included the methanol concentration, the flow rate and the flow direction of the reactants (methanol and air) in the stack. The temperature of the stack was autonomously increased in proportion to the magnitude of the electric load, but it decreased with an increase in the flow rates of the reactants. Although the operation of the stack was initiated at room temperature, under a certain condition the internal temperature of the stack was higher than 80 °C. A uniform distribution of the reactants to all the cells was a key factor in determining the performance of the stack. With the supply of 2 M methanol, a maximum power of the stack was found to be 54 W (85 mW cm-2) in air and 98 W (154 mW cm-2) in oxygen. Further, the system with counter-flow reactants produced a power output that was 20% higher than that of co-flow system. A post-load behavior of the stack was also studied by varying the electric load at various operating conditions. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This work reports, in detail, the first practical realization of a novel carbon electrode based on grafting of vinyltrimethoxysilane (vtmos) functional group for energy storage in electric double layer capacitor (EDLC). Surface modification with surfactant vtmos enhances the hydrophobisation of activated carbon and the affinity toward propylene carbonate (PC) solvent, which improves the wettability of activated carbon in the electrolyte solution based on PC solvent, resulting in not only a lower resistance to the transport of electrolyte ions within micropores of activated carbon but also more usable surface area for the formation of electric double layer, and accordingly, higher specific capacitance, energy density, and power capability available from the capacitor based on modified carbon. Especially, the effects from surface modification become superior at higher discharge rate, at which much better EDLC performance (i.e., much higher energy density and power capability) has been achieved by the modified carbon, suggesting that the modified carbon is a novel and very promising electrode material of EDLC for large current applications where both high energy density and power capability are required. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Capacitance; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Grafting (chemical); Ions; Surface active agents; Surface treatment; Wetting; EDLC; Electrolyte ions; Energy density; Hydrophobisation; Propylene carbonate; Vinyltrimethoxysilane; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646412576

We have developed the synthesis of porous graphitic carbon with a large and accessible surface area via synthesis of carboxyl-containing polymer particles, followed by ion exchange and pyrolysis at low temperature (850°C). The evolution of the graphitic structure together with mesoporosity is temperature dependent, as revealed from the results of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen sorption measurement. Specifically, the development of mesoporosity resulting from continuously catalyzed carbonization by the in situ formed cobalt nanoparticles can be clearly recognized. Further nitric acid oxidation leads to an increase of the pore volume due to the removal of cobalt nanoparticles and opening of closed pore entrances. Moreover, the use of silica as the isolating shell facilitates the formation of high surface area graphitic carbon.

Lead, silver, gold, palladium, copper and nickel were evaluated as deposition metals.

Maximum current efficiency of carbon monoxide was obtained at silver-modified p-InP photoelectrode (rf = 80.4%). On palladium-deposited p-InP electrode, the reduction product was only carbon monoxide. With nickel-deposited p-InP photoelectrode, hydrocarbons (methane and ethylene) were obtained with low Faradaic efficiencies 0.7% and 0.2%, in addition of the formations of CO and formic acid, respectively.

The composites with catalytic metals were processed by controlled mechanical milling (CMM) in the magneto-mill Uni Ball Mill 5 under protective Ar atmosphere. X-ray diffraction of the milled powders revealed the formation of Mg nanograins (50-60 nm range) interdispersed with the nanograined metal additives within the powder particles. Scanning electron microscopy showed particle size reduction after milling. After activation and hydrogenation in a Sieverts-type apparatus under about 2 MPa pressure of hydrogen, the tetragonal β-MgH2 hydride co-exists with the small amount of retained unreacted Mg phase and the small amount of MgO in all three composites. The β-MgH2 phase after hydrogenation is submicrocrystalline with the grain size in the range of 127-151 nm. The XRD pattern for Mg + 10 wt.%Y after hydrogenation also reveals the presence of YH3 and YH2 phases. A single peak of ZrH phase on the Mg + 10 wt.%Zr XRD pattern is detectable. Hydrogen desorption at 300, 325 and 350 °C under atmospheric pressure of hydrogen shows that the Mg + 10 wt.%V composite exhibits the highest rate of hydrogen desorption and the lowest activation energy. For submicrocrystalline composites with the V and Y additives two-step desorption is observed when tested in TGA apparatus. A trend of decreasing DSC desorption peak temperature with decreasing powder particle size is also observed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is an option available to governments and industry to help meet emission reduction levels. In addition to increasing the production of oil, the CO 2 can be stored in the oil reservoir for a very long period of time. However, CO2 capture and CO2 EOR operation result in significant costs and energy penalties, for example, CO2 capture from a point source, transportation to the site of use, and recycling produced CO2. This article evaluates the life cycle of CO2 storage from delivery to the oil field through the production, transportation, and refining of the oil and identifies opportunities for optimization. Information from the IEA GHG Weyburn Monitoring and Storage Project is used to provide baseline information for the storage of CO2. The value of this life-cycle study lies in the development of an understanding of the ""carbon"" economics of the EOR process and the impact on net storage of changes to the value of different components in the chain. These results provide a mechanism whereby environmental consequences can be evaluated within economic decision-making. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Costs; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Greenhouse effect; Life cycle; Mass transportation; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Storage (materials); Case study; Economic optimization; Geological storage; Weyburn unit; Industrial emissions; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Greenhouse effect; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Mass transportation; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Storage (materials)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646378925

The model is developed based on the desire to operate the desorber at higher pressures than normal (&gt;2 bar). The reason for this was to investigate whether it was possible to operate at pressures where the compressor for CO2 recompression to storage pressures of 100-140 bar could be avoided altogether, or at least where the recompression energy requirement would be significantly reduced. The idea was that adding an inert immiscible component to the desorber would give an independent addition to the pressure and thereby the total pressure could be increased. The model simulates this three-phase process in order to investigate the effects of adding an immiscible organic component to the unit to control reboiler temperature. MEA was used as an example absorbent. The results show that the desorption process using MEA is very sensitive to the reboiler temperature. The reboiler and desorber column temperatures are reduced significantly as hydrocarbon is added to the system, but unfortunately at the cost of increased reboiler duties. The driving force for desorption using MEA is lowered even though the acid gas is diluted throughout the column. This is due to the strong temperature dependency of the CO2 partial pressure over MEA. Simulations of a hypothetical amine have been performed to investigate whether a compound with more favorable properties could exist. It was found that, in order for an addition of hydrocarbon not to increase the reboiler heat duty, it would have to have unrealistic thermodynamic properties and the effect on the absorber operation would be very negative, leading to the conclusion that such a solvent would be impossible to use for postcombustion CO2 removal. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Amines; Carbon dioxide; Compressors; Gas absorption; High pressure engineering; Reboilers; Thermodynamic properties; Computational models; Monoethanolamine (MEA); Recompression; Regeneration unit; Regenerators; Amines; Carbon dioxide; Compressors; Gas absorption; High pressure engineering; Reboilers; Regenerators; Thermodynamic properties",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646245926

The procedure includes centrifugation of the dispersion concurrently with the phase transition of the particles and allows precise quantification of dispersion stability in terms of a critical pressure, at which the coalescence between the dispersed particles/drops takes place. The method is applied for studying the effects of surfactant type and concentration on the stability of paraffin-in-water dispersions, which have potential application in energy storage and transportation systems. Several types of water-soluble surfactants (anionic, nonionic, and polymeric) are compared, whereas hexadecane or tetradecane is used as a dispersed phase. Most of the studied individual surfactants are found to be inefficient stabilizers (except for the nonionic Tween 40 and Tween 60). However, the dispersion stability increases significantly after the addition of appropriate cosurfactants, such as hexadecanol, Brij 52, or cocoamidopropyl betaine. Surfactants and cosurfactants with longer hydrophobic tails are better stabilizers than those with shorter tails. The obtained results are discussed from the viewpoint of the mechanisms of particle/drop coalescence during the solid-liquid-phase transition. The consistency and the undercooling temperatures of the studied dispersions are also discussed, because these properties are important for their practical applications. The proposed procedure for evaluation of dispersion stability and some of the conclusions could be relevant to food emulsions, in which dispersed fat particles undergo solid-liquid-phase transition of similar type. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Coalescence; Dispersions; Hydrophobicity; Paraffins; Particles (particulate matter); Phase transitions; Dispersed particles; Dispersion stability; Solid-liquid-phase transition; Water-soluble surfactants; Surface active agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646351279

Many types of memories used in embedded systems allow multiple operating modes (e.g. active, standby, nap, power-down) to facilitate energy saving. Furthermore, it has been known that the potential energy saving increases when the embedded systems use multiple memory banks in which their operating modes are controlled independently. The authors propose a compiler-directed integrated approach to the problem of maximally utilising the operating modes of multiple memory banks by solving the three important tasks simultaneously: (1) assignment of variables to memory banks, (2) scheduling of memory access operations and (3) determination of operating modes of banks. Specifically, for an instance of tasks 1 and 2, the authors formulate task 3 as a shortest path (SP) problem in a network and solved it optimally. Then, an SP-based heuristic that solves tasks 2 and 3 efficiently in an integrated fashion is developed. Then the proposed approach is extended to address the limited register constraint in the processor. From experiments with a set of benchmark programs, it is confirmed that the proposed approach is able to reduce the energy consumption by 15.76% over that by the conventional approach.",,"Computer program listings; Data storage equipment; Energy utilization; Potential energy; Program processors; Benchmark programs; Memory access scheduling; Multi-bank memory systems; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645507021

Our previous work demonstrated the excellent life performance of polymer electrolyte (PE)-type lithium-ion polymer cells in a vacuum. In this work, we determine whether this type of cell cycles normally in a space environment. We conducted endurance testing for γ-ray radiation and vibration of the PE cells, simulating a microsatellite launch. The γ-ray radiation testing revealed that these cells have excellent resistance to γ-ray exposure in simulated low-Earth-orbit (LEO) and geostationary-Earth-orbit (GEO) environments. Vibration testing in an ultrahigh vacuum (10-6 Pa) demonstrated that the cells could endure a microsatellite launch when fastened only with aluminum tape. During this testing, we did not detect any gas components associated with cell solvents. The promising results led us to conclude that PE cells can store power well for an LEO or GEO microsatellite. © 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

Observational studies have demonstrated the association between life style and prevention of chronic diseases in the general population. These studies have been showed a reduction of morbidity for vascular diseases in trained subjects who present adequate cardiovascular fitness and practise regular exercise. The exercise-related protective effects may be mediated in part through components of the metabolic syndrome: improved insulin sensitivity, decreased weight and visceral fat accumulation, reduced low density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides, increased high density lipoprotein (HDL), decreased blood pressure. These effects are more significant in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), because hyperglycemia-related morbidity and mortality are associated with chronic complications. In particular, improved insulin sensitivity may determine a better glucose profile which in turn may positively influence the diabetes-related microvascular complications. Furthermore, improved blood pressure and normalization of lipid profile may also contribute to the prevention of vascular complications. Nonetheless, physical activity can improve psychological well-being by increasing self-esteem and enhancing quality of life. Although patients with T1DM may participate in all kind of sports and physical activities, there are several potential adverse events, including hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes, that can occur. Thus, patients and health professionals have to know in details the physiological effect of physical exercise and its metabolic events in order sport to be healthy and enjoyable for all children, adolescents and young adults with T1DM. © Mattioli 1885.","Childhood; Diabetes; Physical exercise","glucose; insulin; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; fatty acid; insulin; blood pressure regulation; child care; child development; child growth; conference paper; exercise; fitness; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin sensitivity; ketoacidosis; lifestyle modification; lipid storage; metabolic syndrome X; microangiopathy; morbidity; mortality; physical activity; protein blood level; quality of life; sport; vascular disease; adolescent; adult; child; diabetic retinopathy; energy metabolism; female; glucose blood level; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; infant; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; ketoacidosis; kinesiotherapy; male; metabolism; motor activity; multimodality cancer therapy; pathophysiology; preschool child; review; skeletal muscle; Adolescent; Adult; Blood Glucose; Child; Child, Preschool; Combined Modality Therapy; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetic Retinopathy; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemia; Infant; Insulin; Ketosis; Male; Motor Activity; Muscle, Skeletal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750093078

In these areas, it is essential to make use of water from underground reservoirs, most of which are over exploited and suffer from saline contamination given their proximity to the sea. The desalination of brackish water is a means of obtaining low cost drinking water. The method of desalination designed in this paper uses an electrodialysis system fed by photovoltaic modules that is simple, reliable, and low cost because it does not include battery storage or a battery regulator. These systems are of particular interest for isolated zones with access to wells of brackish water where connection to the electric grid is not possible. In this paper, the feasibility of the desalination of brackish water using an electrodialysis system powered by photovoltaic energy and the influence of experimental parameters has been studied. Likewise, a mathematical simulation model that allows predicting and simulating the functioning of a system of these characteristics under different meteorological conditions has been developed. The model has been applied with satisfactory results to the desalination of a NaCl solution in different experimental conditions. Data given by the mathematical simulation model was contrasted with experimental results in order to compare the reliability of the model, and good agreement was obtained.

The layered TiO2/ITO films exhibited a strongly polycrystalline structure that comprises anatase and rutile phases, as revealed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra. The X-ray photoelectron spectrum of Ti2p also verified the stoichiometric state of titanium oxide near the surface. The photo-induced hydrophilic properties of the films were determined from changes in the water contact angles under ultra-violet (UV) irradiation. The results revealed that the layered TiO 2/ITO films possessed a dissipated rate of 30% when they were stored in the dark for 12 h. This result shows that the layered TiO2/ITO films acted as ""electron pools"" with an inherent energy storage capability. This unique property is attributable to the rougher surface and nearly porosity-free columnar structure, which is responsible for increased UV energy absorption and loss-free hole or electron transportation. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The wind energy conversion system is modelled by a squirrel cage asynchronous induction machine (ASM). The grid is modelled as an infinite bus. In the proposed system the ASM is connected to the grid through a DC-link with incorporated battery storage. An ultracapacitor (UCap) bank in parallel to the battery reduces the current ripple which is originated by the PWM – IGBT bridges and absorbs rapid power peaks. Different degrees of grid strength for 2 disturbing events (A: 3-phase fault and B: Voltage dip) are studied. The simulation model permits a sizing of the storage system according to the desired stabilizing capabilities of the system. From the simulation results can be concluded that under weak grid conditions the DC-link need to have a voltage control to ensure the stability of the system. Special attention must be paid to the power quality at the inverter output of the DC-link if renewable generation exceeds 5% of the short circuit power at the coupling point. The simulated ASM generator is rated at 75 kW / 400 V. The DC-link operates at 700 V nominal voltage, the battery is rated at 340 kWh (C = 500 Ah), 34 kW at discharge rate C0.1 and 170 kW at discharge rate C0.5 with a UCap of 0.5 F in parallel, rated at 600 A discharge current. © 2006, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

The use of PCM in a water tank working with a solar system is able to store a lot of energy, but it is necessary to transfer this energy to the water during demand. Optimization of the natural convection to the water is of great importance for the heat transfer. External fins increase the heat transfer surface and the heat transfer coefficient changes. Experimental work was carried out to determine natural convection heat transfer coefficients for PCM modules with two different external vertical fin geometries. Results were presented as a temperature variation over time of the PCM and the water, and the heat transfer coefficient as a function of the temperature difference for different fins. These results were used to validate a simulation code to determine the behaviour of the system using finned PCM modules. The results prove the technical potential of external fins for heat storage systems using PCM. The experimental results were used to determine different correlations for Nusselt number as a function of different dimensionless numbers. © 2006, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

In order to make efficient investment decisions for the future transmission grid, factors such as the integration of renewables in the grid and international trade have to be taken into account. The increased international energy flows due to trade in a consumer environment which expects the reliability of supply to increase, or at least remain at its current level, makes it clear that investments to increase the scarcely available cross-border transfer capacities are needed. Building new transmission lines could alleviate this problem. However, this is often unacceptable due to social and political circumstances. The development of new transmission technologies looks promising in this respect. The unpredictable behaviour of renewables makes it hard to balance consumed and generated electric power. This creates excellent opportunities for energy storage. Although electrical energy storage always has been regarded as not economical, recent developments have provided some new opportunities.

Commercial weight loss programmes have been shown to be better than standard management, and in some areas in the UK general practitioners are now enlisting commercial slimming organisations to help patients lose weight. One such approach is called 'Slimming on Referral', which has reported some short-term success to date without the robust methodology of a longitudinal randomised controlled trial to support these findings. Results from this study are in line with a substantial body of previous research which indicates that interventions for obesity demonstrate moderate success in promoting short-term weight loss. There is, however, almost no evidence that the vast majority of people can maintain clinically significant weight loss over the long term and virtually everyone returns to their baseline weight. Furthermore, research suggests that weight fluctuation may have profound effects on psychological and physical health. The present paper highlights the need to reappraise the management of obesity in type 2 diabetes in the light of these research findings, and suggests an approach to treatment which would help patients to limit the associated physical and psychological cost and importantly ensure that the treatment itself does not compound their difficulties.

Generator bus voltage magnitudes, transformer tap settings and reactive power generation of the capacitor bank are taken as the control variables. While solving the RPP problem using genetic algorithm, the voltage magnitudes are taken as continuous variables, whereas the transformer tap setting and the reactive power generation of capacitor are taken as discrete variables. A binary-coded GA with tournament selection, two point crossover and bit-wise mutation is used to solve this mixed-integer non-linear optimization problem. Some modifications have been made in the representation of the solution variables in the genetic population in order to take care of the discrete nature of transformer tap setting and capacitor bank. The proposed algorithm has been applied to find the optimal reactive power control variables in IEEE 30-bus system and in a practical Indian power system and is found to be more effective than the conventional methods and the simple Genetic Algorithm.","Genetic Algorithm; Line loss minimization; Reactive Power Planning; Voltage stability","Capacitor storage; Electric losses; Electric power generation; Electric transformers; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Power control; Reactive power; control system; energy planning; genetic algorithm; optimization; power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748671824

A scientifically-based standardized locomotor assessment should be an essential part of medical examinations in research and clinical practice. There has been no previous consensus regarding which test procedures should be included in a locomotor assessment. The goal of this article is to provide a rationale for the selection of appropriate locomotor tests in a comprehensive locomotor assessment for elderly patients. We propose that a locomotor assessment should comprise the parameters that have been proven predictive for both falls and impending disability. The parameters should be measured in the standard units of physics. Therefore, we propose the following tests for a standardized locomotor assessment: (1) Self-selected gait velocity as the single best measure of general locomotor status and a good predictor of age-related adverse events; (2) Chair rise test (timed 5 chair rises) which measures power on vertical movement and the hip surrounding muscles as the most important neuromuscular risk factor for falls and fall-related fractures; (3) Tandem standing and tandem walking to measure postural capacity (balance) to the side; (4) Timed up and go test as a global screening procedure; (5) Clinical gait analysis with special focus on regularity; and (6) At least on a research level, movement must be measured referring to the terms of physics by mechanography. Mechanography (Leonardo force plate system, Novotec Pforzheim, Germany) records the time course of ground reaction forces, velocity of the vertical movements of the center of mass and power during unrestricted physiological movements. In the mechanogram the eccentric and concentric phases of movements can be differentiated and the storage of energy in the elastic elements of the body can be examined. The kinetics of human movement is explained by mechanograms of a two-legged jump. The ground reaction forces resulting from a jump down from a height of 0,46 m are demonstrated as a performance that is representative for human coordination. One goal of this text is to underline the insights that arise if the rules of physics are applied to human movement. A deeper understanding enables us to create more effective treatments for disorders of the muscle-bone unit. Bringing physics and cybernetics into the field of osteoporosis is a great heritage of Harold Frost.","Age-related Falls; Frailty; Locomotor Assessment; Mechanography; Muscle Power","anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; benzodiazepine derivative; neuroleptic agent; body equilibrium; body movement; elderly care; falling; fragility fracture; frail elderly; gait; ground reaction force; human; locomotion; nonhuman; osteoporosis; prediction; review; risk factor; senescence; side effect; standing; walking; Accidental Falls; Age Factors; Aged; Bone Density; Frail Elderly; Gait; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Motor Activity; Musculoskeletal Equilibrium; Risk Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746880242

Intensive research on the physiology, biochemistry and molecular genetics of the metabolism of PHAs during last two decades has increased our knowledge on the biosynthesis of these polyesters in bacteria and also showed various applications of these polymers. Prokaryotes synthesize a wide range of different PHAs and accumulate them as insoluble inclusions in the cytoplasm for storage of carbon and energy. Naturally, PHAs are synthesized from coenzyme A thioesters of the hydroxyalkanoic acids, which are synthesized during fatty acid metabolism. Due to similarities of physical and material properties with conventional plastics, PHAs can be recommended for application in various areas like industries, medicine, pharmacy and agriculture. They are thermoplastic and/or elastomeric, insoluble in water, enantiomerically pure, non toxic, biocompatible, piezoelectric and exhibit a high degree of polymerization. For economical production of PHAs, various bacterial strains have been exploited with new fermentation strategies and cheap renewable carbon sources. Transgenic plants have been studied for production of PHAs to compete with production cost of petroleum based bulk plastics.

We present a simplified classification of treatable inborn errors of metabolism in three groups. Group 1 includes inborn errors of intermediary metabolism that give rise to an acute or chronic intoxication. It encompasses aminoacidopathies, organic acidurias, urea cycle disorders, sugar intolerances, metal disorders and porphyrias. Clinical expression can be acute or systemic or can involve a specific organ, and can strike in the neonatal period or later and intermittently from infancy to late adulthood. Most of these disorders are treatable and require the emergency removal of the toxin by special diets, extracorporeal procedures, cleansing drugs or vitamins. Group 2 includes inborn errors of intermediary metabolism that affect the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial energetic processes. Cytoplasmic defects encompass those affecting glycolysis, glycogenosis, gluconeogenesis, hyperinsulinisms, and creatine and pentose phosphate pathways; the latter are untreatable. Mitochondrial defects include respiratory chain disorders, and Krebs cycle and pyruvate oxidation defects, mostly untreatable, and disorders of fatty acid oxidation and ketone bodies that are treatable. Group 3 involves cellular organelles and includes lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. Among these, some lysosomal disorders can be efficiently treated by enzyme replacement or substrate reduction therapies. Physicians can be faced with the possibility of a treatable inborn error in an emergency, either in the neonatal period or late in infancy to adulthood, or as chronic and progressive symptoms - general (failure to thrive), neurological, or specific for various organs or systems. These symptoms are summarized in four tables.

At the same time, rising rates of obesity and overweight in children, even at pre-school ages, have shifted efforts towards the identification of very early factors that predict risk of subsequent obesity, which may allow early targeted interventions. Overall, higher birth weight is positively associated with subsequent greater body mass index in childhood and later life; however, the relationship is complex. Higher birth weight is associated with greater subsequent lean mass, rather than fat mass. In contrast, lower birth weight is associated with a subsequent higher ratio of fat mass to lean mass, and greater central fat and insulin resistance. This paradoxical effect of lower birth weight is at least partly explained by the observation that infants who have been growth restrained in utero tend to gain weight more rapidly, or 'catch up', during the early postnatal period, which leads to increased central fat deposition. There is still debate as to whether there are critical early periods for obesity: does excess weight gain during infancy, childhood or even very early neonatal life have a greater impact on long-term fat deposition and insulin resistance? Early identification of childhood obesity risk will be aided by identification of maternal and fetal genes that regulate fetal nutrition and growth, and postnatal genes that regulate appetite, energy expenditure and the partitioning of energy intake into fat or lean tissue growth.

In the respiro-fermentative phase, the NADH level was kept high and respiration was suppressed, and glucose was anabolized into trehalose and glycogen at a rate comparable to that of catabolism. On the transition to the respiratory phase, cAMP levels increased triggering the breakdown of storage carbohydrates and the increased influx of glucose into the glycolytic pathway activated production of glycerol and ethanol consuming NADH. The resulting increase in the NAD +/NADH ratio stimulated respiration in combination with a decrease in the level of ATP, which was consumed mainly in the formation of biomass accompanying budding, and the accumulated ethanol and glycerol were gradually degraded by respiration via NAD+-dependent oxidation to acetate and the respiratory phase ceased after the recovery of NADH and ATP levels. However, the mRNA levels of both synthetic and degradative enzymes of storage carbohydrates were increased around the early respiro-fermentative phase, when storage carbohydrates are being synthesized, suggesting that the synthetic enzymes were expressed directly as active forms while the degradative enzymes were activated late by cAMP. In summary, the energy-metabolism oscillation is basically regulated by a feedback loop of oxido-reductive reactions of energy metabolism mediated by metabolites like NADH and ATP, and is modulated by metabolism of storage carbohydrates in combination of post-translational and transcriptional regulation of the related enzymes. A potential mechanism of energy-metabolism oscillation is proposed. © 2006 The Authors.","Continuous culture; Dissipative structure; Energy-metabolism oscillation; NADH; Trehalose","acetic acid; adenosine triphosphate; alcohol; carbohydrate; cyclic AMP; enzyme; glycerol; glycogen; messenger RNA; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; trehalose; aerobic cell culture; alcohol production; article; biomass; carbohydrate metabolism; catabolism; cell respiration; controlled study; energy metabolism; enzyme regulation; feedback system; fermentation; fungus culture; gluconeogenesis; glucose transport; glycolysis; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; signal transduction; transcription regulation; yeast; Adenosine Triphosphate; Aerobiosis; Blotting, Northern; Cell Culture Techniques; Cyclic AMP; Energy Metabolism; Fermentation; Kinetics; NAD; Oxygen Consumption; Periodicity; Respiration; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646886193

The results of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) under non-isothermal conditions with different heating rates (5, 10, 15, 20° K/min) are reported and discussed here. The glass transition temperature Tg and the onset crystallization temperature Tc were found to be dependent on the composition as well as on the heating rate. The activation energy for glass transition Eg and the activation energy for crystallization E c are calculated using Kissinger's equation and their compositional dependence is discussed. The glass forming ability lies in the range 0.4-0.6. The present investigations indicate that the above-mentioned quaternary material with a typical composition (x = 0.2) is good for phase change optical memory. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.",,"Composition effects; Crystallization; Differential scanning calorimetry; Evaporation; Glass transition; Reaction kinetics; Silver alloys; AgInSbTe alloy; Compositional dependence; Phase change recording; Thermal evaporation; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646722533

This distribution consists of an intrinsic (main) and an extrinsic (tail) branch. In this work, the method of activation energy analysis on individual cells is introduced for retention tail characterization and explained in detail. The formalism of activation energies (Ea) provides information about the mechanisms involved. Activation energies of single cells in a 256M DDR memory chip and their dependence on negative gate bias (VNWLL) as well as body bias (VBB) have been investigated intensively for the first time. Worst tail cells - all within a small retention time interval - show a twofold and wide distribution of activation energies. The lower Ea distribution can be altered with VNWLL, whereas the higher Ea distribution only alters with VBB. Going from tail towards main distribution, the percentage of cells belonging to the low Ea part continuously decreases and finally disappears. We therefore conclude that a gate induced mechanism (GIDL) is the main component responsible for DRAM retention tail. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we studied the physiological means used by golden spiny mice for conserving energy during food restriction and refeeding and the mechanism by which food consumption may influence thermoregulatory mechanisms and metabolic rate. As comparison, we studied the response to food restriction of another rocky desert rodent, Wagner's gerbil, which accumulates large seed caches. Ten out of 12 food-restricted spiny mice (resistant) were able to defend their body mass after an initial decrease, as opposed to Wagner's gerbils (n = 6). Two of the spiny mice (nonresistant) kept losing weight, and their food restriction was halted. In four resistant and two nonresistant spiny mice, we measured heart rate, body temperature, and oxygen consumption during food restriction. The resistant spiny mice significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced energy expenditure and entered daily torpor. The nonresistant spiny mice did not reduce their energy expenditure. The gerbils' response to food restriction was similar to that of the nonresistant spiny mice. Resistant spiny mice leptin levels dropped significantly (n = 6, P &lt; 0.05) after 24 h of food restriction, and continued to decrease throughout food restriction, as did body fat. During refeeding, although the golden spiny mice gained fat, leptin levels were not correlated with body mass (r2 = 0.014). It is possible that this low correlation allows them to continue eating and accumulate fat when food is plentiful.

We argue that patterns of mammalian feeding have evolved to control energy balance in uncertain environments. It is, therefore, expected that, under sedentary conditions in which the diet is rich in nutrients and abundantly available, animals and man will overeat. This suggests that no physiological defects are needed to induce overweight and ultimately obesity in man. Several considerations arise from these observations. The time period over which energy balance is controlled is far longer than allowed by most experiments. Physiological models of energy balance control often treat excess energy intake as a defect of regulation; ecological models view the same behaviour as part of normal energy balance control in environments where resources are uncertain. We apply these considerations to common patterns of human and animal feeding. We believe that the ecological perspective gives a more accurate explanation for the functionality of excess fat and the need to defend nutrient balance and avoid gross imbalances, as well as explaining hyperphagia in the face of plenty. By emphasising the common features of energy balance control in different mammalian species, the importance of changes in behaviour to accommodate changes in the environment becomes apparent. This also opens up possibilities for the control of body weight and the treatment of obesity in man. © The Authors 2006.","Animal models; Body weight; Ecology; Energy balance; Feeding behaviour; Man","fat; lipid; aerobic metabolism; animal food; body weight; bovids; caloric intake; dietary intake; ecology; energy balance; energy consumption; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; environmental factor; feeding behavior; food intake; food quality; human; human versus animal comparison; hyperphagia; lipid storage; malnutrition; mammal; nonhuman; nutrient; nutrient content; nutritional deficiency; obesity; overnutrition; pathophysiology; physical activity; physiology; review; rodent; species; thermogenesis; wildlife; Animals; Body Weight; Ecosystem; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Food Habits; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Motor Activity; Animalia; Bovidae; Mammalia; Rodentia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646444597

By employing a radio frequency radial dipole field kicker, particle spin directions can be rotated slowly over many turns. A model which couples three dimensional spin motion and longitudinal particle motion was constructed to describe nonequilibrium spin dynamics in high energy electron storage rings. The effects of a stochastic synchrotron radiation on the orbital motion in the accelerator synchrotron plane and its influence on the spin motion are studied. The main contributions to the spin motion, the synchrotron oscillations and the stochastic synchrotron radiation, have different influence on the spin polarization reversal in different regions of the parameter space. The results indicate that polarization reversal might be obtained in high energy electron storage rings with a significant noise even with relatively small strengths of a perturbing magnetic field. The only experimental datum avaliable agrees with the model prediction, however further experimental data would be necessary to validate the model.","High energy electron ring; Polarization reversal; Spin flip; Spin motion","High energy physics; Oscillations; Polarization; Spurious signal noise; Synchrotron radiation; Synchrotrons; High energy electron ring; Polarization reversal; Spin flip; Spin motion; Electrons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646394375

This implies that any large anomalies of oceanic and atmospheric energy transport should be equal and opposite. This simple scenario has become known as Bjerknes compensation. A long control run of the Third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Model (HadCM3) has been investigated. It was found that northern extratropical decadal anomalies of atmospheric and oceanic energy transports are significantly anticorrelated and have similar magnitudes, which is consistent with the predictions of Bjerknes compensation. The degree of compensation in the northern extratropics was found to increase with increasing time scale. Bjerknes compensation did not occur in the Tropics, primarily as large changes in the surface fluxes were associated with large changes in the TOA fluxes. In the oce an, the decadal variability of the energy transport is associated with fluctuations in the meridional overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean. A stronger Atlantic Ocean energy transport leads to strong warming of surface temperatures in the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian (GIN) Seas, which results in a reduced equator-to-pole surface temperature gradient and reduced atmospheric baroclinicity. It is argued that a stronger Atlantic Ocean energy transport leads to a weakened atmospheric transient energy transport. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Computer simulation; Energy transfer; Heat flux; Heat storage; Oceanography; Tropics; Climate model; Extratropical decadal anomalies; Oceanic energy transports; Oceanic heat storage; Climatology; atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric general circulation model; baroclinic mode; climate modeling; decadal variation; oceanic general circulation model; sea surface temperature; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Greenland Sea; Iceland; Norwegian Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646357897

Obesity is associated with several endocrine disorders, including adrenocortical malfunction. Because of the central role of adrenal function in the body's homeostasis, adrenal malfunction is important in the development of other obesity-related abnormalities.

Relativistic rare isotopes produced via projectile fragmentation and fission were separated in flight by the fragment separator FRS and injected into the storage ring ESR. This worldwide unique experimental method gives access to all fragments with half-lives down to the microsecond range. The great research potential is demonstrated by the discovery of new isotopes along with simultaneous mass and lifetime measurements. Single particle decay measurements and the continuous recording of both stored mother and daughter nuclei open up a new era for nuclear spectroscopy. The study of bare and few-electron nuclei has also important astrophysical relevance with respect to the hot stellar conditions where reactions and decay are influenced by the degree of atomic ionization. The future international NUSTAR facility at FAIR consisting of a new large-acceptance in-flight separator (Super-FRS) and a dedicated storage ring system (CR-RESR-NESR) will be an ideal tool to study nuclei with new probes and to investigate the majority of relevant r- and rp-process nuclei which are not in reach with the present-day facilities. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In the Indian nuclear fuel cycle, right from inception, a closed loop option has been adopted where spent fuel is reprocessed to recover plutonium and unused uranium. The emphasis has been to recover actinides, individual fission products and recycle them back to the fuel cycle or use them for various industrial applications. The development of innovative treatment processes for low and intermediate level wastes in recent times has focused on volume reduction as one of the main objectives. In the case of high-level liquid waste, vitrification in borosilicate matrix is being practiced using induction heated metallic melters at industrial scale plants at Tarapur and Trombay. Currently, there are seven operating near surface disposal facilities co-located with power/research reactors in various parts of the country for disposal of low and intermediate level solid wastes. These are routinely subjected to monitoring and safety/performance assessment. An interim storage facility is operational for the storage of vitrified high-level waste overpacks for 30 years or more. Nation wide screening of potential regions and evaluation of rock mass characteristics is in progress for ongoing geological repository programme. Preliminary design and layout of an underground research laboratory/repository has also been initiated. A research programme is underway for long-term evaluation of vitrified waste product under simulated repository conditions. Research is also directed towards development of advanced technologies for waste processing as well as conditioning in vitreous and ceramic matrices. The Department of Atomic Energy with participation of the Indian industry has developed all essential remote-handling gadgets required for operation and maintenance of waste management system and assemblies including decommissioning. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, the efforts made towards elucidating the mechanisms controlling the major regulatory pathways are now being rewarded. At the molecular level, the crucial role of transcription factors is particularly well-illustrated by the link between alterations of their functions and the occurrence of major metabolic diseases. In addition, the possibility of manipulating the ligand-dependent activity of some of these transcription factors makes them attractive as therapeutic targets. The aim of this review is to summarize recent knowledge on the transcriptional control of metabolic homeostasis. We first review data on the transcriptional regulation of the intermediary metabolism, i.e., glucose, amino acid, lipid, and cholesterol metabolism. Then, we analyze how transcription factors integrate signals from various pathways to ensure homeostasis. One example of this coordination is the daily adaptation to the circadian fasting and feeding rhythm. This section also discusses the dysregulations causing the metabolic syndrome, which reveals the intricate nature of glucose and lipid metabolism and the role of the transcription factor PPARγ in orchestrating this association. Finally, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic regulations, which provide new opportunities for treating complex metabolic disorders.

We hypothesized earlier that this consistent change in foraging behavior is a symptom of a disease, as it is a contagious phenomenon. Here we describe more symptoms by comparing mated females of this population (non-responding (NR) population) with mated females of other populations that are strongly attracted to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (responding populations). The most apparent characteristic of the NR population was the presence of numerous dorso-ventrally flattened females (76% of all females). These females had a normal size after mating but shrank during adulthood. Independent of their age, shrunken females did not reproduce and died a few days after shrinking. In addition to these profound differences in short term performance, females from the NR-population showed behavioral changes, including a lower degree of attraction to herbivore-induced plant volatiles, a higher tendency to leave a prey-patch and a lower predation rate. Moreover, about half of the live females of the NR-population carried birefringent dumbbell-shaped crystals in the legs whereas live females of a responding population carried crystals only in the lumen of the Malpighian tubules and the rectum. The symptom 'crystals in the legs' was correlated with low reproduction. Energy dispersive X-ray diffraction of these crystals revealed that they contain calcium and phosphorus along with carbon and oxygen. Crystals with comparable elemental compositions and the same characteristic concentric layering are well known in insects, where they are thought to play a major role in detoxification of calcium and heavy metals, and in storage of phosphorus. The fraction of predators carrying a white spot in the distal part of the opisthosoma, due to accumulation of excretory material in the rectum, was the same in both populations. Present results are discussed in the context of mite pathology and biological control. © Springer 2006.","Acari; Biological control; Crystals; Disease symptoms; Excretion; Fecundity; Foraging behavior; Mortality; Phytoseiidae; Predation rate; Size; Walking speed","acaricide; birefringence; foraging behavior; herbivore; mating behavior; mite; reproduction; X-ray diffraction; acari; aging; animal; animal disease; article; body size; egg laying; female; fertility; growth, development and aging; histology; male; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; plant leaf; predation; walking; Acari; Aging; Animal Diseases; Animals; Body Size; Female; Fertility; Male; Oviposition; Plant Leaves; Predatory Behavior; Walking; Acari; Hexapoda; Insecta; Phytoseiidae; Phytoseiulus persimilis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645843625

The PS accelerator load demands periodic, active, and reactive power pulses of about 2-s duration and a magnitude of up to 45 MW and 65 Mvar. The proposed compensator is able to control both reactive and active power exchange with the network in order to eliminate network disturbances. The controllability study reveals that the best control strategy is to use a q-axis converter input for active power and a d-axis input for reactive power regulation. An analytical system model is created to study the system dynamics and to aid the controller design. The eigenvalue study with the MATLAB model reveals that with large energy storage units and small converter losses, there is only a small interaction between the control channels. The final testing is done with a detailed nonlinear model in PSCAD/EMTDC. The simulation results show that it is possible to fully compensate the active power exchange with the network during typical accelerator cycles and, at the same time, to achieve excellent ac voltage control. © 2006 IEEE.","Accelerator power supply; Eigenvalues; Energy storage; Proton accelerators; Pulsewidth-modulated power converters; Root loci; State-space methods","Capacitor storage; Computer simulation; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Electric converters; Mathematical models; Particle accelerators; Reactive power; Root loci; State space methods; Systems analysis; Accelerator power supply; Controller design; Pulsewidth-modulated power converters; Reactive power pulses; System dynamics; System model; Voltage-source converter (VSC); Electric power systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645730360

The system minimizes the energy requirement of the vehicle and can work with different primary power sources like fuel cells, microturbines, zinc-air batteries, or other power supplies with a poor ability to recover energy from a regenerative braking, or with a scarce power capacity for a fast acceleration. The experimental HEV uses lead-acid batteries, an ultracapacitor (UCAP) bank, and a brushless dc motor with nominal power of 32 kW, and a peak power of 53 kW. The digital signal processor (DSP) control system measures and stores the following parameters: primary-source voltage, car speed, instantaneous currents in both terminals (primary source and UCAP), and actual voltage of the UCAP. When UCAPs were installed on the vehicle, the increase in range was around 5.3% in city tests. However, when optimal control with NN was used, this figure increased to 8.9%.

This requires an accurate balance, which is maintained through the interactions of several regulatory factors, as well as dietary manipulations. Dietary supplementation with CLAs (conjugated linoleic acids) is regarded as promising in many mammalian species for obtaining good body mass repartition and diminution of fat depots. CLAs are a group of positional and geometric isomers of conjugated dienoic derivatives of linoleic acid, naturally present in foods originating from ruminant species, and normally present in human adipose tissue. CLAs can, however, also be obtained as commercial supplements, usually containing synthetically prepared isomeric mixtures, and as dietary supplements CLAs are widely used by obese people, above all in the USA and Europe. CLAs are claimed to have protective effects against human degenerative pathologies, such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and diabetes, as well as showing beneficial effects on immune functions and food and energy intakes. The mechanisms of action of CLAs are not fully clarified at present, because in vitro and in vivo studies are not always in agreement, and possibly because CLAs act in different ways and with different consequences when administered in the diet to different species. The present review summarizes the ascertained mechanisms of action of CLAS, the mammalian species of major interest in which important studies have been conducted, and the future prospects for the use of CLAs in both humans and food animal species. The following topics will be discussed, taking evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies, to provide a possible rationale for the therapeutic or dietary utilization of CLAS: decreased energy/food intake, increased energy expenditure, decreased pre-adipocyte differentiation and proliferation, and increased apoptosis of adipocytes. All of these parameters, in turn, affect decreased lipogenesis and increased lipolysis. For the future, interactions with individual hormonal substrates, changes in gene expression of proteins involved in lipid metabolism, and anti-tumorigenic effects will possibly constitute areas for scientific development and deepening of knowledge of dietary CLAs.","Adipocytes; Adipose tissue; Conjugated linoliec acids; Histometry; Pre-adipocytes","conjugated linoleic acid; triacylglycerol; adipocyte; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; atherosclerosis; body mass; caloric intake; cancer; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; degenerative disease; diabetes mellitus; diet supplementation; drug mechanism; energy expenditure; environmental factor; Europe; food intake; geometry; heredity; human; immune response; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; mammal; nonhuman; obesity; protein expression; review; United States; white adipose tissue; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Apoptosis; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Dietary Supplements; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Linoleic Acids, Conjugated; Lipolysis; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Triglycerides; Animalia; Mammalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645572040

This phenomenon is explained by the storage of elastic energy during the negative phase and its release during the subsequent positive phase. If a transition time (T) takes place, the elastic energy is dissipated into heat. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between ηpos and T, and to determine the minimal T required so that Npos reached its minimal value. Seven healthy male subjects were tested during four series of lowering-raising of the body mass. In the first series (S0), the negative and positive phases were executed without any transition time. In the three other series, T was varied by a timer (0.12, 0.24 and 0.56 s for series S1, S2 and S3, respectively). These exercises were performed on a force platform sensitive to vertical forces to measure the mechanical work and a gas analyser was used to determine the energy expenditure. The results indicated that Npos was the highest (31.1%) for the series without any transition time (S0). The efficiencies observed with transition times (S1, S2 and S3) were 27.7, 26.0 and 23.8%, respectively, demonstrating that T plays an important role for mechanical efficiency. The investigation of the relationship between Npos and T revealed that the minimal T required so that Npos reached its minimal value is 0.59 s. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Elastic energy; Mechanical efficiency; Stretch-shortening cycle; Transition time","adult; article; biomechanics; body mass; controlled study; energy expenditure; heat; human; human experiment; limb movement; male; metabolic parameters; motor performance; muscle contraction; muscle exercise; muscle force; muscle stretching; normal human; oxygen consumption; priority journal; tendon; Adult; Biomechanics; Elasticity; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscles; Tendons; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645464792

These agents shall thus avoid adverse effects, such as body weight gain, exerted by full agonists such as thiazolidinediones. In this context, we describe the identification and characterization of the isoquinoline derivative PA-082, a prototype of a novel class of non-thiazolidinedione partial PPARγ ligands. In a cocrystal with PPARγ it was bound within the ligand-binding pocket without direct contact to helix 12. The compound displayed partial agonism in biochemical and cell-based transactivation assays and caused preferential recruitment of PPARγ-coactivator-1α (PGC1α) to the receptor, a feature shared with other selective PPARγ modulators. It antagonized rosiglitazone-driven transactivation and TG accumulation during de novo adipogenic differentiation of murine C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells. The latter effect was mimicked by overexpression of wild-type PGC1α but not its LXXLL-deficient mutant. Despite failing to promote TG loading, PA-082 induced mRNAs of genes encoding components of insulin signaling and adipogenic differentiation pathways. It potentiated glucose uptake and inhibited the negative cross-talk of TNFα on protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation in mature adipocytes and HepG2 human hepatoma cells. PGC1α is a key regulator of energy expenditure and down-regulated in diabetics. We thus propose that selective recruitment of PGC1α to favorable PPARγ-target genes provides a possible molecular mechanism whereby partial PPARγ agonists dissociate TG accumulation from insulin signaling.

By only making thin films of LiH it is possible to study the stability of these hydride layers and compare it directly with the stability of pure Li without having any transport phenomena or adsorbed oxygen to obscure the results.

We employ feature points, in the form of an edge-map (as obtained from a standard edge-detection operation), to guide the contour (as in the case of SOM-based ACMs) along with the gradient and intensity variations in a local region to ensure that the contour does not ""leak"" into the object boundary in case of faulty feature points (weak or broken edges). In contrast with the snake-based ACMs, however, we do not use an explicit energy functional (based on gradient or intensity) for controlling the contour movement. We extend the BSOM to handle extraction of contours of multiple objects, by splitting a single contour into as many subcontours as the objects in the image. The BSOM and its extended version are tested on synthetic binary and gray-level images with both single and multiple objects. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the BSOM on images of objects having both convex and nonconvex boundaries. The results demonstrate the superiority of the BSOM over others. Finally, we analyze the limitations of the BSOM. © 2006 IEEE.","Active contour models (ACMs); Contour extraction; Edge detection; Self-organizing map (SOM); Snakes; Time-adaptive self-organizing map (TASOM)","Edge detection; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Self organizing maps; Active contour models (ACMs); Contour extraction; Time adaptive self organizing map (TASOM); Feature extraction; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; automated pattern recognition; colorimetry; computer assisted diagnosis; computer graphics; evaluation; image enhancement; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; signal processing; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Colorimetry; Computer Graphics; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Neural Networks (Computer); Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645154988

Traditionally, these fields can be generated with cylindrical magnets. In comparison with cylindrical magnets, the spherical magnets have the advantages of smaller values of inductances, lower energy storage, and less magnetic flux leakage. To satisfy these special fields requirements, this paper describes the design methods of spherical magnets. The basic method derives from the target field approach that has been used to solve many of the inverse electromagnetic problems. Applying this approach, this paper has accomplished the design of spherical quadrupole magnets and sextupole magnets. In engineering and manufacture, the above calculation results are hard to utilize directly because of the complex magnet structures and, thus, high fabrication costs. After redesign and optimization on the above calculation results, this paper has also completed the construction of a modified spherical quadrupole magnet that has constant current distributions. This novel type of quadrupole magnet can generate nearly linear gradient fields and is easy to fabricate in engineering. Simulation and test results of this magnet are also presented. © 2006 IEEE.","Modified spherical quadrupole magnets; Spherical coils; Spherical sextupole magnet; Target field approach","Electromagnetism; Energy storage; High energy physics; Inverse problems; Magnetic flux; Optimization; Modified spherical quadrupole magnets; Sextupole magnets; Spherical coils; Spherical sextupole magnet; Target field approach; Magnets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645136570

Due to the high computational requirements, the need for low power, high performance embedded processors for multimedia applications is growing very fast. This paper proposes a new data prefetch mechanism called pattern-driven prefetching. PDP inspects the sequence of data cache misses and detects recurring patterns within that sequence. The patterns that are observed are based on the notions of the inter-miss stride (memory address stride between two misses) and the inter-miss interval (number of cycles between two misses). According to the patterns being detected, PDP initiates prefetch actions to anticipate future accesses and hide memory access latencies. PDP includes a simple yet effective stop criterion to avoid cache pollution and to reduce the number of additional memory accesses. The additional hardware needed for PDP is very limited making it an effective prefetch mechanism for embedded systems. In our experimental setup, we use cycle-level power/performance simulations of the MPEG4 Visual stream decoders from the MoMuSys reference software with various video streams. Our results show that PDP increases performance by as much as 45%, 24% and 10% for 2KB, 4KB and 8KB data caches, respectively, while the increase in external memory accesses remains under 0.6%. In conjunction with these performance increases, system-level (on-chip plus off-chip) energy reductions of 20%, 11.5% and 8% are obtained for 2KB, 4KB and 8KB data caches, respectively. In addition, we report significant speedups (up to 160%) for various other multimedia applications. Finally, we also show that PDP outperforms stream buffers. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The bundles may be handled and transported with the same equipment that is used for conventional roundwood. Bundles also offer other advantages such as ""cool systems"", good storing characteristics etc. This study deals with some advantages and problems of transport and handling bundled small size energy wood as an alternative to chips. Transport cost, from stump to consumer, is calculated. Two types of material were included in the analysis: bundles and fuel chips. Transport alternatives included transports directly to consumer as well as transports of bundles via a terminal for drying and chipping, and then, in the form of fuel chips directly to consumer with a bulk cargo truck. The study shows that bundles (especially if dry) are cheaper to transport than fuel chips in road transport bins. The useful cargo space is the limiting factor for trucks when transporting dry material. Transport cost decreased until the moisture content reached the critical levels, below 40.9% for chips in road transport bins and below 44.7% for bundles on timber truck. However, there are also other advantages with a dryer material. Chipping cost is lowest in the terminal alternative and highest in the system with chipping loose logging residues in the stand. However, transport via terminal sharply increases the total costs, due to handling and increased transportation work, especially on shorter distances. Transport of uncovered bundles on conventional log trucks can be dangerous because of the risk for pieces of wood falling off. Bundles may also disintegrate during handling. The risk increases if the bundles are not reinforced with e.g. long tops and small trees, or if the strings are damaged during storing. Sisal strings deteriorate and lose their strength after a relatively short period. Thus, they are less suitable than strings of, e.g. polypropylene. Cost savings in transport and chipping indicate an allowed cost for bundling of approximately 4-5 Euro/MWh for short to medium transport distances, to be competitive to the chip alternative. Cost estimates of bundling and covering of stacks with paper indicate that the handling cost is about the same as for chips for short to medium transport distances. However, for longer transport distances and through other advantages such as possibilities for return transports, a dryer and more storable material, cooler systems etc. may increase acceptable bundling-cost substantially. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Bundle; Forest fuel; Main hauling; Road transport; Road transport bins; Terminal; Timber truck; Transport cost; Wood chips","Logging (forestry); Mass transportation; Storage (materials); Timber; Transportation charges; Wood fuels; Forest fuel; Main hauling; Terminal; Timber truck; Forestry; Forestry; Logging (forestry); Mass transportation; Storage (materials); Timber; Transportation charges; Wood fuels; cost; timber industry; transportation; Bundles; Conveying; Forests; Agave sisalana",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644928458

The present study was designed to examine the effects of photoperiod acclimation on BM, energy intake, and serum leptin levels in Brandt's voles (Microtus (Lasiopodomys) brandtii). After 4 weeks of acclimation to either long (LD; light:dark, 16:8) or short (SD; 8:16) photoperiod, SD voles had lower BM, body fat mass, and dry mass of liver and kidneys, but higher digestible energy intake in comparison to LD voles. SD voles also showed a lower level of serum leptin than did LD voles. Furthermore, the level of serum leptin was correlated positively with body fat mass and negatively with gross energy intake. Together, these data suggest that Brandt's voles employ a strategy of minimizing body growth, increasing energy intake, and mobilizing fat deposition in response to cues associated with short photoperiod. Furthermore, leptin seems to be involved in the regulation of BM and energy balance mediated by photoperiod. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Kildare, Ireland","Infective juveniles (IJs) of entomopathogenic nematodes do not feed but have ample stored energy reserves and can survive for several months in soil or in water. Intraspecific variation in survival of Heterorhabditis megidis has been observed for eight isolates of H. megidis stored in water at 20°C for up to 14 weeks with the 50% survival time (ST50) ranging from 5.6 to 12.5 weeks. How important physical and behavioral attributes were in explaining this variation in survival was explored using stepwise regression. Included in the analysis were: initial energy reserves (measured by image analysis densitometry), size (area and length) the time at which 50% of energy reserves were depleted (ET50), and motility (head movements/min in week 0). Energy depletion rate, ET50, is an important predictor of survival, explaining 93.8% of the variation in ST50 among isolates. Energy depletion rate was highest in the first week, a time at which H. megidis IJs were spontaneously active during storage. By week 5, when IJs had begun to die, some individuals had completely depleted their energy reserves, supporting the hypothesis that death was a result of starvation. In a second stepwise regression, performed to explore what factors contribute to variation in rate of energy depletion, motility accounted for 60.1% of the variation in ET 50. With the inclusion of initial energy reserves, length, and area, 88.5% of the variation was accounted for. We conclude that intraspecific variation in survival of H. megidis in water is due largely to variation in rates of depletion of energy reserves, which in turn is strongly associated with levels of locomotory activity. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We use a method based on nonlinear programming (NLP), namely quadratic programming, to consider hydroelectric power generation a function of water discharge and of the head. The method has been applied successfully to solve a test case based on a realistic cascaded hydro system with a negligible computational time requirement and is also applied to show that the role played by reservoirs in the hydro chain do not depend only on their relative position. As a new contribution to earlier studies, which presented reservoir operation rules mainly for medium and long-term planning procedures, we show that the physical data defining hydro chain parameters used in the nonlinear model have an effect on the STHS, implying different optimal storage trajectories for the reservoirs accordingly not only with their position in the hydro chain but also with the new parameterisation defining the data for the hydro system. Moreover, considering head dependency in the hydroelectric power generation, usually neglected for hydro plants with a large storage capacity, provides a better short-term management of the conversion of the potential energy available in the reservoirs into electric energy, which represents a major advantage for the hydroelectric utilities in a competitive electricity market. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Data acquisition was performed at the Brazilian synchrotron light source (LNLS), during a single-bunch operation mode of the storage ring. It was found that hydrogen ion is the main ionic species to desorb after photon excitation followed by other fragments with lower intensities. Desorption ion yields for H+ and Cl+ were obtained as a function of the photon energy. A pronounced enhancement of the Cl+ yield was observed at the first Cl 1s resonance, which may be related to a spectator Auger process. In order to verify the influence of the substrate in the ionic desorption of condensed chloroform, PSID spectra were also measured at the silicon 1s-edge.

Many of these applications require access to huge data repositories and other I/O sources, making the I/O phase a bottleneck in the computing systems, due to its poor performance. In this sense, parallel I/O is becoming one of the major topics in the area of high-performance systems. Existing data-intensive GCA have been used in several domains, such as high energy physics, climate modeling, biology or visualization.

This solid complex releases ammonia upon heating and can be compacted into a dense shape which is both easy to handle and safe. Furthermore, the material has a high volumetric ammonia density of up to 93% of that of liquid ammonia. This provides a long lasting ammonia storage (≈20000km of driving per 6.2 L Mg(NH3)6Cl2 for an average medium-sized vehicle). The controlled thermal decomposition of Mg(NH3) 6Cl2 was demonstrated. A small reactor with a volume of 785 mL was filled with ≈260g of Mg(NH3)6Cl2 yielding a bed density of 331 kg/m3. The reactor was coupled to a buffer with a free volume of roughly 200 mL. A heating wire wrapped around the outside of the reactor supplied the heat-energy. A mass-flow controller was used to simulate a varying NOx signal. It was demonstrated that it was possible to control the desorption using a simple ON-OFF controller with the buffer pressure as the control variable. Approximately 99% of the ammonia contained in the salt could be desorped and dosed, while maintaining the 5 bars used as the set-point pressure. The low density was improved by compressing the Mg(NH 3)6Cl2 powder to a density of 1219 kg/m 3, which is very close to the theoretical crystal density of 1252 kg/m3. Temperature programmed desorption showed that the ammonia could easily be desorped by heating the densified material. Stoichiometric calculations have shown, that compared to the current choice of ammonia delivery for mobile DeNOx (thermal decomposition of a 32.5% wt/wt aqueous urea solution), the high-density Mg(NH3)6Cl2 compound weighs 2.8 times less and takes up 3.1 times less space. This makes Mg(NH3)6Cl2 ideal for use as an ammonia storage compound in both diesel and lean-burn gasoline-driven automobiles. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Supplementation of diets with concentrate often diminishes enteric methane emissions from cows, but it may simultaneously enhance slurry methanogenesis because this is associated with extra amounts of undigested fibre which may be a substrate for slurry microbes. In the present study, the effects on feed degradation, methane formation, nitrogen turnover and body energy balance in cows and their 14 weeks stored slurry were examined. Cows on average producing 10 kg milk d-1 (group HG-10) were fed a forage-only diet composed of low-quality hay and grass silage (1.5:1, dry matter basis). Two groups of cows yielding 20 kg milk d-1 were either fed the same forage as the HG-10 group, but supplemented with concentrate in a ratio of 1:1 (group HG +20), or a forage-only mixture composed of maize silage and grass silage (1:1, group MG-20). The latter mixture was supplemented with concentrate in a ratio of 1:1 for a group of cows yielding 30 kg milk d -1 (group MG+30). The four treatment groups thus represented three milk production scenarios and included a direct comparison of two major feeding options at a given level of milk yield, which is why a certain confounding of milk yield and diet factors could not be avoided. Concerning substrate degradation, fibre digestibility was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the HG-10 group compared to the other groups. In the HG+20 group, a lower fibre digestibility was compensated by a higher degradation in the slurry, resulting in a similar overall fibre degradation compared to that of the HG-10 group. Relative to N intake, treatment differences in excreta-N amounts and gaseous N losses from slurry were not significant. The animals' daily enteric methane emission (313-441 g cow-1 d -1) correlated negatively (r = 0.491; P &lt; 0.05) with the corresponding methane emission from the daily produced slurry stored over 14 weeks (25-63 g cow-1 d-1). Accordingly, concentrate-caused reductions in enteric methane emission per kilogram of dry matter intake (-18%, HG+20 versus MG-20) were thus diminished to -12% of total methane via the opposite trend in slurry methanogenesis. Changes in emissions of N and methane as depending on milk production scenario were as expected.

The microstructure and electrochemical characteristics of the composite alloys were investigated by means of XRD, SEM, EDS and electrochemical measurements. It was shown that LaNi5 addition does not change the basic hexagonal C14 Laves phase of AB2 alloys, but some second phases have segregated. It was found that the addition of LaNi5 greatly improves the activation property, high-rate dischargeability (HRD) and charge-discharge cycling stability of AB2 Laves phase alloy. At current density of 1200 mA/g, HRD of the alloy increases from 38.92% (x=0) to 60.09% (x=10). The capacity retention of the alloy after 200 charge-discharge cycles increases from 57.10% (x=0) to 83.86% (x=5) and 67.31% (x=10). The improvement of the electrochemical characteristics caused by LaNi5 addition seems to be related to formation of the second phases. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Intercrystalline and intergranular cracks have been detected in narrow welded zones having particular hardness, gradually rising from little dimensions till crossing all the plate thickness. Such cracks are due to the residual stresses (RS) produced by the construction technique and to the presence of aggressive elements. H+ diffusion from sulphured hydrogen molecule toward the ferritic material of the internal surface can produce fissures similar to hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC), especially in the presence of RS. Microanalyses have revealed a sulphur deposit formation in the cracks fracture surfaces, as a presence of H2S dragged by LPG fluids. The LPG release due to such cracks in interred vessels near domestic buildings can be dangerous, and an analysis project of its process is under development. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Today, this technique is widely used but still requires consistent time investments whenever a competitive solution, involving to definitely increase weight efficiency, is needed. The laminate composite is assumed to be an elasto-damage material whereas the liner behaves as an elasto-plastic material. Based on the classical laminate theory and on Hill's criterion to take into account the anisotropic plastic flow of the liner, the model provides an exact solution for stresses and strains on the cylindrical section of the vessel under thermomechanical static loading. Part I focuses on the theoretical background. The effect of the stacking sequence on the gap occurrence, on the residual stress magnitude and on the structure stiffness may then be investigated.

The problem involves a fluid flowing inside a horizontal finned tube surrounded by a phase-change material (PCM). The objective of this paper is to predict the temperature distribution, the phase front distribution along the tube and to analyze the effect of fin density and size on the dynamic performance of the system. The problem is modeled as axisymmetric and two-dimensional, and a control volume computer code has been developed for the solution of the corresponding mathematical model. In the experimental arrangement of the tube configuration, two different fin diameters; Dfn=2.7 and 3.2 are considered and the fin density at each fin diameter is varied in the range of Nfn=14-31 finsṡm-1. For a particular geometry then the heat transfer fluid inlet temperature assumes values between -10 °C and -20 °C, and the flow Peclet number is varied in the range from 14 350 to 200 900 accordingly. Comparison between the numerical predictions and the experimental data shows good agreement, even though some effects that are produced by heat transfer to the environment especially at high flow rates neglected in the model but unavoidable in the experiments. Finally, time-wise variation of energy stored by the system is evaluated through instant images of solidification fronts and the combined effect of fin parameters and the flow rate on energy storage is discussed. © 2005 Elsevier SAS.

The transmission of solar energy to an internal concrete cavity wall by air is analyzed. The objective of this work was initially to study the dynamic insulation in timber frame houses. The initial studies showed that it is more efficient to recover solar energy rather than heat losses, which is the principle of dynamic insulation. Clearly, the thermal regulations lead to lower heat losses through walls by conduction. Due to these factors we have decided to study a wall with an integrated solar air collector and a heavy ventilated internal wall. This internal wall, which is used to store solar energy will allow the reduction of heat demand in winter and will improve thermal comfort in summer because thermal mass increases and ventilation during the night will cool the internal wall. We have selected a closed loop air circulation system because, with an air to air heat exchanger, it can be proved to be more effective and the risk of unhealthy air pollution is reduced because the flow of fresh air will not pass through the ventilated air gap. We are constructing an integrated air collector prototype. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This is due to the chronological random nature of the solar radiation level and the dependencies associated with the power output of every photovoltaic (PV) generating unit at the site location. The adequacy of a PSCSE depends on various factors such as the solar radiation level, the battery size and charging (discharging) capability, the failure/repair characteristics of the diesel generator (DG) and the PV unit, the system load profile and peak load and the solar energy penetration level in the system etc. The methodologies, results and discussions presented in this paper should provide valuable information to utilities involved in planning and operating stand-alone systems utilizing both conventional and solar energy. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the experiment is to monitor the temperature variation of the underground soil under a depth of 4 m and around the year, in order to know the thermal capacity ability of the soil to be used as a seasonal thermal storage. The measurements covered two types of systems: the first one is dry soil and the second is dry soil covered by a glass sheet. The measurements indicate that, at a depth of 4 m, the average temperatures for the dry and dry-glass covered systems are 21, 46 °C, with maximum temperatures of 21.5 and 47 °C during December and January, and the minimum temperatures occurred in May and June, are reached values of 19, 44 °C, respectively. The temperatures for the two systems were almost constant through the year and fluctuating with a monthly period of 2π/12. Results show that, the underground thermal capacity can be used as a source of heating and cooling of buildings leading to reduce the energy consumption in this application. Furthermore, for industrial and domestic heating processes, one can utilize the dry-glass covered system to cover a significant part of the heating load. Anyhow, the experimental study may not applicable everywhere, so an analytical presentation for the system will be necessary to save money and efforts. The first step to put the analytical model in reality is to get the thermal properties of the underground soil, and this is the aim of the present study.

One of the activities is in the field of solar thermal process, particularly in development of solar assisted drying systems. Solar drying systems technical development can proceed in two directions. Firstly simple, low power, short life, and comparatively low efficiency-drying system. Secondly, the development of high efficiency, high power, long life expensive solar drying system. The group has developed four solar assisted drying systems namely (a) the V-groove solar collector, (b) the double-pass solar collector with integrated storage system, (c) the solar assisted dehumidification system for medicinal herbs and (d) the photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collector system. The common problems associated with the intermittent nature of solar radiation and the low intensities of solar radiation in solar thermal systems can be remedied using these types of solar drying systems. These drying systems have the advantages of heat storage, auxiliary energy source, integrated structure control system and can be use for a wide range of agricultural produce. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This led to several studies being done on hot water consumption patterns in this sector. Large amounts of sanitary hot water are also consumed in the commercial sector in buildings such as hotels and in large residences such as those found in the mining industry. The daily profiles of sanitary hot water consumption are not related to any technical process but rather to human behavior and varying ambient conditions. The consumption of sanitary hot water, therefore, represents a challenge to the electrical utility because it is an energy demand that remains one of the biggest contributors to the undesirable high morning and afternoon peaks imposed on the national electricity supply grid. It also represents a challenge to sanitary hot water system designers because the amount of hot water as well as the daily profile in which it is consumed impacts significantly on system design. This paper deals with hot water consumption in the commercial and industrial sectors. In the commercial sector, we look at hotels and in the industrial sector at large mining residences. Both of them are served by centralized hot water systems. Measured results from the systems are compared to data obtained from previous publications. A comparison is also made to illustrate the impact that these differences will have on sanitary hot water system design. Simulations are conducted for these systems using a simulation program developed in previous studies. The results clearly show significant differences in the required heating and storage capacity for the new profiles. A twin peak profile obtained from previous studies in the residential sector was used up to now in studies of heating demand and system design in commercial buildings. The results shown here illustrate the sanitary hot water consumption profile differs significantly from the twin peaks profile with a very high morning peak in hot water consumption. This leads to a requirement for bigger heating and storage capacities in commercial buildings like hotels. A summary of the results are provided in the form of minimum design parameters for different hot water consumption profiles. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding the trends of hot water consumption in buildings, especially when demand side management projects are done on these types of systems. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work the standard LCA methodology has been extended to analyse the total environmental impacts of a new more efficient solar thermal system SOLARSTORE during its whole life cycle. This system is being developed by a 5th Framework EC project. The LCA results show that to produce 1 GJ energy with SOLARSTORE system will result in global warming potential of 6.3-10 kg CO2, acidification potential of 46.6-70 g SO2, eutrophication of 2.1-3.1 g phosphate and photochemical oxidant of 0.99-1.5 g C2H4.

A mathematical model based on energy equilibrium and a one-dimensional mathematical model for the unsaturated porous medium have been founded and developed to predict the temperature and moisture content in soil and the enclosed air temperature in the greenhouse. On the condition that plant and massive wall is neglected, the air is mainly heated by the soil surface in the greenhouse, which absorbs the incident solar radiation. With increase in depth, the variation of the temperature and moisture content in soil decreases on account of ambient, and the appearance of the peak temperature in soil postpone. Solar radiation absorber, heat storage and insulation are the main effects of the north massive wall on greenhouse, which is influenced by the structure and the material. The specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of wall material have a remarkable effect on the north wall temperature. The build-up north wall with thermal insulation material may be chosen for greenhouse. The temperature distribution and gas flow in greenhouse is influenced by the cover material of the inside surface of the north wall and the inclined angle of greenhouse roof. All results should be taken into account for a better design and run of a greenhouse. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Micellization and the formation of micelle clusters in dilute aqueous solution, the latter a consequence of micelle bridging, was confirmed by dynamic light scattering, and average association numbers of the micelles were determined by static light scattering for T = 20-40°C. The frequency dependence of the dynamic storage and loss moduli was investigated for solutions in the range of 5-20 wt %. Comparison with results for poly(oxyethylene) dialkyl ethers (10 wt %, T = 25°C) indicated that the viscoelasticity of a copolymer with terminal BIO hydrophobic blocks was roughly equivalent to one with terminal C14 alkyl chains. The temperature dependence of the modulus was investigated for 15 wt % solutions at T = 5-40°C. Superposition of the data led, via an Arrhenius plot, to an activation energy for the relaxation process of -40 kJ mol-1. The negative value contrasts with the positive values found for poly(oxyethylene) dialkyl ethers and related HEUR copolymers with urethane-linked terminal alkyl chains. This difference is attributed to the block-length distribution in copolymer B10E410B10, whereby the activation energy of the relaxation process has a positive contribution from the disengagement of B blocks from micelles but a negative contribution from micellization. The negative value of the activation energy for solutions of B10E410B10 was confirmed by determining the temperature dependence of the zero-shear viscosity of its 15 wt % solution. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Boron; Butenes; Copolymers; Ethylene; Gel permeation chromatography; Ions; Light scattering; Micelles; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Oxides; Polymerization; Rheology; Viscoelasticity; Aqueous micellar solutions; Sequential oxyanionic polymerization; Temperature dependence; Urethane-linked terminal alkyl chains; Solutions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645519445

Gene ontology repertoires, i.e. cellular component, molecular function, and biological process were used to classify differentially expressed genes in the major organs of rats upon treatment of dampness. As to the cellular component, over-expression of genes associated with the plasma membrane was observed in the stomach, spleen, kidney, heart, liver, and lung. Genes associated with translational machinery, endoplasmic recticulum membrane, Golgi apparatus, and nuclear envelope were down-regulated in the stomach. Concerning the molecular function, genes associated with oxidoreductase activity were up-regulated in the stomach, spleen, kidney, lung, and brain. Channel activity, membrane receptor, and electron transporter activity were up-regulated in stomach, kidney, and lung. Regarding the biological process, genes associated with signal transduction were up-regulated in the stomach, while genes associated with biosynthesis and ATP metabolism were down-regulated. In the spleen, melanin biosynthesis was up-regulated while hormone-related activities were down-regulated. In the kidney, genes associated with nucleotide biosynthesis and ATP metabolism were depressed. In the heart and liver, apoptosis was up-regulated while immune response and RAS signal transduction were down-regulated. Interestingly, genes associated with oncogenesis were up-regulated in the stomach and kidney. Functional fingerprints indicated that dampness weakened membrane structures, depressed metabolic activity (especially ATP metabolism), damaged matrix proteins, enhanced signal transduction, and revealed a positive association with oncogenesis. To quantify the functional impact at the molecular level, mRNA levels of key genes were determined by real-time RT-PCR. The results indicated that ATP storage in kidney, spleen, and stomach was depleted in damp-obstructed rats. We propose that oxidative stress, membrane integrity, melanin biosynthesis, ion channel activity, and ATP metabolism might be hallmarks for damp-obstructed rats.

One of the major problems associated with solar process heat application is fluctuation in system temperature during unsteady state radiation conditions which may cause significant thermal and operation problems. In this paper a transient simulation model is developed for analysing the performance of industrial water heating systems using parabolic trough solar collectors. The results showed that to prevent dramatic change and instability in process heat during transient radiation periods thermal storage tank size should not be lower than 14.51 m-2 of collector area. Small periods of radiation instability lower than 30 min do not have significant effect on system operation. During these periods when water flow rate of collector loop is doubled the time required to restore system normal operating condition increased by a ratio of 1.5.

Three selected storage temperatures were assayed: 10°C, ambient (20-24°C), and 40°C. The study was carried out in both pasteurized and unpasteurized product. The effect of pasteurization treatment alone on added AA was not significant. In the pasteurized product, in general AA degraded following a first-order kinetics. The activation energy calculated by using the Arrhenius model averaged 9 kcal/mol. For each storage temperature, the increase in initial AA concentration significantly decreased the AA degradation rate. In the unpasteurized product, AA was not detected after 20 days in samples stored at room temperature and AA degradation followed zero-order kinetics at 10°C, whereas at 40°C a second-order reaction showed the best fit.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and thermal stability of magnetically written bits have been improved by three new SFM technologies. The first technology greatly improves the SNR in the lower areal magnetization region by increasing the magnetic anisotropy energy of the stabilizing layer without degrading the thermal stability. The second is an exchange enhancement technology that uses a Co-based layer adjacent to the Ru exchange coupling layer to improve the thermal stability without degrading the SNR. On SFM media that incorporate this second technology, stable, non-percolating high-density patterns of up to 900 kfci were clearly observed using high-resolution magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The third technology uses a separated recording layer with a Ru/CoCr/Ru exchange-coupling layer (separated-SFM) to provide a more than 50% reduction of medium noise power with the same or better thermal stability than that of conventional SFM. These technologies enable the design of practical media for recording densities over 150 Gbit/in 2.

However, a major technology improvement is still needed for the on-board fuel storage system since hydrogen exhibits a rather low volumetric energy density (regardless whether it is stored as a liquid at cryogenic temperatures or as a compressed gas). Furthermore, the cost for current hydrogen containers is far from what gasoline tanks cost. Therefore, alternatives like solid-state absorbers of hydrogen (e.g. metal hydrides or complex hydrides) are investigated for their feasibility by the car industry. These kinds of systems show very high volumetric storage densities on a materials basis. Unfortunately, the host compounds are usually quite heavy and thus possess a low gravimetric storage density. Also, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the absorption/desorption reactions and their impact on the tank design in general (and on the heat management in particular) have to be considered. Within the framework of this paper, the properties of the most promising solid-state storage systems are discussed and compared to those of the liquid and compressed gaseous hydrogen technologies. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Depending on the application, temperature and dynamics properties of these components have to be considered. These properties strongly depend on the characteristics of basic materials of the capacitors. The frequency and temperature dependence of the capacitance as well as of the internal resistance, ESR, is manly affected by the electrodes of activated carbon and the electrolyte. Under operating conditions differences of 15% and more of the capacitance due to a different structure of the electrodes are observed. Due to the reduced solubility of the conducting salt and the increased viscosity of the solvents for temperatures below freezing point the conductivity of the electrolyte drops drastically with decreasing temperatures. Thus, increases of the ESR between 200 and 700% between room temperature and -30 °C depending on the electrolyte are registered. Due to the slightly different selfdischarge of the single capacitors equivalent to a voltage drop of 4-12% within 3 days, the individual cell inside a module has to be protected by a cell voltage balancing unit. By an active cell voltage balancing unit connected in parallel to the capacitors a voltage drop will be leveled out after 1 h. In addition to the electrical characteristics of the ultracaps also the thermal properties of the single cell as well as of the modules have to be considered for the design in of these storage devices. By cooling elements integrated in the surface of the module casing and forced cooling the effective current load can be nearly doubled. Based on this know how ultracap modules were designed, which fulfill all the requirements of the applications in automotive and industrial electronics. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

It has been found that the enthalpy of melting and crystallisation reaches its highest value for PEO/lauric acid blend (1:1, w/w) which makes this system a promising candidate for thermal energy storage applications. Further studies by step-scan alternating (SSA)-DSC revealed that an increase of the temperature step causes that the average total heating rate is also increasing and the heat flow is characterised by higher values. Reversing component of the heat flow during melting reaches lowest values at highest step (step = 1°) when the re-crystallisation of PEO is hindered. An increase of step generally leads to an increase of the number of non-equilibrium effects and facilitates the activation of kinetic non-reversing processes, hindering the overall crystallisation of PEO. For lauric acid, due to facile crystallisation and self-association, formation of ordered regular structures takes place faster and is influenced by non-reversing processes in higher proportion. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The exergy function proposed by Jørgensen, called eco-exergy, is investigated in this paper because of its formulation that differs from the classical one.

Objectives were (i) to examine the effect of subsoiling Vertisols on sustaining yield of soybean/pigeon pea intercropping, and (ii) to assess the frequency of subsoiling for realizing maximum yield and profit. Though there was a reduction in growth and yield of intercrops, higher soybean equivalent yield (SEY) and area-time equivalent ratio (ATER) value in soybean/pigeonpea intercropping system as compared to sole soybean had a yield advantage. The average yield advantage in intercropping system was 60% higher than that from sole soybean. The yield advantage of intercropping system in terms of ATER was 7% greater with subsoiling than conventional tillage. The yield response to subsoiling was consistent over the period and on an average, subsoiling increased yield by 20%. The effect was associated with improved water storage and root length density. However, with respect to energy use efficiency and profit, the effect of subsoiling was comparable to conventional tillage. The variation in net return and benefit:cost ratio in subsoiling every year and subsoiling in alternate years in sole soybean and soybean/pigeonpea intercropping was not significant. However, in sole pigeon pea subsoiling every year out-yielded subsoiling in alternate years. The interactive effect of subsoiling and intercropping increased the yield by 21-25%. Thus, under rainfed cropping where drought of unpredictable intensity and duration is a prevailing feature, soybean/pigeon pea intercropping could be a promising option, especially when combined with subsoiling in alternate years. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Neuron-derived signaling molecules are temporally and spatially required to coordinate oligodendrocyte differentiation. In this study, we show that neurons regulate myelin membrane traf. cking in oligodendrocytes. In the absence of neurons, the major myelin membrane protein, the proteolipid protein (PLP), is internalized and stored in late endosomes/lysosomes (LEs/Ls) by a cholesterol-dependent and clathrinindependent endocytosis pathway that requires actin and the RhoA guanosine triphosphatase. Upon maturation, the rate of endocytosis is reduced, and a cAMP-dependent neuronal signal triggers the transport of PLP from LEs/Ls to the plasma membrane. These . ndings reveal a fundamental and novel role of LEs/Ls in oligodendrocytes: to store and release PLP in a regulated fashion. The release of myelin membrane from LEs/Ls by neuronal signals may represent a mechanism to control myelin membrane growth. © The Rockefeller University Press.",,"cholesterol; clathrin; cyclic AMP; myelin protein; proteolipid protein; Rho guanosine triphosphatase; animal cell; article; cell maturation; cell membrane; controlled study; endocytosis; endosome; exocytosis; glia cell; lysosome; mouse; myelin sheath; nerve cell; nerve cell network; nonhuman; oligodendroglia; priority journal; protein function; signal transduction; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Brain; Cell Communication; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Coculture Techniques; Cyclic AMP; Endocytosis; Endosomes; Energy Metabolism; Exocytosis; Mice; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Myelin Proteolipid Protein; Myelin Sheath; Neurons; Oligodendroglia; Protein Transport; rhoA GTP-Binding Protein; Signal Transduction; Animalia; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644916118

Following earlier work of the present authors on the life cycle assessment (LCA) for building components, this work presents a monetary, energy usage and environmental impact assessment for solar water heaters. It has been shown herein that for a developing country like Pakistan where large amounts of hot water are required within industry, solar water heating offers favorable payback periods on each of the above three counts. It has been estimated that under the tested conditions, the embodied energy payback period for the plain and finned heater is equivalent to 185 days and 169 days respectively. It has also been found that the amount of carbon released during the construction process of plain and finned water heaters is 27.9 kg and 29.7 kg respectively. Annual carbon saving for the plain and finned water heaters has been calculated to be equivalent to 59.5 kg and 69.6 kg respectively, which in turn gives a carbon payback period of 156 days and 171 days.

All measurements were performed with a MicroSelectron HDR unit and OneDose MOSFET detectors. All dosimeters were normalized to 3 min post-irradiation to minimize fading effects. All dosimeters gave reproducible readings with mean deviation of 1.8% (SD 0.4) and 2.4% (SD 0.6) for 0° and 180° incidences, respectively. The mean energy correction factor was found to be 1.1 (range 1.06-1.12). Overall, there was 60% and 40% mean response of the MOSFET at 2 and 3 cm, respectively, from the source. MOSFET results showed good agreement with TLD and parallel plate ion chamber. Linear dose response with threshold voltage shift was observed with applied doses of 0.3 Gy-5 Gy with Ir-192 energy. Linearity (R2 ≤ 1) was observed in the MOSFET signal with the applied dose range of 0.3 Gy-5 Gy with Ir-192 energy. Fading effects were less than 1% after 10 min and the MOSFET detectors stayed stable (within 5%) over a period of 1 month.

Design/methodology/approach: A general setting of thermodynamics using differential geometry is used and it is shown how the Poynting identity fits in. Findings: A general method of defining the energy storage and dissipation in a general media is stated. Research limitations/implications: It appears that the definition of the energy stored in a dispersive media is not a state variable and depends on the history of the field variation. Practical implications: If an electromagnetic model has to be coupled to a mechanical or thermal one, the associated forces and/or heat dissipations may not be clearly defined if one merely knows the electromagnetic constitutive relations. Originality/value: It proposes a very general setting for the thermodynamic of electrodynamic media. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Differential geometry; Electromagnetism; Thermodynamics","Differential geometry; Electromagnetic media; Electromagnetic model; Electrodynamics; Electromagnetism; Energy storage; Heat losses; Thermal effects; Thermodynamics; Electromagnetic waves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644558394

CO2 can be stored in the subsurface using settings of: (A) thick permeable coal seams; (B) depleted oil and gas fields; (C) saline aquifers of regional extent, with an overlying seal. The North Sea Sleipner project shows that CO2 can be injected into the pore space of deep geological aquifers deeper than 800 m at 1 Mt/yr, using established technology. Suitable sediment sequences of saline aquifers exist in all hydrocarbon-producing areas, are volumetrically much larger than exploited oil and gas fields, and hold the potential to easily store all worldwide CO 2 emissions until 2050. Geological principles are established to assess entire continents for candidate sites of CO2 storage. This shows that opportunity may be widespread, but needs more specific local investigations. Onshore sub-Saharan Africa is considered the most problematic region - but even here there are potentially viable sediment sequences. No demonstration projects currently exist for CO2 capture and storage using small-scale onshore facilities. A simple estimate, assuming CO2 value of $20 per ton, suggests that single boreholes onshore may be viable over 20 years with supply rates of 100,000 ton CO2 per year. In principle, atmospheric CO2 could be captured by cultivated biomass, and co-fired in existing power stations.

Case studies were conducted in both developing and developed countries. 1. In southern Sumatra, Indonesia, 88,369 Mg-C year-1 of wood residue from a plantation forest and excess bark from a pulp mill would be converted into 15,571 Mg-C year-1 of the net carbon sink by biochar for soil improvement. The fixed carbon recovery of the system is 21.0%. 2. In a semiarid region in western Australia, the carbonization of wood residue was incorporated with multipurpose projects of a mallee eucalyptus plantation that involved the function of salinity prevention. During the project period of 35 years, the total carbon sink would reach 1,035,450 Mg-C with 14.0% by aboveground biomass, 33.1% by belowground biomass and 52.8% by biochar in soil. 3.

In doing so, special attention is paid to production of biofuels for the transport sector, because this is likely to become the key emerging market for large-scale sustainable biomass use. Although the actual role of bio-energy will depend on its competitiveness with fossil fuels and on agricultural policies worldwide, it seems realistic to expect that the current contribution of bio-energy of 40-55 EJ per year will increase considerably. A range from 200 to 300 EJ may be observed looking well into this century, making biomass a more important energy supply option than mineral oil today. A key issue for bio-energy is that its use should be modernized to fit into a sustainable development path. Especially promising are the production of electricity via advanced conversion concepts (i.e. gasification and state-of-the-art combustion and co-firing) and modern biomass derived fuels like methanol, hydrogen and ethanol from ligno-cellulosic biomass, which can reach competitive cost levels within 1-2 decades (partly depending on price developments with petroleum). Sugar cane based ethanol production already provides a competitive biofuel production system in tropical regions and further improvements are possible. Flexible energy systems, in which biomass and fossil fuels can be used in combination, could be the backbone for a low risk, low cost and low carbon emission energy supply system for large scale supply of fuels and power and providing a framework for the evolution of large scale biomass raw material supply systems. The gasification route offers special possibilities to combine this with low cost CO2 capture (and storage), resulting in concepts that are both flexible with respect to primary fuel input as well as product mix and with the possibility of achieving zero or even negative carbon emissions. Prolonged RD&amp;D efforts and biomass market development, consistent policy support and international collaboration are essential to achieve this. © Springer 2006.","Biofuels; Biomass conversion; Carbon capture; Combustion; Digestion; Electricity; Gasification; Hydrolysis; Storage","biofuel; biomass burning; conservation management; energy use; fossil fuel; transportation; Saccharum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745601405

In particular, Bio-Energy technologies linked to technologies for CO2 Capture and Storage (BECS) or to other carbon disposal technologies, if done on a sufficiently large scale, can achieve this result given a context of policy urgency that also yields advances in energy efficiency and the take up of ambient energy technologies (wind, solar, etc.) in line with low emissions energy scenarios (e.g. the fossil free energy scenario developed by the Tellus Institute for Greenpeace International (Lazarus et al. 1993). It has also been shown (Read 1999, 2000, 2000a) that, if account is taken of inter-temporal beneficial learning externalities, it is efficient to reward innovation in policy-desirable technology types (e.g. through project-based schemes that embody such technology types) by a greater amount than the penalty on emissions. Such dynamic efficiency can be achieved through establishing a secondary market for project based credits exchanged for a number of emissions permits M(t) (M &gt; 1 for t &lt; H, the time horizon for policy) and with the variation of M(t) over time corresponding to the dynamically efficient path. This results in the incentive for project based emissions reductions being M(t) times greater than the penalty on emissions. By making use of the initial allocation of permits in each time period, an aspect of emissions permit trading that has no efficiency function under either auctioning or 'grand-fathering', this arrangement enables project based credits to be administered flexibly whilst ensuring the integrity of the emissions cap. The purpose of this article is to link these two bodies of work to show how a dynamically efficient response to the threat of abrupt climate change can be implemented in a way that is compatible with the response to gradual climate change that has been negotiated in the Kyoto Protocol. The design of such a dynamically efficient mechanism is considered, having as its objective the promotion of the two technology types mentioned above. A particular institutional model for implementing such a mechanism is described that mimics managerial behaviour in the adoption of new technology, avoids the additionality requirement that burdens the operation of the CDM in its current form, and aims to achieve 'industry friendliness' as a necessary condition of effective implementation. © Springer 2006.",,"climate change; emission control; emissions trading; energy efficiency; energy policy; Kyoto Protocol; technological development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745591651

This process is generally considered as a mimic of natural photosynthesis and is not only of relevance in relation to solar energy conversion but also in relation to perspectives such as molecular information storage, molecular electronics, and molecular photonics. A long-lived CT state in general may be considered as a weakly coupled radical (ion)pair and in this review we focus especially on the consequences of the eventual electron spin correlation in that radical (ion)pair. If substantial spin-spin interaction is still present, such as in compact dyads, CT states can be assigned pure singlet or triplet configurations (1CT, 3CT) and as we demonstrate this configuration has significant influence on the CT lifetime because charge recombination from 3CT is spin forbidden. For small spin-spin interaction such as is typical for CT states in which the radical sites are further removed from each other - e.g., in triads, tetrads, etc., - rapid interconversion of 1CT and 3CT becomes possible especially via a hyperfine interaction (HFI) driven mechanism. This HFI driven mechanism is strongly influenced by external magnetic fields, which allows sensitive detection of the actual spin-spin interaction via magnetic field effects on the electron transfer kinetics, as well as via time-resolved EPR and field-dependent CIDNP. Examples of such studies on artificial multichromophoric electron transfer systems are presented and the results are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Storage lipids are accumulated in abundance in many of our most important crops, including maize, soybean, rapeseed, and oil palm, giving rise to a commercial sector valued at over $50 billion/year. Because the storage lipids of the major global oil crops have a relatively restricted composition, there is great interest in using all available breeding technologies, whether traditional or modern, to enhance the variation in lipid quality in existing crops and/or to domesticate new crops that already accumulate useful novel lipids. Over the past few decades, there has been a great deal of effort to manipulate fatty acid composition in order to produce novel lipids, especially for industrial applications. However, these attempts, many based on genetic engineering, have met with only limited commercial success to date. More recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the modification of both acyl and non-acyl lipids to enhance the nutritional quality of plant oils. In this review, we will examine the background to plant lipid modification and some of the latest developments, with a particular focus on edible oils. © 2006 Society for In Vitro Biology.","Breeding; Edible oils; Fatty acids; Lipids; Oil crops; Transgenic","Elaeis; Glycine max; Sinapis arvensis; Zea mays",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744475355

Mechanisms that underlie the development of hypertension in obese individuals are not very well understood; they are thought to involve activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and oxidative stress. Recent findings: Recent research suggests that obesity-associated hypertension may be causally related to the accumulation of 'dysfunctional' adipose tissue characterized by the presence of 'large' lipid-laden adipocytes. Summary: Excess energy-intake leads to an expansion of adipose tissue, a hallmark of obesity. But morphology of the expanded adipose tissue differs across individuals, including the size of adipocytes. The presence of 'large' rather than 'small' adipocytes is associated with functional and structural abnormalities of adipose tissue. These include increased production of bioactive molecules, such as leptin, angiotensinogen, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reactive oxygen species; insufficient capacity to accommodate excess energy-intake leading to ectopic fat storage in tissues and in turn insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia; and augmented macrophage infiltration enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Such a 'dysfunctional' adipose tissue may, in turn, induce activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and oxidative stress and, hence, promote the development of obesity-associated hypertension. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Adipocyte size; Hypertension; Obesity","angiotensinogen; cytokine; insulin; leptin; reactive oxygen metabolite; adipocyte; adipose tissue; adrenergic system; blood pressure; caloric intake; cell size; disease association; fatty acid oxidation; human; hyperinsulinemia; hypertension; insulin response; obesity; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; priority journal; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; review; Adipocytes; Comorbidity; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Obesity; Oxidative Stress; Prognosis; Renin-Angiotensin System; Risk Assessment; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646790507

The maternal diet must provide sufficient energy and nutrients to meet the mother's usual requirements, as well as the needs of the growing fetus, and enable the mother to lay down stores of nutrients required for fetal development as well as for lactation. The dietary recommendations for pregnant women are actually very similar to those for other adults, but with a few notable exceptions. The main recommendation is to follow a healthy, balanced diet based on the Balance of Good Health model. In particular, pregnant women should try to consume plenty of iron- and folate-rich foods, and a daily supplement of vitamin D (10 μg/day) is recommended throughout pregnancy. There are currently no official recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy in the UK. For women with a healthy pre-pregnancy weight, an average weight gain of 12 kg (range 10-14 kg) has been shown to be associated with the lowest risk of complications during pregnancy and labour, and with a reduced risk of having a low birthweight (LBW) infant. However, in practice, well-nourished women with a normal pre-pregnancy bodyweight show wide variations in weight gain during pregnancy. Low gestational weight gain increases the risk of having a LBW infant, whereas excessive weight gain during pregnancy increases the risk of overweight and obesity in the mother after the birth. A birthweight of 3.1-3.6 kg has been shown to be associated with optimal maternal and fetal outcomes for a full-term infant. LBW (birthweight &lt;2.5 kg) is associated with increased infant morbidity and mortality, as well as an increased risk of adult diseases in later life, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The fetal origins hypothesis states that chronic diseases in adulthood may be a consequence of 'fetal programming', whereby a stimulus or insult at a critical, sensitive period in development has a permanent effect on structure, physiology or function. However, there is little evidence that in healthy, well-nourished women, the diet can be manipulated in order to prevent LBW and the risk of chronic diseases in later life. Maternal nutritional status at the time of conception is an important determinant of fetal growth and development, and therefore a healthy, balanced diet is important before, as well as during, pregnancy. It is also important to try and attain a healthy bodyweight prior to conception [body mass index (BMI) of 20-25], as being either underweight or overweight can affect both fertility and birth outcome. It is now well recognised that taking folic acid during the peri-conceptional period can reduce the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs), and all women who may become pregnant are advised to take a folic acid supplement of 400 μg/day prior to and up until the 12th week of pregnancy. The UK Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA) panel has established dietary reference values (DRVs) for nutrients for which there is an increased requirement during pregnancy. This includes thiamin, riboflavin, folate and vitamins A, C and D, as well as energy and protein. The energy costs of pregnancy have been estimated at around 321 MJ (77 000 kcal), based on theoretical calculations and data from longitudinal studies. In practice, individual women vary widely in metabolic rate, fat deposition and physical activity level, so there are wide variations in individual energy requirements during pregnancy. In the UK, the recommendation is that an extra 200 kcal of energy per day is required during the third trimester only. However, this assumes a reduction in physical activity level during pregnancy, and women who are underweight or who do not reduce their activity level may require more. The COMA DRV panel did not establish any increment in requirements for any minerals during pregnancy, as physiological adaptations are thought to help meet the increased demand for minerals, e.g. there is an increase in absorption of calcium and iron. However, certain individuals will require more calcium, particularly teenagers whose skeletons are still developing. Up to 50% of women of childbearing age in the UK have low iron stores, and are therefore at risk of developing anaemia should they become pregnant. Moreover, around 40% of women aged 19-34 years currently have an iron intake below the lower reference nutrient intake (LRNI). Pregnant women are therefore advised to consume plenty of iron-rich foods during pregnancy and, in some cases, supplementation may be necessary. There are a number of food safety issues that apply to women before and during pregnancy. It is advisable to pay particular attention to food hygiene during pregnancy, and to avoid certain foods (e.g. mould-ripened and blue-veined cheeses) in order to reduce the risk of exposure to potentially harmful food pathogens, such as listeria and salmonella. Pregnant women, and those who may become pregnant, are also advised to avoid foods that are high in retinol (e.g liver and liver products), as excessive intakes are toxic to the developing fetus. It is also recommended that the intake of both alcohol and caffeine is limited to within current guidelines. As for the general population, pregnant women should try to consume at least two portions of fish per week, one of which should be oil-rich. However, in 2004, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) issued new advice on oil-rich fish consumption and now recommends a limit of no more than two portions of oil-rich fish per week for pregnant women (and those who may become pregnant). Oil-rich fish is a rich source of long-chain n-3 fatty acids which are thought to help protect against heart disease. Furthermore, these types of fatty acids are also required for fetal brain and nervous system development. The upper limit on oil-rich fish consumption is to avoid the risk of exposure to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are environmental pollutants. Pregnant women are also advised to avoid marlin, shark and swordfish, and limit their intake of tuna due to the risk of exposure to methylmercury, which at high levels can be harmful to the developing nervous system of the fetus. There are certain considerations with regard to specific dietary groups during pregnancy. For example, vegetarians and vegans may have difficulty meeting their requirements for certain vitamins and minerals, particularly riboflavin, vitamin B12, calcium, iron and zinc. However, most vegan and vegetarian women should be able to meet their nutrient requirements during pregnancy, with careful dietary planning, while those on very restricted diets may also need to consume fortified foods or supplements. Pregnancy during adolescence raises a number of nutritional concerns. Teenagers already have high nutrient requirements for growth and development, and therefore there is potential competition for nutrients. Furthermore, a large proportion of teenage girls have low intakes of a range of nutrients that are important during pregnancy, particularly folate, calcium and iron. Teenagers who become pregnant often do not take folic acid supplements, either because the pregnancy is unplanned, or because they are unaware of the importance of taking folic acid. Teenage pregnancy therefore presents particular challenges for health professionals. As well as following a healthy, balanced diet during pregnancy, staying physically active is also important, to promote general health and well-being, and also to help prevent excess maternal weight gain. Studies that have looked at the effects of maternal physical activity on pregnancy outcome have been of variable quality, but there is little evidence that moderate exercise can have any adverse effects on the health of the mother or the fetus. Studies do suggest that regular, aerobic exercise during pregnancy helps improve or maintain physical fitness and body image. It is recommended that pregnant women should continue with their usual physical activity for as long as feels comfortable, and try to keep active on a daily basis, e.g. by walking. Swimming is a particularly suitable form of exercise, although it is advisable to avoid strenuous or vigorous physical activity during pregnancy. © 2006 British Nutrition Foundation.","Birthweight; Folic acid; Food safety; Oil-rich fish; Pregnancy; Vitamin A","alcohol; alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; beta carotene; caffeine; calcium; carbohydrate; carotene; cyanocobalamin; dioxin; essential fatty acid; fish oil; folic acid; iodine; iron; lipid; magnesium; methylmercury; mineral; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; potassium; pyridoxine; retinol; riboflavin; thiamine; unindexed drug; vitamin D; zinc; adolescent pregnancy; aerobic exercise; alcohol consumption; appetite disorder; article; birth defect; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cheese; clinical trial; constipation; diet supplementation; drug dose regimen; energy cost; female; female fertility; fetal alcohol syndrome; fetus; fetus development; fetus growth; food allergy; food intake; food poisoning; food safety; health care organization; heart disease; human; infant; infant mortality; lactation; lipid storage; low birth weight; maternal diabetes mellitus; maternal hypertension; maternal nutrition; megaloblastic anemia; metabolic rate; morbidity; nausea and vomiting; nervous system development; neural tube defect; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nutrient; nutritional requirement; nutritional status; obesity; physical activity; postmenopause osteoporosis; preeclampsia; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; risk reduction; swimming; taste disorder; United Kingdom; vitamin supplementation; walking; Chondrichthyes; Listeria; Salmonella; Scombridae gen. sp.; Xiphias gladius",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646695861

The 250 Gy dose (LD50) reduced both percentage emergence and seedling height by about 50% relative to the O Gy dose which served as the control and was therefore used as the dosage appropriate for induced mutations for the genotypes. The bulk of the seeds from the three genotypes were irradiated using the 250 Gy dose and variants from the M2 and M3 generations screened by storing either threshed seeds (Category A) or unthreshed seeds (Category B) at a temperature range of 22-25°C and relative humidity of 30-35% on laboratory wooden shelves for 4 months.

Cold plasma is generated by electric discharge at near-ambient temperatures and can be used for surface modification of textile substrates. This paper reports a brief review of the various plasma and their applications for textile modifications. For textile modifications, atmospheric pressure glow discharge cold plasma is more suitable because it can be designed for continuous treatment of textile. However, the main challenge in atmospheric plasma is to obtain a stable glow (filament-free) discharge over a large surface area suitable for the safe treatment of textile. At IIT-Delhi, uniform glow discharge plasma at the atmospheric pressure over large surface area has been developed by optimizing reactor design and process parameters. Using this plasma, polyester (PET) and nylon fabrics were treated for 10-60 s under different gasses. The treatment significantly enhanced the water absorbency and surface energy of both the nylon and PET fabrics. In nylon-6, the properties imparted by plasma treatment did not change even after 25 days. However, in PET, the absorbency and surface energy were found to reduce slowly with time of storage. The samples did not degrade during plasma treatment and showed insignificant change in mechanical properties. The atmospheric pressure glow discharge plasma can effectively and safely be used to modify surfaces of textile substrates at reduced process and environment cost.","Atmospheric pressure plasma; Glow discharge plasma; Nylon-6; Plasma treatment; Polyester","absorbency; air pressure; mechanical property; nylon 6; nylon fabric; plasma treatment; polyethylene terephthalate fabric; surface modification; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646339666

Managing obesity by lifestyle changes alone has met with only limited success, so pharmacological intervention is often necessary to help patients reduce their cardiometabolic risk profile. The recent discovery of the role of the CB1 receptors of the endocannabinoid system, and how these receptors influence appetite and energy storage, has led to the development of promising new approaches to the management of obesity. This review charts the background to the development of novel antagonists (CB1 blockers) directed against the CB1 receptors and briefly summarises the available phase III data. The available phase III data suggest that CB1 blockers could have a major role to play in the management of multiple cardiovascular risk factors, by reducing visceral fat and directly improving lipid and glucose metabolism and insulin resistance.","Adipose tissue; Cannabinoid receptor; Cardiometabolic risk; Cardiovasclar disease; CB1 receptor; Endocannabinoids; Energy homeostasis; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity; Type 2 diabetes; Visceral fat","4 chloro n [[3 (4 chlorophenyl) 4 phenyl 2 pyrazolin 1 yl](methylamino)methylene]benzenesulfonamide; 5 (4 bromophenyl) 1 (2,4 dichlorophenyl) 4 ethyl n (1 piperidyl) 1h pyrazole 3 carboxamide; adiponectin; cannabinoid 1 receptor; cannabinoid 2 receptor; cannabinoid receptor antagonist; endocannabinoid; placebo; rimonabant; adipose tissue; blood pressure regulation; body fat distribution; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; clinical trial; diet therapy; disease association; drug targeting; dyslipidemia; food intake; glucose metabolism; high risk patient; human; insulin resistance; lifestyle; lipid metabolism; low calory diet; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; prevalence; protein blood level; protein function; protein targeting; public health; review; risk assessment; risk reduction; satiety; sitting; systematic review; United Kingdom; waist circumference; weight reduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646170670

Material and Methods: The comparison included portal verification images of different regions (head and neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis) irradiated with 6- and 15-MV photons and electrons. Each portal verification image was done at the storage screen and the EC® film as well, using the EC-L® cassettes (both: Eastman Kodak Corp., Rochester, MN, USA) for both systems. The soft-tissue and bony contrast and the brightness were evaluated and compared in a ranking of the two compared images. Different phantoms were irradiated to investigate the high- and low-contrast resolution. To account for quality assurance application, the short-time exposure of the unpacked and irradiated storage screen by green and red room lasers was also investigated. Results: In general, the quality of the processed ACR images was slightly higher than that of the films, mostly due to cases of an insufficient exposure to the film. The storage screen was able to verify electron portals even for low electron energies with only minor photon contamination. The laser lines were sharply and clearly visible on the ACR images. Conclusion: The ACR system may replace the film without any noticeable decrease in image quality thereby reducing processing time and saving the costs of films and avoiding incorrect exposures. © Urban & Vogel.","Film; Portal verification; Quality assurance; Radiotherapy; Storage phosphor plate","phosphorus; radioisotope; article; brightness; comparative study; cost control; device; electron radiation; energy; evaluation; exposure; film; image analysis; image quality; laser; phantom; photon therapy; quality control; quantitative analysis; simulation; audiovisual equipment; electron; human; photon; radiation dose; radiography; reproducibility; telencephalon; thorax radiography; X ray film; Electrons; Humans; Models, Structural; Phantoms, Imaging; Photons; Radiography, Thoracic; Radioisotopes; Radiotherapy Dosage; Reproducibility of Results; Telencephalon; X-Ray Film",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646075747

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment on CI/R injury. Methods: Livers were harvested from male Wistar rats and stored for 24 h at 4 °C in University of Wisconsin solution (Group 1). Others were additionally treated with HBO during the preservation period (Group 2). At the end of the 24 h cold preservation, the concentrations of hepatic enzymes and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the effluent and the hepatic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were measured. After preservation, the livers were reperfused for 90 min with an oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer. Perfusate samples were obtained serially, and portal flow rates were also recorded. Results: In group 2, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and LPO into the effluent at the end of preservation were decreased and the depletion of ATP was prevented (P < 0.05). After reperfusion, the portal flow was significantly improved in group 2 (P < 0.05). The time-dependent increase of alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT) observed in group 1 was suppressed significantly in group 2, and total bile production during 90 min of reperfusion was significantly greater in group 2 (P < 0.05). The structure of the livers in group 2 was significantly well aintained, and the liver weight change ratio was significantly greater in group 1 (P < 0.05). Conclusions: HBO treatment during cold storage seems to prevent hepatic ischemic injury and have protective effects against CI/R injury by attenuating the depletion of energy stores.

They deal with specific isotope on-line (ISOL) beams such as ISOL-created radioactive ions. The beam intensities are exceptionally high (> 1012 ionss), the radioactive lifetimes are short (≤1 s), and the ion energy is very high (≥150 GeVu). In general in order to minimize the size of the accelerator one needs highly charged ISOL ions and therefore charge breeders are a must. In contrast with the CERN system, utilizing a Penning trap and an electron-beam ion source charge breeder (where the maximum ion beam cannot exceed 106 ionss) the Grenoble group launched in 1995 an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) system capable of storing 1012 ionss and delivering highly charged ISOL ions. In this article we show that this storage is possible for low-ion-energy ISOL ions following classical slowing down theory. In this case the injected ISOL ions are slowed down by ion-ion collisions which yield ion storage inside the ECR plasma, but also charge breeding by the energetic ECR electrons bombarding the slowed down ions. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",,"Electron traps; Ion sources; Isotopes; Particle accelerators; Radioactive elements; CERN system; Charge breeding; Electron-beam ion source charge breeder; Isotope on-line (ISOL); Penning trap; Radioactive ions; Electron cyclotron resonance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645831588

Wood has many applications and it is often in competition with other materials. Chipboard is the most common item of wood-based materials and it has attained the highest economical development in recent years. Relevant up-to-date environmental data are needed to allow the environmental comparison of wood with other materials. There are several examples of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) evaluations of some wood products and forest-technology systems, but no comprehensive Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data for particleboard manufacture is available in the literature. The main focus of this study is to generate a comprehensive LCI database for the manufacture of resin-bonded wood particleboards. Methods. In this work, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards and Ecoindicator 99 methodology were considered to quantify the potential environmental impact associated to the system under study. A Spanish factory considered representative of the 'state of art' was studied in detail. The system boundaries included all the activities taking place inside the factory as well as the activities associated with the production of the main chemicals used in the process, energy inputs and transport. All the data related to the inputs and outputs of the process were obtained by on-site measurements. Results and Discussion. LCI methodology was used for the quantification of the impacts of the particleboard manufacture. The inventory data of the three defined subsystems are described: - Wood preparation: a comprehensive inventory of data including storage, debarking, particle production, storage and measurement of particles, drying and combustion of the bark for energy purposes. Board shaping: data related to particle classification, resin mixing, mattress formation and the pressing stage. Board finishing: cooling data, finishing, storage and distribution of the final product. The system was characterised with Ecoindicator 99 methodology (hierarchic version) in order to identify the 'hot spots'. Damage to Human Health was mainly produced by the subsystem of Board finishing. The subsystem of Board shaping was the most significant contributor to damage to the Ecosystem Quality and Resources. Conclusions. With the final aim of creating a database to identify and characterise the manufacture of particleboard, special attention was paid to the inventory analysis stage of the particle-board industry. A multicriteria approach was applied in order to define the most adequate use of wood wastes. Environmental, economic and social considerations strengthen the hypothesis that the use of forest residues in particleboard manufacture is more sustainable than their use as fuel. Recommendations and Outlook. In this work, particleboard was the product analysed, as it is one of the most common wood-based materials. Future work will focus on the study of another key wood board: Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF). Moreover, factors with strong geographical dependence, such as the electricity profile and final transport of the product, will be analysed. In addition, the definition of widespread functional unit to study the use of wood wastes at the end-of-life stage may be another issue of outstanding interest. © 2006 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Chipboard manufacture; End-of-life stage; Life cycle inventory (LCI); Particleboard; Wood products","resin; article; chemical industry; energy transfer; environmental impact assessment; inventory control; life cycle assessment; materials handling; priority journal; professional standard; Spain; wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645415697

We examined the effects of i.c.v. or i.p. acute leptin administration on food intake in food-deprived goldfish at different time intervals post-injection (0-2, 2-8 and 0-8 h). Food intake was reduced by i.p. administered leptin (1 μg) at 8 h post-injection, without statistically significant differences after i.c.v. treatment. The present study shows for the first time in a teleost that chronic (10 days) leptin treatment (i.p.) reduces food intake, body weight gain, specific growth rate and food efficiency ratio. Moreover, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism seems to be regulated by leptin in fish. Chronic leptin treatment increased lipid mobilization and carbohydrate storage as hepatic and muscle glycogen. Finally, leptin could mediate its actions on energy homeostasis in fish, at least in part, through interactions with hypothalamic catecholamines, since chronic leptin treatment reduced both hypothalamic noradrenergic and dopaminergic turnover without significant modifications in hypothalamic serotoninergic and neuropeptide Y (NPY) systems. In summary, our results suggest that leptin can regulate feeding behaviour and body weight homeostasis in fish. © 2006 Society for Endocrinology.",,"adrenergic receptor; catecholamine; dopamine receptor; glycogen; neuropeptide Y; recombinant leptin; serotonin receptor; analysis of variance; animal experiment; article; carbohydrate metabolism; controlled study; dopaminergic activity; feeding behavior; food intake; glycogen liver level; glycogen muscle level; goldfish; growth rate; homeostasis; hormonal regulation; hormone action; lipid metabolism; nonhuman; noradrenergic system; priority journal; protein protein interaction; serotoninergic system; statistical significance; teleost; weight gain; weight reduction; Animals; Body Weight; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Catecholamines; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Glycogen; Goldfish; Hypothalamus; Injections, Intraperitoneal; Injections, Intravenous; Leptin; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Muscles; Neuropeptide Y; Serotonin; Starvation; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645237312

This makes it difficult to apply utility cyclic control on EWHs in these countries, since the water may cool down and there may be a demand for hot water during the shut-down period. An investigation was carried out on a 121 l EWH in order to study the cooling behaviour and the availability of hot water for different time intervals (referred to as the standing times) between the initial use, defined as a typical shower period, and the consecutive use. It is observed that, as the standing time is increased, the initial temperature gradient in the storage tank decreases and the thermocline is lost completely after 24 h. However, as the second discharging process is started, the temperature gradient is formed again due to incoming cold fluid and its mixing with the hot water at the bottom of the tank. Furthermore, although the temperature of the hot water at the outlet port decreases as the standing time is increased, the volume of water discharged for the temperature to drop to 40°C is approximately the same for each standing time. The more the second draw-off is delayed, the smaller the fraction of water discharged at constant temperature, ranging from 40 to 60% of the total storage volume between 0 to 24 h of standing time. © 2006 Energy Institute.","Cyclic control; Electric water heaters; Energy efficiency; Thermal storage","Cyclic control; Domestic electrical water heaters; Standing time; Storage tank; Thermocline; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Electric heating; Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Hot water heating; Mixing; Performance; Thermal gradients; Water tanks; Water heaters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645131530

Responses to sugar are closely integrated with response pathways that indicate environmental conditions such as light and water availability. High sugar levels inhibit seedling development, repress photosynthetic gene expression and induce genes of storage metabolism such as those of starch biosynthesis. Genetic approaches have demonstrated the importance of abscisic acid (ABA) and the transcriptional regulator ABA-insensitive4 (ABI4) in sugar response pathways.

We hypothesized that oxidative catabolism facilitated by a proven amino acid-based (AA) storage solution promotes oxidative stress; furthermore, there is an important role for antioxidant supplementation during cold storage. Methods. SB from Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6 in each group) were procured according to standardized procedures involving vascular flush with modified University of Wisconsin solution and luminal treatment with an AA-based solution proven previously to aid preservation. SB were assigned randomly to the following antioxidant treatment groups: group 1, none; group 2, superoxide dismutase/catalase; group 3, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox, a water-soluble analogue of vitamin E). Energetics, oxidative stress, electrophysiology, and histology were assessed over 24 hours at 4°C. Results. The addition of Trolox in group 3 resulted in a significant reduction in malondialdehyde levels compared with all other groups throughout 24 hours of cold storage. Tissue energetics correlated well with reduced oxidative injury; over the first 12 hours, adenosine triphosphate and total adenylates were superior in tissues treated with Trolox (group 3) versus AA solution alone (group 1). Functional assessment showed relatively normal permeability in all groups, however, Trolox-treated tissues showed significantly higher short-circuit current compared with control group (17.7 vs 5.5 μA/cm 2). Histologic integrity was improved in group 3 after 24 hours of cold storage. Conclusions. Oxidative stress appears to be a determinant in the pathogenesis of mucosal injury during cold storage.

The mechanism underlying the antidiabetic effect of rosiglitazone (RG) treatment (20 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks) was studied. Methods: The antidiabetogenic effect of RG treatment on serum insulin and metabolic parameters in serum and target tissues of insulin action was investigated in vivo and compared with the pancreatic beta cell protective effects of RG. Results: Almost all RG-treated animals remained normoglycaemic compared to controls, but, at the same time, they were hyperinsulinaemic. RG had no effect on serum free fatty acid and serum and muscle triglyceride concentrations and did not appreciably affect body weight and fat depots. RG prevented a HE diet-induced reduction of GLUT 4 glucose transporter content in epididymal adipose tissue, but not in gastrocnemius muscle. The normoglycaemic effect was not associated with a suppression of liver PEPCK activity. Muscle PKCε expression, known to be elevated in diabetic Psammomys and to inhibit insulin signalling, was only marginally decreased. However, RG treatment prevented the marked decrease in insulin immunostaining as well as the vacuolization of the beta cells and accelerated beta cell proliferation. Conclusions: These data indicate that the skeletal muscle is not the primary target of RG action, whereas the preservation of the insulin secretory capacity and the prevention of degenerative beta cell vacuolization in spite of persisting insulin resistance appear to be the basis for the anti-hyperglycaemic effect of RG in Psammomys.

It mediates the interaction between the water-soluble exohydrolase and its membrane-embedded glycolipid substrate at the lipid-water interface. Functional deficiencies in this protein result in a fatal neurological storage disorder, the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis. In order to elucidate this cofactor's mode of action and identify the surface region of GM2AP responsible for binding to HexA, we designed several variant forms of this protein and evaluated the consequences of these mutations for lipid- and enzyme-binding properties using a variety of biophysical and functional studies. The point mutants D113K, M117V and E123K showed a drastically decreased capacity to stimulate HexA-catalysed GM2 degradation. However, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy showed that the binding of these variants to immobilized lipid bilayers and their ability to solubilize lipids from anionic vesicles were the same as for the wild-type protein. In addition, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay system showed that these variants had the same capacity as wild-type GM2AP for intervesicular lipid transfer from donor to acceptor liposomes. The concentration-dependent effect of these variants on hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-6-sulfo- β-d-glucopyranoside (MUGS) indicated a weakened association with the enzyme's α subunit. This identifies the protein region affected by these mutations, the single short α helix of GM2AP, as the major determinant for the interaction with the enzyme. These results further confirm that the function of GM2AP is not restricted to a biological detergent that simply disrupts the membrane structure or lifts the substrate out of the lipid plane. In contrast, our data argue in favour of the critical importance of distinct activator-hexosaminidase interactions for GM2 degradation, and corroborate the view that the activator/lipid complex represents the true substrate for the degrading enzyme. © 2006 The Authors.","β-hexosaminidase A; Ganglioside degradation; GM2-activator; Lipid transfer; Lysosome","4 methylumbelliferyl 2 acetamido 2 deoxy 6 sulfo beta dextro glucopyranoside; anion; beta n acetylhexosaminidase A; detergent; ganglioside GM2 activator protein; glucopyranoside; liposome; unclassified drug; alpha helix; animal cell; article; binding site; biophysics; complex formation; concentration (parameters); donor; enzyme activation; enzyme binding; enzyme mechanism; enzyme subunit; evaluation; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; functional assessment; gangliosidosis; lipid bilayer; lipid solubility; lipid transport; lipid vesicle; membrane structure; molecular dynamics; mutation; neurologic disease; nonhuman; point mutation; priority journal; protein binding; protein deficiency; protein degradation; protein determination; protein function; protein hydrolysis; protein immobilization; protein protein interaction; protein variant; solubilization; storage disease; surface plasmon resonance; wild type; Animals; beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidase; Binding Sites; Cell Line; Circular Dichroism; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Fluorescent Dyes; G(M2) Activator Protein; G(M2) Ganglioside; Humans; Lipid Bilayers; Liposomes; Models, Molecular; Multiprotein Complexes; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Recombinant Proteins; Spodoptera; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644941436

To minimize energy expenditure, hibernators use the natural hypometabolic state of torpor. Deep torpor in ground squirrels is accompanied by reduction of brain activity, and is associated with changes in electrical activity patterns, with changes in neuronal connectivity, with tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and with loss of behavioural function (e.g., spatial memory, operational conditioning, behavioural rhythmicity). Thus, deep torpor does not guarantee unchanged physiological and behavioural outcome. However, the adverse effects of deep torpor may be limited to the extreme hibernation strategy used by ground squirrels. The wide variety of natural hibernation strategies may serve as a basis to identify hypometabolic strategies appropriate for long lasting human hypometabolism.","Circadian rhythms; EEG; Ground squirrel; Memory; Neuronal connectivity; Torpor","Brain activity; Circadian rhythms; Electrical activities; Energy expenditure; Ground squirrels; Hyperphosphorylation; Neuronal connectivity; Torpor; Data storage equipment; Electroencephalography; Neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644931305

Recent reports show that the two-layer method (TLM), which employs oxygenated perfluorochemical (PFC) and UW solution, is superior to simple cold storage in UW for pancreas preservation in islet transplantation. However, UW solution has several disadvantages, including the inhibition of Liberase activity. In this study, we investigated the features of a new solution, designated M-Kyoto solution. M-Kyoto solution contains trehalose and ulinastatin as distinct components. Trehalose has a cytoprotective effect against stress, and ulinastatin inhibits trypsin. In porcine islet isolation, islet yield was significantly higher in the M-Kyoto/PFC group compared with the UW/PFC group. There was no significant difference in ATP content in the pancreas between the two groups, suggesting that different islet yields are not due to their differences as energy sources. Compared with UW solution, M-Kyoto solution significantly inhibited trypsin activity in the digestion step; moreover, M-Kyoto solution inhibited collagenase digestion less than UW solution. In conclusion, the advantages of M-Kyoto solution are trypsin inhibition and less collagenase inhibition. Based on these data, we now use M-Kyoto solution for clinical islet transplantation from nonheart-beating donor pancreata. © 2006 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.","Islet transplantation; M-Kyoto solution; Trypsin inhibition; Ulinastatin collagenase inhibition","adenosine triphosphate; collagenase; perfluoro compound; trehalose; trypsin; ulinastatin; University of Wisconsin solution; adenine nucleotide; gluconic acid; glucose; m kyoto solution; phosphate; potassium; preservation solution; sodium; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; article; cell protection; controlled study; digestion; energy resource; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas islet cell; preservation; priority journal; statistical significance; stress; absorption spectrophotometry; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cold ischemia; glucose blood level; human; human tissue; islet isolation; isolation procedure; kidney capsule; male; operation duration; organ preservation; pancreas; pancreas islet; pancreatic tissue; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; rat; severe combined immunodeficiency; two layer preservation method; Adenosine; Adenosine Triphosphate; Allopurinol; Animals; Collagenases; Epoprostenol; Fluorocarbons; Glutamine; Glutathione; Hetastarch; Insulin; Islets of Langerhans; Islets of Langerhans Transplantation; Magnesium Sulfate; Mice; Mice, SCID; Niacinamide; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Raffinose; Swine; Trehalose; Trypsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644927502

Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has historically been considered an effective method to reduce the processor power consumption. Conventional DVS techniques typically consider only processor utilisation issues in a policy-making process. However, as memory-bound multimedia applications are becoming popular in handheld devices, the DVS policies should consider the so-called 'memory wall' problem to maximise energy gain. Recent DVS techniques suffer from the inefficiency of their policies caused by the memory-wall problem while executing multimedia applications, and no previous research on DVS considers the problem explicitly. The existence of the memory wall problem in a real system is revealed and a metric that can be used to detect the problem in advance is found. A memory-aware DVS (M-DVS) technique that takes the memory wall problem fully into consideration is proposed. The experimental results on a PDA show that M-DVS can reduce ∼8% of additional power consumption, compared with conventional DVS, without any QoS degradation for handling multimedia clips.",,"Electric potential; Mobile telecommunication systems; Problem solving; Program processors; Quality of service; Storage allocation (computer); Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS); Memory wall problem; Power consumption; Problem explicitly; Multimedia systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644895686

An efficient approach could be the induction of a hypometabolic stasis in the astronauts, thus drastically reducing the physical and psychological requirements of the crew. On the other hand, in the wild, a reduction in resource consumptions physiologically occurs in certain animals which periodically enter hibernation, a hypometabolic state in which both the energy need and energy offer are kept at a minimum. During the last twelve years, we have been studying different tissues of hibernating dormice, with the aim of analyzing their features during the euthermia -hibernation-arousal cycle as well as getting insight into the mechanisms allowing adaptation to hypometabolism. We paid particular attention to the cell nucleus, as it is the site of chief metabolic functions, such as DNA replication and RNA transcription. Our observations revealed no significant modification in the basic features of cell nuclei during hibernation; however, the cell nuclei of hibernating dormice showed unusual nuclear bodies containing molecules involved in RNA pathways. Therefore, we supposed that they could represent storage/assembly sites of several factors for processing some RNA which could be slowly synthesised during hibernation and rapidly and abundantly released in early arousal in order to meet the increased metabolic needs of the cell. The nucleolus also underwent structural and molecular modifications during hibernation, maybe to continue important nucleolar functions, or, alternatively, permit a most efficient reactivation upon arousal. On the basis of the observations made in vivo, we recently tried to experimentally induce a reversible hypometabolic state in in vitro models, using cell lines derived from hibernating and non-hibernating species. By administering the synthetic opioid DADLE, we could significantly reduce both RNA transcription and export to cytoplasm, protein synthesis and cell proliferation. In addition, we induced the formation of some nuclear bodies similar to those found in natural hibernators. The total reversibility of DADLE effects and the absence of cytotoxicity make this molecule an interesting candidate to induce a controlled hypometabolic state, at least in in vitro systems.","Cell nucleus; Hibernation; Hypometabolism; Manned space missions","Cell nucleus; Hibernation; Hypometabolism; Manned space mission; Metabolic function; Molecular modification; Resource consumption; RNA transcription; Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Manned space flight; Metabolism; Molecules; Physiology; Transcription; RNA",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644882728

It is known to be a strong risk factor for lifestyle-related diseases. Here, we investigated the effects of long-term intake of tea catechins (Cat) in combination with regular exercise (Ex) on the development of obesity in C57BL/6 mice.Design:We compared body weight, adipose tissue mass, plasma parameters and Β-oxidation activity in mice fed a low-fat diet (5% triglyceride (TG); LF), a high-fat diet (30% TG; HF), a HF diet supplemented with 0.5% (w/w) tea Cat, a HF diet in addition to swimming Ex or a HF diet plus 0.5% tea Cat in addition to swimming Ex (Cat+Ex) for 15 weeks. Oxygen consumption and respiratory quotients were measured using indirect calorimetry.Results:Tea-Cat intake in combination with swimming Ex suppressed HF diet-induced body-weight gain by 18 and 22%, respectively, compared to Ex and tea-Cat intake on their own. Visceral fat accumulation and the development of hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia were also reduced in the HF+Cat+Ex group.

Lipid oxidation, determined using indirect calorimetry, was higher in the HF+Cat+Ex group, suggesting increased lipid utilization at the individual level.Conclusion:These results indicate that intake of tea Cat, together with regular Ex helps to reduce diet-induced obesity.

In a deregulated electricity market, price uncertainty must be also considered in addition to inflow uncertainty. This makes the operation problem more challenging due to inclusion of the objective of minimizing risk. It also makes the objective function nonlinear while the estimation of risk is problematic. For dealing with uncertainty, a set of finite scenarios of inflow or price sequences may form the evolution of information over the stages that are used in optimization algorithms. Such implicit optimization methods can be seen as an extension of deterministic optimization. A disadvantage is the number of scenarios may grow exponentially in multi-stage optimization problems, even with only a few branches at each stage. An explicit method, denoted as the Fletcher-Ponnambalam model (FP), has been recently developed for the first and second moments of the storage state distributions in terms of moments of the inflow distributions. This method provides statistical information on the nature of random behaviour of the system state variables without any discretization and hence suitable for multireservoir problems. Also not considering scenarios makes it computationally inexpensive, as there is little growth to the size of the original problem. In this paper, we introduce the price uncertainty into the FP model; our results indicate that the method could achieve optimum policy considering also the reduction of risk, using the second moment information. Our study is for medium term operations of a single reservoir. The results are compared with corresponding results from simulation and where possible, with the well-known Benders' Decomposition method (BD). © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Explicit method; Reservoir operations; Risk; Stochastic programming; Uncertainty","Algorithms; Computer simulation; Costs; Deregulation; Hydroelectric power; Marketing; Optimization; Risk management; Stochastic programming; Deregulated electricity market; Explicit method; Hydro energy management; Hydropower optimization; Reservoir operations; Operations research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644548718

Pseudorandom time series of solar irradiance, based on measured values of the instantaneous clearness index, are applied as input data. Power-flow calculations are carried out in order to assess the impact of fluctuating solar irradiance on the grid voltage.

In addition, we model the solar pond to compute theoretical temperature distributions and compare with the experimental measurements, and hence a good agreement is found between experimental and theoretical temperature profiles. There is a large amount of heat losses between daytimes and nighttimes, depending upon the temperature difference, and these present a significant potential for energy savings and storage.

Therefore, we measured regional and whole-body composition in patients with TB and wasting. Methods: Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in 18 patients with newly diagnosed TB and wasting (10 coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) and 22 controls (10 coinfected with HIV). Results: Patients with TB and wasting had significantly lower body weight (48.6 versus 62.0 kg), lean body mass (39.6 versus 45.6 kg), and fat mass (6.2 versus 12.6 kg) than did controls. Patients with TB had significantly reduced lean tissue in the limbs (15.2 versus 19.1 kg) and trunk (21.3 versus 23.2 kg) and significantly higher trunk-to-limb lean ratio (1.41 versus 1.22) compared with controls. Patients with TB had significantly reduced fat in the limbs (3.4 versus 6.1 kg) and trunk (2.1 versus 5.7 kg) and significantly lower trunk-to-limb fat ratio (0.52 versus 0.92) compared with controls. Body composition measurements were no different in patients with and without HIV coinfection. Conclusions: Wasting in TB is associated with depletion of whole-body lean and fat tissue in approximately equal proportions overall, but lean tissue depletion is greater in the limbs and fat tissue depletion is greater in the trunk. HIV coinfection does not affect the magnitude or distribution of the body composition changes. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The rheological properties of noodle dough were influenced by the ingredients and their interactions. Increasing moisture content decreased Young's modulus (E) of dough samples. Addition of gum to dough at a lower moisture content of 30% increased E, decreased the energy at break (EB) and increased the storage modulus (G′) values. Interactions of starch and gum influenced changes in the rheological parameters at higher moisture contents.

In these applications, the dynamic memory subsystem is currently one of the main sources of power consumption and its inappropriate management can severely affect the performance of the whole system. Within this context, the construction and power evaluation of custom memory managers is one of the most difficult parts for an efficient mapping of such dynamic applications on low-power embedded systems. In this paper, we present a new system-level approach to model complex dynamic memory managers integrating detailed power profiling information.

Each nuclide comes with its own mass value different from all others. For short-lived exotic atomic nuclei the importance of its mass ranges from the verification of nuclear models to a test of the Standard Model, in particular with regard to the weak interaction and the unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix. In addition, accurate mass values are important for a variety of applications that extend beyond nuclear physics. Mass measurements on stable atoms now reach a relative uncertainty of about 10-11. This extreme accuracy contributes, among other things, to metrology, for example the determination of fundamental constants and a new definition of the kilogram, and to tests of quantum electrodynamics and fundamental charge, parity, and time reversal symmetry. The introduction of Penning traps and storage rings into the field of mass spectrometry has made this method a prime choice for high-accuracy measurements on short-lived and stable nuclides. This is reflected in the large number of traps in operation, under construction, or planned world-wide. With the development and application of proper cooling and detection methods the trapping technique has the potential to provide the highest sensitivity and accuracy, even for very short-lived nuclides far from stability. This review describes the basics and recent progress made in ion trapping, cooling, and detection for high-accuracy mass measurements with emphasis on Penning traps. Special attention is devoted to the applications of accurate mass values in different fields of physics. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Today hydrogen is mainly produced by decarbonizing fossil fuels (e.g. natural gas), and in the future decarbonization of both fossil fuels and biomass will play a leading role in the production of hydrogen. The main purpose of this paper is to suggest the identification of potential environmental risks in terms of ""life cycle thinking"" (which considers all aspects from production to utilization) with regard to the hydrogen-based economy to come. Hydrogen production by decarbonization results in CO2 emissions. The final destination of the recovered CO2 is uncertain. Furthermore, there is a possibility that hydrogen molecules will escape to the atmosphere, posing risks that could occasion global environmental changes such as depletion of stratospheric ozone, temperature change in the stratosphere and change of the hydrides cycle through global vaporization. Based on the results of simulation, requirements regarding the following items are proposed to minimize potential risks: hydrogen source, production and storage loss. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Solar energy is stored during sunny days and released later at night or during cloudy days and, to smooth power demands, electric energy is stored during off-peak periods and later used during peak periods. A heat transfer model of the HTESS is developed and validated with experimental data. Simulations carried out for a period of 4 consecutive winter months indicate that, with such a system, the electricity consumption for space heating is reduced by nearly 32%. Also, more than 90% of the electric energy is consumed during off-peak hours.

Binding energies of single molecules have been studied as a function of orientation of the molecules and type of nanotube. We have found weak adsorption, with binding energies near 100 meV/molecule in the most stable configurations. The binding energies on metallic and semiconducting nanotubes are similar. When the nanotube surface is fully covered with one molecule per graphitic hexagon, the binding energy per molecule decreases for some nanotubes due to repulsive interactions between neighbor molecules. For the same reason, direct adsorption of a single hydrogen layer with a coverage of more than one molecule per graphitic hexagon is not possible, even at low temperatures. However, adsorption of two layers (14.3 wt% hydrogen adsorbed when all the surface is covered) leads to binding energies between 40 and 80 meV/molecule, although the molecules of the outer layer are more weakly bound compared to those of the inner one. All the small calculated binding energies indicate that substantial adsorption is only possible at very low temperatures. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A power system for WO mode consisting of a wind turbine generator (WTG), a synchronous machine (SM), the consumer load, a battery based energy storage system (ESS) and a discrete dump load (DL) along with the associated DCS have been simulated. By means of a 400 Hz reference power message that establishes the active power necessary for frequency regulation and a prescribed active power sharing between the ESS and DL actuators, graphs for frequency, voltage and active powers for consumer load and wind speed changes are presented. The results of the simulation show maximum settling times and frequency per unit variation of 1.5 s and 0.16% respectively, for the previous input changes.

The increase of the amount of KOH used for activation caused the activation degree of the carbons to increase very significantly. The activated carbons obtained using lower amounts of KOH were mainly microporous, while the amount of mesopores developed in the samples progressively increased for the carbons activated with higher proportions of KOH. The gravimetric specific capacitance of samples obtained with (2:1), (3:1) and (5:1) KOH to carbon ratio were rather similar at low current densities (∼400 F/g at low current densities), despite the significant differences observed in their textural characteristics. Supercapacitors built with the activated carbons obtained with (2:1) and (3:1) KOH to carbon ratio yielded the highest volumetric capacitance (higher than 200 F/cm3 at low current densities), while the most activated sample yielded the lowest values, due to the significant reduction in density caused by activation. The high values of capacitance observed result from the combination of two mechanisms of energy storage: double layer formation and pseudocapacitance. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Las Condes, 10373, Of. 60 Santiago, Chile","In February 2001, widespread flooding occurred throughout the Atacama Desert of northern Chile and southern Peru. It was particularly severe in the Río Loa basin, where roads and bridges were disrupted and the town of Calama inundated. The instantaneous peak flow in the Río Salado, a tributary of the Río Loa, reached 310 m3 s-1 an order of magnitude higher than any previously recorded event. The flood is estimated to have a return period of 100-200 years and is shown to have been caused by intense, long-duration rainfall in the western Cordillera associated with La Niña. The surface water response is typical of arid areas and highly dependent on antecedent conditions, but is quite different in perennial and ephemeral catchments. Ephemeral flood flows suffer high transmission losses, recharging phreatic aquifers. Perennial rivers have lower runoff coefficients, but baseflow levels remained high after the event for several months due to bank storage rebound and interflow. Extremely high energies of ∼3000 W m-2 were generated by the floods in the Cordillera, becoming less in the Precordillera and downstream. Erosion and sediment transport were consequently highest in the upper and middle reaches of the rivers, with mixed erosion-deposition in the lowest reach. The new insights gained from the interpretation and quantification of this event have important implications for palaeoenvironmental analysis, hazard management, water resource evaluation and the palaeohydrological evolution of the Andes.

The energy storage in such a type of composite combines an electrostatic attraction as well as quick faradaic processes called pseudo-capacitance. It has been shown that carbon nanotubes play the role of a perfect backbone for a homogenous distribution of ECP in the composite. It is well known that pure conducting polymers are mechanically weak, hence, the carbon nanotubes preserve the ECP active material from mechanical changes (shrinkage and breaking) during long cycling. Apart of excellent conducting and mechanical properties, the presence of nanotubes improves also the charge transfer that enables a high charge/discharge rate. For an optimal use of ECPs in electrochemical capacitors, a special electrode composition with ca. 20 wt.% of CNTs and a careful selection of the potential range is necessary. The capacitance values ranging from 100 to 330 F g-1 could be reached for different asymmetric configurations with a capacitor voltage from 0.6 to 1.8 V. It is also noteworthy that such a type of ECP/CNTs composite does not need any binding substance that is an important practical advantage. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Ion-exchange membrane technologies are non-hazardous in nature and being widely used not only for separation and purification but their application also extended towards energy conversion devices, storage batteries and sensors etc. Now there is a quite demand for the ion-exchange membrane with better selectivities, less electrical resistance, high chemical, mechanical and thermal stability as well as good durability. A lot of work has been done for the development of these types of ion-exchange membranes during the past twenty-five years. Herein we have reviewed the preparation of various types of ion-exchange membranes, their characterization and applications for different electro-membrane processes. Primary attention has been given to the chemical route used for the membrane preparation. Several general reactions used for the preparation of ion-exchange membranes were described. Methodologies used for the characterization of these membranes and their applications were also reviewed for the benefit of readers, so that they can get all information about the ion-exchange membranes at one platform. Although there are large number of reports available regarding preparations and applications of ion-exchange membranes more emphasis were predicted for the usefulness of these membranes or processes for solving certain type of industrial or social problems.

In general, the DEN increased with increasing body weight for salmoniformes and pleuronectiformes. However, no effect of temperature was found for any groups examined by systematic order or species. Perciformes fish showed no effect of body weight or temperature on the DEN.

The catalytic activities of the samples for CO oxidation were evaluated in a flow fixed-bed micro-reactor. The techniques of XRD, XPS, EXAFS, H2-TPR and TPO-MS were employed to characterize the catalysts. The results of activity measurement show that for CO oxidation the presence of a small amount of noble metals greatly enhances the activity of Co/Ce-Al-O catalyst, the existence of cerium has increased the activity of the samples because of its capacity for oxygen storage and the interaction between cerium oxide and cobalt phase. The structural characterization results of XRD, XPS and EXAFS indicate that the cobalt in Co-Pt(Pd, Rh)/Ce-Al-O catalysts exists as metallic phase, while in Co/Ce-Al-O catalyst only part of the cobalt has been reduced to zero valence, the rest exists as Co-Al spinel which cannot be reduced at 450 °C by H2. H2-TPR results suggest that the hydrogen spillover may occur during the reduction pretreatment, and therefore increasing the reduction deepness of cobalt phases. The results of TPO-MS show that the oxygen spillover from noble metals to cobalt phase during CO oxidation is very potential. It decreases the activation energy of CO oxidation reaction and results in a prominent increase of the activity. The spilled over species, such as atomic H and O, generated on noble metal sites are mobile on the surface of the catalysts, which makes both of the close and remote cobalt phases involve in reactions at lower temperatures. Additionally, the coordination numbers from EXAFS indicate that the presence of noble metals greatly enhances the dispersion of cobalt phases. The order of this enhancement effect is Pt &gt; Pd &gt; Rh. As a result, the oxygen spillover effect and the enhancement effects on the reduction deepness and the dispersion of cobalt phases should be the main contributions to the catalytic synergy effect between cobalt phases and noble metals. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

To this aim, a tomato puree was freeze-dried and equilibrated at increasing solid fractions. The bleaching rate was assessed by measuring tomato color during storage for up to 18 months at temperatures from -30 to 0°C. The temperature dependence of the tomato-bleaching rate was neither predictable using the Arrhenius equation nor simply related to tomato physical state. The lack of a clear Arrhenius relation was attributed to the occurrence of temperature-dependent phenomena, such as ice crystallization and oxygen solubility modifications, which strongly changed the local concentration of reactants. A modified Arrhenius equation predicting the tomato-bleaching rate in the entire temperature range was proposed. Tomato concentration, and hence its physical state, affected the temperature dependence of bleaching, modifying apparent activation energy and frequency factor of the modified Arrhenius equation. In light of these considerations, a mathematical model was set up and validated to accurately predict the tomato-bleaching rate on the basis of only its concentration and storage temperature. © 2006 American Chemical Society.","Arrhenius equation; Carotenoid oxidation; Lycopene; Modeling","oxygen; pigment; article; chemistry; food preservation; freezing; fruit; methodology; physical chemistry; reproducibility; solubility; thermodynamics; time; tomato; Chemistry, Physical; Food Preservation; Freezing; Fruit; Lycopersicon esculentum; Oxygen; Pigments, Biological; Reproducibility of Results; Solubility; Thermodynamics; Time Factors; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644930909

We found that the structural transitions of OT SAMs from the c(4 × 2) superlattice to the (6 × √3) superlattice resulting from long-term storage were caused by both the dynamic movement of the adsorbed sulfur atoms on several adsorption sites of the Au(111) surface and the change of molecular orientation in the ordered layer. Moreover, it was found that the chemical structure of the sulfur headgroups does not change from monomer to dimer by the temporal change of SAMs at room temperature. Contrary to the results of the long-term-stored SAMs, it was found that the annealing process did not modify either the interfacial or chemical structures of the sulfur headgroups or the two-dimensional c(4 × 2) domain structure.

Four coupling agents were selected to modify the surface of the rice husk in the composite materials, including two types of functionalized polymers [PP homopolymer grafted with maleic anhydride (MA-PP) and an elastomer styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene triblock copolymer grafted with MA (MA-SEBS)] and two bifunctional organometallic coupling agents (silane and titanate with linear low-density polyethylene as a carrier). The influence of each type of coupling agent on the interfacial bonding strength was studied by dynamic mechanical analysis, scanning electronic microscopy, and rheological tests. The results showed that strong interactions were formed between the coupling agents and the filler surface. The addition of a coupling agent with an elastomeric carrier (MA-SEBS) increased the loss tangent and reduced the storage modulus of the composite. A similar but less intense effect was observed for the titanate coupling agent. However, an antagonistic performance was obtained when MA-PP and silane were employed as coupling agents.

The samples were heated at fixed temperature and the volume of the evolved gas recorded as a function of time. Milled and doped samples were prepared by mechanical and mechanochemical reactions, respectively. Samples containing 1 and 2 mol% hydrogen hexachloroplatinate hydrate were prepared. The materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Mechanical alloying was effective to modify the crystallinity of the complex and to change the material morphology enhancing the amount of gas evolved. Both the milled and the doped samples showed an increase of the pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy decreased for the doped sample, and it increased for the milled sample. As a result it was found that the decomposition of 1 mol% doped sample could be provided by waste heat coming from polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

An autocatalytic kinetic model was proposed for the curing of benzoxazine monomer. Gel point (tgel) was determined from tan δ maximum and also from intercept of storage and loss modulus and the corresponding activation energy was estimated. All kinetic parameters including reaction orders and kinetic constants were determined. The autocatalytic effect was very significant. A master equation for the cure rate was generated from the kinetic data that was numerically integrated to predict the cure-profile. The theoretical cure prediction matched reasonably well with the experimental results. The high autocatalytic effect was attributed to the presence of phenolic OH groups generated by the ring-opening polymerization; which aids further ring-opening polymerization.","Benzoxazine; Curing; Kinetic modeling; Rheokinetics","Activation energy; Crosslinking; Curing; Gels; Isotherms; Mathematical models; Polymerization; Benzoxazine; Gel points; Kinetic modeling; Rheokinetics; Monomers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31344472006

Previous studies established that c-Fos induces condensation and depolarization of PIP2 films and expansion and hyperpolarization of PC. We have now explored more in depth the thermodynamic aspects of these lipid-protein interactions, finding that the mixtures have associated hysteresis. The analysis of the excess thermodynamic functions provides evidence of entropic-enthalpic compensations that result in a favorable enthalpic contribution derived from the interaction of c-Fos with PIP 2, which exceeds the unfavorable configurational entropy. On the contrary, favorable entropy terms dominate the interaction of c-Fos with PC over the unfavorable enthalpy. The free energy of hysteresis is stored as excess free energy. A shift in molecular packing-dependent surface reorganization, compared to that of ideally mixed films, indicates a gain in information content at the lipid-protein interface in mixed films of c-Fos with PIP2 but not with PC. It is postulated that the free energy stored in these mixtures could act as a bidirectional structural information transducer for dynamic compression-expansion processes occurring on the membrane surface. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Lipid-protein interactions; Phospholipid metabolism; Surface thermodynamics; Enthalpy; Entropy; Free energy; Growth kinetics; Hysteresis; Metabolism; Thermodynamic properties; Phospholipids; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate; protein c fos; animal; article; artificial membrane; chemistry; entropy; human; lipid metabolism; metabolism; protein binding; Animals; Entropy; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Membranes, Artificial; Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate; Protein Binding; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644529769

In this case, each converter of the back-to-back system is used as a power conditioning system for the SMES coils. Since the AC/DC converter can be designed independently of the frequency of the power system, a two-way switch is connected to the AC side of each converter. This two-way switch can select the interconnected power systems. By using the two-way switches, this system can provide the stored energy in the SMES system to each interconnected power system through two AC/DC converters. For instance, lower-cost power of each power network can be stored through two converters during the off-peak hours and made available for dispatch to each power network during periods of demand peak. Then this system increases the reliability of electric power networks and enables the economical operations depending on the power demand. This paper describes the unique operations of the back-to-back interconnection with SMES and discusses the optimal SMES configuration for a 300-MW class back-to-back interconnection.","Back-to-back; Electromagnetic force; Helical coil; Interconnected system; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES)","Back-to-back; Electromagnetic force; Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); Electric converters; Electric energy storage; Networks (circuits); Superconducting magnets; Electric power system interconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32144449236

Both molecular physisorption and dissociative atomic chemisorption are considered. The geometric and electronic structures of BNTs and boron sheets have been elucidated. These two novel boron structures present buckled surfaces with alternating up and down rows of B atoms, with a large buckling height of about 0.8 A°. The buckled structures are about 0.20 eV/atom more stable than the corresponding flat ones. However, the helicity of some BNTs does not allow for the formation of alternating up and down B rows in the surface and, therefore, these nanotubes have flat surfaces. The buckled and flat nanostructures have different geometric and bonding characteristics, but both are metallic. Molecular hydrogen physisorption energies are about 30-60 meV/molecule on boron sheets and nanotubes, actually lower than in graphene and in carbon nanotubes and far from the energies of 300-400 meV/molecule necessary for efficient hydrogen storage at room temperature and moderate pressures for onboard automotive applications. Chemisorption binding energies on BNTs are about 2.4-2.9 eV/H atom, similar to the ones obtained in CNTs. Finally, the energy barrier from molecular physisorption to dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen is about 1.0 eV /molecule. Therefore, the calculations predict physisorption as the leading adsorption mechanism of hydrogen at moderate temperatures and pressures. The expected hydrogen adsorption capacity of these novel B materials is even smaller than that of CNTs. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Adsorbents; Automotive engineering; Binding energy; Boron; Chemisorption; Hydrogen; Probability density function; Surface chemistry; Boron sheets; Density functional calculations; Electronic structures; Nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31044435167

Since the low-energy ion irradiation is quite useful for surface modification of materials, it is expected that the hydriding properties of Mm samples were improved by ion irradiation. The research, which aimed at the improvement in occlusion ability of Mm alloy using ion irradiation, is the first trial in the world. In this study, the ion irradiation was made with H+, Ar+ and K+ in the acceleration energy range of 350 keV, up to a dose of 1 × 1016 cm-2 using Takasaki Ion Accelerators for Advanced Radiation Application (TIARA) in Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI). The initial hydrogen absorption rate was increased as the ion dose was increased. These results clearly suggest that the ion irradiation induces a high concentration of vacancies that trap high concentration of hydrogen atoms at the initial stage of the reaction.

There are significant dependence of non-isothermal crystallization behavior and kinetics of PEN/MWCNT nanocomposites on the MWCNT content and cooling rate. The incorporation of MWCNT accelerates the mechanism of nucleation and crystal growth of PEN, and this effect is more pronounced at lower MWCNT content. Combined Avrami and Ozawa analysis is found to be effective in describing the non-isothermal crystallization of the PEN/MWCNT nanocomposites. The MWCNT in the PEN/MWCNT nanocomposites exhibits much higher nucleation activity than any nano-scaled reinforcement. When a vary small quantity of MWCNT was added, the activation energy for crystallization is lower, then gradually increased, and becomes higher than that of pure PEN above 1.0 wt% MWCNT content.

Hierarchical structures up to third order, namely, side chain mesomorph formation followed by the interchain lamellar structure of P3HT and finally its intercalation within the clay tactoids are observed. The structures are supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) experiments. The TGA curves show two-stage degradation corresponding to those of the side chain and main chain of P3HT, and both temperatures decrease with an increase in clay concentration in the PNCs. The melting points of PNCs have increased by 2-3°C higher than that of P3HT. The glass-transition temperature (Tg) and β-transition temperature (Tβ), measured by DMA, increase with an increase in clay concentration. The storage modulus (G) of PNCs has also increased more dramatically than that of P3HT. The UV-vis spectra of the PNCs show a blue shift in the π-π*absorption peak of the conjugated chain, but the photoluminescence spectra showed a red shift with an increase in the clay concentration. The quantum yield of the photoluminescence process also increases in the melt-cooled PNCs, and this is in sharp contrast to that of solvent cast PNCs where photoluminescence quenching was observed. Fibrillar network structure of the solvent cast PNCs promotes energy transfer of the charge carriers, but its absence in the melt-cooled films inhibits such energy transfer, increasing the quantum yield. The room-temperature dc conductivity of the PNCs decreased by an order compared to that of P3HT in both the doped and undoped states.

A (MgH2)88Ni 11Fe1 sample (B) was obtained by high-energy ball milling for 20 h a mixture of Ni, Fe and MgH2 powders in the due proportions. A SPEX8000 shaker mill with a 10:1 ball to powder ratio was used for milling in argon atmosphere. The samples were submitted to repeated hydrogen absorption/desorption cycles in a Sievert type gas-solid reaction controller at temperatures in the range 520 ÷ 590 K and a maximum pressure of 2.5 MPa during absorption. The samples were analysed before and after the hydrogen absorption/desorption cycles by X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The results concerning the hydrogen storage properties of the studied compounds are discussed in connection with the micro-structural characteristics found by means of the used analytical techniques. The improved kinetics of hydrogen desorption for sample A, in comparison to sample B, has been ascribed to the different behaviour of iron atoms in the two cases, as proved by Mössbauer spectroscopy. In fact, iron results homogeneously distributed in sample A, partly at the Mg2Ni grain boundaries, with catalytic effect on the gas-solid reaction; in sample B, instead, iron is dispersed inside the hydride powder as metallic iron or superparamagnetic iron. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Ball milling; Catalytic effect; Hydrogen storage; Melt spinning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846438190

With stress it synthesizes 'acute phase proteins'. It acts as a fat store and derives its energy from oxidation of fat and protein rather than carbohydrate.

Rather than the total amount of fat, central distribution of adipose tissue is very important in the pathophysiology of this constellation of abnormalities termed metabolic syndrome. Adipose tissue, regarded only as an energy storage organ until the last decade, is now known as the biggest endocrine organ of the human body. This tissue secretes a number of substances - adipocytokines - with multiple functions in metabolic profile and immunological process. Therefore, excessive fat mass may trigger metabolic and hemostatic disturbances as well as CVD. Adipocytokines may act locally or distally as inflammatory, immune or hormonal signalers. In this review we discuss visceral obesity, the potential mechanisms by which it would be related to insulin resistance, methods for its assessment and focus on the main adipocytokines expressed and secreted by the adipose tissue. Particularly, we review the role of adiponectin, leptin, resistin, angiotensinogen, TNF-α, and PAI-1, describing their impact on insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk, based on more recent findings in this area. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Adipocytokines; Adipose tissue; Insulin resistance; Metabolic syndrome; Visceral obesity","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; adipocytokine; adiponectin; angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist; angiotensinogen; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; insulin; insulin sensitizing agent; interleukin 6; leptin; metformin; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; resistin; somatostatin derivative; troglitazone; tumor necrosis factor alpha; acromegaly; adipose tissue; anthropometric parameters; antiinflammatory activity; body fat distribution; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cytokine production; cytokine release; diabetogenesis; disease association; disease course; drug mechanism; endocrine surgery; gene mutation; genetic code; heart protection; human; hyperinsulinemia; hypertension; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin synthesis; lean body weight; lipid oxidation; lipodystrophy; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein determination; protein expression; protein function; review; risk assessment; risk factor; weight reduction; Abdomen; Adipokines; Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue; Humans; Interleukin-6; Leptin; Obesity; Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1; Resistin; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746233401

Cystinosis is the most common cause of inherited Fanconi syndrome leading to renal failure, in which the pathogenesis is still enigmatic. Based on studies of proximal tubules loaded with cystine dimethyl ester (CDME), altered mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production was proposed to be an underlying pathologic mechanism. Thus far, however, experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis in humans is lacking. In this study, energy metabolism was extensively investigated in primary fibroblasts derived from eight healthy subjects and eight patients with cystinosis. Patient's fibroblasts accumulated marked amounts of cystine and displayed a significant decrease in intracellular ATP content. Remarkably, overall energy-generating capacity, activity of respiratory chain complexes, ouabain-dependent rubidium uptake reflecting Na,K-ATPase activity, and bradykinin-stimulated mitochondrial ATP production were all normal in these cells. In conclusion, the data presented demonstrate that mitochondrial energy-generating capacity and Na,K-ATPase activity are intact in cultured cystinotic fibroblasts, thus questioning the idea of altered mitochondrial ATP synthesis as a keystone for the pathogenesis of cystinosis.

Experiments involving polarized exciting radiation were carried out at the four crystal monochromator beamline of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt for synchrotron radiation from 4 to 10 keV at the electron storage ring BESSY II. Resonant Raman spectra of thin Ni foils were recorded at the Cu-Kα (8041 eV) exciting beam energy. In the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the N.C.S.R. Demokritos, the resonant Raman spectrum of a thick nickel target was also recorded for an unpolarized Cu-Kα (8041 eV) exciting beam produced after the ionization of a thick Cu target by 1.7 MeV protons in a triaxial, orthogonal geometry. In the present work, the individual spectral characteristics and the methodological approaches adopted for the extraction of the Ni-RRS cross sections, with respect to each mode of excitation, are presented, compared and discussed.

LiAlH 4 samples purified in advance were examined on their hydrogen desorption behaviors in the various heating conditions in which some of them were melted and the others not. Some of the as-received samples were mechanically ground in an Ar atmosphere for a short time of period using a hall milling machine and then supplied to DSC measurements. The color of the sample after milling changes from gray-beige to grey, probably due to contamination of metal elements such as iron and chromium from hardened steel vessel and balls during grinding. The rapid hydrogen desorption was observed for the samples melted by heating, whereas the insignificant hydrogen desorption was observed for the ones which were not melted by heating, in spite that heating and cooling were repeated three times. The time from melting to decomposition of LiAlH 4 accompanied by hydrogen desorption was 90±30 s. independent of hydrogen desorption temperature. The samples milled in hardened steel vessel using a planetary-type ball milling machine exhibited about 2 K lower melting temperature and 15 K lower hydrogen desorption temperature than the as-purified samples. These changes can be considered to happen because contamination metal elements contributed to lowering a melting temperature and worked as a catalyst to decrease the activation energy for decomposition of liquefied LiAlH 4. These results indicate that metal elements such as iron and chromium certainly contribute to improve hydrogen desorption temperatures of alanates, as reported in many papers, but it is more important to lower their melting temperatures in order to improve their hydrogen desorption kinetics. © 2006 The Japan Institute of Metals.","Alternate; Catalyst; Hydrogen desorption; Hydrogen storage materials; Melting temperature","Alternate; Hydrogen desorption; Hydrogen storage materials; Melting temperature; Ball milling; Comminution; Desorption; Differential scanning calorimetry; Heating; Hydrogenation; Melting; Lithium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645780351

Box 1870 Nordnes, N-5817 Bergen, Norway","Studies using annual averages of lipid storage or estimated quality of the feeding season have shown that energy reserves influence egg production in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). However, vitellogenesis starts months before spawning. Therefore, energy reserves near the start of vitellogenesis might provide better proxies of fecundity and hence egg production than yearly averages. If so, proxies with large temporal variations (e.g., weight and lipid energy) should vary similarly in their predictive power, and females with different spawning periods should have their fecundity determined at different times. We exposed cod to two photoperiods to induce different spawning seasons. Growth before spawning was monitored, and potential fecundity was measured at the onset of spawning. The date yielding the greatest explanatory power differed between photoperiods. As proxies, length varied less and had lower explanatory power than weight. Lipid energy at the onset of spawning was a poor proxy. The greatest explanatory power was found ∼3-4 months before spawning around the start of vitellogenesis, indicating that potential fecundity was highly influenced by female energy reserves at this time. Determination of potential fecundity early in vitellogenesis may be a common feature for determinate teleost spawners. © 2005 NRC.",,"egg production; fecundity; gadoid; lipid; photoperiod; secondary production; Gadus morhua; Teleostei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645128978

Studies indicate that microstructuring by sandblasting and acid etching (SLA) enhances the osteogenic properties of titanium. The undesired initial hydrophobicity, however, presumably decelerates primary interactions with the aqueous biosystem. To improve the initial wettability and to retain SLA microstructure, a novel surface modification was tested. This modification differs from SLA by its preparation after acid etching, which was done under protective gas conditions following liquid instead of dry storage. We hypothesized that this modification should have increased wettability due to the prevention of contaminations that occurs during air contact. The main outcome of dynamic wettability measurements was that the novel modification shows increased surface free energy (SFE) and increased hydrophilicity with initial water contact angles of 0° compared to 139.9° for SLA. This hydrophilization was kept even after any drying. Reduced hydrocarbon contaminations were identified to play a possible role in altered surface thermodynamics. Such surfaces aim to retain the hydrophilicity and natural high surface energy of the Ti dioxide surface until surgical implants' insertion and are compared in this in vitro study with structural surface variants of titanium to compare roughness and chemically induced wettability. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Hydrophilicity; Microstructure; Surface contamination; Surface energy; Surface roughness","Contact angle; Contamination; Etching; Hydrocarbons; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Interfacial energy; Surface properties; Surface roughness; Surface treatment; Titanium; Acid etching; Osteogenic properties; Sandblasting and acid etching (SLA); Surface contamination; Surface free energy (SFE); Wettability; Microstructure; hydrocarbon; titanium; article; chemical modification; human; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; implant; outcomes research; sandblasting and acid etching; structure analysis; surface property; wettability; Acids; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Prostheses and Implants; Spectrum Analysis; Surface Properties; Thermodynamics; Titanium; Wettability; X-Rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645096659

In situ stress conditions significantly impact flow, transport and exchange characteristics of fracture networks that dominate the permeability of crystalline reservoir rocks. In this paper, several scales of information are combined to present a fully three-dimensional hydraulic finite element model of the principal KTB fault zones, and linked to a geomechanical model describing the alteration of the hydraulic parameters with stress changes caused by fluid extraction. The concept of geomechanical facies is introduced to define and characterize architectural elements in the subsurface system. Evaluation of a long-term pump test in the KTB pilot hole, June 2002-July 2003, coupled with a geomechanical model gives an insight into some of the elastic and nonelastic processes controlling hydraulic transport in the basement rocks. Trends in the decline of the permeability and the degree of storage in the system could only partially be explained by elastic processes, clearly indicating the importance of nonelastic processes. A number of inelastic processes are suggested as areas for further research. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Coupled processes; Elastic processes; Geomechanical; Geomechanical facies; Hydraulic flow; KTB; Pressure-dependent permeability","basement rock; borehole; drilling; permeability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645046886

A total of 2700 Japanese quail eggs were used for this study. The eggs were collected from 20-week-old laying quails for each trial for 3 consecutive days. The birds were housed as 1 male/3 female per cage of 40×30×30 cm. A standard layer diet (20% protein and 3.0% calcium) was given ad libitum. Natural daylight was supplemented with artificial light to give an 18-h photoperiod. Eggs were stored at 9-15°C at 70-75% relative humidity in storage room during the remaining period of storage. The eggs were candled on the 6th day of incubation to detect fertile eggs and dead embryos. At the end of incubation, unhatched eggs were separated and cracked for determination of the cause including infertile eggs or embryonic mortality. Embryonic mortality rate was calculated as percent of the embryonic deaths within the fertile eggs, not within all death embryos. In this study, overall apparent fertility rate was calculated as 66.5%. The differences between mean apparent fertility rates of the treatment groups were significant (P&lt;0.01). The lowest hatchability was observed in group 1 (any warming (control group)) (39.9%) while as the highest percentage occurred in groups 4 (warming on day 7 of storage) (56.2%) and 5 (double warming on days 7 and 14 of storage) (57.4%). The hatchability of fertile eggs of group 4 was significantly higher than for groups 1, 2 (warming on day 1 of storage) and 3 (double warming on days 1 and 7 of storage) (P&lt;0.05). In group 5, the hatchability of fertile eggs was significantly higher than in the other groups (except group 4) (P&lt;0.05). The highest embryonic mortality rate was observed in early stage of group 1 while the lowest rate was determined in early stage of group 5. Although there was no significant difference in embryonic deaths between groups, effect of pre-incubation warming treatment in decreasing early stage embryonic deaths was observed. Effect of pre-incubation warming in decreasing middle and late stage embryonic deaths was significant. In middle period, the lowest embryonic death rate was seen in group 5 (double warming on days 7 and 14 of storage) while the highest was in group 3 (double warming on days 1 and 7 of storage). In the late period, the lowest embryonic death rate was observed in group 4 (warming on day 7) while the highest was in control group. In the present study, the highest hatching performance and the lowest rate of embryonic deaths (early, middle, and late) were observed in group 5. In control group, however, hatching performance was the lowest and embryonic deaths were the highest. Since there was no significant difference in hatchability between groups warmed on day 7 only and warmed on both days 7 and 14, it can be advantageous to warm eggs on day 7 only to avoid unnecessary expenses in energy and labour. © Verlag Eugen Ulmer GmbH &amp; Co.

In this work the radial combustion propagation on thin circular samples of stoichiometric and over aluminized Fe2O3/Al thermite mixtures is studied. The radial geometry allows an easy detection of sample heterogeneities and the observation of the combustion behavior in their vicinity. The influence of factors like reactant mixtures stoichiometry, samples green density and system geometry on the rate of propagation of the combustion front is analyzed. The radial combustion front profiles are registered by digital video-crono-photography. Combustion thermograms are obtained for two sample radii. Theoretical calculations, based on the impurity levels reported by the reactants manufacturers and on the thermite reaction stoichiometry, were used to define the stoichiometric mixture with unitary equivalence ratio (E. R.). However, it was found from the experimental results that the excess of aluminum only starts for E. R. values between 1.12 and 1.27. This was explained by the further oxidation of aluminum during storage and/or by the reaction incompleteness. In the range studied, the combustion rates of the thermite mixtures did not show any significant dependence on the green density. Combustion rates obtained in this work were slightly higher than those obtained in an earlier work for long square channel geometry. A considerable dispersion of temperature values was observed and attributed to thermocouples sensitivity to micro-scale variations. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

We have previously shown that estrogen replacement therapy enhances the expression of receptors for the cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF and other cytokines acting via the gp130 signal transducing receptor have been reported to decrease obesity. In the present study, we investigated whether LIF treatment can reduce obesity in OVX mice. Design: Eight-week-old female C57Bl/6 mice were OVX or sham-operated. The mice were treated with LIF, 30 μg/kg or PBS via daily i.p. injections for 15 days (n = 9-10). Methods: Dual X-ray absorptiometry and computerized tomography. Results: We found that LIF treatment of OVX mice caused a significant reduction in the weight of white fat depots (P = 0.017) and serum leptin levels (P = 0.011). LIF also caused a significant decrease in brown fat mass (P = 0.036). Treatment with LIF decreased thymus weight but did not affect crown-rump length, femur length, trabecular bone mineral density or the weight of several non-fat organs including the uterus. Conclusion: The cytokine, LIF, decreases body fat mass in OVX mice, suggesting that estrogen signaling is not required for this effect. © 2006 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.",,"estrogen; leptin; leukemia inhibitory factor; animal model; article; body fat; body mass; bone density; brown adipose tissue; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; crown rump length; drug activity; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; femur; lipid storage; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; organ weight; ovariectomy; priority journal; protein blood level; signal transduction; thymus; trabecular bone; uterus weight; weight reduction; white adipose tissue; Adipose Tissue; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Animals; Body Composition; Body Weight; Densitometry, X-Ray; Female; Interleukin-6; Leptin; Leukemia Inhibitory Factor; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Organ Size; Ovariectomy; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644601862

The characteristics of the stationary states can be improved, before turn-off, however, the base has to be discharged by a separate discharge process. Two different modes of this process are demonstrated and discussed. Discharge by diffusion requires quite long durations but offers low discharge energies. A forced discharge admitting space charge regions also can be kept at controlled low field strength and is much faster but yields higher discharge energies.

However, their ability to store energy is limited by the quantity of lithium that may be removed from and reinserted into the positive intercalation electrode, LixCoO2, 0.5 &lt; x &lt; 1 (corresponding to 140 mA·h g-1 of charge storage). Abandoning the intercalation electrode and allowing Li to react directly with O2 from the air at a porous electrode increases the theoretical charge storage by a remarkable 5-10 times! Here we demonstrate two essential prerequisites for the successful operation of a rechargeable Li/O2 battery; that the Li2O2 formed on discharging such an O2 electrode is decomposed to Li and O2 on charging (shown here by in situ mass spectrometry), with or without a catalyst, and that charge/discharge cycling is sustainable for many cycles. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalysts; Electrodes; Energy storage; Global warming; Mass spectrometry; Oxygen; Charge discharge cycling; Intercalation electrodes; Lithium batteries; lithium derivative; metal oxide; article; electric battery; electrochemistry; electrode; electronics; energy; mass spectrometry; X ray powder diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32044453597

Starting from statistically distributed Au clusters on a thin amorphous carbon film, ""islands"" are formed within a few months storage at room temperature, which consist of Au clusters with sizes &lt;4 nm embedded in a thin Au film. These islands cover originally areas with sizes around 25 × 70 nm 2. If the temperature is increased in the transmission electron microscope two different processes can be clearly distinguished that lead to the coarsening of the cluster size distribution: cluster coalescence and (contactless) Ostwald ripening. The degree and rate of the coarsening are found to depend on the underlying surface (Au film or amorphous carbon) and the exposure to the high-flux high-energy electron beam, which can be estimated to lead to high-temperature excursions in a cluster on a 10-12 s time scale. The experimental findings are confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations using the many-body Gupta potentials in order to calculate the Au/Au interaction. Moreover, the results of MC simulations suggest an electron-beam induced formation of a ""quasi-two-dimensional gas"" of small highly mobile Au species on the Au film, which promotes Ostwald ripening. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The values were determined from the shrinking kinetics measured by stopped-flow light scattering. This high Pf was only partially inhibited by mercury (HgCl2) but showed low activation energy (Ea) consistent with water permeation through water channels. To study short-term regulation of water transport that could be the result of channel gating, the effects of pH, divalent cations, and protection against dephosphorylation were tested. The high Pf observed at pH 8.3 was dramatically reduced by medium acidification. Moreover, intravesicular acidification (corresponding to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane) shut down the aquaporins. De-phosphorylation was discounted as a regulatory mechanism in this preparation. On the other hand, among divalent cations, only calcium showed a clear effect on aquaporin activity, with two distinct ranges of sensitivity to free Ca2+ concentration (pCa 8 and pCa 4). Since the normal cytoplasmic free Ca2+ sits between these ranges it allows for the possibility of changes in Ca2+ to finely up- or down-regulate water channel activity. The calcium effect is predominantly on the cytoplasmic face, and inhibition corresponds to an increase in the activation energy for water transport. In conclusion, these findings establish both cytoplasmic pH and Ca2+ as important regulatory factors involved in aquaporin gating. © The Author [2006].

Residual MMA of 120 resin specimens were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. For the heat-polymerized resins, the lowest residual MMA content was obtained when they were given a long-term terminal boil and then stored in the distilled water for at least 1 day. For the autopolymerized resins, the lowest residual MMA content was obtained when they were additionally cured in water at 60°C and then stored in the distilled water at least 1 day. For the microwave-polymerized resins, the lowest residual MMA content was obtained when they were stored in the distilled water at least 1 month. The lowest overall residual MMA content was obtained from heat-polymerized specimens that were given a long-term terminal boil cure and then stored in the distilled water at least 1 day.

The main scientific goal is the study of the antimatter component of the cosmic radiation. Three years of data taking will provide unprecedented statistics for antiprotons (80 MeV-190 GeV) and positrons (50 MeV-270 GeV) and will set the upper limit for the ratio Hē/He below 10-8. PAMELA is built around a permanent magnet silicon spectrometer, surrounded by a plastic scintillator anticoincidence shield. An electromagnetic calorimeter is used for particle identification and energy measurements. If PAMELA data exceed the storage allowance on the satellite or the daily downlink quota (20 GB), a second level trigger may be activated by uplink from ground. Information from the anticoincidence system and from the calorimeter will be included in the second level trigger condition, providing a selective reduction of data. The second level trigger condition provides a reduction of data of ∼60%, with a maximum systematic uncertainty in the proton (electron) spectra of 10% (3%). This uncertainty will be assessed during flight measuring one event every 10 without the second level trigger condition. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The small-sized flywheel is made up several magnets for a motor/generator as well as an HTS bearing, and they are fitted into a 34 mm diameter, 3 mm thick aluminium disc. For simplicity and miniaturization of the whole system, the small-sized flywheel takes torque directly from a planar stator, which consists of an axial flux-type brushless DC motor/generator. The small-sized flywheel successfully rotated up to 38 000 rpm in a vacuum while levitated above the stator with a gap of about 1 mm. However, there are some eddy current losses in the stator and non-axisymmetry in the magnetic field causing large drag torque. In order to solve these problems, an improved magnet array in the flywheel, including magnetic screening, is proposed and 3D electromagnetic simulations have been conducted. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bearings (machine parts); Computer simulation; DC motors; Energy storage; High temperature superconductors; Torque; 3D electromagnetic simulation; Magnetic screening; Torque density; Flywheels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31144473898

Even an instantaneous voltage drop may give rise to serious problems in computer systems or electronic equipment. The uninterruptible power system (UPS) has been used to compensate for the power service interruptions. Also, the instantaneous voltage drop compensator using the electrolytic capacitor has been developed for the instantaneous voltage drop. Recently, the double-layer capacitor has been considered as a new energy storage element. This capacitor has many advantages such as no maintenance, long lifetime, and quick charge/discharge characteristics with large current and it has higher energy density than the electrolytic capacitor. Therefore, we developed the UPS using the double-layer capacitor. In this paper, the performance of the UPS using the double-layer capacitor is shown by simulated and experimental results. Furthermore, the discharge characteristics of the double-layer capacitors are investigated on the basis of the equivalent circuit including the capacitors and a voltage booster. Finally, the maximum load capacity to compensate is clarified for the system. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Double-layer capacitor; Instantaneous voltage sag; Uninterruptible power system","Double-layer capacitors; Instantaneous voltage sag; Load capacity; Power service interruptions; Computer simulation; Computer systems; Electric loads; Electric potential; Electrolytic capacitors; Electronic equipment; Equivalent circuits; Uninterruptible power systems",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31144459061

These devices allow fast energy transfer from an electronically excited molecule to an unexcited neighbor molecule in such a way that the excitation energy reaches the reaction center with high probability. Trapping occurs there. Systems with similar properties can be prepared by enclosing dyes inside a microporous material and by choosing conditions such that the cavities are able to uptake only monomers but not aggregates. The materials we discuss generally consist of cylindrical zeolite L crystals, in the size range of 30-7000 nm, the channels of which are filled with dye molecules. The synthesis is based on the fact that molecules can diffuse into individual channels. In some cases it is desirable to modify the channel openings afterwards by adding a closure molecule. Functionalization of the closure molecules allows fine-tuning of, for example, wettability, refractive index, and chemical reactivity. The supramolecular organization of the dyes inside the channels is a first stage of organization. It allows light harvesting within a certain volume of a dye-loaded nanocrystalline zeolite and radiationless transport to both ends of the cylinder or from the ends to the center. The second stage of organization is the coupling to an acceptor or donor stopcock fluorophore at the ends of the zeolite L channels, which can trap or inject electronic excitation energy. The third stage of organization is the coupling to an external device via a stopcock intermediate. Another host-guest system, which will be shortly presented, is zeolite A containing silver sulfide. Due to the small dimensions of the cages of zeolite A it is possible to stabilize Ag2S monomers and dimers. In contrast to bulk silver sulfide these small particles show photoluminescence in the visible. In both host-guest systems interesting optical phenomena such as laser action are observed. The wide-ranging tunability of these highly organized materials offers fascinating new possibilities for exploring excitation energy transfer phenomena, and challenges for developing new photonic devices for solar energy conversion and storage. © 2005 Académie des sciences.

This technique is an easily applied measure of fruit texture that is related to sensory characteristics such as 'crunchiness' [Vincent, J.F.V., Saunders, D.E.J., Beyts, P., 2002. The use of critical stress intensity factor to quantify ""hardness"" and ""crunchiness"" objectively. J. Texture Stud. 33, 149-159]. The present study focuses on the relationship between SENB and the penetrometer test routinely used for fruit quality assessment. Fruit from cultivars Cox's Orange Pippin, Sciros, Sciearly and Scifresh were removed from cold storage at regular intervals, and texture was assessed after 1 and 7 days at 20°C. Texture was measured using a conventional puncture test with an Effegi probe and a SENB test. During the SENB test, a notched beam of apple tissue was subjected to three-point bending until it broke. Fracture toughness (Kc) and fracture energy (Gc) were calculated, and Low-Temperature Scanning Electron Microscopy (LTSEM) was used to examine the fracture surface following beam failure. Both Kc and Gc were correlated with puncture force, but the relationship was different for Sciros and Sciearly (two siblings from a Gala × Splendour cross) compared to the other cultivars. Sciros and Sciearly apples had higher Kc and Gc values than would be anticipated from measurements of puncture force. This supports the suggestion that these apples are crisper when eaten than might be expected from puncture (penetrometer) values. Comparison of the texture of shrivelled and non-shrivelled Sciros apples indicated that puncture measurements are unreliable when fruit are dehydrated. Puncture measurements suggested shrivelled apples were 'crisper' than non-shrivelled fruit, while SENB parameters indicated the reverse. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We have recently demonstrated that the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R), which is abundantly expressed in the heart, plays a key role in energy metabolism of the fasting heart. However, little is known about the function and regulation of the VLDL-R during sepsis. In the present study, we explored lipid accumulation and VLDL-R expression in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated heart in vivo and regulation of VLDL-R expression in vitro. Methods and results: Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that LPS significantly decreased both lipid accumulation and VLDL-R expression in the hearts of fasting mice. Treatment with LPS also downregulated VLDL-R in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes, and this downregulation was completely reversed by interleukin (IL)-1β receptor antagonist. IL-1β downregulated the expression of VLDL-R in a time- and dose-dependent manner and markedly reduced the uptake of DiI-labeled β-VLDL but not DiI-labeled low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Use of specific pharmacologic inhibitors and short interference RNA revealed that Hsp90 was required for IL-1β to downregulate VLDL-R expression. Conclusions: These findings suggest that IL-1β is a principle mediator of changes in cardiac lipid and energy metabolism during sepsis through the downregulation of myocardial VLDL-R expression. © 2005 European Society of Cardiology.

However, the effect of NO-1886 on body weight, fat accumulation, and energy expenditure in ovariectomized (OVX) rats is not clear. The primary aim of this study was to ascertain whether NO-1886 ameliorated obesity in OVX rats and to examine the effects on fatty acid oxidation-related enzymes. NO-1886 decreased accumulation of visceral fat and suppressed the increase in body weight resulting from the ovariectomy. NO-1886 decreased the respiratory quotient and increased expression of the fatty acid translocase messenger RNA (mRNA) in the liver, soleus muscle, and mesenteric fat. NO-1886 also increased the expression of fatty acid-binding protein mRNA in the liver and soleus muscle and the expression of the uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) mRNA in the heart, soleus muscle, and mesenteric fat, but not in the brown adipose tissue. Furthermore, NO-1886 did not affect UCP1 and UCP2 in brown adipose tissue. Therefore, amelioration of obesity by NO-1886 in OVX rats is possibly because of an the increased expression of fatty acid oxidation-related enzymes and UCP3, both of which are related to fatty acid transfer and fat use. Our study indicates that the LPL-promoting agent NO-1886 may be potentially beneficial in the treatment of obesity and obesity-linked health problems in postmenopausal women. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A whole-farm modeling approach was used to investigate promising mitigation measures. The effects of potential mitigation measures were modeled to obtain estimates of net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from representative dairy model farms in five European regions. The potential to reduce farm GHG emissions was calculated per kg milk to compare organic and conventional production systems and to investigate region and system specific differences. An optimized lifetime efficiency of dairy cows reduced GHG emissions by up to 13% compared to baseline model farms. The evaluation of frequent removal of manure from animal housing into outside covered storage reduced farm GHG emissions by up to 7.1%. Scraping of fouled surfaces per se was not an effective option since the reduction in GHG emissions from animal housing was more than out-weighed by increased emissions from the storage and after field application. Manure application by trail hose and injection, respectively, was found to reduce farm GHG emissions on average by 0.7 and 3.2% compared to broadcasting. The calculated model scenarios for anaerobic digestion demonstrated that biogas production could be a very efficient and cost-effective option to reduce GHG emissions. The efficiency of this mitigation measure depends on the amount and quality of organic matter used for co-digestion, and how much of the thermal energy produced is exploited. A reduction of GHG emissions by up to 96% was observed when all thermal energy produced was used to substitute fossil fuels. Potential measures and strategies were scaled up to the level of European regions to estimate their overall mitigation potential. The mitigation potential of different strategies based on a combination of measures ranged from -25 up to -105% compared to baseline model farms. A full implementation of the most effective strategy could result in a total GHG emission reduction of about 50 Mt of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents per year for conventional dairy farms of EU(15) comparable to the defined model farms. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a review is presented of the agriculture related sources of methane and nitrous oxide, and of the main strategies for mitigation. The rumen is the most important source of methane production, especially in cattle husbandry. Less, but still substantial, amounts of methane are produced from cattle manures. In pig and poultry husbandry, most methane originates from manures. The main sources of nitrous oxide are: nitrogen fertilisers, land applied animal manure, and urine deposited by grazing animals. Most effective mitigation strategies for methane comprise a source approach, i.e. changing animals' diets towards greater efficiencies. Methane emissions, however, can also be effectively reduced by optimal use of the gas produced from manures, e.g. for energy production. Frequent and complete manure removal from animal housing, combined with on-farm biogas production is an example of an integrated on-farm solution. Reduced fertiliser nitrogen input, optimal fertiliser form, adding nitrification inhibitors, land drainage management, and reduced land compaction by restricted grazing are the best ways to mitigate nitrous oxide emissions from farm land, whereas, management of bedding material and solid manure reduce nitrous oxide emissions from housing and storage. Other than for methane, mitigation measures for nitrous oxide interact with other important environmental issues, like reduction of nitrate leaching and ammonia emission. Mitigation strategies for reduction of the greenhouse gases should also minimize pollution swapping. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about effects of this management strategy on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during fermentation, storage, and field application of the substrates compared to untreated slurries. In this study, we compared cattle slurry and cattle slurry with potato starch as additive during the process of fermentation, during storage and after field application. The addition of potato starch strongly enhanced CH4 production from 4230 l CH4 m-3 to 8625 l CH4 m-3 in the fermenter at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 29 days. Extending the HRT to 56 days had only a small effect on the CH4 production. Methane emissions from stored slurry depended on storage temperature and were highest from unfermented slurry followed by the slurry/starch mixture. Gas emissions from untreated and fermented slurry during storage were further analyzed in a pilot-scale experiment with different levels of covering such as straw cover, a wooden lid and no cover. Emissions of greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O, NH3) were in the range of 14.3-17.1 kg CO2 eq. m-3 during winter (100 day storage period) and 40.5-90.5 kg CO2 eq. m-3 during summer (140 day storage period). A straw cover reduced NH3 losses, but not overall GHG emissions, whereas a solid cover reduced CH4 and NH 3 emissions. After field application, there were no significant differences between slurry types in GHG emissions (4.15-8.12 kg CO2 eq. m-3 a-1). GHG emissions from slurry stores were more important than emissions after field application. Co-digestion of slurry with additives such as starch has a large potential to substitute fossil energy by biogas. On a biogas plant, slurry stores should be covered gas-tight in order to eliminate GHG emissions and collect CH4 for electricity production. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Box 50, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark","Agriculture is an important contributor to global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), in particular for methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Emissions from farms with a stock of ruminant animals are particularly high due to CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation and manure handling, and due to the intensive nitrogen (N) cycle on such farms leading to direct and indirect N2O emissions. The whole-farm model, FarmGHG, was designed to quantify the flows of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) on dairy farms. The aim of the model was to allow quantification of effects of management practices and mitigation options on GHG emissions. The model provides assessments of emissions from both the production unit and the pre-chains. However, the model does not quantify changes in soil C storage. Model dairy farms were defined within five European agro-ecological zones for both organic and conventional systems. The model farms were all defined to have the same utilised agricultural area (50 ha). Cows on conventional and organic model farms were defined to achieve the same milk yield, so the basic difference between conventional and organic farms was expressed in the livestock density. The organic farms were defined to be 100% self-sufficient with respect to feed. The conventional farms, on the other hand, import concentrates as supplementary feed and their livestock density was defined to be 75% higher than the organic farm density. Regional differences between farms were expressed in the milk yield, the crop rotations, and the cow housing system and manure management method most common to each region. The model results showed that the emissions at farm level could be related to either the farm N surplus or the farm N efficiency. The farm N surplus appeared to be a good proxy for GHG emissions per unit of land area. The GHG emissions increased from 3.0 Mg CO2-eq ha -1 year-1 at a N surplus of 56 kg N ha-1 year-1 to 15.9 Mg CO2-eq ha-1 year-1 at a N surplus of 319 kg N ha-1 year-1. The farm N surplus can relatively easily be determined on practical farms from the farm records of imports and exports and the composition of the crop rotation. The GHG emissions per product unit (milk or metabolic energy) were quite closely related to the farm N efficiency, and a doubling of the N efficiency from 12.5 to 25% reduced the emissions per product unit by ca. 50%. The farm N efficiency may therefore be used as a proxy for comparing the efficiencies of farms with respect to supplying products with a low GHG emission. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, results of an electron-proton Compton scattering experiment on the polymer are presented. The results reveal a strong decrease of the scattering integral intensities due to the protons in these materials. Thus far these effects have found no common explanation based on existing condensed matter theories. Rather, they invoke the existence of quantum correlations (also called quantum entanglement - QE) and decoherence between the particles. Of particular importance in the present context is the fact that the interaction time of the probe (i.e. neutron or electron) must be of the same order of magnitude as the decay of the coherence (also called decoherence) of the correlated particles. The found experimental effects and their possible explanations may have far reaching consequences for condensed matter physics and in particular for the theoretical treatment of hydrogen containing materials. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

This rule applies also for other organic/inorganic materials if the interaction between hydrogen and the solid surface remains the Van der Waals force.

Moreover, a change in memory size will alter the timing and pattern of references in a multiprogramming mix. This paper presents an equation to model how memory size affects page faults. The equation is derived with the help of a conjectured invariant on the interaction between reference behavior and replacement policy. The page fault equation is validated in several experiments with real applications and systems.

It was found that phenyl-alanine exhibits a linear dose response in the dose region 0.1-17 kGy. However, phenyl-alanine is about 10 times less sensitive to γ-irradiation than standard l-α-alanine irradiated at the same doses. Moreover, the EPR response from phenyl-alanine is unstable and, independent of the absorbed dose, decreases by about 50% within 20 days after irradiation upon storage at room temperature. γ-irradiated polycrystalline perdeuterated L-α-alanine (CD3CD(NH2)COOH) has not previously been studied at room temperature by EPR spectroscopy. The first part of the present analysis was with respect to the structure of the EPR spectrum. By spectrum simulations, the presence of at least two radiation induced free radicals, R1=CH3C•(H)COOH and R 2=H3N+-C•(CH 3)COO-, was confirmed very clearly. Both these radicals were suggested previously from EPR and ENDOR studies of standard alanine crystals. The further investigations into the potential use of alanine-d 4 as RSM, after choosing optimal EPR spectrometer settings parameters for this purpose, show that it is ca. two times more sensitive than standard L-α-alanine. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

During night the PCM crystallises, energy is released. During daytime air is circulated in the unit, energy is absorbed and the indoor air is cooled. The characteristic of PCM is that there is an increase of the specific heat over a limited temperature span. This is the principle that is used in the design of the PCM air heat exchanger unit. The action of a PCM storage unit will act differently depending of the thermal properties of the material. In an ideal material the phase transition occurs at a given temperature. On the market, compounds containing PCM are available which, in order to create a suitable melting temperature, are mixtures of different products. In these materials, the transition from liquid to solid takes place over a temperature span, i.e. the specific heat varies with the temperature. This can be represented by a cP(T) curve, specific heat as a function of the temperature. In this paper, the development of a mathematical model of the PCM air heat exchanger is presented. Considerations are taken to different shapes of the cP(T) curve. The mathematical model is verified with measurement on a prototype heat exchanger.

These windows constitute the passive solar heating system. This paper studies the active heating system of a passive house, which includes the following sub-systems: (1) solar thermal collectors, (2) a water storage tank, (3) a secondary water circuit, (4) a domestic hot water preparation system and (5) an air ventilation and heating system. Models for all sub-systems are presented. The integrated model was implemented to Pirmasens Passive House (Rhineland Palatinate, Germany). The active solar heating system provides a smaller amount of heat than the heat provided by the passive solar heating system. Almost all the solar energy collected is not used for space heating but to domestic hot water (DHW) preparation. However, there is still a need for the classical water heater to operate all over the year. Almost all space heating thermal load is covered by using the classical air heater that operates mainly during the nights from November to April. The solar fraction lies between 0.180 in February and 0.679 in October, with a yearly average of 0.446.

A new-style cool storage scheme working with high-temperature water for air-conditioning is introduced in this paper. By supercooling refrigerant before being throttled with 2-38 °C water, the refrigerating output is raised and the water's sensible heat is converted to cool energy to be used for cool storage air-conditioning. The characteristics and performance of three systems with different water cycle patterns, viz., unmixed, fully mixed and partially mixed, were theoretically analyzed and simulated. For an unmixed system, its performance is sensitive to g, the ratio of heat capacity flow rate of supercooling water to that of refrigerant, and the total cool storage efficiency reaches a max value when g = 1. For a fully mixed system, its performance changes with time and the supercooling efficiency decreases gradually. For a partially mixed system, a thermal transfer model for the thermally stratified water tank was established in order to simulate the time-dependent temperature profiles. The influences of water mass flow rate, design service time and tank height on its dynamic performance were investigated. The results help design, control and optimization of these systems. © 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Air-conditioning; Cool storage; Dynamic characteristics; High-temperature water; Supercooling; Temperature stratification","Electric loads; Optimization; Refrigerants; Supercooling; Thermal stratification; Cool storage; Dynamic characteristics; High temperature water; Temperature stratification; Air conditioning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27744479865

However, mobile devices still have restricted capabilities with respect to processing, storage space, energy consumption, stable connectivity, bandwidth availability. In order to address these shortcomings, a potential solution is context-awareness (by context we refer to the implicit information related both to the requesting user and service provider that can affect the usefulness of the returned results). Context plays the role of a filtering mechanism, allowing only transmission of relevant data and services back to the device, thus saving bandwidth and reducing processing costs. In this paper, we present an architecture for context-aware service discovery. We describe in detail the system implementation and we present the system evaluation as a tradeoff between a) the increase of the quality of service discovery when context-awareness is taken into account and b) the extra cost/burden imposed by context management. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Under negative polarisation, a pseudocapacitive behaviour of activated carbon has been demonstrated, that is related with reversible hydrogen adsorption in the pores. It allows carbon to be polarised at potential values far from the thermodynamic decomposition of the electrolyte. Balancing the mass of these two materials with pseudocapacitive properties results in a practical cell voltage of 2 V in aqueous medium, with energy densities close to the values obtained with electric double layer capacitors working in organic electrolytes, while avoiding their disadvantages. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

For eight weeks prior to slaughtering, the fish were fed diets containing either 100% fish oil (M-group) or 60% fish oil and 40% soybean oil (S-group). Filleting was performed 0.5 h after slaughtering and the fillets were stored at 6°C for 48 h post-mortem. The contraction rate was faster for the S-group, but after 48 h storage the contraction was 21% of the initial fillet length for both fish groups. The ATP content analysed 1 h post-mortem was lower of the S-group (4.5 μm g- 1 ww) compared with the M-group (6.1 μm g - 1 ww). After 16 h, the ATP content was similar for both fish groups (1.7-2.2 μm g- 1 ww). The muscle pH analysed 1 h post-mortem was 0.2 unit lower of the S-group (pH 6.9) than of the M-group (pH 7.1). From 8 to 12 h, the pH fell significantly to 6.3 and 6.6 for the S-group and M-group, respectively. From 24 h and onwards, the pH was similar of both fish groups (pH 6.2). Texture development differed significantly due to dietary treatment. The S-group had highest initial breaking force, demonstrating that the texture of this group was firmer immediately after slaughtering. The breaking force of the S-group dropped to a stable level after 4 h, whereas the breaking force of the M-group decreased continuously during the storage period. The breaking force was similar of both groups after 16 h storage. The L*-value (lightness) increased during the first 4-6 h storage. From 8 to 16 h, the L*-value was stable or slightly decreasing. The L*-value was consistently higher of the M-group. In conclusion, dietary inclusion of soybean oil resulted in faster energy depletion post-mortem, faster rigor contraction, faster reduction of the breaking strength and lower L*-values. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The modulation of the expression of this membrane transport protein might play an important role in the susceptibility to the development of obesity. The aim of the present study was to compare the AQP7 gene expression in subcutaneous abdominal fat in lean vs. obese high fat intakers with a similar daily physical activity pattern. Twelve young men, 6 lean (BMI = 23.2 ± 0.4 kg/m2) and 6 obese (35.0 ± 1.1 kg/m2) with a similar habitual dietary intake of fat (45.5 ± 2.5 vs. 43.5 ± 1.7% daily energy from fat for lean and obese, respectively) and physical activity (16.0 ± 5.7 vs. 17.2 ± 5.1 METs h/week for lean and obese, respectively), were recruited. Subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsies were obtained and total RNA was extracted and purified. Pools of RNA from lean and obese individuals were probed into Affymetrix GeneChip Human U133A. The microarray analysis revealed that AQP7 gene was down-regulated in obese compared to lean subjects. The results of the microarray analysis were confirmed by real-time PCR studies. In summary, our data show that the AQP7 gene is differentially expressed in adipose tissue of lean and obese individuals. The down-regulation of the AQP7 gene could be implicated in the susceptibility to obesity by reducing glycerol release and promoting the accumulation of lipids in the adipose tissue. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the possibility of improving the efficiency and simultaneously minimizing the environmental impact of energy conversion processes, together with the opportunity to reduce the dependency of fossil fuels, are main drivers for the currently increasing research and development efforts. However, significant technological breakthroughs are necessary for making a hydrogen economy feasible. In particular, it is necessary to develop appropriate hydrogen storage and transportation technologies. Recently, metal ammine salts were proposed as safe, reversible, high-density and low-cost hydrogen carriers. Here, we discuss how this development could provide a platform for using ammonia as a fuel for the hydrogen economy. We do that by comparing various possible hydrogen carriers with respect to energy and cost efficiency, infrastructure requirements, safety concerns and also environmental impact.

The investigation was conducted on 30 elderly and 19 young adult males. For the analysis of possible MTU adaptation in response to endurance running the subjects were divided into two subgroups: non-active vs. endurance-runners. All subjects performed isometric maximal voluntary plantarflexion and knee extension contractions on a dynamometer. The distal aponeurosis of the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and vastus lateralis (VL) during plantarflexion and knee extensions and the muscle architecture of the GM and VL were visualized by ultrasonography. The maximal knee and ankle joint moment were higher for the young compared to the elderly population (p<0.05). No identifiable differences in muscle architecture between young and elderly subjects were detected in VL and GM. Aging results in a reduced (p<0.05) normalized stiffness of the quadriceps femoris tendon and aponeurosis, which were not identifiable for the triceps surae. In contrast, the properties of both MTUs showed no major differences between endurance-runners and the non-active group (p>0.05). Only pennation angle at the GM were higher for the runners compared to the non-active group (p<0.05). The present results indicate that tendon changes related to aging do not occur proportionally in different MTUs. Furthermore, it seems that the extra stress and load imposed on high-load-bearing MTUs during endurance running may not be sufficient to produce significant adaptative processes in the mechanical parameters analyzed. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent evidence suggests that an emerging class of enzymes containing a conserved patatin domain are centrally important players in lipid degradation. Here we describe the identification and characterization of amajor triglyceride lipase of the adipose triglyceride lipase/Brummer family, Tgl4, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Elimination of Tgl4 in a tgl3 background led to fat yeast, rendering growing cells unable to degrade triglycerides. Tgl4 and Tgl3 lipases localized to lipid droplets, independent of each other. Serine 315 in the GXSXG lipase active site consensus sequence of the patatin domain of Tgl4 is essential for catalytic activity. Mouse adipose triglyceride lipase (which also contains a patatin domain but is otherwise highly divergent in primary structure from any yeast protein) localized to lipid droplets when expressed in yeast, and significantly restored triglyceride breakdown in tgl4 mutants in vivo.

Diets were formulated to have similar digestible energy (13.8 MJ/kg) and total lysine (11.0 g/kg) contents. Thirty boars (58 kg) were assigned to one of the five dietary treatments (six per treatment) as follows: (T1) 0 g Lactofeed/kg (860 g whey permeate/kg, 140 g soya bean meal/kg, Volac International, UK) (LF70); (T2) 40 g LF70/kg; (T3) 80 g LF70/kg; (T4) 120 g LF70/kg; and (T5) 160 g LF70/kg. After a 14-day adaptation period, pigs were housed in metabolism crates and faeces and urine were collected for nitrogen balance and ammonia emission. NH3-N emission was measured over 10 days using a laboratory scale procedure. Coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) for dry matter and gross energy digestibility were affected by dietary LF70 inclusion (quadratic, P&lt;0.05). T1 had a higher urinary N and total N excretion (P&lt;0.1), a lower N retention (as a proportion of intake) (P&lt;0.05) than the LF70 supplemented diets. T1 had a higher NH3-N per gram of N intake from days 0 to 4 (P&lt;0.05) than the LF70 supplemented diets. In the faeces isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid were affected by dietary LF70 level (quadratic, P&lt;0.01). There was a linear decrease in the ratio of acetic acid: propionic acid with increasing LF70 levels (P&lt;0.05). In the caecum and colon lactobacilli concentrations were affected by dietary LF70 inclusion (quadratic, P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that the incorporation of lactofeed in finisher pig diets increases CTTAD for gross energy and the concentration of lactobacilli in the hind-gut and decreases total nitrogen excretion. The inclusion of lactofeed also reduces the quantity of ammonia emitted from fresh manure in the first 4 days of storage. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Storage of electrical energy is the most critical aspect of hybrid automobiles. Therefore, an exact knowledge of the behavior of the battery and further electrical storage elements is mandatory. Their nonlinear characteristics over wide ranges of current magnitude, transient period, temperature and state of charge must be evaluated. Battery aging is another matter of increasing importance. For this reason, an automated battery test bench has been developed which is capable of reproducing high dynamic loads in both charging and discharging direction. Pulse rise times are in the range of a few microseconds at maximum currents up to 1500 A. The quasi-static charge and discharge power can reach 20 kW. Optimized characterization programs enable a rapid extraction of battery behavior parameters as well as capacitor characteristics. With this equipment various types of automotive batteries such as lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride batteries and all types of double-layer capacitors can be characterized. For statistical analysis of several batteries in parallel, a compact version of the test bench with reduced current amplitudes and transient response times was developed. This stand-alone tester can be used for both stimulating aging effects and characterizing the most relevant battery parameters simultaneously. The battery measurement equipment was successfully used to characterize different types of batteries. Parameterization of a battery model with high transient and amplitude dynamics for automotive applications was reached.

The objective was to gather data, which will give us the capability to assess the performance of these cells during typical space missions.

Li-Ion cells have: (1) reduced mass, (2) increased volumetric efficiency, (3) improved cycle and calendar life, (4) higher power and energy (5) lower self discharge, (6) no ""memory effect"", (7) excellent low temperature performance and (8) are more environmentally friendly than other types of batteries, such as Ag-Zn or NiH2 and; therefore, may be a better alternative to these traditional types of cells for space applications. Life cycle testing was performed with Li-Ion cells purchased from three different cell manufacturers. Eight space cells have been subjected to a 25% depth of discharge (DoD) low earth orbit (LEO) cycle, which consists of 110 minutes per cycle equaling 13 cycles per day. The two Vendor A (45Ah) cells have undergone tests for more than seven years. The two Vendor B (42Ah) cells have undergone tests for more than four years, and two Vendor C (45Ah) cells have also been tested for more than two years, yielding an experience base ranging from approximately range 9,000 to 26,000 cycles.

Among these is regenerative braking. Its impact on vehicle fuel consumption can be determined by vehicle testing and/or computer simulation. In this paper, equations are developed that complement these results by offering a means for readily quantifying the potential impacts of regenerative braking on a vehicle's tractive-fuel consumption. Driving schedules can be decomposed into three generic modes - powered driving, braking, and idling. Without regenerative braking, the tractive-fuel consumed for powered driving is determined by the tractive energy required to propel a vehicle along a driving schedule, and the efficiency with which this energy can be delivered by the powertrain. The addition of regenerative braking reduces the portion of tractive energy that must be directly supplied by the powerplant. This reduction is determined by the vehicle kinetic energy that must be removed by wheel braking, and the braking-wheel to traction-wheel effectiveness with which it is recovered, stored, and subsequently recycled for propulsion. Correlations of tractive and braking energies are developed for broad ranges of vehicle mass, tire rolling resistance, and aerodynamic drag, and for the driving schedules used for fuel-economy regulation in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Using these correlations, equations are developed that quantify the potential reductions in tractive-fuel consumption enabled by regenerative braking. The sensitivity of tractive-fuel consumption to reductions in the vehicle parameters is changed significantly by regenerative braking, and this is quantified as well. The mathematical formulations of the study facilitate physical understanding of the results.

However, in order to power the fuel cells, hydrogen must be generated at some point, the ideal source being the logistic fuels such as JP-5 or JP-8 that is already used for propulsion. This process is not trivial, as several potential issues can arise from processing logistic fuel, the two primary concerns being the effect of sulfur within the fuel on the processing and fuel cell components, and the longevity issues resulting from coke formation during fuel processing. In the first part of this paper, we look as work that we have performed that addresses some of these issues for the steam reforming of JP-5 to produce pure hydrogen for fuel cell use. Specifically, we have identified a means to separate the reforming process into several steps in order to minimize the amount and cost of maintenance that must be done on the system. This separation can potentially lead to other optimizations in the reforming pathway. Results from bench-scale demonstrations of these processing steps will be presented based on the conversion of JP-5 fuel. In considering applications for this technology, a ground cart would likely be the first large scale target that can then be used to plan for other application areas. Present ground carts ranging from 90 to 300kVA power output are a critical tool for aviation support, but are presently based on the inefficient conversion of logistic fuels to power through internal combustion. It may be possible to replace the internals of a ground cart to use fuel cell to improve the efficiency of the energy conversion process, however, certain decisions will need to be made as to what processes will be retained on board the ground cart and which can be done at a central facility to support multiple ground carts. Three possible arrangements of equipment for ground carts based on logistic fuels can be identified: The use of a hydrogen storage medium with hydrogen directly feed to the fuel cell. This option would require a stationary plant to generate hydrogen, most likely through the desulphurization and reforming of logistic fuels. The use of on-board reforming of sulfur free logistic fuel, with the output sent to the fuel cell. A central plant to handle the sulfur removal of the fuel would be required. The use of both on-board desulphurization and reforming of as-delivered logistic fuels, with the resulting output feed to the fuel cell. In this case, no additional support facilities would be needed. In the second part of this paper, we examine each of the above scenarios in the consideration of replacing a current 90kVA combustion-based unit. System models have been built for fuel processing of JP-5 in order to size the individual processes within the ground cart and provide representative mock-ups of each arrangement. Other factors such as environmental, maintenance, and longevity have also been considered as part of this study. We have also considered the prospect of using other fuel cells besides PEM-based units as to determine if improvements in thermal and mass integration can be performed for each configuration. Additionally, we consider what the size of the off-board support systems would be to support a number of ground carts.

The aim of this experiment was to demonstrate that such a device can be operated under normal user conditions. Compared with permanent magnet undulators, superconducting undulators have a higher magnetic field strength (for a given period length and a given gap width) and can be tuned electrically. The higher field strength allows the production of photon beams with higher brilliance and higher photon energy. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071344842

The aim of this study was to test stability of pigments (chl a, chl b and lutein) in pistachio kernels stored for 14 months, in the dark, at three different temperatures: 10, 25 and 37°C. The samples were packaged using two films (nylon and EVOH), with and without oxygen scavengers; packages were hermetically closed. Moreover, per each temperature, some samples were packaged in bags without a hermetic seal, as reference. After 14 months, at the end of the storage period, pigments underwent a degradation that was influenced by storage time and temperatures. Lower concentrations were observed at 37°C with a degradation of about: 62% for chl a, 44% for chl b, 57% for lutein. At 10 and 25°C, the samples didn’t show any differences statistically significant and the degradation of pigments were: 46% for chl a, 33% for chl b, 37% for lutein. Among samples, during storage no difference was observed, due to the packaging films or the presence of oxygen scavengers. At 25°C, after 11 months, samples packaged in bags not closed hermetically, showed a presence of moulds and bugs (Plodia interpunctella - Hubner). For kinetic study, rate of degradation of the three pigments fitted a pseudo-zero-order kinetic and it was observed an activation energy of: 11.7 KJ/mol, 12.1 KJ/mol and 18.2 KJ/mol, respectively for chl a, chl b and lutein. © 2006 Chiriotti Editori.

The pilot plant was designed, fabricated, tested and simulated at the solar energy laboratory, Mattarria Faculty of Engineering, Cairo, Egypt. The distillation chamber consists of a humidifier (evaporator) and a dehumidifier (condenser) units. The circulation of air in the two units is maintained by natural convection. The cold salt water is preheated inside the distillation unit before exchanging heat with the solar collector loop. This plant has a flat-plate collector field area of 3.1 m2, it constitutes a closed loop with its own storage tank. The research is then carried out to evaluate the unit performance of such design and to estimate the fraction factor of the solar system to the load. A numerical simulation was developed for the system being considered. A detailed annual performance of the system is presented. The annual variation of the temperatures and useful heat gain were estimated for the system components.

According to a recent report from the World Health Organization,1 the prevalence of both conditions has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, with rates of about 50 to 60% of the adult population in the U.S., Canada, and European countries.2-6 The health consequences of obesity are enormous. Obesity is associated with some of the most prevalent diseases of modern societies, including type 2 diabetes, hyper tension, cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer (breast, uterus, prostate, colon). The increase in the prevalence of obesity observed worldwide in the past 50 years has occurred in a changing environment characterized by a progressive reduction in energy expenditure associated with physical activity and the abundance of highly palatable foods. These environmental changes occurred over a period of time that is too short to cause changes in the frequencies of genes associated with obesity. Thus, genes that were selected for energy storage in the primitive hunter/gatherer populations are now detrimental in an era of food abundance. From a genetic point of view, this suggests that gene-environment interactions are important in determining an individuals’ susceptibility to obesity and related co-morbidities. © 2006 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056971651

In the early seventies, the focus was placed upon solar energy collection and storage for heating purposes only, and the dominating perspective was the substitution of conventional energy sources and equipments. The main application was in residential buildings. While centered on (solar) technologies, that approach to improve indoor environmental conditions was too far from the highly sophisticated technological approach represented by the use of air conditioning for producing comfort. Today’s quick pace of change has however contributed to make those two worlds much closer than one could imagine at first sight. The growing consideration given to different types of passive non-residential buildings, many of which equipped with some type of air conditioning system, and the fact that air conditioning systems are being themselves identified as sources of contamination for both indoors and outdoors, converge to suggest reductions in auxiliary energy systems both in terms of dimension (power) and use (energy). This paper will discuss the implications of comfort on the strategies for building design along the ideas discussed in the previous paragraphs, with a special emphasis on nonresidential buildings. © 1991 Artur Bezelga and Peter Brandon.","Building design; Comfort; Energy conservation in buildings; Passive solar buildings",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056915182

Predictions based on extrapolation of the energy consumption show that the demand will soon exceed the supply. However, it is difficult to establish exactly how long the fossil fuels will last. New oil and gas fields are being still discovered, and the methods for retrieving oil from known fields are continuously improving although extraction energy costs would become higher than the actual energy yield due to the increased energy costs for research, deep drilling, as well as to lower quality and accessibility of the still available oil storages [3].

Out of the three traditional methods of CO2 capture (absorption, adsorption and membrane processes), absorption is considered to be the best available technology for post-combustion application. However, amine absorption requires 4-6 GJ/tonne of recovered CO2, in a large part due to significant energy consumption associated with the regeneration step. In this paper, we perform a systematic analysis of the separation performances and associated energy cost of a single-stage membrane module. First, the operational limits are identified in terms of permeate composition and CO2 recovery ratio via a systematic parametric study for CO2/N2 mixtures. The energy consumption of the capture step is then evaluated and compared with the performance of amine absorption. Next, the search for an optimal strategy in terms of compression energy for a combination of membrane capture and CO2 injection has been addressed. The results allow the identification of an optimal membrane pressure ratio for a given set of conditions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this collector, the absorber plate-container unit performs the function of both absorbing the solar energy and storing PCM. The solar energy was stored in paraffin wax, which was used as a PCM, and was discharged to cold water flowing in pipes located inside the wax. The collector's effective area was assumed to be 1 m2 and its total volume was divided into 5 sectors. The experimental apparatus was designed to simulate one of the collector's sectors, with an apparatus-absorber effective area of 0.2 m2. Outdoor experiments were carried out to demonstrate the applicability of using a compact solar collector for water heating. The time-wise temperatures of the PCM were recorded during the processes of charging and discharging. The solar intensity was recorded during the charging process. Experiments were conducted for different water flow rates of 8.3-21.7 kg/h. The effect of the water flow rate on the useful heat gain (Qu) was studied. The heat transfer coefficients were calculated for the charging process. The propagation of the melting and freezing front was also studied during the charging and discharging processes. The experimental results showed that in the charging process, the average heat transfer coefficient increases sharply with increasing the molten layer thickness, as the natural convection grows strong. In the discharge process, the useful heat gain was found to increase as the water mass flow rate increases. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The transport of WSOC is an important process for the transfer of organic matter in forest ecosystems and for the development of SOM. In the boreal zone, the climate change may influence the decomposition of SOM, as well as the fluxes of WSOC in terrestrial ecosystems, and its export to rivers. The aim of this study was to identify the amount of WSOC accumulated in the catchment area (4,240 ha) underlain by continuous permafrost, as well as its annual export to streams. The WSOC content in a moss-lichen layer varies significantly, depending on the site hydrothermal regime and plant species composition. The WSOC capital was low (10–50 kgC ha-1) on 37% of the watershed territory, where the moss-lichen layer had been destroyed by a ground fire in 1990. In undisturbed larch ecosystems the WSOC was as high as &gt;50 kgC ha-1. The entire watershed WSOC storage in the moss-lichen layer was estimated to be 511 tC, comprising about 1.2% of the total biomass of the moss-lichen layer in the watershed. The stock of litter accumulated in the catchments varied from 2.4 to 76.3 t ha-1, with the lowest values characteristic of the burnt areas and south-facing slopes. The larch stands growing on the north-facing slopes and in valleys were dominated by feathermoss and Sphagnum (28% watershed territory), where the litter accumulation was &gt;50 t ha-1. The estimated total accumulation of WSOC analyzed in the litter of the watershed was 133.7 tC, and comprised of 0.3% total Corg. The overall WSOC storage, including mineral soil, at the watershed reached 3,100 tC. The flux of WSOC in the stream during the growing season was about 200 tC year-1 (5 gC m-2 y-1). The WSOC loss from the watershed was as much as 7% of the overall WSOC that had accumulated in the moss-lichen layer, litter and 50 cm of the mineral soil layer, or 3–5% of the NPP. © 2006, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Export; Larch ecosystems; Permafrost; Water-soluble organic carbon; Watershed",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024221331

The memory bandwidth is both an issue at the shared SDRAM memory as well as on the local memory layer. Modern multi-media applications contain multiple tasks and/or benefit from task parallelisation. However, tasks running on multiple processors can access the same memory in parallel. This causes access conflicts that delay the system and increase its energy cost. Since existing techniques also optimise the memory bandwidth inside a single task, they cannot cope with inter-task conflicts. A need thus exists for techniques that optimise the memory bandwidth across the tasks' boundaries. We have therefore introduced several task-ordering/data assignment techniques for both the local memory layer as the SDRAM. Multi-media applications consist of multiple tasks which are started/stopped at runtime due to user events. Also the tasks themselves have become data-dependent. We have shown that design-time nor runtime techniques can effectively deal with this dynamic behaviour. Therefore, we have introduced a novel scenario-based memory bandwidth approach. It combines the best of the design-time and runtime techniques. Finally, runtime memory management requires an efficient management of the free space. We have introduced a methodology which customises the DM managers for this purpose. © 2006 The Institution of Electrical Engineers and 2008 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Bandwidth; Information management; Storage allocation (computer); Assignment technique; Dynamic applications; Dynamic behaviours; Efficient managements; Memory bandwidths; Memory management; Multi- threaded applications; Multiple processors; Dynamic random access storage",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013428412

First, they may confirm, or not confirm, structures and mechanisms proposed on the basis of analyses of the living system. Second, they may lead to a purely photochemical system for the capture and storage of solar energy. For the latter purpose, the most interesting part of the photosynthetic process is photosystem II, in which water is split by visible light into oxygen and areduced material. The principal stages of t he process are probably (a) light harvesting and trapping, (fo) electron transfer from chlorophyll to a quinone, and (c) oxidation of water via an intermediate containing manganese. Each of these three processes has now been reproduced to some extent in vitro but the light harvesting antenna efficiencies are lowered by concentration quenching. Recent progress, including kinetic investigations in the picosecond region and theoretical studies of energy transfer in the antenna are described. © 2006 by Imperial College Press.

This process provides the essential charge separation that drives subsequent energy-storage reactions. Numerous model systems have duplicated the electron-transfer step but fast charge recombination prevents storage of energy. This basic reaction was recognised by Lord George Porter in the early 1970s as being the critical feature for the future evolution of artificial photosynthetic systems. Moreover, it was stressed that the quinone had to be free to diffuse from the reaction site so as to facilitate two-electron chemistry by way of disproportionation. In order to realise the type of chemistry envisioned by Porter, we have studied a new porphyrin-quinone model compound whereby the porphyrin is equipped with a peripheral calixarene unit. This latter module possesses a central cavity that can bind the quinone in a position suitable for electron transfer from the excited singlet state of the porphyrin. Intracavity electron transfer must compete with both charge-transfer complexation and diffusional quenching. Here, we review the electron-transfer chemistry of this supramolecular entity in terms of Porter's original simplistic model for the bacterial reaction centre complex. © 2006 by Imperial College Press.

To solve these problems, a new solid fuel called Eco-fuel has been developed by briquetting a mixture of coal and different plastics. The commonly used plastics (polyethylene and polystyrene) were used in this study. Eco-fuel is clean, strong and easy to handle. It is easier to ignite than raw coal.

In order to maintain a stable body weight over an extended period, energy intake as solid or liquid food must be matched with energy expended in metabolism and physical activity with a remarkable degree of accuracy. For example, it has been calculated that the typical change in weight and body composition over a decade by an adult human would require energy supply and demand to be matched to a precision of around 0.2% (Weigle, 1994). This level of accuracy is achieved despite longitudinal variability in availability of, and requirement for, energy. For almost all mammals, other than those maintained under strictly controlled laboratory conditions, the composition, quality and quantity of food that is available for consumption will vary considerably between meals and from day to day, requiring the selection of a suitable combination of food types and quantities over longish periods to smooth out any temporary imbalances, such as a discontinuous supply. Similarly, energy demands will vary widely, being heavily influenced by factors such as developmental state (e.g. growing, reproducing), behaviour (e.g. social influences, migration) and environment (e.g. climate, season). Although the source of food may be discontinuous or irregular, a continuous supply of accessible energy is required for survival, necessitating storage of energy and nutrients, to ensure that supply always meets demand. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926092387

Assuming that these are the latest goals for sustainable agriculture, researchers in Korea having farms of small size and complex topography are attempting to introduce various systems for water and soil conservation. Water retaining capacity per ha of paddy fields in Korea was 5 times larger than that of upland, 3.5 times over forest area and 2 times over grassland. The total water retaining capacity on paddy fields was estimated at 23.8 billion tons for 1146 thousand ha in total, considering the present topographical condition. This quantity of water storage was equal to 47.6 times the amount of water kept in Youngweol Dam, which can store 0.5 billion ton-year-1and for whose construction one billion dollars was taken. Therefore, the most appropriate type of farming in Korea, located in the Asia monsoon belt with heavy rain, was paddy rice farming. Although water use in paddy fields was larger than in uplands, putting water into paddy land played an important role for energy equilibrium through circulation between air heated in cities and that of surrounding rural areas. In the case of water quality, a new approach and concept considering land use, including paddy fields that are covering 61% of arable lands, is required to improve water quality contaminated by agricultural pollutants in Korea. This could be possible through a pollution load evaluation system, classification of watersheds by topographical characteristics & mother rocks, sub-classification of arable lands, assessment of erosion potential and a possibility of site-specific BMP (Best Management Practice) application in the field. © OECD 2006.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909143125

The work is based on a prototype building that includes a ventilated photovoltaic array, solar air and water heating, a biomass-fired boiler, and a stratified thermal store. The supervisory control problem is, for each source, whether to deploy the received energy directly into the building, store it for later use, or reject it to the environment. These decisions are currently made by a building management system programmed with a complex, arbitrary set of rules and setpoints. The considerable number of operational states means that such a control system is very difficult to commission. Analysis of the data for the early stages of building operation indicate strongly that it is unlikely optimal use is being made of the renewable energy sources with this approach. The objective of this research is to investigate the potential effectiveness of replacing the rule-based control scheme with one based on a combination of a building/system model with an optimization algorithm. The existing building, plant, and control systems were modeled using a commercial simulation environment and calibrated against measured data from the building. A period of swing-season operation was used to compare the existing control with that based on an optimal approach. Results indicate that significant improvements in system operation are possible but also that significant improvement in execution time will be needed for any future online deployment. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958112135

The sample came from Asturias (Spain) and was analyzed by X-ray diffractometry and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Glow peaks appeared at 115, 205 and 310 °C. Main emissions occurred at 475, 575, 650 and 745 nm, attributed to the Dy+3 ion and, at 410 nm, from electron-hole recombination. The fractional glow technique and the general order model were employed to study the emission at 575 nm in detail. The results showed that the 115 and 205 °C glow peaks originate at traps with activation energies of 1.6 and 1.9 eV, respectively, on the kinetic order of 1.5 and 1.3 and frequency factors of 1.7×1019 and 2.7×1019s-1, respectively.

Matrix converters provide an all-silicon solution to the problem of converting AC power from one frequency to another, offering almost all the features required of an ideal static frequency changer. They possess many advantages compared to the conventional voltage or current source inverters. A matrix converter does not require energy storage components as a bulky capacitor or an inductance in the DC-link, and enables the bi-directional power flow between the power supply and load. The most of the contemporary modulation strategies are able to provide practically sinusoidal waveforms of the input and output currents with negligible low order harmonics, and to control the input displacement factor. The perspective of matrix converters regarding EMC in comparison with other types of converters is brightly evident because it is no need to use any equipment for power factor correction and current and voltage harmonics reduction. Such converter with proper control is properly compatible both with the supply mains and with the supplied load. A special digital control system was developed for the realized experimental test bed which makes it possible to achieve greater throughput of the digital control system and its variability.","Control system; Electromagnetic compatibility; Matrix converter; Pulse width modulation strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249114185

Also, we assess future perspectives for the hydrogen economy in such a scenario. The results show that as major petroleum and gas supplies shift to unconventional resources along the second half of this century due to resource depletion, the Middle East loses its importance as a petroleum and gas exporter and the global patterns of their transportation change significantly. We then show that while hydrogen’s competitiveness decreases due to the detailed treatment of energy and CO2 transportation, biomass-derived Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuels become attractive because their production facilitates a wide diffusion of CO2-neutral energy carriers by considerably reducing the transportation cost. FT fuels are produced in regions rich in forest resources and then transported on a large scale by tanker. By contrast, hydrogen is produced mainly at the center of its consumption regions using domestic feedstock, and its interregional delivery, which is done only by pipeline, plays a marginal role due to its high transportation cost. It is confirmed that such a hydrogen supply structure offers energy security benefits. Finally, we show that the regional distribution of CO2 storage capacity is a major determinant of the pattern of hydrogen transportation around 2100, because all the CO2 generated from hydrogen production is required to be captured for sequestration in that period and because interregional CO2 transportation is hardly chosen for economic reasons. © 2006, Springer Japan.","CO2 concentration stabilization; Fischer-Tropsch synthetic fuels; Hydrogen; Interregional energy transportation; Regionally disaggregated global energy model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46049120923

The interaction of different inputs from the environment generates the building as a built storage in which energy and materials have been stocked.

It promises economic small-scale hydrogen production, e.g. at refuelling stations and has the potential of inexpensive CO2 separation. Four configurations of the membrane reactor have been modelled with Aspenplus to determine its thermodynamic and economic prospects. Overall energy efficiency is 84%HHV without H2 compression (78% with compression up to 482 bar). The modelling results also indicate that by using a sweep gas, the membrane reactor can produce a reformer exit stream consisting mainly of CO2 and H2O (&gt;90%mol) suited for CO2 sequestration after water removal with an efficiency loss of only 1%pt. Reforming with a 2 MW membrane reactor (250 unit production volume) costs 14 $/GJH2 including compression, which is more expensive than conventional steam reforming+compression (12 $/GJ). It does, however, promise a cheap method of CO2 separation, 14 $/t CO2 captured, due to the high purity of the exit stream. The well-to-wheel chain of the membrane reactor has been compared to centralised steam reforming to assess the trade-off between production scale and the construction of a hydrogen and a CO2 distribution infrastructure. If the scale of centralised hydrogen production is below 40 MW, the trade-off could be favourable for the membrane reactor with small-scale CO2 capture (18 $/GJ including H2 storage, dispensing and CO2 sequestration for 40 MW SMR versus 19 $/GJ for MR). The membrane reactor might become competitive with conventional steam reforming provided that thin membranes can be combined with high stability and a cheap manufacturing method for the membrane tubes. Thin membranes, industrial utility prices and larger production volumes (i.e. technological learning) might reduce the levelised hydrogen cost of the membrane reactor at the refuelling station to less than 14 $/GJ including CO2 sequestration cost, below that of large-scale H2 production with CO2 sequestration (∼15 $/GJ). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular the proposed incompressible transversely isotropic model incorporates: a multiplicative split of the fibre stretch into contractile and (series) elastic stretches; the possibility of energy storage in the series elastic element; the dependence of the contractile stress on the strain rate; the governing equation of activation dynamics, so that general histories of neural stimulation may be taken as input data.

In the short term, the availability of renewable energy technology can be affected by mitigation measures. Carbon storage projects can enhance timber supply and reduce revenues from timber sales of other countries. Large-scale technical adaptation programmes can increase prices for commodities used as inputs. Societal adaptation programmes can have negative impacts on neighbouring countries by reducing natural resource availability. However, climate policy measures will not only generate losses but also benefits, often in the same countries that experience losses. Notably, emission reduction measures could reduce import bills (and volatility) for developing countries that import fossil fuels. Losses are unlikely to be insurable due to the characteristics of events with regard to timing, predictability and inseparability of causes. Emitters could be made liable for their emissions, with liability covering direct and indirect effects of the emissions. Market-based financial derivatives allow hedging against fuel price losses, albeit only in the short term. In the long term, the best approach to prevent losses and even reap benefits is an economic diversification.

Two energy management strategies that control the alternator power are analysed: a regenerative braking strategy and a more advanced strategy based on optimisation techniques. The potential behind these strategies is analysed by studying the typical characteristics of components that are directly related to the energy flow in the vehicle. It is shown that operating the internal combustion engine at the highest efficiency will not inherently lead to the lowest fuel consumption. Subsequently, engineering rules are presented to evaluate the performance that can be expected for each strategy. The component characteristics are included as input parameters to make the method generally applicable. To show the value of the engineering rules, the potential fuel reduction is computed for a specific vehicle configuration and driving cycle and compared with simulations results. © 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","energy management; fuel reduction; mild hybrid electric vehicles; regenerative braking; vehicular electric power systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248505701

By dynamically profiling the taken traces during program execution, the new scheme can achieve the goal of one BTB lookup per taken trace.

The transfer function between the output signal and the input signal of the process is: y(s)/u(s)=Wp (s) and the time constants characterizing the delays of signals due to energy storage elements result from the eigenvalues of the state matrix A. In the classical feedback control system, the controller computes the control signal according to the expression u(s) = Wc(s) ua (s) - y(s). The reduction of signal delay in the process is implemented by the PID algorithm described by the transfer function W c(s)that accelerates the feedback system by overexciting the control signal to a specified extent. The reduction of signal delay in the process can also be implemented by negative feedback of the state variables x. If the process is state controllable and the control signal is computed according to the algorithm u = kcua -Fx, the time constants of the feedback system can be freely specified by appropriate selection of F and k c. The design of the feedback gain F can be performed using the Ackermann formula; the system is accelerated by means of overexcitation of the control signal to an appropriate extent even in this case. The paper presents the fact that the gain can be chosen according to kc = C(A-BF -1B -1CA-1B, and the overexcitation ratio of the control signal can be calculated using the relationship u(0)/u(∞) = 1+F(A-BF)-1B-1. This overexcitation ratio is in connection with the rate of pole transfers that can be expressed analytically. It occurs frequently that the state variables x of the process cannot play any pan in the computation of the control signal since the state variables cannot be measured. In such cases, the state feedback can be implemented from the state variables x * (t) of a state observer according to the expression u = k cuaFx*. The paper presents the fact that the state feedback implemented based on the state observer - as opposed to the common concept - can also be interpreted as a state feedback of the process model, with the task of computing the control signal that fulfils the requirements of acceleration. This signal is applied at the input of both the process model and the real process.","Controller; Fedback control system; Observer; Overexcitation","Acceleration; Algorithms; Energy storage; Feedback control; Mathematical models; Time delay; Fedback control system; Input signals; Observers; Overexcitation; Time constants; Electric excitation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947717226

Only 20%-25% of the source energy needed to synthesized hydrogen from natural compounds can be recovered for end use by efficient fuel cells.

Hence, it does save energy which is conventionally wasted by a braking resistor. Moreover, the large engine generator is replaced by the much smaller one, because the supercapacitor reduces high power demands away from it. For the power conversion between the supercapacitor and the dc link, a three-leg bidirectional dc-dc converter, which has the same structure as the commercially available three-phase inverter, is used. Two kinds of simulations are performed to study the behaviors of the proposed system under the worst operating conditions.

However, whenever a new product is to be launched onto the market, defining which are the most relevant properties to monitor, as well as their cut-off criterion, is the subject of strong debate. Besides, for products with long estimated shelf-lives, accelerated studies have to be conducted and a third parameter has to be estimated: the acceleration factor which defines the correlation between the different storage conditions. In this study we propose a new approach for determining the shelf-life of industrialised food products, the Multivariate Accelerated Shelf-Life Test (MASLT), in which a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed and the scores of the time-related components are taken for estimating the multivariate rate constants (km), the multivariate acceleration factor (αm) and the multivariate activation energy (Eam).

As well as pipe rehabilitation decisions, tank sizing, tank siting and pump operation schedules are considered as design variables. Inclusion of pump operation schedules requires consideration of water system operation over the demand pattern period. Design of distribution storage facilities involves solving numerous issues and trade-offs such as locations, levels and volume. This paper investigates the application of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in the identification of the pay-off characteristic between total cost, reliability and water quality of Anytown's water distribution system. A new approach is presented for formulation of the model. To provide flexibility, the network must be designed and operated under multiple loading conditions. The cost of the solution includes the capital costs of pipes and tanks as well as the present value of the energy consumed during a specified period. Optimization tends to reduce costs by reducing the diameter of, or completely eliminating, pipes, thus leaving the system with insufficient capacity to respond to pipe breaks or demands that exceed design values without violating required performance levels. Here a resilience index is considered as a second objective to increase the hydraulic reliability and the availability of water during pipe failures. Considering reliability as one of the objectives in the optimization process will decrease the level of vulnerability for the solutions and therefore will result in robust networks. However, oversized distribution mains and storage tanks will have adverse effects on water age with negative effects on water quality due to low flow velocity and little turnover, respectively. Therefore, another objective in the design and operation of distribution systems with storage facilities is the minimization of residence time, thus minimizing deterioration in water quality, which is directly associated with the age of water. Residence time must include not only the time in tanks but also the travel time before and after the water's entry into the storage facilities. The residence time of the water in the network is considered as a surrogate measure of water quality. Results are presented for the pay-off characteristics between total cost, reliability and water quality, for 24 h design and five loading conditions. © IWA Publishing 2006.","Genetic algorithm; Multi-objective; Optimization; Water distribution; Water quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846941949

The result reveals that the Mg film with (001) preferential orientation absorbs hydrogen at certain temperature easier than that of the Mg film with (101) orientation. This phenomenon can be explained in the view point of the energy change for the nucleation and growth of hydride in different crystal plane.","Hydrogen storage; Magnetron sputtering; Mg-Ni film; Multi-layers","Hydrogenation; Magnetron sputtering; Microstructure; Multilayers; Nickel alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicon wafers; Thin films; X ray diffraction analysis; Hydrogen storage alloys; Multilayer film; Magnesium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846837627

Unlike previous urban canopy schemes, SM2-U integrates in a simple way the physical processes inside the urban canopy: the building wall influence is integrated in the pavement temperature equation, allowing the model to compute directly the energy budget of street canyons.

The energy efficiency, economic aspect, environmental and safety issues of various hydrogen storage technologies were compared. Presently, high-pressure gas compression is favorable due to its high energy efficiency as well as low capital and operation costs. Liquefaction is mainly employed in space applications because of its high volumetric and gravimetric efficiency. The disadvantages are low energy efficiency and high cost. Due to their high volumetric efficiency, metal hydride storage and carbon nanotube adsorption are promising hydrogen storage technologies and are expected to play a key role in hydrogen economy in the future.","Environment pollution; Fuel cell; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen energy; Hydrogen storage; Renewable energy","Accident prevention; Carbon nanotubes; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Energy efficiency; Hydrogen; Environment pollution; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen energy; Renewable energy; Storage (materials); Cost Effectiveness; Costs; Fuel Cells; Hydrogen; Safety; Storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846238121

In addition, we evaluate the energy-security efficiency of the proposed architecture. On a return-address store, SCache generates one or more copies of the return address value and saves them as read only in the cache area. The number of copies generated strongly affects both energy consumption and vulnerability. When the return address is loaded (or popped), the cache compares the value loaded from the memory stack with the corresponding copy existing in the cache. If they are not the same, then return-address corruption has occurred. In the present study, the proposed approach is shown to protect more than 99.5 of return-address loads from the threat of buffer overflow attacks, while increasing the total cache-energy consumption by, at worst, approximately 23, compared to a well-known low-power cache. Furthermore, we explore the tradeoff between energy consumption and security, and our experimental results show that an energy-aware SCache model provides relatively higher security with only a 10 increase in energy consumption.

The electrooptical response of an AAFLCD allows for new addressing modes, including quasi-static intermediate grayscales maintained without applying a field and passively addressed multiplexed high-frequency displays and spatial light modulators. A new kind of asymmetric cells have been obtained by using fluorinated block copolymer (FBC) alignment, which enhances surface segregation and provides a low energy surface. In this work we combine FBC alignment with antiferroelectric liquid crystal mixtures containing strongly electronegative fluorinated components.

The proposed decoder architecture is characterized as follows: (i) Partitioning a pipelined operation not to read and write intermediate messages simultaneously enables the accelerated message-passing schedule to be implemented with single-port SRAMs. (ii) FIFO-based buffering reduces the number of SRAM banks and words of the LDPC decoder based on the accelerated message-passing schedule.

The results showed that after photon excitation several ions desorbed from the CO 2 films: C+, O+, CO+ and O 2+. PSID experiments showed that ion desorption was enhanced only at the Si resonance excitations. When the thickness of the CO 2 was ∼ 500 L or higher, almost no desorption yield was observed.

Resolving its distribution and speciation in plants is essential for understanding the mechanisms involved in Cd tolerance, trafficking and accumulation. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana was exposed to cadmium under controlled conditions. Elemental distributions in the roots and in the leaves were determined using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDX), and synchrotron-based micro X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF), which offers a better sensitivity. The chemical form(s) of cadmium was investigated using Cd LIII-edge (3538 eV) micro X-ray absorption near edge structure (μ-XANES) spectroscopy. Plant μ-XANES spectra were fitted by linear combination of Cd reference spectra. Biological sample preparation and conditioning is a critical point because of possible artifacts. In this work we compared freeze-dried samples analyzed at ambient temperature and frozen hydrated samples analyzed at -170 °C. Our results suggest that in the roots Cd is localized in vascular bundles, and coordinated to S ligands. In the leaves, trichomes (epidermal hairs) represent the main compartment of Cd accumulation. In these specialized cells, μ-XANES results show that the majority of Cd is bound to O/N ligands likely provided by the cell wall, and a minor fraction could be bound to S-containing ligands. No significant difference in Cd speciation was observed between freeze-dried and frozen hydrated samples. This work illustrates the interest and the sensitivity of Cd LIII-edge XANES spectroscopy, which is applied here for the first time to plant samples. Combining μ-XRF and Cd LIII-edge μ-XANES spectroscopy offers promising tools to study Cd storage and trafficking mechanisms in plants and other biological samples. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The pathophysiological mechanisms by which these growth trajectories confer increased risks for these diseases are obscure, but there is compelling evidence that the dynamic process of catch-up growth per se, which often overlaps with adiposity rebound at a younger age, is characterized by hyperinsulinemia and by a disproportionately higher rate in the recovery of body fat than lean tissue (i.e. preferential ‘catch-up fat’). This paper first focuses upon the almost ubiquitous nature of this preferential ‘catch-up fat’ phenotype across the life cycle as a risk factor for obesity and insulin-related complications – not only in infants and children who experienced catch-up growth after earlier fetal or neonatal growth retardation, or after preterm birth, but also in adults who show weight recovery after substantial weight loss owing to famine, disease-cachexia or periodic dieting. It subsequently reviews the evidence indicating that such preferential catch-up fat is primarily driven by energy conservation (thrifty) mechanisms operating via suppressed thermogenesis, with glucose thus spared from oxidation in skeletal muscle being directed towards de novo lipogenesis and storage in white adipose tissue. A molecular–physiological framework is presented which integrates emerging insights into the mechanisms by which this thrifty ‘catch-up fat’ phenotype crosslinks with early development of insulin and leptin resistance. In the complex interactions between genetic constitution of the individual, programming earlier in life, and a subsequent lifestyle of energy dense foods and low physical activity, this thrifty ‘catch-up fat’ phenotype – which probably evolved to increase survival capacity in a hunter–gatherer lifestyle of periodic food shortages – is a central event in growth trajectories to obesity and to diseases that cluster into the insulin resistance (metabolic) syndrome. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.

The WMCD aims to manage the existing water in the storage tanks and automatically control the storage tanks filling operation with minimum energy and no water losses. The water management and control device consists of valves, sensors, and controllers; it uses a programmable logic control (PLC) to control the overall filling operation and to monitor the water level in the storage tanks. It satisfies its purpose by giving consumers the chance to manage their available water resources as they observe the level of water in their storage tanks continuously, and it controls the filling operation by means of water and pressure sensors, thus saving water and energy. © 2006 NRC Canada.","Control devices; Jordan; Storage tanks; Water control; Water losses; Water management","Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Problem solving; Programmable logic controllers; Water levels; Water supply systems; Control devices; Jordan; Storage tanks; Water control; Water losses; Water management; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751243042

Two classes of CME, namely flare-related CME events and CMEs associated with filament eruption are well reflected in the evolution of active regions. The presence of significant magnetic stresses in the source region is a necessary condition for CME. In young active regions magnetic stresses are increased mainly by twisted magnetic flux emergence and the resulting magnetic footpoint motions. In old, decayed active regions twist can be redistributed through cancellation events. All the CMEs are, nevertheless, caused by loss of equilibrium of the magnetic structure. With observational examples we show that the association of CME, flare and filament eruption depends on the characteristics of the source regions: • the strength of the magnetic field, the amount of possible free energy storage, • the small- and large-scale magnetic topology of the source region as well as its evolution (new flux emergence, photospheric motions, cancelling flux), and • the mass loading of the configuration (effect of gravity).

Samples of breast muscle (Pectoralis major) were collected at 14 weeks of age from 8 birds per group. Overfeeding induced an accumulation of lipids in breast muscle (1.5- to 1.7-fold, depending on genotype) mainly induced by triglyceride deposition. It also induced a considerable increase in the amounts (expressed as g/100 g of tissue) of saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids (SFA, MUFA), while the amounts of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) remained unchanged in hinny and Muscovy ducks or slightly increased in Pekin and mule ducks. In breast muscle, overfeeding decreased the activity of the main enzymes involved in lipogenesis from glucose (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PDH, malic enzyme, ME, acetyl CoA carboxylase, ACX). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in Pectoralis major muscle was also significantly decreased (- 21%). The ability of muscle tissues to catabolize long-chain fatty acids, as assessed by β-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HAD) activity, was increased in Pectoralis major muscle, as was cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) activity. Hybrid and Pekin ducks exhibited higher levels of ACX and LPL activity in Pectoralis major muscle than Muscovy ducks, suggesting a greater ability to synthesise lipids in situ, and to take up circulating lipids. Total lipid content in breast muscle of hybrid and Pekin ducks was higher than in that of Muscovy ducks. In hybrid and Pekin ducks, lipid composition of breast muscle was characterized by higher amounts of triglycerides, SFA and MUFA than in Muscovy ducks.

This is confirmed by TPD on the electrode material after charging, which shows a peak due to hydrogen at 200-250°C. The positive electrode is a composite made of carbon nanotubes, as minor component, and MnO2. Interesting properties are given by the presence of nanotubes, such as a developed porosity, a high electrical conductivity and a good resiliency, all being very important for enhancing the power and cycle life of supercapacitors.

The daily growth analysis of each sampled population revealed faster growth in the Ebro sardine larvae than in both of the Alboran Sea larval populations. This fact is supported by their greater content with age of DNA, RNA and protein. However, the significantly higher carbohydrate content of the Bay of Almería sardine larvae and a higher Fulton's index, indicative of energy storage of individuals, in both of the sardine populations sampled in the Bays of Almería and Málaga show evident differences in the daily growth of the Alborán Sea larvae from those originating in the Ebro region. Late larval growth in the Alborán Sea sardine tends to favour an increase in body mass rather than in body length. This study hypothesises that the productivity pulses off the Alboran Sea coasts induced by the north and northwestern wind regimes may be responsible for the growth pulses observed in the otolith microstructure.","Carbohydrates; DNA; Growth; Mediterranean; Proteins; RNA; Sardine larvae","biochemical composition; carbohydrate; DNA; growth; larval development; otolith; protein; RNA; spawning; Alboran Sea; Andalucia; Bahia de Malaga; Ebro River; Eurasia; Europe; Gulf of Almeria; Malaga [Andalucia]; Mediterranean Sea; Southern Europe; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750452678

Furthermore, an isolated system operation which uses Distributed Generators (DGs) and Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) which are installed in QCC as the main power supply will be performed.

The tissue is no longer viewed simply as a vehicle for lipid storage; instead, it is recognized as a major endocrine and secretory organ. White adipocytes release a multiplicity of protein hormones, signals and factors, termed adipokines, with an extensive range of physiological actions. Foremost among these various adipokines is the cytokine-like hormone, leptin, which is synthesized predominantly in white fat. Leptin plays a critical role in the control of appetite and energy balance, with mutations in the genes encoding the hormone or its receptor leading to profound obesity in both rodents and man. Leptin regulates appetite primarily through an interaction with hypothalamic neuroendocrine pathways, inhibiting orexigenic peptides such as neuropeptide Y and orexin A, and stimulating anorexigenic peptides such as proopiomelanocortin. White fat also secretes several putative appetite-related adipokines, which include interleukin-6 and adiponectin, but whether these are indeed significant signals in the regulation of food intake has not been established. Through leptin and the other adipokines it is evident that adipose tissue communicates extensively with other organs and plays a pervasive role in metabolic homeostasis. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Adipocytes; Adipokines; Appetite; Energy balance; Leptin; Obesity","Rodentia; adipocyte; adipose tissue; appetite; energy metabolism; human; physiology; review; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Appetite; Energy Metabolism; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750215437

The four-order implicit Runge-Kutta formula to the equations was derived, and the nonlinear algebraic equations were solved by using the Gauss-Newton method. The analytical solution of an example shows that the upper damping coefficient, the lower damping coefficient and the residual magnetic induction of the rare earth permanent magnet play an important role in electromechanical resonance of the flywheel rotor system. There is a small change for the electromechanical coupling resonance frequency with the upper damping coefficient increasing, but the resonance amplitude decreases with the upper damping coefficient increasing. With the lower damping coefficient increasing, the resonance frequency increases, and the resonance amplitude decreases.

To asses the effect, if any, of such diet on product quality, meat balls were prepared and evaluated for quality changes when fresh as well as during storage (-20±1°C). Feeding a ration with CP12 and TDN 60% (LH) to kids produced animals with highest slaughter weight (20.3 kg) yielding higher carcass weight and dressing percentage, lean (65.6%) and fat (6.6%) contents with low bone and trim losses. Although total variety meat yield was markedly higher in HL, the non-carcass fat deposition was relatively higher in LH carcasses. The water activity (aW) of fresh goat meat ranged from 0.994-0.995 and total cholesterol 72.8-90.5 mg/100 g meat. The pH was high in HL and HH meat resulting in decreased (p≤0.05) extract release volume (ERV).

In many regions agricultural fields are just one component of a complex landscape matrix and understanding the interactions between agricultural fields and other landscape components such as wetlands is crucial for comprehensive, whole-landscape accounting of soil organic carbon (SOC) change. Our objective was to assess the effects of management and erosional history on SOC storage in wetlands of a typical hummocky agricultural landscape in southern Saskatchewan. Wetlands were classed into three land management groups: native wetlands (i.e., within a native landscape), and uncultivated and cultivated wetlands within an agricultural landscape. Detailed topographic surveys were used to develop a digital elevation model of the sites and landform segmentation algorithms were used to delineate the topographic data into landform elements. SOC density to 45 cm was assessed at seven uncultivated wetlands, seven cultivated wetlands, and twelve native wetlands. Mean SOC density decreased from 175.1 mg ha- 1 to 30 cm (equivalent mass depth) for the native wetlands to 168.6 mg ha- 1 for the uncultivated wetlands and 87.2 mg ha- 1 for the cultivated wetlands in the agricultural field. The SOC density of sediment depositional fans in the uncultivated wetlands is high but the total SOC stored in the fans is low due to their small area. The uncultivated wetlands occupy only 11% of the site but account for approximately 23% of SOC stores. Re-establishing permanent vegetation in the cultivated wetlands could provide maximum C sequestration with minimum energy inputs and a minimum loss of productive acreage but the overall consequences for the gas emissions would have to be carefully assessed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A background section of the review explores reasons why high-producing dairy cows are prone to develop fatty liver post partum. Hepatic lipidosis and coinciding health and fertility problems seriously endanger profitability and longevity of the dairy cow. Results from a great number of earlier epidemi-ological and clinical studies made it clear that a different approach was needed for elucidation of pathogenesis and etiology of this complex of health problems. There was a need for an adequate animal model in which hepatic lipidosis and production, health and fertility problems could be provoked under controlled conditions. It was hypothesized that overconditioning ante partum and feed restriction post partum might induce lipolysis in adipose tissue and triacylglycerol accumulation in the liver following calving. This consideration formed the basis for the experiments, which resulted in the “Utrecht fatty liver model of dairy cows”. In this model, post partum triacylglycerol-lipidosis as well as the whole complex of health and fertility problems are induced under well-controlled conditions.

In this work, an efficient pre-traceback architecture for the survivor-path memory unit (SMU) of high constraint length VD targeting wireless communication applications is proposed. Compared to the conventional traceback approach which is based on three kinds of memory access operations: decision bits write, traceback read, and decode read, the proposed architecture exploits the inherent parallelism between the decision bit write and decode traceback operation by introducing pre-traceback operation. Consequently, the proposed pre-traceback approach reduces the survivor memory read operations by 50%. As a result of the reduction of the memory access operations, compared to the conventional 2-pointer traceback algorithm, the size of the survivor memory as well as the decoding latency is reduced by as much as 25%.

In this context, the chemical storage and transport of this energy appears to be an attractive option for the supply of fuels. On the other hand, it is not unlikely that CO2 will be recovered on a large scale in the next 10-20 years, thus making it available as a carbon source for liquid fuels. A preliminary analysis indicated that the liquid fuels that could be most readily manufactured from hydrogen (from electrolysis) and recycled CO2 were: methanol, mixed alcohols and gasoline (via methanol). In the light of developmental work at NEDO, Japan, methanol appears to be simplest to manufacture. The Mobil Methanol-to-Gasoline process also facilitates the manufacture of a very convenient automotive fuel. Mixed alcohols have the advantages both of low toxicity, and efficient Fischer-Tropsch catalysts for their synthesis (the Pearson process and the Ecalene process).

Due to the scattered CO2 sources and the uncertainty in the growth of the CO2 market, a cost effective and flexible transport system is required. In this work a ship transport concept is developed as an alternative to pipeline transport. New technical solutions, cost-, energy-, exergy- and CO2 emission analysis for ship-based transport of CO2 are presented. The concept includes all the elements in the transport chain, namely liquefaction, intermediate storage, loading system, semi-pressurized ship and offshore unloading system. Economical large-scale transport Of CO2 by ship could be done in semi-pressurized vessels of around 20 000 m3 at pressures near triple point (6.5 bara and -52°C) in order to use well established design for commercial construction of LPG carriers and intermediate storage. This condition also gives the highest density in the liquid state, which reduces the transport unit cost. Liquefaction Of CO2 is best achieved in an open cycle, where the refrigeration is partly or fully provided by the feed gas itself. The offshore unloading system will transport the liquid CO2 from the dedicated CO2 ship to the wellhead on the platform at the required temperature and pressure. During the unloading phase the ship is connected to a submerged turret loading (STL) system. The CO2 is pumped to a pressure high enough to avoid phase transition in the transfer lines. A flexible riser, a subsea pipeline and an insulated pipeline in the platform shaft bring the CO2 from the unloading location to the topside of the platform. The CO2 is pumped to injection pressure and heated to avoid operational problems before it is injected into the reservoir for EOR using conventional water injection wells. The total specific energy requirement for the selected transport chain is 142 kWh tonne-1 C02, where the liquefaction process accounts for 77%. An exergy analysis of the chain is performed showing that the minimum work required in the chain is 60 kWh tonne-1 CO2, giving a chain rational efficiency of 42%. The total CO2 emissions are estimated to be approximately 1.4% of the inlet CO2. The total costs of ship-based transport are calculated to be 20-30 USD tonne-1 for volumes larger than 2 Mt y-1 and distances limited to the North Sea. Ship transport offers a flexible alternative for bringing CO2 to offshore installations. Dedicated CO2 carriers for transport of CO2 directly from the source to the oil fields might be a key element in future CO2 infrastructures. © 2006 Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Carbon dioxide; CO2; Costs; Energy; Exergy; Ship; Transport","Energy utilization; Enhanced recovery; Gas emissions; Liquefied petroleum gas; Petroleum pipelines; Petroleum reservoirs; Service vessels; Ships; Enhanced oil recovery; Offshore unloading system; Ship transport; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Enhanced recovery; Gas emissions; Liquefied petroleum gas; Petroleum pipelines; Petroleum reservoirs; Service vessels; Ships",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749007664

The site-specific differences in adipose tissue functions - e.g. energy storage versus insulation - should also affect the use of different FAs. To study this, 16 female minks were randomly assigned into the control group or fasted for 5 days. Preferential mobilization of n-3 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) during fasting caused a decrease in the n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio in fat and liver. In addition, the minks utilized short-chain FAs efficiently in all fat depots, but long-chain FAs - 20:0, 20:1n-11, 20:1n-9, 22:1n-11 and 24:1n-9 - were preserved. The number of double bonds in the FA chain correlated positively with mobilization rate in the retroperitoneal fat. The observed negative correlation between mobilization rate and the location of the first double bond from the methyl end may be due to peroxisomal chain-shortening of long-chain FAs and not the double bond position per se. As a result, minks are able to preserve a low melting point and fluidity of the subcutaneous fat depots, which would be essential to a Northern semi-aquatic mammal. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However it is difficult to evaluate the effect of cross ventilation quantitatively and to undertake design based on a quantitative evaluation. This is because the indoor environment is uneven and changes according to the outside conditions. It is difficult to predict the ventilation rate under cross ventilation due to the variation in wind. Hence it is still difficult to estimate indoor comfort conditions given by cross ventilation. In this paper full-scale model cross ventilation experiments are described and the properties of airflow in and around the full-scale model (velocity field, pressure distribution on surface, visualized flow pattern, heat transfer coefficient distribution, discharge coefficient of openings and so on) have been examined. The mixing property and heat exhaust effect of cross ventilation are discussed. Tracer gas concentration decay measurements were made in the model to determine the spatial unevenness of mixing property, the air change index and the velocity distribution. It is shown that the different mixing properties are formed according to the airflow pattern. The heat exhaust effect, was determined by using plasterboard that was set on the floor for heat storage. The temperature of the air and surface was measured, and exhaust heat by cross ventilation was calculated. The relation between temperature reduction and the flow path was examined, and the total exhaust heat by cross ventilation was compared to the total convective heat transfer from the plasterboard. These experiments showed that ventilation rate is the most important factor in determining the amount of exhaust heat and the room mean age of air. However the airflow path has an influence in the exhaust heat and mixing property in the cross ventilated space.","Cross ventilation; Full-scale model experiment; Heat exhaust effect; Mixing property; Room mean age; Tracer gas; Ventilation index","Air; Flow patterns; Heat transfer; Mixing; Pressure distribution; Temperature; Cross ventilation; Full-scale model experiment; Heat exhaust effect; Mixing property; Tracer gas; Ventilation index; Ventilation exhausts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748787115

For storing heat in buildings, there are two important thermal properties of the materials that need to be considered, i.e. the heat capacity by volume and the heat-absorption rate. The first property determines the ability of the element to store thermal energy, and the second property determines the ability of the element to conduct the thermal energy. The combined convective and radiative heat transfer coefficient and the surface area of the thermal mass determine the rate of heat transfer between the thermal mass element and the air. One of the good examples in using thermal mass is night cooling, which can avoid or minimize the need for mechanical cooling in buildings. We present a simple design formula for use by architects and engineers which involves only three design related parameters, i.e. the time constant of the system, the dimensionless convective heat transfer number and the Fourier time constant. The present method allows the fast determination of the amount of thermal mass as well as key design parameters when the phase shift of indoor air temperature and the attenuation of the indoor air temperature fluctuation are specified.","Design method; Heat storage; Natural ventilation; Night ventilation; Passive cooling; Thermal mass; Thermal time constant","Absorption; Cooling; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Interiors (building); Partitions (building); Thermodynamic properties; Thermodynamics; Design method; Natural ventilation; Passive cooling; Thermal mass; Thermal time constant; Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748785964

The two SBRs were operated in parallel under the same conditions of organic load (0.85 gCOD l-1 d-1) and sludge age (about 10 d), the only difference being the length of the feed: less than 1 min vs. 5 h. In this way the conditions of a plug flow reactor and of a completely mixed reactor were simulated. The two systems were compared on sludge settleability (related to filaments abundance and floc morphology), substrate uptake rates and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) storage rates. The main difference between the two systems was in the settling properties of the sludge: both SVI and effluent solids were higher in the system with slow feed. With regard to filamentous microorganisms, even though both reactors were inoculated with the same sludge with high concentration of filaments, they were rapidly washed out from both systems. Microscopic observations showed that the reason for the different settling properties of the two sludges was in the floc structure, which was more compact in the system operated with fast feed. These data support the theory of the role of diffusion inside the flocs in determining the settling properties of the sludge. The maximum substrate uptake rates and PHA storage rates were similar in the two systems, showing that also the microorganisms grown at a constant and low substrate concentration were able to quickly increase their activity and to store PHAs when in the presence of a sudden change in substrate concentration. © Selper Ltd., 2006.","Diffusion limitation; Feed length; SBR; Settling properties; Storage; Substrate uptake","Activated sludge process; Batch reactors; Digital storage; Effluents; Energy storage; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Microorganisms; Morphology; Wastewater treatment; Diffusion limitations; Feed lengths; Filamentous microorganisms; Microscopic observations; Sequencing batch reactors; Settling properties; Substrate concentrations; Substrate uptake; Substrates; ethylene glycol; formic acid; methanol; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; Chemical reactors; Diffusion; Microorganisms; Sludge digestion; Substrates; Wastewater treatment; effluent; industrial waste; sludge; waste treatment; wastewater; article; chemical oxygen demand; comparative study; concentration (parameters); controlled study; diffusion; flocculation; industrial waste; inoculation; microbial growth; microbial identification; microbial metabolism; microorganism; microscopy; nonhuman; plug flow reactor; process model; process monitoring; reactor operation; sequencing batch reactor; sewage effluent; sludge settling; storage; waste component removal; waste water management; water analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748604577

Due to the piezoelectric effect, part of the vibration energy is transformed into electrical energy that can be conveniently dissipated. Therefore, by using appropriate electrical circuits, it is possible to dissipate strain energy and, as a consequence, vibration is suppressed through the added passive damping. From the electrical, point of view, the piezoelectric element behaves like a capacitor in series with a controlled voltage source and the shunt circuit, commonly formed by an RL network, is tuned, to dissipate, the electrical energy, more efficiently in a given frequency band. It is important to know that large inductances are frequently required, leading to the necessity of using synthetic inductors (obtained from operational amplifiers). From the mechanical point of view, the vibration energy can be attenuated in a single mode, or in multiple modes, according to the design of the damping device and the frequency band of interest. This work is devoted to the study of passive damping systems for single modes or multiple modes, based on piezoelectric patches and resonant shunt circuits. The present contribution discusses the modeling of piezoelectric patches coupled to shunt circuits, where the basics of resonant shunt circuits (series and parallel topologies) are presented. Following, the devices used in passive control, (piezoelectric patch and synthetic inductors) are analyzed from the electrical, and experimental viewpoints. The modeling of multi-degree-of-freedom mechanical systems, including the effects of the passive damping devices is revisited, and, then a design methodology for the multi-modal case is defined. Also, it is briefly reviewed the optimization method used for design purposes, namely the LifeCycle Model. Finally, experimental results are reported, illustrating the success of using the methodology presented in passive damping applications applied to mechanical and mechatronic systems.

One-day-old mummies of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius colemani Viereck (Hymenoptera: Aphidiinae) were exposed to cold (2 and 4°C) for various periods (1-3 wk) under a high relative humidity (75 ± 5% RH) and darkness. High mortality and shortened adult longevity occurred with increasing duration of exposure at low temperatures. Individual parasitoid mass loss increased with cold storage duration and was associated to a marked decrease in dry mass caused by lipid reserve depletion. Water content (water mass/dry mass) slightly increased with cold exposure duration because of starvation. Similar patterns were observed for both temperatures tested. This study emphasizes (1) how energetic reserves may be critical to survive at low temperatures and (2) that the survival and longevity are related, at least in part, to the depletion of energy reserves during starvation. © 2006 Entomological Society of America.","Cold hardiness; Fat reserves; Low temperature; Survival; Water relations","cold region; fat reserve; insect; longevity; low temperature; parasitoid; physiological response; survival; temperature effect; water content; water relations; Aphididae; Aphidiinae; Aphidius colemani; Hymenoptera; Vespoidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748349951

These problems are related to laterally inhomogeneous energy fluence distributions and spectral variations causing a lateral shift in the beam quality, commonly referred to as off-axis softening (OAS). We have examined how the dose calculation accuracy is affected when enabling and disabling explicit modeling of these two effects. The calculations were performed using a pencil kernel dose calculation algorithm that facilitates modeling of OAS through laterally varying kernel properties. Together with a multi-source model that provides the lateral energy fluence distribution this generates the total dose output, i.e., the dose per monitor unit, at an arbitrary point of interest. The dose calculation accuracy was evaluated through comparisons with 264 measured output factors acquired at 5, 10, and 20 cm depth in four different megavoltage photon beams. The measurements were performed up to 18 cm from the central beam axis, inside square fields of varying size and position. The results show that calculations including explicit modeling of OAS were considerably more accurate, up to 4%, than those ignoring the lateral beam quality shift. The deviations caused by simplified head scatter modeling were smaller, but near the field edges additional errors close to 1% occurred. When enabling full physics modeling in the dose calculations the deviations display a mean value of -0.1%, a standard deviation of 0.7%, and a maximum deviation of -2.2%. Finally, the results were analyzed in order to quantify and model the inherent uncertainties that are present when leaving the central beam axis. The off-axis uncertainty component showed to increase with both off-axis distance and depth, reaching 1% (1 standard deviation) at 20 cm depth. © 2006 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","Dose calculation; Head scatter; Off-axis; Pencil kernel; Uncertainties","Data storage equipment; Photons; Statistics; Dose calculation; Dose uncertainties; Megavoltage photons; Off-axis; Pencil kernel; Spectral variation; Standard deviation; Uncertainties; Uncertainty analysis; accuracy; algorithm; article; beam therapy; dose calculation; dosimetry; image quality; photon therapy; priority journal; radiation dose",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748295832

Comparing the trends in polarity-dependent electrical characteristics between two different gate dielectric structures of stacked oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) and oxide alone (SiO2), it was demonstrated that the bimodal behavior observed in SONOS transistors is due to the stacked gate dielectric structure and that the device degradation is caused not by electrons but by holes. The proposed model is based on two models of the anode hole injection with maximum available hole energy Emax and the hydrogen-released interface trap generation. It is shown that the device degradation Δ* in the stacked-ONO gate structure can be expressed by the total fluence of the hole QAh injected from the anode side as Δ* ≈ QAh0.25. Utilizing a threshold voltage shift ΔVth method, it was found that the gate conduction in SONOS transistors is governed by a specific tunneling process, which depends on the voltage drop Vox across the tunnel oxide. It is also shown that the gate conduction mechanism through the ONO stacks makes a smooth transition from one tunneling process to another depending on the relationship between the Vox and the tunneling barrier height of ΦB. © 2006 IEEE.","Degradation; Gate conduction; Hole fluence; Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI); Nonvolatile memory (NVM); Polarity dependence; Polysilicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS)","Degradation; Dielectric amplifiers; Electric conductivity; Electron tunneling; Nonvolatile storage; Polysilicon; Gate conduction; Hole fluence; Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI); Polarity dependence; Polysilicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS); Transistors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748105075

Current nutritional recommendations are based on healthy premature infants and are designed to provide postnatal nutrient retention during the ""stable-growing"" period equivalent to the intrauterine gain of a normal fetus. However, this reference is still a matter of debate, especially in the field of protein and mineral requirements. Protein requirements recently have been reevaluated, taking into consideration that (1) fetal lean body mass gain and the contribution of protein gain to lean body mass gain appear as more suitable references than does weight gain; (2) an additional protein supply needs to be provided for early catch-up growth, compensating for the cumulative protein deficit developed during the first weeks of life; (3) an increase in the protein-energy ratio is mandatory to improve the lean body mass accretion and to limit fat mass deposition; (4) the fractional nitrogen absorption rate and protein efficiency vary according to the feeding regimens; and (5) recommended dietary protein allowance needs to be adapted for postconceptional age instead of gestational age or birth weight to integrate the dynamic aspect of growth and protein metabolism. Thus recommended intakes for premature infants 26 to 30 weeks postconceptional age are 3.8 to 4.4 g of protein/kg/d with a protein/energy ratio between 3.0 to 3.3 g/100 kcal, according to their relative postnatal growth restrictions and should decrease progressively up to the time of discharge. After birth, there is a dramatic physiological change in bone metabolism resulting from various factors; abrupt reduction in mineral supply, stimulation of parathyroid hormone secretion, change in hormonal environment, and relative reduction in mechanical stimulation. There is a stimulation of the remodeling process, inducing an increase in endosteal bone resorption and a decrease in physical density. In preterm infants, this process of postnatal bone metabolism adaptation modifies the mineral requirements, with the remodeling stimulation itself providing a part of the mineral requirement necessary for postnatal bone turnover. In extrauterine conditions, the care of premature infants should not necessarily aim to achieve intrauterine calcium accretion rates. Considering long-term appropriate mineralization and the fact that calcium retention between 60 to 90 mg/kg/d suppresses the risk of fracture and clinical symptoms of osteopenia, a mineral intake between 100 to 160 mg/kg/d of highly-absorbed calcium and 60 to 75 mg/kg/d of phosphorus could be recommended. © 2006 Mosby, Inc.

TAG biosynthetic activity was identified in the cytosolic fraction of developing peanut (Arachis hypogaea) cotyledons. This activity was NaF insensitive and acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dependent. Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the final step in TAG biosynthesis that acylates diacylglycerol to TAG. Soluble DGAT was identified from immature peanuts and purified by conventional column chromatographic procedures. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 41 ± 1.0 kD. Based on the partial peptide sequence, a degenerate probe was used to obtain the full-length cDNA. The isolated gene shared less than 10% identity with the previously identified DGAT1 and 2 families, but has 13% identity with the bacterial bifunctional wax ester/DGAT. To differentiate the unrelated families, we designate the peanut gene as AhDGAT. Expression of peanut cDNA in Escherichia coli resulted in the formation of labeled TAG and wax ester from [14C]acetate. The recombinant E. coli showed high levels of DGAT activity but no wax ester synthase activity. TAGs were localized in transformed cells with Nile blue A and oil red O staining. The recombinant and native DGAT was specific for 1,2-diacylglycerol and did not utilize hexadecanol, glycerol-3-phosphate, monoacylglycerol, lysophosphatidic acid, and lysophosphatidylcholine. Oleoyl-CoA was the preferred acyl donor as compared to palmitoyl- and stearoyl-CoAs. These data suggest that the cytosol is one of the sites for TAG biosynthesis in oilseeds. The identified pathway may present opportunities of bioengineering oil-yielding plants for increased oil production. © 2006 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Biosynthesis; Column chromatography; DNA; Glycerol; Plant cell culture; Cytosolic fraction; Eukaryotic cells; Oilseeds; Triacylglycerols (TAGs); Agricultural products; Biosynthesis; Column Chromatography; Glycerol; Nucleic Acids; Plants; Arachis hypogaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Eukaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747123328

In a burning plasma simulation scheme, two neutral beam (NB) groups were used: one that simulates alpha-particle heating and another that simulates external heating. For the alpha-particle heating simulation, the heating power proportional to the deuterium-deuterium (D-D) neutron yield rate was injected. The behavior of the part of the NB heating simulating alpha-particle heating was varied by increasing the proportional gain relating the applied power to the measured neutron yield rate in both ELMy H-mode and RS plasmas, while the part of the NB power in the role of external heating was held constant i.e., no-burn-control case. Above a certain value of the proportional gain, a runaway effect was triggered where excursive increases in the neutron yield rate and stored energy were observed. With burn control, where the stored energy was controlled at a constant value by a feedback control system using the external heating, the runaway was not triggered, and the neutron yield rate was kept at a constant value in the L-mode plasmas. Zero-dimensional calculation indicated that the runaway triggered by increasing the proportional gain well simulates the runaway triggered by improved confinement. The limitations came from differences between deuterium-tritium and D-D plasmas, such as the dominant reaction for the neutron yield and the temperature dependence of the fusion reaction rate, which were discussed together with improvement on the burning plasma simulation scheme.","Burn control; Burning plasma simulation experiment; JT-60U","Computer simulation; Deuterium; Energy storage; Feedback control; Plasmas; Thermal effects; Burn control; Burning plasma simulation experiment; JT-60U; Control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746960745

The proposed algorithm is voxel-based and takes into account the conical projection geometry associated with the biplane image acquisition equipment. The reconstruction process starts with an initial ellipsoidal approximation derived from the input ventriculograms. This model is subsequently deformed in such a way as to match the input projections. To this end, the object is modeled as a 3-D Markov-Gibbs random field, and an energy function is defined so that it includes one term that models the projections compatibility and another one that includes the space-time regularity constraints. The performance of this reconstruction method is evaluated by considering the reconstruction of mathematically synthesized phantoms and two 3-D binary databases from two orthogonal synthesized projections. The method is also tested using real biplane ventriculograms. In this case, the performance of the reconstruction is expressed in terms of the projection error, which attains values between 9.50% and 11.78% for two biplane sequences including a total of 55 images. © 2006 IEEE.","Markov random fields; Reconstruction from projections; Simulated annealing; Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction; Ventriculographic images","Algorithms; Approximation theory; Image reconstruction; Markov processes; Medical imaging; Simulated annealing; Cardiac angiography; Markov random fields; Reconstruction from projections; Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction; Ventriculograms; Ventriculographic images; Angiography; algorithm; angiography; article; biological model; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation; heart ventricle; human; image enhancement; image quality; information retrieval; methodology; probability; radiography; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Angiography; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Markov Chains; Models, Cardiovascular; Models, Statistical; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746883567

Thirty-six preruminant calves (148 ± 1.6 kg body weight) were assigned to 1 of 6 degrees of nutrient synchrony (SYN, 1-6) and to 1 of 2 meal sequences (i.e., the high-protein meal in the morning or in the evening). Calves at SYN 1 received 2 balanced meals: one at 0600 and one at 1800. Nutrient synchrony decreased stepwise from SYN 1 to SYN 6 in which calves received 85% of the daily protein supply in 1 meal. The digestible energy intakes at 0600 and 1800 were equal between treatments. Daily intakes of all nutrients and dietary ingredients were identical for all treatments. Calves were housed individually in respiration chambers. Apparent fecal nutrient digestibility and nitrogen and energy balances were measured. Apparent nutrient digestibility decreased when &gt;71% of the dietary protein was fed in one meal. Nutrient synchrony did not affect the efficiency of digestible protein utilization in calves at a identical digestible nutrient intake.

The work is based on a prototype building that includes a ventilated photovoltaic array, solar air and water heating, a biomass-fired boiler, and a stratified thermal store. The supervisory control problem is, for each source, whether to deploy the received energy directly into the building, store it for later use, or reject it to the environment. These decisions are currently made by a building management system programmed with a complex, arbitrary set of rules and setpoints. The considerable number of operational states means that such a control system is very difficult to commission. Analysis of the data for the early stages of building operation indicate strongly that it is unlikely optimal use is being made of the renewable energy sources with this approach. The objective of this research is to investigate the potential effectiveness of replacing the rule-based control scheme with one based on a combination of a building/system model with an optimization algorithm. The existing building, plant, and control systems were modeled using a commercial simulation environment and calibrated against measured data from the building. A period of swing-season operation was used to compare the existing control with that based on an optimal approach. Results indicate that significant improvements in system operation are possible but also that significant improvement in execution time will be needed for any future online deployment.",,"Buildings; Computer simulation; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimal control systems; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Building management system; Heat sources; Renewable energy systems; Supervisory control; Thermal storage; Control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746449324

Latent heat storage is one of the most efficient ways of storing thermal energy. Solar energy is a renewable energy source that can generate electricity, provide hot water, heat and cool a house, and provide lighting for buildings. Paraffin waxes are cheap and have moderate thermal energy storage density but low thermal conductivity and, hence, require a large surface area. Hydrated salts have a larger energy storage density and a higher thermal conductivity. In response to increasing electrical energy costs and the desire for better lad management, thermal storage technology has recently been developed.

Here we propose to study and create nanostructures by implantation of focussed high energy heavy ions. For this purpose we are developing and building at the new 5 MV tandem accelerator of the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, a facility capable of delivering beams focussed to a diameter below 10 nm that can be scanned over the sample. This contrasts with previous methods which use keV ions. As a consequence, structures with small lateral size and a much larger perpendicular size like patterns of columns, can be created. These are expected to allow a high packing density of functional units, and other specific advantages. The nanobeam will be used mainly to create nanostructures by irradiation with heavy ions with an energy of 20-50 MeV in a precise pattern (ion beam lithography), since it takes only one or few ions per spot to create structural, electronic, magnetic or chemical changes in certain materials along the ions tracks and therefore, very low ion beam intensities can be applied. Structures like ordered conducting wires in insulating media or three-dimensional magnetic column structures in a diamagnetic medium can be created. The latter will be the first application of the facility, and could be developed to provide a data storage medium with Terabits/in.2 capability, drastically increasing the present storage density. The facility will also generate nanobeams of 2-10 MeV protons. They will be used to develop a scanning transmission proton microscope for research of the mentioned nanostructures and the detection of defects, voids, precipitates, etc. in other thinned samples. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The storage lake covers an area of 1 to 2 km in width and about 7 km in length. Model simulations were performed for a summer and a winter day. Due to a change in the surface properties, the installati on of the storage lake resulted in a modification of the energy balance. Above the lake area, a stably stratified atmosphere establishes during the day and unstable stratification during the night. During the day, the latent heat flux is similar to that of the replaced cultivated ground, but is higher at the night. The influence of the storage lake on temperature and humidity can be seen to a height of about 300 m above ground level. During the night, water vapour accumulation results in relative humidity values of 100%, as a result a greater number of days with fog above the storage lake is likely when compared to the surrounding area. The storage lake does not produce its own lake breeze during the day, because the larger-scale up-valley wind is too dominant. However, a significant modification of the nocturnal down-valley wind above the lake area can be observed, especially in summer. As a consequence of the larger-scale valley wind system, the influence of the storage lake on the temperature, humidity, and wind field can be identified up to about 4 km on the downwind side. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"air temperature; climate effect; climate modeling; lake; relative humidity; stratification; wind field; Chile; Coquimbo; Elqui River; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745830433

The working principles and the basic features of the ACDHWS are introduced in this paper. This is followed by an experimental study on dynamic operation characteristics, hot water supply performance, energy efficiency and the temperature distribution of hot water in the storage tank of the unit. The results show that the ACDHWS can reliably be used to heat domestic hot water without losing its cooling capacity when it is controlled well in different operation conditions. Comparatively, the coefficient of comprehensive energy performance (COP2) of the ACDHWS is about 38.6% higher than that of the original unit. Furthermore, it is proved that the ACDHWS can continuously supply hot water for householders if a suitable hot water storage tank is installed.

Even though many fatty acids are thought to be synthesized in the body, it appears as nearly all circulating fatty acids are, in fact, derived from the diet. In view of the wide dietary availability of such nutrients, the need to conserve energy likely minimizes endogenous synthesis. Consequently, the possibility exists to alter circulating the profile of fatty acids, including the ""non essential"" ones by dietary manipulations. In turn, a theory on the dietary vs endogenous contribution to circulating fatty acids, including those known as non-essential, is discussed based on critical interpretation of original data. © 2006 A B Academic Publishers.","Essential fatty acids; Fatty acids; Omega 3; Polyunsaturated fatty acids",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745795954

The PCMs have a melting temperature range of 50.0°C to 61.20°C and a latent heat range of 162.0 J/g to 204.5 J/g. The inlet temperature and the mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid (HTF) were selected as experimental parameters to test the thermal energy storage performance of the PCMs. The transition times, temperature range, propagation of the solid-liquid interface, as well as heat flow rate characteristics of the employed cylindrical tube storage system were studied at varied experimental parameters. The experimental results show that the melting front moves to inward in the radial directions as well as in the axial directions from the top toward to the bottom of the PCM tube. It was observed that the convection heat transfer in the liquid phase plays an important role in the melting process. The changes in the studied HTF parameters have more effect on the melting processes than the solidification processes of the PCMs. The average heat storage efficiency calculated from data for all the PCMs is 51.5%, meaning that 48.5% of the heat actually was lost somewhere.","Eutectic mixture; Fatty acids; Phase change material; Thermal analysis","Eutectics; Heat convection; Melting; Phase transitions; Temperature distribution; Thermoanalysis; Eutectic mixtures; Experimental parameters; Phase change materials; Temperature range; Fatty acids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745699996

Kurz. Most of Thai herbs are widely used as traditional medicine and drying is an initial step in the production process. Solar dryer with a biomass backup heating system is the most feasible solution to drying in Thailand. In this work, a 4 m × 5 m solar collector was used to absorb solar radiation for heating the incoming air during the daytime, while a biomass burner was used to supply heat when solar energy was not possible. Heat from fuelwood combustion was accumulated in the thermal storage system made of bricks, and was used to heat up the incoming air. Results showed that the herb was dried uniformly and the temperature inside the drying cabinet could be maintained above 50°C for more than 10 hours. Thermal efficiency when using solar energy was 10.5%, but the value was less than 1% when using the heat from biomass burning. This resulted from the low moisture content of the products after being dried by the solar energy. The dryer is beneficial to the operators, particularly in southern Thailand, where continuous drying is required. This dryer is by no means limited to drying of the herb. Currently, four dryers of the same model have been used by farmer groups in southern Thailand for drying bananas, several types of herbs, fish, and other products. In economic consideration, its payback period is 5.5 years when compared with the LPG-equipped dryer. When the total cost and production capacity are considered, its payback period is about 6 years.","Herb drying; Solar dryer; Thermal storage; Wood combustion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745697630

Rats had free access to normal (NP; 14%) or high (HP; 53%) total milk protein isoenergetic diets, or were fed the NP diet but restricted to the energy intake of HP rats (NPr), which was 89.1 ± 9.3% that of NP rats.

However, their melting temperatures can be adjusted to a suitable value by preparing a eutectic mixture of the myristic acid (MA) and the stearic acid (SA). In the present study, the thermal analysis based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique shows that the mixture of myristic acid (MA) and stearic acid (SA) in the respective composition (by mass) of 64% and 36% forms a eutectic mixture having melting temperature of 44.13°C and the latent heat of fusion of 182.4 J·g-1. The thermal energy storage characteristics of the MA-SA eutectic mixture filled in the annulus of two concentric pipes were also experimentally established. The heat recovery rate and heat charging/discharging fractions were determined with respect to the change in the mass flow rate and the inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid. Based on the results obtained by DSC analysis and by the heat charging/discharging processes of the PCM, it can be concluded that the MA-SA eutectic mixture is a potential material for low temperature thermal energy storage applications in terms of its thermo-physical and thermal characteristics.","Differential scanning calorimetry; Eutectic mixture; Myristic and stearic acids; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage","Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy utilization; Heat transfer; Solar heating; Stearic acid; Thermoanalysis; Eutectic mixture; Myristic acids; Phase change material; Thermal energy; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745642721

Sixteen farm-bred male sables were divided into a fed control group and an experimental group fasted for 4 days. The rate of weight loss in the sable was similar to other medium-sized mustelids. Fasting led to hypoglycaemia and to a decreased lymphocyte percentage. The sable derived metabolic energy from both subcutaneous and intraabdominal white adipose tissues and the relative decrease in fat mass was the largest for the retroperitoneal and subcutaneous depots. Metabolic energy derived partly from body proteins indicated by the increased plasma levels of urea, uric acid and total essential amino acids. Triacylglycerols accumulated in the livers of the fasted sables and the increased plasma aminotransferase activities suggested hepatic dysfunction. The decreased plasma insulin concentrations and the elevated cortisol levels probably contributed to stimulated lipolysis and protein catabolism. Moreover, fasting increased the plasma ghrelin concentrations of the sables and down-regulated the thyroid activity. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Early recognition and treatment of these conditions is important in preventing morbidity and mortality. Our knowledge of metabolic myopathies has expanded rapidly in recent years with major advancements in the detection of the specific genetic and biochemical defects of these disorders. This improved genetic and molecular delineation of metabolic myopathies led to new diagnostic tests and the design of more rational treatments such as enzyme replacement therapy.

A recent evaluation of the global potential of primary renewable energy carried out by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sets a value of at least 2800EJ/yr, which is more than the most energy-intensive SRES scenario forecast for the world energy requirement up to the year 2100. Nevertheless, what is really important to quantify is the amount of final energy since the use of renewable sources may involve conversion efficiencies, from primary to final energy, different from the ones of conventional energy sources. In reality, IPCC does not provide a complete account of the final energy from renewables, but the text claims that using several available options to mitigate climate change, and renewables is only one of them, it is possible to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration at a low level. In this paper, we evaluate in detail biomass primary and final energy using sugarcane crop as a proxy, since it is one of the highest energy density forms of biomass, and through afforestation/reforestation using a model presented in IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). The conclusion is that the primary-energy potential for biomass has been under-evaluated by many authors and by IPCC, and this under-evaluation is even larger for final energy since sugarcane allows co-production of electricity and liquid fuel. Regarding forests we reproduce IPCC results for primary energy and calculate final energy. Sugarcane is a tropical crop and cannot be grown in all the land area forecasted for biomass energy plantation in the IPCC/TAR evaluation (i.e. 1280Mha). Nevertheless, there are large expanses of unexploited land, mainly in Latin America and Africa that are subject to warm weather and convenient rainfall. With the use of 143Mha of these lands it is possible to produce 164EJ/yr (1147GJ/hayr or 3.6W/m 2on average) of primary energy and 90EJ/yr of final energy in the form of liquid fuel (alcohol) and electricity, using agricultural productivities near the best ones already achievable and biomass gasification technology. More remarkable is that these results can be obtained with the operation of 4,000 production units with unitary capacity similar to the largest currently in operation. These units should be spread over the tropical land area yielding a plantation density similar to the one presently observed in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, where alcohol and electricity have been commercialized in a cost-effective way for several years. Such an amount of final energy would be sufficiently large to fulfill all the expected global increase in oil demand, as well as in electricity consumption by 2030, assuming the energy demand of such sources continues to grow at the same pace observed over the last two decades. When sugarcane crops are combined with afforestation/reforestation it is possible to show that carbon emissions decline for some IPCC SRES scenarios by 2030, 2040 and 2050. Such energy alternatives significantly reduce CO 2emissions by displacing fossil fuels and promote sustainable development through the creation of millions of direct and indirect jobs. Also, it opens an opportunity for negative CO2emissions when coupled with carbon dioxide capture and storage. © Springer 2006.","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Intensive culture; Mitigation","agricultural production; biomass burning; biomass power; carbon dioxide; climate change; energy use; renewable resource; Africa; Brazil; Latin America; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; South America",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745598771

Wind generated electricity appears to be a fiscally viable solution, as the area has excellent wind potential. Yet despite the technological improvement, the penetration of substantial wind power to autonomous electrical grids is still limited, mainly due to existing technical barriers. One of the most interesting autonomous electrical network cases is the island of Crete. Here, with an excellent wind potential, about 180 wind turbines of 120 MW total installed rated capacity are in operation or under construction. However, even in this relatively strong electrical system, grid instability and mismatching of supply and demand have led to significant wind energy rejection. This ""spilt"" wind power corresponds to an annual financial loss of income of 30,000 € per MW of wind power installed. The present study seeks an integrated methodology with pumped-hydro storage for maximizing the contribution of wind energy in the Crete electricity supply. In addition, the objective is to improve grid stability.

Their characteristics move strongly according to frequency, and temperature. Temperature variation is generally not taken into account in electrical simulation software. In many applications such as transport, industry, space one or in military applications, the variations of temperature are significant. A model taking into account these variations seems to be essential. In this study we propose to define a simple model taking into account characteristics variations of the electrolytic capacitors according to the temperature and frequency. A method of identification is proposed based on genetic algorithm. A good compromise between simplicity and precision is one of the objectives of this study. This identification was carried out for large electrolytic capacitor of rated value 4,7mF/500V. The comparison between measurements and the model for different temperatures gives good results.

One of today's trends is to access multimedia services from this sort of device. Their low capacity in terms of storage, and their high inclination to wireless connection, suggest the use of streaming techniques instead of media download. Mobile devices are, at present, dramatically unhomogeneous for visualization and audio reproduction characteristics. Consequently, today multimedia delivery systems are very customized for some device profiles or for wireless connection types. Transcoding techniques are used in order to adapt the same media source to the multiple hardware profiles. Client-based transcoding techniques show their weakness in high energy consumption, and server-based transcoding techniques suffer from scalability problems. In this paper we propose a scalable distributed multimedia server based on the Grid computing paradigm, which can adapt media content to the device profile and/or to the connection link.

The derivation is based on a modal analysis of the time-dependent radiative transfer equation. This approach confirms that the dynamic diffusion coefficient is given by the random-walk result D=cl*/3, where l* is the transport mean free path and c is the energy velocity, independent of the level of absorption. It also shows that the diffusion coefficient for steady-state transport, often used in biomedical optics, depends on absorption, in agreement with recent theoretical and experimental works.

Cold acclimation of rats led to a 3-fold increase in fatty acid (FA) β-oxidation (P < 0.01) for ex vivo livers perfused at 37 °C. This increase was preserved following perfusion at 25 °C (P < 0.001). In vitro measurement of absolute rates of hepatic β-oxidation revealed no significant difference following cold acclimation, implying changes in fatty acid flux through β-oxidation rather than increased oxidation capacity. Total FA uptake was increased one-third following perfusion at 25 °C (P < 0.001) and cold acclimation (P < 0.05) and cold acclimation led to diversion of tissue FA from storage to β-oxidation (P < 0.01). In separate experiments, in vivo hepatic lipogenesis rates for saponifiable lipids doubled (P < 0.01) and cholesterol synthesis increased one-third (P < 0.001). Taken together these data suggest the oxidation and synthesis of lipids occur simultaneously in hepatic tissue possibly to increase prevailing tissue FA concentrations and to generate heat through increased metabolic flux rates. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.","Cold acclimation; Fatty acid oxidation; Lipogenesis; Liver metabolism","animal tissue; article; cholesterol synthesis; cold acclimatization; controlled study; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid transport; in vitro study; lipid metabolism; lipogenesis; liver function; liver metabolism; male; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; rat; rodent; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745257579

The TUS design concepts will allow us to construct the next generation of fluorescence detectors with increasing light collection power and higher resolution. The KLYPVE instrument with collection power 5 times larger of the TUS will be the next space detector. Light collection is obtained with the help of segmented ""low frequency Fresnel type"" mirrors. Photo receiver retina in the focal consists of modules of PM tubes. For stable performance in conditions of variable light noise and variable temperature the tube type with a multi-alcali cathode was chosen. Voltage supplies for PMT in one module were designed for keeping the performance of photo receiver retina uniform when the tube gain change. From every tube the signal amplitude is recorded in time bins of 400 ns. The digital data are kept and analyzed in the module FPGA connected to the central FPGA controlling all data. The RAM memory is large, capable to record events with different duration of the light signal (up to several seconds). The preliminary event data are analyzed in the triggering system of the central FPGA. The trigger criteria have several options for events of different origin (different pixel signal duration). The trigger integration time is controlled from the space mission center. The performances of the detector were simulated and zenith angle dependent trigger efficiencies were calculated. The TUS detector will be efficient in recording ""horizontal"" EAS (zenith angles more than 60°), developed to their maximum above the cloud cover. The EAS Cherenkov light, back scattered from the cloud cover, will be recorded and will improve data on the EAS direction and position of maximum. For better accuracy in physical parameters of the events and for the experimental check of this accuracy the performance of two TUS detectors at the space platform was recommended. The accommodation of 2 TUS detectors at space platform of the ""RESURS O"" type was tried and approved. The TUS prototypes are being tested in the Mexican mountains. The photo receiver of two PM tubes with the TUS electronics on-board of the MSU Tatiana satellite is measuring the atmosphere light background. © 2005 COSPAR.","Atmosphere; Cosmic rays; Extreme energy; Fluorescence; Mirror-concentrator; Space Platform","Backscattering; Detectors; Field programmable gate arrays; Fluorescence; Random access storage; Satellites; Extensive Air Shower (EAS); Extreme energy; Mirror-concentrator; Space Platform; Space research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744914822

The addition of nanosized metal-oxide powders to polymer electrolyte improves the performance of the polymer electrolyte for all solid-state lithium rechargeable batteries. To meet the challenge of global warming, a new generation of lithium rechargeable batteries with excellent safety, reliability, and cycling life is needed, i.e., not only for applications in consumer electronics, but especially for clean energy storage and for use in hybrid electric vehicles and aerospace. Nanomaterials and nanotechnologies can lead to a new generation of lithium secondary batteries.

The present work investigates the effect of feeding Senegalese sole larvae on Artemia enriched with higher or lower doses of lipid emulsion. Two lipid sources - soybean oil and fish oil - were compared. From 16 days after hatching (DAH) onwards, larvae were fed one of four experimental treatments: Artemia enriched on a high or low dose of soybean oil emulsion (HS and LS) or Artemia enriched on a high or low dose of fish oil emulsion (HF and LF). In terms of growth, the dietary lipid level did not have a significant effect while the soybean oil treatments induced a lower growth than the fish oil-enriched Artemia. The fatty acid (FA) composition of the larvae closely reflected the dietary quantitative and qualitative FA profile. Only slight dietary effects were noted in the activity of trypsin, lipase and alkaline phosphatase. A higher amount of lipid droplets was noticeable in the posterior intestine epithelia and in the hepatocytes of larvae fed Artemia enriched with higher lipid doses, while LS-Artemia induced the lower lipid accumulation on the basal zone of the enterocytes, in accordance with the lowest total lipid level measured in this treatment. These results suggest an important effect of dietary total lipid level on lipid accumulation in the enterocytes and on FA absorption. At 33 DAH a tube feeding trial was conducted with 14C-labelled oleic acid (OA) or triolein (TRI), showing that the lower accumulation of lipid droplets in the larvae fed LS was associated with a significantly higher absorption and retention in the gut and body tissues of the TRI label. For OA no significant differences between treatments were found. TRI label was considerably more evacuated than OA, indicating that sole larvae may have a lower capacity to incorporate a triacylglycerol, which needs to be digested. Finally, OA appears to be preferentially utilized for energy production, accumulating more in larval tissues when absorbed in higher amounts. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the physiological importance of this process, the molecular mechanism is unknown. Here, a genetic screen has been used to identify Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that exhibit a postgerminative growth arrest phenotype, which can be rescued by providing sugar. Seventeen sugar-dependent (sdp) mutants were isolated, and six represent new loci. Triacylglycerol hydrolase assays showed that sdp1, sdp2, and sdp3 seedlings are deficient specifically in the lipase activity that is associated with purified oil bodies. Map-based cloning of SDP1 revealed that it encodes a protein with a patatin-like acyl-hydrolase domain. SDP1 shares this domain with yeast triacylglycerol lipase 3 and human adipose triglyceride lipase. In vitro assays confirmed that recombinant SDP1 hydrolyzes triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols but not monoacylglycerols, phospholipids, galactolipids, or cholesterol esters. SDP1 is expressed predominantly in developing seeds, and a SDP1-green fluorescent protein fusion was shown to associate with the oil body surface in vivo. These data shed light on the mechanism of lipolysis in plants and establish that a central component is evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes. © 2006 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Enzymes; Growth kinetics; Hydrolysis; Seed; Carbon skeletons; Genetic screen; Molecular mechanism; Postgerminative growth; Plants (botany); Germination; Hydrolysis; Plants; Seeds; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Eukaryota; carboxylesterase; hybrid protein; SDP1 protein, Arabidopsis; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; vegetable oil; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; article; chemistry; chromosome map; enzyme specificity; enzymology; genetics; germination; growth, development and aging; hydrolysis; intracellular membrane; lipolysis; metabolism; molecular cloning; molecular genetics; phylogeny; physiology; plant seed; prenatal development; protein tertiary structure; seedling; sequence alignment; ultrastructure; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; Chromosome Mapping; Cloning, Molecular; Germination; Hydrolysis; Intracellular Membranes; Lipase; Lipolysis; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Oils; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Seedling; Seeds; Sequence Alignment; Substrate Specificity; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646842826

As the profile of this family of technologies grows rapidly, there remain many uncertainties relating to its viability, effectiveness and desirability. In this paper we begin to map out some of the key issues associated with CCS, using a multi-criteria approach to explore how an (admittedly small) selection of stakeholders perceive alternative storage options and energy scenarios. We present five long-term scenarios describing alternative ways in which the UK energy system could develop and which deploy different levels of carbon storage. The key storage options considered are oil and gas fields (both disused and with enhanced oil recovery), traps in saline aquifers, saline aquifers outside traps and on-shore sites. The relative performance of the scenarios and the storage reservoirs included within them have been assessed against a set of socio-economic, technical and environmental criteria by a small selection of stakeholders to the carbon storage debate. Whilst we cannot make strong conclusions regarding precise stakeholder opinions at this stage due to the small size of the sample, the broad delineation of the arguments for and against CCS are evident. Multi-criteria assessment (MCA) appears to hold much potential as a useful tool for characterising and better understanding differences in stakeholder assessments of CCS and its implications, and for identifying options around which greater consensus on the desirability (or otherwise) of CCS as a mitigation strategy might emerge. © Springer 2006.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Crude petroleum; Economic and social effects; Fossil fuels; Geology; Salinity measurement; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Geological carbon storage; Mitigation strategy; Multi-criteria assessment (MCA); Fuel storage; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; fossil fuel; gas exchange; map",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646802317

The capacity of carbohydrates to induce secretion of these incretin hormones could be one of the factors determining the metabolic quality of different types of carbohydrates. We analyzed the correlation between the rate of intestinal absorption of (starch-derived) glucose and plasma concentrations of GLP-1 and GIP after ingestion of glucose and starchy foods with a different content of rapidly and slowly available glucose. In a crossover study, glucose, insulin, GLP-1, and GIP concentrations were monitored for 6 h after consumption of glucose, uncooked cornstarch (UCCS) or corn pasta in 7 healthy men. All test meals were naturally labeled with 13C. Using a primed, continuous D-[6,6- 2H2]glucose infusion, the rate of appearance of exogenous glucose (RaEx) was estimated, reflecting the rate of intestinal glucose absorption. GLP-1 concentrations increased significantly from 180 to 300 min after ingestion of UCCS, the starch product with a high content of slowly available glucose. A high GIP response in the early postprandial phase (15-90 min) occurred after consumption of glucose. There was a strong positive within-subject correlation between RaEx and GIP concentrations (r = 0.73, P &lt; 0.01) across the test meals. Rapidly and slowly digestible carbohydrates differ considerably in their ability to stimulate secretion of incretin hormones; the metabolic consequences of such differences warrant exploration. © 2006 American Society for Nutrition.","Glucagon like peptide-1; Glucose absorption; Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide; Stable isotopes; Starch","carbohydrate; gastric inhibitory polypeptide; glucagon like peptide 1; starch; adult; article; food intake; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; human; human experiment; insulin blood level; male; normal human; postprandial state; test meal; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646776080

He participated from the beginning, with the energy that has become his hallmark. The area of systems studies was introduced in The Netherlands in about 1970, mainly through the activities of the Systeemgroep Nederland or Dutch Systems Group, initiated by Ab Hanken. The paper aims to unearth the original message that made the field of systems attractive. Design/methodology/approach - The aim is achieved on the basis of a re-analysis of von Bertalanffy's systems papers, which he published under the title of ""General System Theory"". Findings - von Bertalanffy's message was not what is usually thought - that many political leaders treat their problems incompetently and hence make them less solvable or even create messes. He answered a general question about knowledge acquisition, in an area where an answer was sorely needed. Practical implications - von Bertalanffy's answer inspired hope that one day one would be able to acquire the knowledge needed to solve the politicians' problems. He even identified a number of methods to do so. Originality/value - The claim of the paper is that von Bertalanffy intended systems thinking to extend methods of knowing. This intention has been obscured by the limited methods he introduced. This claim is argued in an original way. © Emerald Group Publising Limited.","Experience; Knowledge management; Memory; Research","Data storage equipment; Knowledge management; Research; Design/methodology/approach; Experience; General system theory; Netherlands; Number of methods; Reanalysis; Systems groups; Systems thinking; System theory",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646537176

The motor is driven by a PWM inverter with voltage booster. The voltage booster is used to control the dc link voltage in high speed region to improve the system efficiency. Furthermore, the double-layer capacitor as a storage element is combined with the PWM inverter with voltage booster to gain the efficiency for the regenerating operation. In this system, normally, the regenerative power does not return to a battery directly but is stored in the double-layer capacitors for the next motoring action to suppress the excessive regenerative current to battery, and the regenerative power returns to the battery when the regenerative energy is larger than a certain value. The charging current to the battery is controlled to a constant value to extend the life-time of the battery. The transient and steady state characteristics of the system for 1.5kW IPM motor are investigated by both simulation and experiment. Finally, the effectiveness of the system is demonstrated by the simulated and experimental results.","Double-layer capacitor and regeneration; Permanent magnet motor; PWM inverter; Voltage booster","Capacitors; Computer simulation; Electric energy storage; Power electronics; Pulse width modulation; Synchronous motors; Voltage control; Double-layer capacitor and regeneration; Permanent magnet motor; PWM inverter; Voltage boosters; Electric inverters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646375713

Examples of possible Milanese gold threads are discussed as well as specimens from Queen Kristina's funeral clothing, but the main focus of this study is on the 14 episcopal copes made for the coronation of King Adolf Fredrik in 1751. The specimens were examined by a variety of methods including visual inspection, stereo magnification and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX). The environmental conditions and storage materials were recorded for each object. The metal used for most of the specimens is silver gilt. The objects are in relatively good condition, probably due to good quality and careful handling. The metal shows varying degrees of corrosion. Possible reasons such as air pollution and conservation treatment are discussed. The findings will form the basis of continuing work on a database of metal threads at the National Heritage Board.

These electronic subunits were encapsulated in a case (110 × ∼80 × ∼30 mm) made of epoxy resin. The IEU was evaluated in two animal experiments using goats implanted with the UP-LVAD. The lithium ion batteries in the IEU provided 30-min energy supply daily to the UP-LVAD.

As a result of the availability of high-calorie food and a reduction in energy expenditure, maladaptive metabolic processes may interfere with the action of insulin and increase susceptibility for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. With the advent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), the mechanisms of this maladaptation and its relationship to insulin resistance syndrome components have become less obscure, promising new therapeutic approaches for this common problem. In this review we first focus on the molecular structure and cellular mechanisms of action of these receptors and then discuss how PPAR-γ, a PPAR isoform, provides a link between adiposity, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV.

The goal of this paper is to develop a DCT-based watermarking algorithm for low power and high performance. Our energyefficient technique focuses on reducing computation required on blockbased permutation. Instead of using spacial coefficients proposed by Hsu and Wu's algorithm [1], we use DCT coefficients to pair blocks directly. The approach is implemented by C language and estimated power dissipation using Wattch toolset. The experimental results show that our approach not only reduces 99% energy consumption of pairing mechanism, but also increase the PSNR by 0.414db for the best case. Moreover, the proposed approach is robust to a variety of signal distortions, such as JPEG, image cropping, sharpening, blurring, and intensity adjusting.

The use of ultrasonography demonstrated that the tendinous structures of the muscle-tendon complex are compliant enough to influence the biomechanical behavior (length change, shortening velocity, and so on) of fascicles substantially. It was discussed that the fascicles are a force generator rather than a work generator; the tendinous structures function not only as an energy re-distributor but also as a power amplifier, and the interaction between fascicles and tendinous structures is essential for generating higher joint power outputs during the late pushoff phase in human vertical jumping. This phenomenon could be explained based on the force-length/velocity relationships of each element (contractile and series elastic elements) in the muscle-tendon complex during movements. Through computer simulation using a Hill-type muscle-tendon complex model, the benefit of making a countermovement was examined in relation to the compliance of the muscle-tendon complex and the length ratio between the contractile and series elastic elements. Also, the integral roles of the series elastic element were simulated in a cyclic human heel-raise exercise. It was suggested that the storage and reutilization of elastic energy by the tendinous structures play an important role in enhancing work output and movement efficiency in many sorts of human movements. © 2006 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Computer simulation; Stretch-shortening cycle; Ultrasonography","Computer simulation; Force control; Mechanical properties; Muscle; Tendons; Elastic energy; Human vertical jumping; Stretch-shortening cycle; Ultrasonography; Biomechanics; biomechanics; body movement; compliance (physical); dynamics; echography; energy; energy expenditure; exercise; force; heel; jumping; medical research; review; simulation; stretching; tendon; work",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646240323

Grid computing has emerged as an enabler for e-Science as it permits the creation of virtual organizations that bring together communities with common objectives. Within a community, data collections are stored or replicated on distributed resources to enhance storage capability or the efficiency of access. In such an environment, scientists need to have the ability to carry out their studies by transparently accessing distributed data and computational resources. In this paper, we propose and develop a Grid broker that mediates access to distributed resources by: (a) discovering suitable data and computational resources sources for a given analysis scenario; (b) optimally mapping analysis jobs to resources; (c) deploying and monitoring job execution on selected resources; (d) accessing data from local or remote data sources during job execution; and (e) collating and presenting results. The broker supports a declarative and dynamic parametric programming model for creating Grid applications. We have used this model in Grid-enabling a high-energy physics analysis application (the Belle Analysis Software Framework). The broker has been used in deploying Belle experimental data analysis jobs on a Grid testbed, called the Belle Analysis Data Grid, having resources distributed across Australia interconnected through GrangeNet.

But predrying involves not only high investment and energy costs, it also restricts flexibility in product changeovers because of the long residence times that are needed, and it also affects process reliability due to the additional upstream processing step. For this reason, research is currently being carried out in a pilot plant into the venting technology on a single screw extruder. The aim is to get by without predrying altogether through the use of a vented hopper system in combination with a melt-degassing unit. With the aid of the intrinsic viscosity of the specimens and the pressure losses measured during the process, it is shown that such a solution is basically possible with the existing extrusion line.",,"Costs; Degassing; Extrusion; Polyethylene terephthalates; Pressure effects; Energy costs; Hopper system; Pet film extrusion; Single screw extruder; Plastic films",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646006095

The original KASCADE experiment at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany, has been extended by 37 detector stations of the former EAS-TOP experiment (Grande array) to provide sensitivity to energies of primary particles from the cosmos of up to 1018 eV. The new FADC-based DAQ system will improve the quality of the data taken by the Grande array by digitizing the scintillator signals with a 250-MHz sampling rate. The signals of each of the 37 detector stations are continuously recorded using interleaved 12-bit FADCs located on custom-made digitizer boards at each station. The digitizer boards feature a self-triggering mechanism, initiating the data transmission to the Grande DAQ station using programmable thresholds, a timestamp mechanism, and optical data transmission. The control logic is implemented using field progammable gate arrays (FPGAs). Five optical receiver and temporary storage modules receive the data from up to eight stations each (at an approximate rate of 2.5 MB/s per station) and transfer them into the memory of one of five PCs via a customized PCI interface card. Running on a master PC, the data acquisition software searches for coincidences in the timestamps, incorporates triggers generated by the other KASCADE-Grande components, and builds air shower events from the data of the individual stations. Completed Grande events are sent to the central DAQ of KASCADE-Grande at an approximate rate of a few air shower events per second. Two Grande stations have been equipped with the FADC-based data acquisition system, and first data are shown. © 2006 IEEE.","Astroparticle physics instrumentation; Flash analog-to-digital-converters (FADCs)-based readout systems; KASCADE-Grande; Programmable logic","Analog to digital conversion; Approximation theory; Data reduction; Field programmable gate arrays; Image quality; Signal receivers; Custom-made digitizer boards; Flash analog-to-digital-converters (FADC)-based data acquisition (DAQ) system; Grande array; Optical receivers; Data acquisition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645667809

Understanding what influences life history strategies and how changes in life history in turn influence population dynamics and ecological interactions are crucial to our understanding of marine ecology and contemporary anthropogenic induced change. We present a state-dependent model that optimises life-long energy allocation in iteroparous fish. Energy can be allocated to growth or reproduction and depends in the individual's age, body length, and stored energy and the state of the environment. Allocation and the physiological processes of growth, energy storage, and reproduction are modelled mechanistically. The model is parameterised for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), more specifically the Northeast Arctic cod stock. Growth and maturation predicted by the model fit well with field observations, and based on a further investigation of cod reproduction in the model, we conclude that the model has the ability to recapture complex life history phenomena, e.g., indeterminate growth and skipped spawning, and therefore provides an important tool that can improve our understanding of life history strategies in fish. © 2005 NRC.",,"environmental conditions; food availability; gadoid; growth; life cycle; maturation; population dynamics; stock assessment; Arctogadus glacialis; Gadus morhua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645666107

However, the remarkable talents of a third class of biomolecules are often overlooked. For example, one of them far surpasses the building blocks of nucleic acids and proteins in terms of theoretical coding capacity by oligomer formation. Although often exclusively assigned to duties in energy metabolism, carbohydrates as part of cellular glycoconjugates (glycoproteins, proteoglycans, glycolipids) have, in fact, other important tasks. Currently, they are increasingly gaining recognition as an operative high-density information coding system. An elaborate enzymatic machinery enables cells to be versatile enough to produce a glycan profile (glycome) that is as characteristic as a fingerprint. Moreover, swift modifications during dynamic processes, such as differentiation or malignant transformation, are readily possible. The translation of the information presented in oligosaccharide determinants to biological responses is carried out by lectins. Recognition of foreign glycosignatures in innate immunity, regulation of cell-cell/matrix interactions, cell migration or growth, and intra- and intercellular glycan routing etc represent physiologically far-reaching lectin-carbohydrate functionality. The classification of endogenous lectins is guided by sequence alignments and conservation of distinct structural traits. For example, a jelly-roll-like folding pattern and maintenance of key residue positioning involved in stacking and C-H/π-interactions as well as directional hydrogen bonds to the β-galactoside ligands are common denominators among galectins. Biochemical and biophysical studies are beginning to unravel the intricacies of the selection of a limited set of endogenous ligands, such as certain integrins or ganglioside GM1, and combined with biological cell experiments, its relevance for cell sociology, e.g. in growth regulation and tumor cell invasion or activated T cell apoptosis. Histopathological monitoring accompanies the biological cell investigations, linking expression of certain family members to tumor progression or suppression. Further insights into the functional consequences of the sugar code's translation are thus expected to have notable repercussions for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.","Agglutinin; Apoptosis; Drug design; Galectin; Glycoconjugate; Lectin; Metastasis; Sugar code","amino acid; beta galactosidase; carbohydrate; galectin; galectin 1; galectin 2; galectin 3; galectin 4; galectin 7; galectin 8; ganglioside GM1; glycolipid; glycoprotein; integrin; lectin; nucleic acid; nucleotide; oligomer; oligosaccharide; proteoglycan; apoptosis; cancer inhibition; cell growth; cell invasion; cell migration; energy metabolism; genealogy; genetic code; glycobiology; growth regulation; histopathology; human; hydrogen bond; innate immunity; malignant transformation; microphotography; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; protein function; protein structure; review; T lymphocyte; tumor cell; tumor growth; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Carbohydrate Conformation; Drug Design; Galectins; Humans; Hydrogen Bonding; Ligands; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligosaccharides; Protein Conformation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645462356

A study was conducted to determine the effect of preincubation warming and egg size on the warming rate of eggs. Three egg groupings were evaluated: small broiler breeder eggs (52 to 57 g), large broiler breeder eggs (64 to 69 g), and turkey eggs (74 to 107 g). The eggs were subjected to 2 temperature treatments. The conventionally incubated eggs were moved directly from storage (17.5°C) to the incubator (adjusted to 37.5°C). The preincubation warmed eggs were moved from the storage room to the preincubation room (28°C) for 12 h and then to the incubator. Internal egg temperature was measured once per minute to calculate the rate of warming. The warming rate potential (k value) differed for egg type and temperature treatment The values for small and large broiler breeder eggs and turkey eggs were 0.0506,0.0488, and 0.0471 kJ/min per kJ of energy in the egg, respectively. This study characterizes the maximum rate of temperature change that occurs when eggs are transferred from a storage or preincubation area to the incubator, creating baseline values for future work with the modification of hatchery management protocols. These data can contribute to more informed decisions regarding hatchery temperature profile strategies and their effect on the developing embryo. ©2006 Poultry Science Association, Inc.","Egg size; Preincubation warming; Warming rate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645366990

Cysteine, one of the two S-containing aminoacids present in proteins, contains sulfur in fully reduced form and its thiol group can undergo a range of reactions under physiological conditions. X-ray absorption spectroscopy represents a unique tool to speciate the redox state of sulfur in biomolecules because of the known strong correlation between oxidation state and absorption edge energy shift (over 10 eV). Moreover, a rich X-ray absorption near edge structure is related to the chemical structures of S-containing biomolecules, as well as significant spectral changes due to biochemical action. The formation of a disulfide bond, i.e. a covalent linkage between the S atoms of two cysteine residues, or its reduction were investigated only indirectly in biomolecules. X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments at the sulfur K-edge were performed at the soft X-ray beamline in Frascati using the wiggler source of the 0.51 GeV storage ring DAΦNE. X-ray absorption near edge structure data were collected to distinguish in situ between S-thiol and disulfide on model protein systems. Such preliminary results confirm this technique as a unique probe of sulfur chemistry in vivo. Quantitative speciation of S-metabolites can be foreseen in biological tissues with no chemical manipulations of the specimen.",,"Cells; Insulin; Light absorption; Metabolites; Oxidation; Redox reactions; Sulfur; Tissue; X ray spectroscopy; Biomolecules; Cysteine; Glutathione; X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy; Trace analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645287532

We studied the relationship between size scaling of energy intake, total metabolic costs and levels of storage energy related to the niche shift from invertebrate feeding to cannibalism in an alpine Arctic char population. Gill-net samples consisted of two distinct size modes, small invertebrate feeding char (92-172 mm total length) and large cannibalistic char (265-606 mm total length). Food consumption was estimated for a one year period using a radioactive tracer (137Cs). The energy intake followed a hump-shaped relationship with fish size for invertebrate feeding char and increased monotonically with size for cannibalistic char. Total metabolic costs increased exponentially with size for both groups. Char feeding in the invertebrate niche had a maximum net energy gain at 140 mm total length with an upper size limit for positive net energy gain at 180 mm. For cannibals the relationship between size and net energy gain formed a hump shaped function with maximum net energy gain at 400 mm and a lower size limit for positive net energy gain at 230 mm. The size at maturation for both small and large char was close to the size for maximum energy gain in their respective niches. Immature individuals close to the upper size limit for positive net energy gain in the invertebrate niche had low levels of storage lipids but tended to have high mass specific growth rates. This may imply a reallocation from reversible (stored) energy to structural (length) growth as a strategy to transform into the size-range where the cannibalistic niche successfully could be exploited.

The development of low-cost, high-protein food supplements for weaning infants from local and readily available raw materials is a constant challenge for developing countries. Objective. To formulate, d evelop, and assess the nutritive value, acceptability, and keeping quality of sorghum-based staple dried flakes as instant weaning foods. Methods. Weaning blends composed of 42% sorghum supplemented with 20% legumes, 10% oil seeds, and 28% additives (sugar, oil, skim milk powder, and vanillin) were prepared according to FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations and processed in a twin-roller drum dryer. The effects of fermentation and of the addition of malt on the nutritive value and functional properties of the blends were investigated. Results. The blends were found to contain 16.6% to 19.3% protein, 68.7% to 72.7% carbohydrate, 0.9% to 1.3% fiber, and 405.8 to 413.2 kcal of energy per 100 g. The iron content of the blends ranged from 5.3 to 9.1 mg/100 g, and the calcium content ranged from 150 to 220 mg/100 g, All blends reconstituted well and formed a soft paste when stirred with hot or cold water. The water-holding capacity, wettability, and bulk density were within the ranges of corresponding values of commercial weaning foods. Sensory attributes, viscosity values, and in vitro digestibility varied among the blends, whereas lysing content improved considerably (p ≤.05) for all blends. All blends had similar keeping quality, with no signs of spoilage or development of off-flavors or colors after 10 months of storage. Most blends remained free of aflatoxins. Conclusions. Legumes and oil seeds can be effectively used in sorghum-based weaning foods as an acceptable protein and mineral supplement. © 2006, The United Nations University.","Legumes; Oil seeds; Sorghum; Sudan; Weaning food","food supplementation; sorghum; weaning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644958911

Angiopoietin-related growth factor (AGF), a member of the angiopoietin-like protein (Angptl) family, is secreted predominantly from the liver into the systemic circulation. Here, we show that most (>80%) of the AGF-deficient mice die at about embryonic day 13, whereas the surviving AGF-deficient mice develop marked obesity, lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and liver, and insulin resistance accompanied by reduced energy expenditure relative to controls. In parallel, mice with targeted activation of AGF show leanness and increased insulin sensitivity resulting from increased energy expenditure. They are also protected from high-fat diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance and nonadipose tissue steatosis. Hepatic overexpression of AGF by adenoviral transduction, which leads to an approximately 2.5-fold increase in serum AGF concentrations, results in a significant (P<0.01) body weight loss and increases insulin sensitivity in mice fed with a high-fat diet.

In Germany, notably high wind power capacities are planned in the North. If the existing transmission capacities between individual regions become insufficient, the electricity prices will differ considerably and the system operation can become unstable. It is supposed that the extension of transmission capacities and the use of energy storages avoid this separation of individual regions. In this paper, the arising price differences between regions in Germany are estimated using a novel stochastic linear optimisation model that optimises the efficient power market operation on an hourly basis. To estimate the impact of extensions of transmission lines and energy storages on the electricity prices systematic case studies are undertaken. It is exemplarily shown that differences of electricity prices can be equalised with transmission capacity extensions whereas they remain with the use of storage devices.

This device has been conceived to limit the vibrations on the first diffracting crystal and to maintain it at a constant temperature. These points are crucial for maximizing the beamline stability. Moreover, the relative angular position of the second crystal can be dynamically adjusted by a piezoelectric transducer coupled with a feedback system in order to always be at the maximum of the rocking curve during an X-ray absorption spectroscopy scan. The temperature is stabilized to an accuracy of 0.01°, with two principal consequences. The energy resolution is close to the theoretical value [ΔE/E = 5.6 × 10-6 for Si(220)] and the precision of the energy positioning is extremely good even if the power load changes. A feedback mechanism allows a permanent and automatic optimization of the angle between the two crystals of the monochromator.

The regulation of utilization of the different lipid sources in skeletal muscle during exercise is reviewed, and the influence of diet, training, and gender is discussed. Major points deliberated are the methods utilized to measure uptake and oxidation of LCFA during exercise in humans. The role of the various lipid-binding proteins in transmembrane and cytosolic transport of lipids is considered as well as regulation of lipid entry into the mitochondria, focusing on the putative role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), and carnitine during exercise. The possible contribution to fuel provision during exercise of circulating VLDL-TG as well as the role of IMTG is discussed from a methodological point of view. The contribution of IMTG for energy provision may not be large, covering ∼10% of total energy provision during fasting exercise in male subjects, whereas in females, IMTG may cover a larger proportion of energy delivery. Molecular mechanisms involved in breakdown of IMTG during exercise are also considered focusing on hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Finally, the role of lipids in development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, including possible molecular mechanisms involved, is discussed.

Net radiation and the turbulent fluxes are directly measured, the anthropogenic flux may be estimated and the storage flux is calculated as an energy balance residual. This paper reports both measurement and modelling of energy fluxes during wintertime in suburban areas of Christchurch, New Zealand. Under settled anticyclonic conditions, a strong inversion can occur over the city which severely restricts turbulent mixing. Even after sunrise the turbulent fluxes are small, and if one assumes advection is negligible, this means the storage flux increases in importance to very high levels. This paper suggests that these high storage rates are physically unrealistic for this environment. Rather, it is likely that some energy, which is assumed to be dissipated as heat storage, is more likely lost through mesoscale advection or attributed to errors caused by unsuitable measurement techniques under conditions with low friction velocity. However, even these two processes cannot fully account for flux loss. A full study is recommended to resolve this issue and meanwhile, caution is advised when applying current research methodology to estimate storage fluxes in urban areas in stable wintertime conditions. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",,"eddy covariance; energy balance; energy flux; urban climate; winter; Australasia; Canterbury [South Island]; Christchurch; New Zealand; South Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644788600

We have recently identified a novel class of compounds, CO-releasing molecules (CO-RMs), which exert important pharmacological activities by carrying and delivering CO to biological systems. Here, we examined the possible beneficial effects of CO liberated from CO-RMs on the damage inflicted by cold storage and I-R in isolated perfused kidneys. Hemodynamic and biochemical parameters as well as mitochondrial respiration were measured in isolated perfused rabbit kidneys that were previously flushed with CO-RMs and stored at 4°C for 24 h. Two water-soluble CO-RMs were tested: (1) sodium boranocarbonate (CORM-A1), a boron-containing carbonate that releases CO at a slow rate, and (2) tricarbonylchloro(glycinato)ruthenium(II) (CORM-3), a transition metal carbonyl that liberates CO very rapidly in solution. Kidneys flushed with Celsior solution supplemented with CO-RMs (50 μM) and stored at 4°C for 24 h displayed at reperfusion a significantly higher perfusion flow rate (PFR), glomerular filtration rate, and sodium and glucose reabsorption rates compared to control kidneys flushed with Celsior solution alone. Addition of 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-alpha]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, prevented the increase in PFR mediated by CO-RMs. The respiratory control index from kidney mitochondria treated with CO-RMs was also markedly increased. Notably, renal protection was lost when kidneys were flushed with Celsior containing an inactive compound (iCO-RM), which had been deliberately depleted of CO. CO-RMs are effective therapeutic agents that deliver CO during kidney cold preservation and can be used to ameliorate vascular activity, energy metabolism and renal function at reperfusion. © 2006 International Society of Nephrology.","Carbon monoxide; Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules; Cold preservation; Heme oxygenase-1; Ischemia-reperfusion injury; Kidney function","1h 1,2,4 oxadiazolo[4,3 a]quinoxalin 1 one; boron derivative; carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide releasing molecule; celsior; glucose; guanylate cyclase inhibitor; ruthenium; sodium; sodium boranocarbonate; transition element; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; cryopreservation; energy metabolism; flow rate; glomerulus filtration rate; hemodynamics; kidney function; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; osteolysis; priority journal; rabbit; renal protection; reperfusion; reperfusion injury; Animals; Carbon Monoxide; Cold; Kidney; Male; Mitochondria; Organ Preservation; Oxadiazoles; Oxygen Consumption; Quinoxalines; Rabbits; Reperfusion Injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644638482

This paper presents a load model, which incorporates the characteristics of batch-type loads common to any type of process industry. The model is coupled with an optimisation formulation utilising integer programming for minimising the total electricity-cost satisfying production, process flow and storage constraints for different tariff structures. The methodology proposed can be used for determining the optimal response for any industry under time varying tariffs. The case study of a steel plant shows that significant reductions in peak-period demand (about 50%) and electricity cost (about 5.7%) are possible with optimal-load schedules. The utility can also get significant reduction in the peak coincident demand if large industries optimally reschedule their productions in response to time-of-use (TOU) tariff. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand regulation of the switch from cell proliferation to differentiation, SUCROSE NONFERMENTING-1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE (SnRK1) was antisense repressed in pea seeds. Transgenic seeds show maturation defects, reduced conversion of sucrose into storage products, lower globulin content, frequently altered cotyledon surface, shape, and symmetry, as well as occasional precocious germination.

Delayed down-regulated genes are related to mitotic activity, gibberellic acid/brassinosteroid synthesis, stress response, and Ca2+ signal transduction. This specifies a developmentally younger status and conditional stress. Higher gene expression related to respiration/ gluconeogenesis/fermentation is consistent with a role of SnRK1 in repressing energy-consuming processes in maturing cotyledons under low oxygen/energy availability. Delayed up-regulated genes are mainly related to storage protein synthesis and stress tolerance. Most of the phenotype resembles abscisic acid (ABA) insensitivity and may be explained by reduced Abi-3 expression. This may cause a reduction in ABA functions and/or a disconnection between metabolic and ABA signals, suggesting that SnRK1 is a mediator of ABA functions during pea seed maturation. SnRK1 repression also impairs gene expression associated with differentiation, independent from ABA functions, like regulation and signaling of developmental events, chromatin reorganization, cell wall synthesis, biosynthetic activity of plastids, and regulated proteolysis. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Cells; Enzymes; Fermentation; Genes; Nutrition; Seed; Stresses; Embryos; Gibberellic acid; Kinases; Phenotype; Sugar (sucrose); Cells; Enzymes; Fermentation; Genes; Nutrition; Seeds; Stresses; Sucrose; Eukaryota; Pisum sativum; abscisic acid; complementary RNA; GLC2 protein; protein serine threonine kinase; sucrose; vegetable protein; article; cluster analysis; DNA microarray; down regulation; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; histology; metabolism; molecular genetics; pea; phenotype; phylogeny; physiology; plant seed; prenatal development; transgenic plant; upregulation; Vicia faba; Abscisic Acid; Cluster Analysis; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Peas; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; RNA, Antisense; Seeds; Sucrose; Up-Regulation; Vicia faba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33344466304

Lysosomal degradation of proteinaceous and other material declines early in such diseases. This suggests that intraneuronal aggregates consist of material which is normally broken down in the lysosome and thus accumulates when lysosomal degradation fails. This is plausible even though those aggregates are generally non-lysosomal, because lysosomal uptake may be affected. Thus, restoring lysosomal function might eliminate them - and without increasing the concentration of the soluble monomers or oligomers of which they are formed. This approach is therefore unlikely to be harmful and may well be beneficial. How might lysosomes be rejuvenated? Since lysosomal dysfunction is likely to be caused by intralysosomal material that is resistant to lysosomal degradation, normal function might be recovered by augmenting that function to cause the toxin to be degraded. Here, I describe how such augmentation might be achieved with microbial enzymes. Soil microbes display astonishing catabolic diversity, something exploited for decades in the bioremediation industry. Environments enriched in human remains impose selective pressure on the microbial population to evolve the ability to degrade any recalcitrant, energy-rich human material. Thus, microbes may exist that can degrade these lysosomal toxins. If so, it should be possible to isolate the genes responsible and modify them for therapeutic activity in the mammalian lysosome. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The most established methods of storing hydrogen are as a cryogenic liquid and as a high-pressure compressed gas. However, these conventional technologies are restricted by the high energy cost of the liquefaction and compression processes, and by their low volumetric hydrogen densities. In the past 40 years considerable research efforts have focussed on the encapsulation of hydrogen in metal hydrides but the competitiveness of the higher capacity metal hydrides, such as the magnesium-based alloys, has been hampered by sluggish sorption kinetics. In recent years hydrogen storage researchers have broadened the scope of potential materials under investigation to include complex hydrides and other advanced nanomaterials, such as nanostructured carbons and metal-oxide frameworks. This paper presents a review of the most mature of the hydrogen storage technologies, being compressed gas, cryogenic liquid and metal hydrides, and discusses promising directions in the search for suitable hydrogen storage materials.",,"Cryogenics; Hydrogen; Nanostructured materials; Reaction kinetics; Sorption; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydrides; Sorption kinetics; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33244477416

Geometrical weight functions that are characteristic for each species are given, and it is shown how convolutions of pairs of weight functions recover each Mayer bond of the ternary mixture and hence ensure the correct second virial expansion of the excess free-energy functional. The case of sphere-platelet overlap relies on the same approximation as does Rosenfeld's functional for strictly two-dimensional hard disks. We explicitly control contributions to the excess free energy that are of third order in density. Analytic expressions relevant for the application of the theory to states with planar translational and cylindrical rotational symmetry-e.g., to describe behavior at planar smooth walls-are given. For binary sphere-platelet mixtures, in the appropriate limit of small platelet densities, the theory differs from that used in a recent treatment [L. Harnau and S. Dietrich, Phys. Rev. E 71, 011504 (2004)].

After literature review, a standardisation and selection exercise has been performed to get figures on conversion efficiency, energy production costs and CO 2 avoidance costs of different technologies, the main parameters for comparison. On the short term, electricity can be produced with 85-90% CO 2 capture by means of NGCC and PC with chemical absorption and IGCC with physical absorption at 4.7-6.9 €ct/kWh, assuming a coal and natural gas price of 1.7 and 4.7 €/GJ. CO2 avoidance costs are between 15 and 50 €/t CO2 for IGCC and NGCC, respectively. On the longer term, both improvements in existing conversion and capture technologies are foreseen as well as new power cycles integrating advanced turbines, fuel cells and novel (high-temperature) separation technologies. Electricity production costs might be reduced to 4.5-5.3 €ct/kWh with advanced technologies. However, no clear ranking can be made due to large uncertainties pertaining to investment and O&amp;M costs. Hydrogen production is more attractive for low-cost CO2 capture than electricity production. Costs of large-scale hydrogen production by means of steam methane reforming and coal gasification with CO2 capture from the shifted syngas are estimated at 9.5 and 7 €/GJ, respectively. Advanced autothermal reforming and coal gasification deploying ion transport membranes might further reduce production costs to 8.1 and 6.4 €/GJ. Membrane reformers enable small-scale hydrogen production at nearly 17 €/GJ with relatively low-cost CO2 capture. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The plasma triacylglycerol concentration was significantly lower in the SRCD-treated rats than in the control rats 4 h after HF diet administration (P < 0.05). In a study of female C57BL/6 mice that consumed a solid HF diet containing 0, 0.2 or 0.5% SRCD ad libitum for 8 wk, the increases in body weight and visceral fat mass were less in those fed the diet supplemented with 0.5% SRCD than in those fed the HF diet (P < 0.05).

In addition, the energy efficiency and the plasma leptin and adiponectin concentrations were lower in the mice and rats that were administered SRCD than in those fed the HF diet alone (P < 0.05). The inhibitory effects of SRCD on HF diet-induced obesity may be attributable to the inhibition of carbohydrate and lipid absorption from the small intestine.

For 50-period SiO x/SiO 2 multilayers, the flat-band voltage shift (ΔV FB) of the C-V curves is found to be inversely proportional to the photoluminescence peak wavelength and intensity, which indicates that larger-sized and more dense Si NCs will exhibit a stronger nonvolatile memory. In single-layer devices, a reduction in the tunnel-oxide thickness strongly enhances ΔV FB, and an asymmetry exists between electron and hole storage. The retention time is improved by increasing the thickness of the tunnel oxide rather than the control oxide. The defect states in these devices are considerably reduced by hydrogenation passivation, enhancing ΔV FB in the hole storage. ΔV FB is enhanced on both polarities by reducing the thickness of the center oxide in doubly-stacked devices, A longer retention time is found in the doubly-stacked memory, which seems to result from suppressed charge leakage between the upper NC layer and the substrate due to an energy barrier in the lower NC layer.","C-V curves; Flat-band voltage shift; Ion-beam sputtering; Nonvolatile memory; Photoluminescence; Si nanocrystals",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32044462286

Public awareness of hydrogen energy and attitudes towards a future hydrogen economy are yet to be systematically investigated. This paper opens by discussing alternative conceptualisations of risk, then focuses on issues surrounding the use of emerging technologies based on hydrogen energy. It summarises expert assessments of risks associated with hydrogen. It goes on to review debates about public perceptions of risk, and in doing so makes comparisons with public perceptions of other emergent technologies - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), Genetically Modified Organisms and Food (GM) and Nanotechnology (NT) - for which there is considerable scientific uncertainty and relatively little public awareness. The paper finally examines arguments about public engagement and ""upstream"" consultation in the development of new technologies. It is argued that scientific and technological uncertainties are perceived in varying ways and different stakeholders and different publics focus on different aspects or types of risk. Attempting to move public consultation further ""upstream"" may not avoid this, because the framing of risks and benefits is necessarily embedded in a cultural and ideological context, and is subject to change as experience of the emergent technology unfolds. © 2006 FQS.","Emergent technology; Hydrogen energy; Public attitudes; Public engagement; Risk perception; Trust; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31844453697

Methods: A randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study with a washout period was performed in 13 healthy male subjects. A 4240-kJ diet containing 30 g of triacylglycerol (TAG) or DAG (TAG meal or DAG meal, containing 34.5% lipids, 52.1% carbohydrates, and 14.1% proteins) was administered after a fasting period of 15 to16 h. Breath and serum were analyzed for up to 5 h after ingestion of the meal. Results: The amount of change in energy expenditure 3 h after loading with the DAG meal tended to be higher than that after loading with the TAG meal (P < 0.1). Changes in respiratory quotient 2 and 5 h after loading with the DAG meal were significantly lower than those after loading with the TAG meal, suggesting high lipid oxidation activity after the meal. The serum insulin level 0.5 h after loading with the DAG meal was significantly lower than that after loading with the TAG meal. This result suggests that there is a smaller stimulus in the direction of fat storage after loading with the DAG meal. Conclusions: Compared with the TAG-containing meal, the DAG-containing meal tended to produce a higher postprandial energy expenditure and a significantly lower postprandial respiratory quotient. These results suggest that the DAG-containing meal has high postprandial lipid oxidation activity and a potential effect on high diet-induced thermogenesis. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Nowadays, 9 years after its discovery emerging data indicate that the primary physiological role of UCP3 may be the mitochondrial handling of fatty acids rather than regulating energy expenditure via thermogenesis. UCP3 has been proposed to export fatty acid anions or fatty acid peroxides away from the matrix-side of the mitochondrial inner membrane to prevent their deleterious accumulation. In this way, UCP3 could protect mitochondria against lipid-induced oxidative mitochondrial damage, a function especially important under conditions of high fatty acid supply to skeletal muscle mitochondria. Such function may be clinically relevant in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a condition characterized by muscular fat accumulation, mitochondrial damage and low levels of UCP3. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The theological properties and behavior of the gel-formed cellulose solution were investigated by using dynamic viscoelastic measurement. The effects of temperature, time, cellulose molecular weight, and concentrations on both the shear storage modulus (G′) and the loss modulus (G"") were analyzed. The cellulose solution having a viscosity-average molecular weight (Mη) of 11.4 × 104 had its sol-gel transition temperature decreased from 60.3 to 30.5 °C with an increase of its concentration from 3 to 5 wt %. The gelation temperature of a 4 wt % cellulose solution dropped from 59.4 to 30.5 °C as the Mη value was increased from 4.5 × 104 to 11.4 × 104. Interestingly, at either higher temperature (above 30 °C), or lower temperature (below -3 °C), or for longer gelation time, gels could form in the cellulose solutions. However, the cellulose solution remains a liquid state for a long time at the temperature range from 0 to 5 °C. For the first time, we revealed an irreversible gelation in the cellulose solution system.

Therefore, this indicates that either heating or cooling treatment could not break such stable gels.

The capture factors are applied to the original CO2 emissions scenarios at a highly disaggregated level. The results are summed up and presented. The results indicate that it might be possible to capture and store a significant quantity of energy related CO2, especially in the second quarter of this century.

Here we show that lipid bodies are a major source of contrast in third-harmonic generation (THG) microscopy of cells and tissues. In hepatocytes, micrometer-sized lipid bodies produce a THG signal 1 -2 orders of magnitude larger than other structures, which allows one to image them with high specificity. THG microscopy with ∼1,200 nm excitation can be used to follow the distribution of lipid bodies in a variety of unstained samples including insect embryos, plant seeds and intact mammalian tissue (liver, lung). We found that epi-THG imaging is possible in weakly absorbing tissues because bulk scattering redirects a substantial fraction of the forward-generated harmonic light toward the objective. Finally, we show that the combination of THG microscopy with two-photon and second-harmonic imaging provides a new tool for exploring the interactions between lipid bodies, extracellular matrix and fluorescent compounds (vitamin A, NADH and others) in tissues. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"lipid; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; retinol; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell ultrastructure; controlled study; embryo; extracellular matrix; fluorescence microscopy; insect cell; lipid analysis; lipid body; lipid metabolism; liver cell; microscopy; nonhuman; plant cell; priority journal; rat; sensitivity and specificity; third harmonic generation microscopy; Animals; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Hepatocytes; Lipids; Liver; Lung; Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton; Organelles; Plants; Seeds; Animalia; Insecta; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31344446932

Electrical, thermal, and phase-transformation mechanisms are considered to produce a physically realistic description of this new approach to ultrahigh-density data storage. Models developed are applied to the design of a suitable storage layer stack with the necessary electrical, thermal, and tribological properties to support recorded bits of nanometric scale. The detailed structure of nanoscale crystalline and amorphous bits is also predicted. For an optimized trilayer stack comprising Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 sandwiched by amorphous or diamond-like carbon layers, crystalline bits were roughly trapezoidal in shape while amorphous bits were semi-ellipsoidal. In both cases, the energy required to write individual bits was very low (of the order of a few hundred picoJoules). Amorphous marks could be directly overwritten (erased), but crystalline bits could not. Readout performance was investigated by calculating the readout current as the tip scanned over isolated bits and bit patterns of increasing density. The highest readout contrast was generated by isolated crystalline bits in an amorphous matrix, but the narrowest readout pulses arose from isolated amorphous marks in a crystalline background. To assess the ultimate density capability of electrical probe recording the role of write-induced intersymbol interference and the thermodynamic stability of nanoscale marks were also studied. © 2006 IEEE.","Electrical nanoprobes; GeSbTe trims; Phase-change recording; Phasechange films; Scanning probe data storage","Electrical nanoprobes; GeSbTe trims; Phase-change recording; Phasechange films; Scanning probe data storage; Crystalline materials; Mathematical models; Optimization; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermodynamics; Phase transitions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31144432926

In summer the C. euxinus population in deep layers of the Black Sea was dominated by pre-diapause and diapausing postmoult copepodite stage V (CV) with small sexually undifferentiated gonads and mean lipid content of 14.1 ± 6.0% of body volume. The lipid content of deep-living females was 7.2 ± 4.2% of body volume. At the same time, intermoult and premoult CV with enlarged gonads and low lipid content (7.7 ± 5.1% of body volume) and females with oil sac volume of 1.4 ± 1.0% were found at shallow stations. Premoult CV with oil volume of 0.6 ± 0.8% and mature females with little visual evidence of substantial lipid storage dominated in the Marmara Sea. The differences in moulting patterns and oil sac volumes of C. euxinus from deep zones and shallow regions suggest that vertical migrations to the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) are necessary for formation of large lipid reserves providing high reproductive potential of this species. On the basis of an energy balance model it was shown that under low phytoplankton concentration of about 30 μg C l- 1 preadults and adults migrating to the OMZ could accumulate lipids (up to 5% of body energy content daily), in contrast to copepods constrained to shallow oxic water columns of the Black Sea and from the Marmara Sea. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Results indicate that both temperature and activation energy for glass transition ( T g ) are dependent on the types of polymers in the blend and blend composition. The T g and E values of the unblended elastomers are higher than those in blends; this behavior is associated with the elastomer confinement and blend morphology.","Activation energy; Confinement effects; EPDM; Glass transition; Natural rubber","Activation energy; Glass transition; High density polyethylenes; Polypropylenes; Rubber; Arrhenius method; Confinement effects; EPDM; Elastomers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30844448999

Between 1984 and 1991 nine power plants with an overall capacity of 354 MW have been installed in the Mojave Desert in California. Since, these power plants can be equipped with a thermal storage or a fossil back-up they offer a fully dispatchable electricity generation capacity. This technology will be a very interesting near term option for countries with high solar irradiation levels and small resources of fossil fuels like Jordan. This paper, discusses the use of parabolic trough solar thermal power plants for electricity production under Jordanian climate for two different sites (Amman, and Ma'an). An analysis of the daily power output, direct normal irradiation and the efficiency for the two sites has been carried out. The results showed that Ma'an site would be preferred than Amman site, so that it is recommended to erect the Parabolic Trough Concentrator (PTC) plant in the southern region of Jordan. Also this study aims to encourage the Jordanian government and the private sector to implement the solar thermal power plants for future expansion of power sector due to the increasing electricity demand and environmental degradation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Filling the tanks with a heat sink would reduce the necessary gas storage area dramatically. The heat sink would absorb the energy that the hot gas contains and consequently the gas would experience a decrease in temperature. This implies that the density of the gas will increase and allow more helium to be stored in the same tank before the tank's maximum operating pressure is reached. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study indicated that the heat sink in fact reduced the total pressure in the tank significantly. The large heat transfer area that the heat sink provides ensures that this kind of system has a quick thermal response. In order to make optimal use of this advantage, the gas must be distributed evenly throughout the tank and no local high-temperature regions must occur. A few injection concepts were investigated to optimise for this requirement. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Characterization of the nanocomposites was done by using X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. The mechanical and dynamic mechanical properties were studied. The surface energy of the clays and the elastomer was also measured. Even with the addition of only 4 phr of clay in Viton B-50, tensile strength and modulus improved by 30-96% and 80-134%, respectively, depending on the nature of the nanoclays. Exfoliation was observed with both the unmodified and the modified clays at low loading in all the fluoroelastomers. Best properties were observed with the unmodified clay. All the grades of fluororubber followed the same trend. The increment (19%) in storage modulus was also higher in the case of the unmodified clay filled Viton B-50 system. The results were explained with the help of thermodynamics, surface energies, and swelling studies. The difference in surface energy, Δγ, between the rubber and the unmodified clay was lower.

In contrast, the compound Ge2Sb2Te5, which is a prototype phase-change material used in optical and electronic data storage, has been shown to undergo a profound change in local order on amorphization. In this work, ab initio ground state calculations are used to unravel the origin of the local order in the crystalline cubic and the amorphous phase of GeSbTe alloys and the resulting physical properties. Our study shows that this class of materials is characterized by two competing structures with similar energy but different local order and different physical properties.

Box 2632, Tallinn 13803, Estonia","Over the last five decades, the isotope effect in solids has been one of the major researches in solid state science. Most of the physical properties of a solid depend to a greater or lesser degree on its isotopic composition. Scientific interest, technological promise and increased availability of highly enriched isotopes have led to a sharp rise in the number of experimental and theoretical studies with isotopically controlled semiconductor and insulator crystals. A great number of stable isotopes and well-developed methods of their separation have made it possible to date to grow crystals of C, LiH, ZnO, ZnSe, CuCl, GaN, GaAs, CdS, Cu2O, Si, Ge and α-Sn with a controllable isotopic composition. The use of such objects allows the investigation of not only the isotope effects in lattice dynamics (elastic, thermal and vibrational properties) but also the influence of such effects on the electronic states via electron-phonon coupling (the renormalization of the band-to-band transition energy Eg, the exciton binding energy Eb and the size of the longitudinal-transverse splitting ΔLT). Capture of thermal neutrons by isotope nuclei followed by nuclear decay produces new elements, resulting in a large number of possibilities for isotope selective doping of solids used in opto-, quantum electronics, fiber optics, etc. The nonlinear dependence of the free exciton luminescence (especially 12C x 13C1-x, LiHxD1-x) intensity on the excitation density allows us to consider these crystals as potential solid state lasers in the UV part of the spectrum. Isotopic information storage may consist in assigning the information ""zero"" or ""one"" to mono-isotopic microislands (or even to a single atom) within a bulk crystalline (or thin film) structure. Recent theoretical results confirm that quantum theory provides the possibility of new ways of performing efficient calculations. It shows how the use of quantum physics could revolutionize the way of communication and process information. Although modern computers rely on quantum mechanics to operate, the information itself is still encoded classically. A new approach is to treat information as a quantum concept and to ask what new insights can be gained by encoding this information in an individual quantum system. Isotope information storage and isotope quantum computers are briefly discussed. The review concludes with an outline of the main features of isotope physics in solids, and avenues for future research and applications. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In collisions with helium, the ions were first thermalised at room temperature or cooled to -65°C in an ion trap before injection into an ion storage ring. Delayed dissociation of photoexcited ions was measured, and the kinetics were found to be non-trivial. The time spectrum obtained after 390 nm photoexcitation was not a single exponential decay normally observed for the dissociation of ions with a narrow energy distribution. We consider two interpretations of the time spectrum, either a multiple-exponential decay or a power-law decay. The physical implication of a multiple-exponential decay requires the presence of at least three isomers that interconvert slowly on the timescale for dissociation. In contrast, a power-law model implies a broad internal energy distribution of the excited ions. The origin of a broad distribution is, however, not obvious since we believe the width of the distribution to be narrow before excitation, about 0.1 eV, and TTF•+ is non-fluorescent. We, therefore, discard the power-law model in favour of the multiple-isomer model. The dominant dissociation reaction at low internal energies is loss of SCH as measured in collision-induced dissociation experiments and fragmentation of metastable ions. We suggest that excited TTF•+ rearranges via local minima on the potential energy surface to higher-energy isomers either before or after the photoexcitation. Isomerisation may be entropy-driven, which reduces the rate for reverse reactions to prevent equilibrium before the dissociation step. DFT calculations were applied in the search for possible structures of isomers. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Body weight, food intake, respiratory quotient, and heat production (indirect calorimetry), and gastric emptying (14C breath test) were compared between ghrelin+/+ and ghrelin-/- mice. In both strains, the effect of exogenous ghrelin on gastric emptying and food intake was determined. Ghrelin-/- mice showed some subtle phenotypic changes. Body weight gain and 24-h food intake were not affected, but interruption of the normal light/dark cycle triggered additional food intake in old ghrelin+/+ but not in ghrelin-/- mice. Exogenous ghrelin increased food intake in both genotypes with a bell-shaped dose-response curve that was shifted to the left in ghrelin-/- mice. During the dark period, young ghrelin-/- mice had a lower respiratory quotient, whereas their heat production was higher than that of the wild-type littermates, inferring a leaner body composition of the ghrelin-/- mice. Absence of ghrelin did not affect gastric emptying, and the bell-shaped dose-response curves of the acceleration of gastric emptying by exogenous ghrelin were not shifted between both strains. In conclusion, ghrelin is not an essential regulator of food intake and gastric emptying, but its loss may be compensated by other redundant inputs. In old mice, meal initiation triggered by the light/dark cue may be related to ghrelin. In young animals, ghrelin seems to be involved in the selection of energy stores and in the partitioning of metabolizable energy between storage and dissipation as heat.

It is proposed that Rydberg Matter (RM) clusters containing Na and K atoms are the main part of the alkali atmospheres of the Moon and Mercury, forming large clouds. RM clusters are studied in the laboratory with laser fragmentation and laser spectroscopy methods. Due to the very large collision cross sections of Rydberg atoms and RM clusters, the atmospheres are not collision free, as normally assumed based on the low densities of free alkali atoms. The non-escaping radial density variation for the Na atoms, observed, e.g., on the Moon, and the Maxwellian velocity distributions observed on Mercury are caused by a true atmosphere with collisional equilibration; this process is not possible in an exosphere. Fast alkali atoms are released from the RM clusters already at large heights by solar photons and charged particle impact. The kinetic temperatures derived for the atmospheres agree with the quantized energy release. The cluster model predicts that the rate of loss from the surface is much smaller than for a purely atomic model, since the transient storage is in the RM cluster form in the atmosphere and not at the surface. The conductance of the atmosphere is of the order of 100 S due to the facile collisional ionization of the RM clusters. The apparent depletion of K in the atmosphere of Mercury is explained. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

There is no leakage of palmitic acid even when it is in melt state. Therefore, these composite blends are called shape-stabilized phase change materials and they have utility advantage of without encapsulation in passive solar latent heat thermal energy storage application.

This algorithm is based on the Conventional Self Consistent Field (CSCF) method and it presents two main innovations. The first one is the use of a bit map for the control of the 2e- integrals evaluated and previously stored in disk. The bit map reduces disk demand significantly when storing 2e- integrals. The second innovation is the use of i-loop balancing, a new proposal for static workload distribution through the nodes. The i-loop balancing optimizes parallelism in GAMESS, reducing an important sequential portion of its source code. The results obtained confirm a reduction of up to 49% in the disk demand for the 2e- integrals storage, considering different simulated molecules on a 13-node Beowulf cluster and 6-31G and STO-6G basis set. The total and CPU times stay below the times obtained with the GAMESS CSCF method for larger molecules. The total execution and CPU times were equivalent at the CSCF times for smaller molecules. The results show an improvement in the GAMESS scalability as well as a better cost vs. benefit relationship when executing the program. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The revolution speed was 250 rpm and the milling time was 2 h. The sample Mg-10 wt% Fe2O3, prepared by milling at the weight ratio of sample to ball 1/45, has the best hydrogen-storage properties. It absorbs 5.56 wt% hydrogen at the first cycle at 593 K under 12 bar H2 for 60 min. Its activation is accomplished after two hydriding-dehydriding cycles. The activated sample absorbs 4.26 wt% hydrogen at 593 K, 12 bar H2 for 10 min. The reactive grinding of Mg with Fe 2O3 increases the H2-sorption rates by facilitating nucleation (by creating defects on the surface of the Mg particles and by the additive), by making cracks on the surface of Mg particles and reducing the particle size of Mg and thus by shortening the diffusion distances of hydrogen atoms. Hydriding-dehydriding cycling also increases the H 2-sorption rates by creating defects on the surface of the Mg particles, and by making cracks on the surface of Mg particles and reducing the particle size of Mg. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

It has been found that hydrolysis reaction of Mg and Mg-Ni composite, both obtained by high-energy ball milling, is faster and extensive when they are immersed in 1 M KCl. In contrast, milled Mg and Mg-Ni composite in pure water, MgH2 and MgH2-Ni composites in pure water and in 1 M KCl show low yield and reactivity. Hydrolysis kinetics and yield are maximum with Mg-10 at% Ni composite milled for 30 min, so reaction is fully completed within an hour in the presence of chloride ions. It is related to the creation of micro-galvanic cells between Mg and dispersed Ni elements, accentuating greatly Mg corrosion in highly conductive aqueous media. A significant increase of the H2 production is also observed with 30 min milled Mg sample, likely because of the accentuation in the pitting corrosion resulting from the creation of numerous defects and fresh surfaces through the milling process. On the other hand, intensive ball milling of pure magnesium has no effect on the Mg reactivity in pure water. Ball milling effect is likely masked by the significant Mg passivation in pure water. A correlation is established between the conversion yield of ball-milled MgH2 powder in pure water and its effective surface area, which is increased by the milling process. Ni addition has no effect on the hydrolysis reaction in nonconductive media (i.e. pure water) and with nonconductive material (i.e. MgH2). © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

The developed model is suitable for determining control strategy that will ensure efficient and reliable operation of the electrolyzer. Moreover, the dynamic model can be integrated with renewable energy systems models to design, analyze and optimize sustainable energy systems.

The microstructures and electrochemical performances of the as-cast and quenched alloys were analyzed and measured. The effects of B, Cr, Ti and rapid quenching on the microstructures and electrochemical properties of the alloys were investigated in detail. The obtained results show that the as-cast and quenched alloys are composed of the (La, Mg)Ni3 phase (PuNi3-type structure) and the LaNi5 phase as well as the small amount of the LaNi2 phase. A trace of the Ni2B phase exists in the as-cast alloy containing boron, and the Ni2B phase in the alloy nearly disappears after rapid quenching. The relative amount of each phase in the alloys depends on the composition of the alloys and the quenching rate. The addition of B, Cr enhances the cycle stability of the as-cast alloys, while the addition of Ti reduces the cycle stability of the as-cast alloy. The addition of B, Cr, Ti decreases the discharge capacities of the alloys. Rapid quenching increase the cycle lives of the alloys, but the effect of rapid quenching on the discharge capacity of the alloys is different. Except the alloy containing boron, the capacities of the alloys decrease monotonously with the increase of the quenching rate. The capacity of the alloy containing boron has a maximum value with the increase of the quenching rate. The as-cast and quenched alloys have an excellent activation performance. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The process is based on the molecular dissociation of the gas into different ionized species, such as H+ and H2+. The plasma was generated applying a pulsed voltage in an atmosphere of methane. The efficiency of the system was optimized by adjusting the frequency of the pulsed plasma aiming at maximum selectivity to hydrogen. The reforming of natural gas was accompanied by the simultaneous storage of hydrogen in a hollow cathode set-up made of titanium. Hydrogen contents higher than 900 ppm (in weight%) were stored in the Ti cathode. The efficiency of the method was compatible to industrial applications. Pyrolitic carbon condensed on the lower walls of the reactor but did not interfere with the kinetics of hydrogen absorption. In fact, the carbon produced in such manner could be considered a byproduct of the process and can be used as natural gas adsorbent once adequately activated. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Their equilibrium structures have been determined based on the calculated relative stabilities of hydrogen occupation sites in LaNi 4Al and the rule of H-H separation to be no less than 0.21 nm, as well as the full geometry optimization. The covalency and ionicity analysis shows that the interaction between H and Ni is covalent and ionic; between H and La mainly ionic; between H and Al for x = 1, 2, 3 and 4 mainly ionic and for x = 4.5, 5 and 7 both covalent and ionic. The change of BOH-Nis(orIonicityH-Las) with x can be a phenomenological indication of the experimental phase transformation for hydrogen solubility in LaNi4Al. The comparison of the calculated stability of hydrogen at interstices in LaNi4Al and LaNi5 shows that the possible hydrogen occupation sites in LaNi4Al are fewer than those in LaNi 5. This contributes to the decrease of hydrogen storage capacity for LaNi4Al, which is illustrated by comparing the electron density distribution of LaNi4AlH7 with LaNi5H 7. Except for H-H repulsions, the change of absorption energy with hydrogen content, arising from the fact that an H atom tends to keep away from an Al atom, elucidates the limited maximum hydrogen content in LaNi 4Al. © 2005 Acta Materialia Inc.

Their characteristics change strongly according to the frequency, temperature, and aging time. These last two parameters are generally not taken into account in electrical simulation software. To realize these precise simulations, we propose to determine parameters of an electrical model of electrolytic capacitor by using the genetic algorithm method. This identification was carried out for a large electrolytic capacitor with rated value of 4,700 μF/500 V. The comparison between measurements and model for different temperatures and aging times gives good results. The model shown in this paper has a precision that is much better than a standard model for temperatures lower than 0°C. But this model does not comprise too many elements, which allows it to be integrated easily in simulation software.","Electrolytic capacitor; Genetic algorithm; Modeling; Predictive maintenance; Simulation","Computer simulation; Computer software; Electrolytes; Energy storage; Genetic algorithms; Power electronics; Temperature distribution; Electrolytic capacitor; Predictive maintenance; Standard models; Storage functions; Capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28844465318

Desert areas are characterized by large land availability, with high levels of solar radiation and wind. However, apart from generating costs (which should fall down in future), two main problems have to be faced. First, fluctuations of renewable power availability may lead to electric grid instability, reducing the quality of energy supply. Second, since deserts are typically far from energy-demanding areas, large power transport lines are needed. The system proposed in this paper resorts to the use of liquid hydrogen (LH2) for energy storage, and to the combined transport of electric energy and LH2 with a MgB2 superconducting line. The system allows flexible delivering of energy in electric and chemical form, depending on end-users demands. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Coloured waters were treated in continuous at low current density, to reduce the electrical consumption. Ti/PtOx electrodes were used to oxidize simulated dyebaths prepared with an azo/dichlorotriazine reactive dye (C.I. Reactive Orange 4). The decolourisation yield was dependent on the dyeing electrolyte (NaCl or Na2SO4). Dyeing effluents which contained from 0.5 to 20 g l-1 of NaCl reached a high decolourisation yield, depending on the current density, immediately after the electrochemical process. These results were improved when the effluents were stored for several hours under solar light. After the electrochemical treatment the effluents were stored in a tank and exposed under different lighting conditions: UV light, solar light and darkness. The evolution of the decolourisation versus the time of storage was reported and kinetic constants were calculated. The time of storage was significantly reduced by the application of UV light. A dye mineralization study was also carried out on a concentrated dyebath. A TOC removal of 81% was obtained when high current density was applied for a prolonged treatment with recirculation.

To account for the limitation of accurately installing sensors within the heterogeneous and porous ballast bulk, the heat fluxes were calculated from four different methods to compare their variability, dynamics and shortcomings. Ground heat fluxes were gathered from 1) a heat flux plate with the inclusion of heat storage between the soil surface and the heat flux plate, 2) temperature gradient measurements with correction for heat storage, 3) temperature gradient measurements with a modelled surface temperature and a laboratory derived thermal conductivity, 4) as residual from the surface energy balance equation. The results show a distinct deviation of the four methods for absolute values of the ground heat flux as well as for temporal dynamics on the diurnal cycle. As indicated by the temporal dynamics of the ground heat flux times series and a simple error analysis of the four methods, the most plausible estimates for an urban application in a heterogeneous ballast layer were obtained by temperature gradient measurements between the surface and 0.05m. Overall, the results indicate that accurate ground heat flux measurements in urban applications still prove difficult to acquire. © Springer-Verlag/Wien 2005.",,"ground-based measurement; heat flux; heat island; urban atmosphere; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Lower Saxony; Osnabruck",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28044469651

Inelastic neutron scattering experiments in combination with lattice dynamics calculations are used to study the phonon properties as well as thermodynamic properties of several novel compounds. There is a large variation in the thermal expansion, specific heat and equation of state pertaining to the compounds described in this review. The interatomic potentials as determined for various compounds have been able to successfully model the thermodynamic behavior. Lattice dynamical calculations and high pressure inelastic neutron scattering experiments indicate that large softening of several low energy phonons is mainly responsible for the negative thermal expansion in ZrW2O8, HfW2O8 and ZrMo2O8 up to 1443, 1050 and 600 K, respectively. It has been shown that a proper description of negative thermal expansion requires consideration of both the acoustic and optic phonon modes in the entire Brillouin zone. We have also reviewed studies on X-ray image storage materials MFX (M = Ba, Pb, Sr; X = Cl, Br, I); compounds MPO4 (M = Al, Fe and Ga); several garnet minerals M3Al2Si3O 12 (M = Fe, Mg, Ca and Mn) and zircon (ZrSiO4). The variations in phonon spectra manifest in the thermodynamic properties of these compounds at high pressure and temperature. The calculations enable predictions and microscopic interpretation of the thermal expansion, specific heat and the equation of state. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This power system is robust and reliable but the efficiency of power generation is low, resulting in large quantities of waste heat. The principal aim of this paper is to investigate an alternative concept: the energy production by small scale generators in close proximity to the energy users, integrated into microgrids. Microgrids - de-centralised electricity generation combined with on-site production of heat - bear the promise of substantial environmental benefits, brought about by a higher energy efficiency and by facilitating the integration of renewable sources such as photovoltaic arrays or wind turbines. By virtue of good match between generation and load, microgrids have a low impact on the electricity network, despite a potentially significant level of generation by intermittent energy sources. The paper discusses the technical and economic issues associated with this novel concept, giving an overview of the generator technologies, the current regulatory framework in the UK, and the barriers that have to be overcome if microgrids are to make a major contribution to the UK energy supply. The focus of this study is a microgrid of domestic users powered by small Combined Heat and Power generators and photovoltaics. Focusing on the energy balance between the generation and load, it is found that the optimum combination of the generators in the microgrid- consisting of around 1.4 kWp PV array per household and 45% household ownership of micro-CHP generators- will maintain energy balance on a yearly basis if supplemented by energy storage of 2.7 kWh per household. We find that there is no fundamental technological reason why microgrids cannot contribute an appreciable part of the UK energy demand. Indeed, an estimate of cost indicates that the microgrids considered in this study would supply electricity at a cost comparable with the present electricity supply if the current support mechanisms for photovoltaics were maintained. Combining photovoltaics and micro-CHP and a small battery requirement gives a microgrid that is independent of the national electricity network. In the short term, this has particular benefits for remote communities but more wide-ranging possibilities open up in the medium to long term. Microgrids could meet the need to replace current generation nuclear and coal fired power stations, greatly reducing the demand on the transmission and distribution network. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This study focuses on the evaluation of heat transfer enhancement in phase change energy storage units. The experiments are performed using spherical capsules filled with paraffin wax and metal beads. The experiments are conducted by inserting a single spherical capsule filled with wax and metal beads in a stream of hot/cold air. Experimental measurements include the temperature field within the spherical capsule and in the air stream. To determine the enhancement effects of the metal beads, the measured data is correlated against those for a spherical capsule filled with pure wax. Data analysis shows a reduction of 15% in the melting and solidification times upon increasing the number and diameter of the metal beads. This reduction is caused by a similar decrease in the thermal load of the sphere due to replacement of the wax by metal beads. The small size of the spherical capsule limits the enhancement effects; this is evident upon comparison of the heat transfer in a larger size, double pipe energy storage unit, where 2% of the wax volume is replaced with metal inserts, result in a three fold reduction in the melting/solidification time and a similar enhancement in the heat transfer rate. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of relative humidity, scanning rate, scanning area on friction is concerned. The JKRS (Johnson-Kendall-Roberts) theory considering the energy of adhesion between tip and GeSb 2Te4 (at.%) film is introduced. Experimental results indicate that high humidity leads to high adhesive force, low humidity to low adhesion. When the tip's surface energy is unchanged, minute change of surface energy of GeSb2Te4 film will affect the adhesive force. Experiment also shows that variance of friction level goes unanimous at the different scanning area and the same normal load. Next, the effect of scanning rate on friction is attributed to the surface absorbate and liquid film. Finally, it suggests that relative humidity and protective coating should be considered for the promising ultra-high density probe storage medium. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The main goal is to design an autonomous, environmentally sustainable and zero emission power system using commercially available equipment. In order to achieve the optimum cost effective solution, its limitations are defined by simulating its performance over a year. A scenario is chosen which is representative of an area with significant wind potential, where the grid connection is relatively long or the construction of the line itself would irretrievably harm the environment. This study simulated the operation of a small, remote hotel primarily powered by a wind turbine and supported by a hydrogen energy system incorporating a medium pressure electrolyzer, a compressed hydrogen gas storage unit and a PEM fuel cell stack. The simulated load is biased towards a particular season as in the case of a small hotel for summer holidays. This arrangement takes advantage of the long period of low load during the ""off peak"" season, which enables the production of reserves of hydrogen to supplement the wind generated electricity during the ""peak"" season, avoiding the use of a large electrolyzer system, which is the most expensive and vulnerable component. The simulation results showed that for this particular system, a wind turbine rated at four times the peak load power associated with the optimum combination of an electrolyzer and a hydrogen storage unit would meet the electrical energy needs of a 10 bedroom, non-luxury hotel under the supervision of a load management controller. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The qualities of twelve biodiesel samples, which were divided into 3 groups and stored at different temperatures and environments, were monitored at regular interval over a period of 52 weeks. Experimental results demonstrated that the biodiesel under test degraded less than 10% within 52 weeks for those samples stored at 4 and 20°C while nearly 40% degradation was found for those samples stored at a higher temperature, i.e. 40°C. The results suggested that high temperature, together with air exposure, greatly increase the biodiesel degradation rate. The temperature or air exposure alone, however, had little effect on biodiesel degradation. Water content in biodiesel will enhance biodiesel degradation due to hydrolysis but its effect is much less than the above two factors. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling of the problems is introduced in the paper. A comprehensive computer program is completed, embodying 3 main modules corresponding to the 3 methods. The results of a computation example show that there are obvious differences between the 3 methods. The least initial investment in TES is obtained by the existing method, and the maximum energy saving results from the 2nd method, while the minimum LCC method is the most economic in over the life cycle. The program is useful in obtaining basic data necessary for decision making at the design stages of TES projects. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The novel model is drawn based on the simulation results, using 8-year long measured hour-by-hour wind speed data from five different locations throughout the world. The simulation program simulates the battery state of voltage (SoV) and is able to predict the wind fraction for a period of time, typically monthly or yearly. The yearly wind fraction values obtained from the simulations are plotted against the ratio of energy to load for various battery storage capacities to obtain wind fraction curves. The novel method correlates the yearly wind fraction with the parameters of the Weibull distribution function, thus, offering a general methodology. The yearly wind fraction curves are mathematically represented using a 2-parameter model. The novel algorithm is validated by comparing the simulated wind fraction values with those calculated from the simplified algorithm. The standard error of estimation of the WF from the simplified algorithm is further presented for each battery capacity. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Fat was partially substituted by β-glucan at levels of 25, 50, and 75% which were referred to as 25B, 50B, or 75B formulations, respectively. The full fat (FF) (100% oil) mayonnaise without β-glucan substitution was used as a control experiment. Physicochemical, rheological, and microbiological analyses, and sensory evaluation of the FF and reduced fat (RF) mayonnaises were performed. The results indicated that all RF mayonnaises had significantly lower energy content, but higher water content than their FF counterpart and these differences increased with increasing substitution levels of β-glucan. With regard to pH, there were no significant differences between the FF and RF mayonnaises after one-day storage. However, pH values of the RF samples decreased with an increasing degree of substitution after 2 months storage. In terms of texture, the 50B and 75B formulations showed similar firmness and adhesiveness values as those of the FF sample. Microstructure analysis showed close packing structures of large droplets for the FF and 25B and loose structures of a network of aggregated small droplets for the 50B and 75B samples. Both FF and RF mayonnaises exhibited thixothopic shear thinning behaviour under steady shear tests and were rheologically classified as weak gels under small amplitude oscillatory shear tests. Microbial loadings of all mayonnaises tested were in the acceptable limit throughout the storage time. The RF mayonnaises exhibited higher storage stability than the FF sample. Sensory evaluation demonstrated that mayonnaises substituted with β-glucan of not more than 50% were acceptable. This study shows good potential for spent brewer's yeast β-glucan to be used as a fat replacer in mayonnaise. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

At low temperature (5°C), the encapsulated oil and bulk oil, as reference, showed little oxidation which, moreover, could be accounted for by the oxygen dissolved in the oil. At intermediate temperatures (25 and 45°C), oxidation exceeded the level corresponding to dissolved oxygen and became dependent on oxygen transport through the matrix. At high temperature (60°C), a rapid, linear increase in peroxide concentration was followed by an autocatalytic phase with a rapid increase in peroxides, subsequently reaching a steady-state concentration. The oxidation of the encapsulated oil was found to have a lower energy of activation (around 60 kJ/mol) than the bulk oil (around 80 kJ/mol), resulting in a protection of the encapsulated oil at higher temperatures. However, the temperature-dependence of the zeroth order rate constants for initial peroxide formation in the encapsulated oil showed a shift from a rate determining reaction at low temperature with a high energy of activation to a reaction at higher temperature with a smaller energy of activation, especially for the encapsulated oil without initiator added. At low temperature, lipid oxidation seems rate-determining while, at higher temperature, oxygen permeation through the matrix with a lower energy of activation becomes rate-determining. The glassy matrix yields only partly protection against lipid oxidation as it allows permeation of oxygen and other small molecules, as further confirmed by the effect of a hydrophilic radical initiator, incorporated in the matrix, on peroxide value of the encapsulated oil. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditionally fossil fuel has been the prime source of energy. However, there are two major concerns regarding fossil fuels, i.e. their rapid depletion and their contribution towards growing global warming. It is being widely realized that for sustainable development presently used energy mediums such as fossil fuel and nuclear power have to be quickly replaced by renewable energy sources. The latter are sustainable and have the potential to meet present and future projected global energy demands without inflicting any environmental impacts. Pakistan is amongst the most prominent cotton producing countries in the world. The affluent availability of local cotton has lead to a well-established textile sector in Pakistan. A large proportion of its cotton products go into export. Being a successful candidate in international textile market Pakistani textile industry is continuously seeking modern and high-tech facilities to improve quality of its products. The biggest challenge Pakistani textile industry is facing today is how to cut down its environmental burdens to cope with the international standards on the issue. Water heating system as required for dying process is one of the major energy consuming areas in fossil fuel-run Pakistani textile industry. Water heating system therefore has a significant contribution towards total environmental impacts associated with textile sector. This work presents an alternate, sustainable solution for water heating by means of fossil fuel. It has been shown herein that under Pakistan's climate solar energy can contribute significantly towards this duty. In the present work two different designs of built-in storage water heater - plain and newly designed finned type - were constructed to compare their thermal performance. Three months of experimental data were collected for the two heaters. The solar fractions for this period were found to be 63 and 73%, respectively. The monetary and embodied energy payback periods for the two heaters were, respectively, found to be 6.7 and 6.1 years, and 185 and 169 days. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
