Since robots do not posses self-consciousness, estimation of adequate grasping force for individual objects by robots or manipulators is another challenge for wider applications of robots and manipulators. This article suggests a mathematical model, recently developed, for computation of scattered energy of vibrations sensed by the stylus during an object slippage in robot grippers. The model includes in it dynamic parameters like trial grasping force, object falling velocity, and geometry of object surface irregularities. It is envisaged that using the said mathematical model, with the help of robust decision making capabilities of artificial neural network (NN), a robot memory could be able to estimate appropriate/optimal grasping force for an object considering its physiomechanical properties. On the basis of above mentioned mathematical model, this article demonstrates an experimental methodology of estimating adequate grasping forces of an object by robot grippers using Backpropagation (BP) neural networks. Four different algorithms have been explored to experiment the optimal grasping force estimation. © 2008 IEEE.","Backpropagation; Grasping force; Neural networks; Object grasping; Robot; Scattered energy of vibration; Slip detection","Backpropagation; Functions; Grippers; Manipulators; Mathematical models; Mechatronics; Modal analysis; Object recognition; Random access storage; Robotics; Robots; Vegetation; Artificial neural networks; Backpropagation neural networks; Dynamic parameters; Experimental methodologies; Falling velocities; Grasping force; Individual objects; Industrial environments; Object grasping; Object surfaces; Optimal grasping forces; Physiomechanical properties; Pick and places; Robot grippers; Scattered energy of vibration; Slip detection; Neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049129060

The output of the transducer is a strong and irregular function of | time hence, to obtain a suitable supply source, an AC-DC conversion is needed. Classical rectifiers (half/full bridge or voltage doubler) with an output storage capacitor do not fit very well, since they work as peak detectors, converting only input voltages which are higher than their output voltage. The paper shows an electronic interface which is able to efficiently harvest the energy associated to the randomic voltage waveform delivered by a piezoelectric transducer. Its working principle is based on an inductive step-up converter; an active driving circuit is used to set the phases of the converter. The energy is stored into a capacitor which is also used to supply the active elements of the step-up converter, realizing a completely autonomous energy scavenging system. For this reason the whole circuitry has been designed with a very low-power consumptions, about 700 nA.

Inspired by human running, the flight phase is assumed to be nearly-passive. Consequently, the initial joint velocities of the flight phase can be solved by using a static optimization procedure, provided that the boundary joint angles have been picked in advance. The two hopping phases can then be dynamically optimized, with the velocity jumps of the joints predicted by a simple collision model. The direct single shooting method solves the nonlinear constrained optimization problem. Ground reaction forces and the Zero-Moment-Point serve as constraints.

For the first method, assuming a partly known environment, the information gain is estimated by applying the ray tracing algorithm to the known part of the environment. For the second method, the new information gain is calculated using polygon clipping in an unknown environment. Simulation results in a typical rough agricultural field showed that the exploration strategy, which was incorporated with energy consumption and the information gain estimation with a ray tracing algorithm using a coarse map, had an advantage over other polices in terms of energy consumption and the path length. © 2008 IEEE.","Coverage path planning; Dijkstra shortest path; Energy cost; Exploration; Rough environment","Conformal mapping; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Elementary particle sources; Mechatronics; Random access storage; Robotics; Three dimensional; Wireless sensor networks; Coverage path planning; Dijkstra shortest path; Energy cost; Exploration; Rough environment; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049084352

However the vulnerable deployment environment of CWSN challenge the data aggregation in terms of data privacy and resiliency. If a node or a group of nodes are compromised or the sensing environment is manipulated by an adversary, the aggregation result will be changed easily. Therefore, it is essential to design a resilient data aggregation scheme with data privacy and security guarantees. This paper proposes a scheme that provides privacy-preserving data fusion, and tolerate data disruption and node compromise as well. We make use of subgroup within each cluster to improve the resiliency against node compromise; and we employ a novel encryption algorithm that support secure comparison between concealed data, which will be further used for density mining against the manipulating data disruption. The simulation results show that this scheme can preserve relatively accurate average aggregation with malicious data filtering. And the mathematical evaluation and comparison show better effectiveness and fitness of our scheme for CWSN in terms of fault tolerance and process efficiency than the previous data aggregation schemes. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Administrative data processing; Cryptography; Data privacy; Fault tolerance; Hybrid sensors; Information management; Management information systems; Quality assurance; Reliability; Routing protocols; Semiconductor storage; Sensor networks; Sensors; Wireless telecommunication systems; Data aggregations; Data filtering; Data streams; Encryption algorithms; Node compromises; Privacy and securities; Process efficiencies; Save energies; Simulation results; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57949116440

But the essential condition is the availability of modular high energy density pulsed power supply units with low volume and weight. During the last years modular structured energy packs have been built up at ISL as a basic installation for various applications in the field of pulsed power electronics, in particular they are developed to feed active protection launcher systems. Each power supply module comprises one energy storage capacitor, a thyristor stack, a corresponding number of crow-bar diodes and a well-designed coaxial power line serving as a pulse forming network and current limiting reactor. To provide high flexibility these modules can be triggered separately and independently by fiber optic transmitters with an overall jitter lower than 50 ns. The paper presented describes the basic design of a 50 kJ energy pack and the further developed set-up with a strongly reduced overall height obtained by using a novel multichip thyristor.

Although the series PHEV topology has been recently targeted as the prime choice for PHEV applications, it is unclear as to whether or not it is indeed the most efficient option. This paper models PHEVs in both series and parallel structures by using the forward/backward modeling method, to determine the most efficient drive train architecture for future PHEV applications. In general, the drive train efficiency can be simply yielded out by calculating the losses at each power stage in a series or parallel drive train structure. However, the power component stage-based analysis is a practically deficient method. In order to have a fair efficiency comparison, some parameters that directly affect fuel consumption, such as drive train mass and different control strategies should also be taken into consideration. This paper aims at modeling both the series and parallel PHEV drive trains, and further computing and comparing their absolute drive train efficiencies. Furthermore, the resultant ESS charging profiles, discharging profiles, as well as roundtrip efficiencies are calculated and studied. © 2008 IEEE.","Batteries; Efficiency; Electric vehicle; Energy storage; Land vehicle; Modeling; Simulation","Applications; Automobiles; Control theory; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Flywheels; Fuzzy control; Locomotives; Propulsion; Railroad cars; Secondary batteries; Batteries; Control strategies; Drive trains; Energy storage systems; Hybrid Electric Vehicles; Land vehicle; Modeling; Modeling methods; Paper models; Parallel structures; Power components; Power stages; Roundtrip efficiencies; Simulation; Suitability analyses; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849106763

The vertical beam divergence from the X-ray source is reduced significantly by a collimating mirror. Subsequently the beam is selectively monochromated by a double Si(111) crystal monochromator with high energy resolution (E/E 2 10-4) in the energy range 5-23 keV, or by a double Mo/B4C multilayer monochromator for 10-30 times higher flux (1011 photons s-1) in the 6-15 keV range. These two monochromators are incorporated into one rotating cradle for fast exchange. The monochromated beam is focused by a toroidal mirror with 1:1 focusing for a small beam divergence and a beam size of 0.9 mm 0.3 mm (horizontal vertical) at the focus point located 26.5 m from the radiation source. A plane mirror installed after the toroidal mirror is selectively used to deflect the beam downwards for grazing-incidence SAXS (GISAXS) from liquid surfaces. Two online beam-position monitors separated by 8 m provide an efficient feedback control for an overall beam-position stability in the 10 m range. The beam features measured, including the flux density, energy resolution, size and divergence, are consistent with those calculated using the ray-tracing program SHADOW. With the deflectable beam of relatively high energy resolution and high flux, the new beamline meets the requirements for a wide range of SAXS applications, including anomalous SAXS for multiphase nanoparticles (e.g. semiconductor core-shell quantum dots) and GISAXS from liquid surfaces. © International Union of Crystallography 2009.","Double-crystal monochromator; Double-multilayer monochromator; SAXS; Superconducting wiggler; X-ray beamline","Electric conductivity; Magnetic fields; Magnetic storage; Mirrors; Monochromators; Multilayers; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Scattering; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Semiconductor quantum dots; Superconducting magnets; Superconductivity; X ray scattering; X rays; Double-crystal monochromator; Double-multilayer monochromator; SAXS; Superconducting wiggler; X-ray beamline; Wigglers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849093142

In this paper, we present a new sensor routing scheme that provides power-centric data delivery from sensors to the home base station. The proposed scheme divides the home into areas such as rooms and deploys relay nodes to each area. The WENs collect data from the sensors and deliver the data only to the home base station. Sensors deliver their data to the relay nodes or the home base station through the sensor with the strongest power. The performance results show that the proposed scheme is more efficient in wireless home networks than existing schemes. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Data deliveries; Energy-efficient; Home environments; Home networks; Hop counts; Life-times; OF sensors; Performance analyses; Performance results; Power capacities; Relay nodes; Sensor nodes; Sensor routing; Transmission ranges; Two types; Wireless home networks; Administrative data processing; Base stations; Carrier communication; Computer networks; Consumer electronics; Data fusion; Domestic appliances; Electric network synthesis; Energy efficiency; Information management; Local area networks; Management information systems; Personal communication systems; Routing algorithms; Routing protocols; Semiconductor storage; Sensor data fusion; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849155343

To accomplish target detection and localization data from more then three sensors which receive signals from moving targets, measure RSSI, and translate RSSI into the distance between sensor and target. All this process involves more sensor and energy consumption. Where as the energy is a critical resource in wireless sensor networks and network lifetime needs to be long-drawn-out through the use of energy-conscious sensing strategies during system operations. We introduce an efficient-localization algorithm using only one sensor and auto controlling the transmission rage of its one hope neighbor sensors. Algorithm provides the precise location of the target by using signal strength and velocity of the object. It takes minimum resources of networks, which makes the network prolong. Our approach ETCTR adopt the multicasting for transmission settlement rather then broad casting that minimize the communication cost of the network.

Distinguishing with the radio frequency (RF) communication for the terrestrial wireless sensor networks, the peculiarity of acoustic communication in underwater environment causes many issues of energy consumption, propagation delay, time synchronization and other factors when designing the sensor network. Moreover, the high propagation delay (about 1 second over 1.5 km) causes a serious problem for the MAC protocol. In this paper, we proposed a new MAC protocol called Efficiency Reservation MAC (ERMAC) protocol which is suitable for the peculiarity of acoustic communication in underwater environment.

In contrast to recent DFT calculations (Lee et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2006, 97, 56104-56107) that have shown a multiple number of molecular hydrogen chemisorption on Ti-decorated PANI, only 0.52 D2 molecules per Ti atomically adsorb on Ti-deposited PANI at 87 K at a nominal Ti coverage of 2 ML. Broad TPD spectra of D2, HD, and H2 were observed, which showed a common peak at 250 K and another isotope-dependent peak at higher temperature. Ti deposited on TiO 2 forms clusters with a size distribution at 87 K, on which D 2 atomically adsorbs. As the Ti coverage increases, the D2 desorption peak gradually shifts from 200 to 260 K and the number of D 2 molecules adsorbed per Ti also increases from 0.26 at 0.1 ML to 0.87 at 2 ML. We attribute this to the fact that D2 adsorbs on larger clusters with a greater adsorption energy. TPD spectra of D2 desorbing from Ti (2 ML)/PANI and Ti (1 ML)/TiO2 look very similar to each other. This led us to conclude that Ti also adsorbs on PANI in clusters. We suggest that no molecular D2 adsorption on Ti/PANI at 87 K is due to a reduced electron backdonation ability of Ti upon clustering. The small number of adsorbed D2 per Ti on both substrates was ascribed to irreversible D2 adsorption only on relatively large Ti clusters, while D2 adsorbs reversibly on small clusters. This was indirectly confirmed by the observation that continuous H2-D2 isotope exchange occurs to produce HD on Ti/PANI as well as on Ti/TiO2 at 106 K in a high pressure cell at 5.7 mTorr. Desorption mechanisms involving H atom abstraction from PANI by Ti clusters are proposed to account for the complex isotope-dependent TPD spectra. Implication of the present results for hydrogen storage based on Ti-dispersed polymers is briefly addressed. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Atomic spectroscopy; Auger electron spectroscopy; Chemisorption; Desorption; Flow interactions; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Isotopes; Polyaniline; Sulfur compounds; Temperature programmed desorption; Adsorption energies; Atom abstractions; Desorption mechanisms; Desorption peaks; DFT calculations; Dispersed polymers; High pressure cells; Higher temperatures; Isotope exchanges; Molecular hydrogens; Small clusters; Titanium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149145423

Previous offline evaluations show that this urban module is able to simulate in good behavior road, wall, and roof temperatures and to correctly partition radiation forcing into turbulent and storage heat fluxes. However, to improve prediction of the meteorological fields inside the street canyon, a new version has been developed, following the methodology described in a companion paper by Masson and Seity. It resolves the surface boundary layer inside and above urban canopy by introducing a drag force approach to account for the vertical effects of buildings. This new version is tested offline, with one-dimensional simulation, in a street canyon using atmospheric and radiation data recorded at the top of a 30-m-high tower as the upper boundary conditions. Results are compared with simulations using the original single-layer version of the Town Energy Balance module on one hand and with measurements within and above a street canyon on the other hand. Measurements were obtained during the intensive observation period of the Basel Urban Boundary Layer Experiment. Results show that this new version produces profiles of wind speed, friction velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent heat flux, and potential temperature that are more consistent with observations than with the single-layer version.

IGCC can operate on a multi-fuel basis (coal/petroleum coke/refinery waste) and facilitate the use of coal to produce valuable products beyond electricity generation. Hydrogen is one major product of such ""poly-generation."" As a result, IGCC can be seen as a vehicle to introduce the hydrogen economy. Since the first IGCC power plants came into operation in the late 1970s, the more recent installations have matured and potential gains with sophisticated system integration concepts have been evaluated against its practicality during real term operation. The mayor system components have benefited from dedicated Research & Development over the last 2 decades and as a result several recent installations have reached industry standards, which are comparable to other electricity generation equipment. The highly pressurized IGCC gasification process provides the mechanism to effectively capture all key pollutants such as particulates, sulphur, mercury and carbon dioxide, prior to combustion. Pre-combustion capture is more economical than capturing these pollutants in a 'post-combustion' high volume and low concentration flue gas. It is expected that post-combustion clean-up technology will require o long-term development cycle before it is mature enough to be applied to existing coal plants. Even at that point, only a small portion of today's operating coal-fired plants will be able to adapt major retrofit conversions. In addition to the lower overall CO2 footprint, IGCC plants require less water than conventional coal plants do. As a consequence of the highly effective Syngas clean-up process, the remaining gas primarily consists of hydrogen with a concentration of over 80%.

Super-resolution of document images is characterized by bimodality, smoothness along the edges as well as subsampling consistency. These characteristics are enforced in a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework by defining an appropriate energy function. In our method, subsampling of super-resolution image will return the original low-resolution one, proving the correctness of the method.

In this study, the evolution of the back-stress during the ECAE process is analyzed. Two different numerical models were investigated in this respect. The first one is a single crystal strain gradient plasticity model based on dislocation densities. The second model is the Teodosiu and Hu's hardening model, which is a microstructuraly based phenomenological model at the macroscale. The results provided by the two models are obviously distinct.

We also compare these variation trends of cRAT with those of the SRAM-based RAT (sRAT). Having these variation trends is useful during the early stages of architectural exploration where physical level information is not yet available. Compared to sRAT, cRAT is more sensitive to the number of physical registers and issue width, however less sensitive to the number of GCs. We find that when the number of GCs passes a limit, cRAT becomes more efficient than its equivalent sRAT from latency perspective. For instance, with 64 architectural registers and 128 physical registers, this limit is 20 GCs. This work also proposes an energy optimization for the cRAT; this optimization selectively disables cRAT entries that do not result in a match during lookup. The energy savings are, for the most part, a function of the number of physical registers. For instance, for a cRAT with 128 entries energy is reduced by 40%.

Organic liquid H2 carriers that release H2 endothermically are easier to handle with existing infrastructure because they are liquids, but they have low storage densities and their endothermicity consumes energy in the vehicle. On the other hand, inorganic solid H2 carriers that release H2 exothermically have greater storage densities but are unpumpable solids. This paper explores combinations of an endothermic carrier and an exothermic carrier, where the exothermic carrier provides some or all of the necessary heat required for dehydrogenation to the endothermic system, and the endothermic carrier serves as a solvent for the exothermic carrier. The two carriers can be either physically mixed or actually bonded to each other. To test the latter strategy, a number of chemically bound N-heterocycle:BH 3 adducts were synthesized and in turn tested for their ability to release H2 by tandem hydrolysis of the BH3 moiety and dehydrogenation of the heterocycle.

Results: As opposed to males, females showed from early infancy a smaller rate of muscular mass and a larger percentage of body fat (from 10 years of age), with fat deposits being basically gynoid or peripheral. With age, females showed a greater increase in fat mass together with an accelerated loss of muscular mass. Both rates tended to level out between 51 and 65 years of age. Between the ages of 40 and 60, females exhibited significant morphological evidence of larger fat depots in their legs. Conclusions: Gender differences in the patterns of proportion and distribution of body fat, as well as in the pattern of body fat evolution, were found from early infancy.

Also, the paper explains an improvement in the tetrahedral topology to increase the accuracy of the results as well as the efficiency of the overall process.","3D image segmentation; Active models; Deformable models; Topological Active Volumes","Computer vision; Deformation; Digital image storage; Image processing; Image segmentation; Three dimensional computer graphics; Topology; 3D active models; 3D image segmentation; 3D meshes; Active models; Active volumes; Deformable models; Energy functions; Segmentation processes; Segmentation results; Topological Active Volumes; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57349193518

In this paper, a control method allowing the use of a small size dc-link capacitor Co for the cascade of voltage controlled-rectifier/inverter-motor drive system is proposed. This is achieved by adding the power balance equation in the system's model and the application of an exact I/O feedback linearization technique in a way that the rectifier controller compensates any sudden change in the inverter load, which is here an induction motor. Since the exact I/O feedback linearization technique is sensitive to the uncertainties over system parameters, a robust control strategy based on sliding mode controller (SMC) is proposed. By this approach, the dc-link voltage (vdc) becomes almost insensitive to the load variations. As a result, the level of vdc could be stabilized with a small Co. Without any considerations of the RMS current stress on the Co, a calculation method of a minimum dc-link capacitor Co(min) based on its storage energy is proposed. All the investigations are shown by computer simulations and the performance of controlled system is verified by experimentation results. © 2008 IEEE.","Controlled rectifier; I/O linearization technique; Induction motor; Sliding mode control; Small dc-Link capacitor","AC motors; Applications; Capacitance; Capacitors; Computer control systems; Control theory; Dielectric devices; Electric drives; Electric equipment; Electric inverters; Electric motors; Electric rectifiers; Feedback; Induction motors; Linearization; Motors; Robust control; Sliding mode control; Calculation methods; Control methods; Control strategies; Controlled rectifier; Controlled systems; Current stresses; Feedback linearization techniques; I/O linearization technique; Load variations; Motor drive systems; Power balance equations; Sliding mode controllers; Small dc-Link capacitor; Small sizes; Storage energies; Sudden changes; System parameters; Voltage controlled; Feedback linearization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57349165818

Outgassing level is followed during the first seconds of the implantation step and is systematically found under the chamber pressure limit. As well, stopping power efficiency is evaluated. SIMS analysis and simulation tests with SRIM software are performed to define the minimum resist thickness that prevents ions to penetrate the layers underneath. Data indicate that both experimental and simulation tests are in good agreement and that at low energies the stopping layer thickness is found to be in the order or lower than 80 nm. Finally, the impact of implantation step on patterned wafers is carried out. Features of interest are dense and isolated lines with a nominal CD of 130 nm. We control the CD and profile with a standard CD SEM and a CD AFM in order to get access to additional information such as height of the feature, top rounding and the CD through height. Results underline that our patterned resist doesn't show significant degradation under our implant conditions.","ArF and KrF lithography; CD AFM; CD control; Implant; Outgassing; Resist profile; Stopping power","ArF and KrF lithography; CD AFM; CD control; Implant; Outgassing; Resist profile; Stopping power; Access control; Atomic force microscopy; Degassing; Electron beam lithography; Ionization; Krypton; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57349113109

The influence of the urban breeze circulation on the structure and the dynamics of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer is analysed by using ground stations, wind profilers (UHF radar), radio soundings and aircraft data. The IOP5 is a summertime anticyclonic situation with low wind, strong insulation and a deep boundary layer with a sheared wind profile. The temporal and spatial relationship between the Surface Energy Balance (SEB), the diurnal evolution of the surface temperature and the dynamics of the airflow within the mixed layer are studied for urban and rural sites. The vertical and horizontal structure of the urban heat island are analysed from both surface stations and aircraft data. The nocturnal urban heat island reaches 5 °C. In the early morning, the city air becomes 1 °C cooler than in the countryside (due to efficient heat storage and building shade on the city urban canopy), then warmer again (1 °C) in the afternoon, due to negligible evaporation and strong sensible heat flux in the city. The daytime heat island is also present in altitude, being localized above the city centre at 350 m of height (1 °C) and advected to leeward at 1100 m of height (0.5 °C). This diurnal heat island is associated to an urban-breeze circulation characterized by a surface convergence towards the city at low levels and a divergence in upper boundary layer. The urban breeze grows in intensity from 2 m s-1 (at 12.00 UTC) to 5-6 m s-1 (at 18.00 UTC). Aircraft measurements show that the urban breeze horizontal extension is 2 to 3 times larger than the city size. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",,"airflow; atmospheric circulation; boundary layer; energy balance; experimental study; heat island; mixed layer; sensible heat flux; surface temperature; wind profile; Eurasia; Europe; France; Haute Garonne; Midi-Pyrenees; Toulouse; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149394857

Concentrated solar power systems operating in the field of medium temperatures are the main research objectives, directed towards the development of a new and low-cost technology to concentrate the direct radiation and efficiently convert solar energy into high-temperature heat. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-tank sensible-heat storage system is proposed for storing thermal energy, with a two-tanks molten salt system. In the present paper, the typology of a below-grade cone shape storage is taken up, in combination with nitrate molten salts at 565°C maximum temperature, using an innovative high-performance concrete for structures absolving functions of containment and foundation. Findings: Concrete durability in terms of prolonged thermal loads is assessed. The interaction between the hot tank and the surrounding environment (ground) is considered. The developed FE model simulates the whole domain, and a fixed heat source of 100°C is assigned to the internal concrete surface. The development of the thermal and hygral fronts within the tank thickness are analysed and results discussed for long-term scenarios. Originality/value: Within the medium temperature field, an innovative approach is here presented for the conceptual design of liquid salts concrete storage systems. The adopted numerical model accounts for the strong coupling among moisture and heat transfer and the mechanical field. The basic mathematical model is a single fluid phase non-linear diffusion one based on the theory by Bažant; appropriate thermodynamic and constitutive relationships are supplemented to enhance the approach and catch the effects of different fluid phases (liquid plus gas). © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Concretes; Flow; Solar power; Thermal insulating properties","Conceptual design; Concrete construction; Concretes; Electric power plants; Electric power systems; Fused salts; Heat storage; Power plants; Renewable energy resources; Salts; Solar power plants; Solar radiation; Tanks (containers); Concentrated solar powers; Concrete durabilities; Concrete surfaces; Concrete systems; Cone shapes; Constitutive relationships; Cost technologies; Design/methodology/approach; Direct radiations; Do-mains; Energy exploitations; Fe models; Flow; Fluid flows; Fluid phasis; Heat sources; Heat storage systems; High temperatures; Innovative approaches; Linear diffusions; Maximum temperatures; Mechanical fields; Medium temperatures; Molten salts; New technologies; Numerical models; Research objectives; Solar power; Storage systems; Strong couplings; Surrounding environments; Thermal insulating properties; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57149146711

Different viscoelastic behaviours were obtained by varying iota-carrageenan concentration or temperature. Furthermore, gels were added with casein without changing their rheological properties measured in dynamic mode (small deformation), to study the influence of solid surface tension of gels on adhesiveness. After the determination of rheological parameters of gels with dynamic rheological method, the level of adhesion was measured by a pull off test. The maximum force and the energy of adhesion measured during the separation of the gel from the solid surface were studied. Both were inversely related to the storage modulus of the gel. They increase with decreasing loss tangent (corresponding to an increase of the level of structure of the gel). Moreover, the maximum force measured during separation increases with the solid surface tension (steel or plastic) and the more structured the gel, the higher is the adhesiveness differences between surfaces. When 0.2-0.3% (w/v) of casein are added to gels with high enough storage modulus (>90 Pa), the maximum separation force increases whereas the energy of adhesion is not affected.

A speed of amorphous-to-crystalline phase transformation in Ge2 Sb2 Te5 and Ag0.1 (Ge2 Sb2 Te5) 0.9 films has been evaluated on a nanosecond time scale using a 658-nm laser beam. The focused laser beam with a diameter <10 μm was illuminated in the power (P) and pulse duration (t) ranges of 1-17 mW and 10-460 ns, respectively, with subsequent detection of the response signals reflected from the film surface. We also evaluated the material characteristics, such as optical absorption and energy gap, crystalline phases, and sheet resistance of as-deposited and annealed films. The experiments showed that the crystallization speed of the Ge2 Sb2 Te5 film is largely improved by adding Ag. For example, the threshold pulse durations (tT) for Ge2 Sb2 Te5 and Ag0.1 (Ge2 Sb2 Te5) 0.9 films are approximately 70 and 30 ns for P=7 mW. In addition, the sheet resistance in the amorphous state of the Ag0.1 (Ge2 Sb2 Te5) 0.9 film is approximately ten times that of the Ge2 Sb2 Te5 film. This improvement can lead to a low programming current in electronic operation. To understand the ultrafast crystallization in the amorphous Ag0.1 (Ge2 Sb2 Te5) 0.9 film, we suggest heat confinement by electron hopping. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Computer programming; Crystalline materials; Crystallization; Electric resistance; Laser beams; Lasers; Nanocrystalline alloys; Pulse generators; Pulsed laser applications; Semiconducting germanium compounds; Sheet resistance; Soldered joints; Thick films; Amorphous chalcogenides; Amorphous states; Annealed films; Crystalline phase transformations; Crystalline phasis; Crystalline states; Crystallization speeds; Current pulses; Data storages; Electron hopping; Film surfaces; Focused laser beams; Local heating; Material characteristics; Nano-seconds; Optical absorptions; Powers (p); Programming currents; Pulse durations; Response signals; Short lasers; Time scales; Ultra fasts; Silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049171377

The solutions for temperature distributions in the aquifer, underlying rock, and overlying rock are derived by the Laplace transforms and their corresponding time-domain solutions are evaluated by the modified Crump method. Field data adopted from the literature are used as examples to demonstrate the applicability of the solutions in modeling the heat transfer in an aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) system. The results show that the aquifer temperature increases with time, injection flow rate, and water temperature. However, the temperature decreases with increasing radial and vertical distances. The heat transfer in the rocks is slow and has an effect on the aquifer temperature only after a long period of injection time. The influence distance depends on the aquifer physical and thermal properties, injection flow rate, and injected water temperature. A larger value of thermal diffusivity or injection flow rate will result in a longer influence distance. The present solution can be used as a tool for designing the heat injection facilities for an ATES system. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Analytical solution; Groundwater flow; Heat transfer; Laplace transform; Thermal energy storage","confined aquifer; groundwater flow; heat transfer; Laplace transform; numerical model; water temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049136720

For all cases, 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was used as an initiator and an acetonitrile/toluene (3:1) mixture was chosen as a porogen. After packing the polymer particles into empty SPE cartridges, nickel(II) ions were removed by washing with 50 mL of 2.0 M nitric acid. Characterization of the polymer particles has been carried out by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and elemental analysis. The best nickel imprinting properties were given by polymers synthesized in the presence of 8-hydroxyquinoline and 2-(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate as a monomer. The optimum pH for quantitative nickel retention was 8.5 ± 0.5, while elution was completed with 2.5 mL of 2.0 M nitric acid. When using polymer masses of 300 mg, sample volumes until 250 mL can be passed through the cartridges without reaching the breakthrough volume. Therefore, a pre-concentration factor of 100 has been reached when eluting with 2.5 mL of the elution solution. Electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry has been used as a detector for nickel determination. The limit of detection of the method was 0.050 μg L-1 (pre-concentration factor of 100), while the relative standard deviation for eleven replicates was 6%.

It is not clear, however, if they represent independent factors or they are mechanistically linked. We investigated the effects of ROS on insulin signaling using as model system the p66Shc-null mice. p66Shc is a redox enzyme that generates mitochondrial ROS and promotes aging in mammals. We report that insulin activates the redox enzyme activity of p66Shc specifically in adipocytes and that p66Shc-generated ROS regulate insulin signaling through multiple mechanisms, including AKT phosphorylation, Foxo localization, and regulation of selected insulin target genes. Deletion of p66Shc resulted in increased mitochondrial uncoupling and reduced triglyceride accumulation in adipocytes and in vivo increased metabolic rate and decreased fat mass and resistance to diet-induced obesity. In addition, p66 Shc-/- mice showed impaired thermo-insulation. These findings demonstrate that p66Shc-generated ROS regulate the effect of insulin on the energetic metabolism in mice and suggest that intracellular oxidative stress might accelerate aging by favoring fat deposition and fat-related disorders. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Biochemistry; Enzyme activity; Enzymes; Hormones; Mammals; Nutrition; Oxygen; Accelerate aging; Adipocytes; Adipose tissues; AKT phosphorylations; AS models; Critical determinants; Energetic metabolisms; Fat accumulations; Fat masses; In-vivo; Intracellular oxidative stresses; Metabolic rates; Reactive oxygen species; Redox enzymes; Target genes; Triglyceride accumulations; Insulin; gene product; insulin; insulin receptor substrate 1; lipid; mitogen activated protein kinase; protein kinase B; protein p66; protein p66 shc; protein p85; protein p85a; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor FOXO; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; vinculin; insulin; oxygen; protein Shc; reactive oxygen metabolite; Shc1 protein, mouse; adipocyte; aging; animal cell; article; controlled study; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; gene deletion; gene targeting; lipid storage; metabolic rate; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oxidation; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein localization; regulatory mechanism; signal transduction; adipose tissue; animal; C57BL mouse; genetics; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; phosphorylation; physiology; transgenic mouse; Mammalia; Mus; Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Insulin; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Phosphorylation; Reactive Oxygen Species; Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749091893

On the basis of a complex spring model of a vibration system, the dynamic shear properties of neoprene rubbers before and after exposure to different durations of ultraviolet irradiation were then determined from the experimental results of dynamic transmissibility tests.

Split-phase generation has previously been accomplished using voltage-sourced inverters (VSIs). There are some advantages to instead using CSIs, such as improved output voltage waveform quality and built-in overcurrent protection; however, two issues have prevented their adoption to date. First, while a CSI does not require the input boost converter used by a VSI when fed from a low-voltage source, it may require a preconditioning circuit to provide the required dc current. Second, no algorithm for producing split-phase outputs with a CSI presently exists. This paper's two major contributions aim to solve these problems. A simple preconditioning circuit is presented to provide the necessary dc current and store energy in a capacitor bank for use during load transients. A switching algorithm is written to produce balanced split-phase output voltages under a variety of unbalanced loading conditions. It is demonstrated using simulation and experimental results on a 400-W prototype that the proposed system is able to successfully generate balanced output voltages under unbalanced, inductive, nonlinear, and transient loading conditions, while equalizing switch utilization and minimizing output voltage ripple. © 2008 IEEE.","Current supplies; Inverters; Pulsewidth modulated inverters; Pulsewidth modulation","Capacitors; Channel state information; Information retrieval; Modulation; Overcurrent protection; Pulse width modulation; BOOST converters; Capacitor banks; Current supplies; DC currents; Inverters; Load transients; Low-voltage sources; Output voltage ripples; Output voltages; Over currents; Phase currents; Phase generations; Pulsewidth modulated inverters; Stand -alone; Switch utilizations; Switching algorithms; Transient loadings; Unbalanced loadings; Voltage-sourced inverters; Power converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-59749100276

Particularly, an explanation of the energy function when the capacity is exceeded: the limitation in pattern storage implies that similar patterns are going to be identified by the network, therefore forming different clusters. This ability can be translated as an unsupervised learning of pattern clusters, with one major advantage over most clustering algorithms: the number of data classes is automatically learned, as confirmed by the experiments. Two methods to reinforce learning are proposed to improve the quality of the clustering, by enhancing the learning of patterns relationships.

There is a growing awareness that nanotechnology will have a profound impact on energy generation, storage, and utilization by understanding the significant differences of energy states and transport in nanostructures compared to macrostructures. Nanotechnology-based solutions are being developed for a wide range of energy solutions such as solar cells, hydrogen generation and storage, batteries, and fuel cells. Energy shortages and environmental pollution are serious challenges that humanity is starting to face. The world demand for energy is expected to double from 14 terawatts (TW) in the year 2000 to 28 TW by the year 2050. Fuel cells are non-polluting and efficient energy conversion devices that are expected to play a dominant role in energy solutions of the future. However, fuel cells still face significant technological roadblocks that need to be overcome before they will become economically viable. One of the biggest challenges towards the commercialization of fuel cells is their low stability and the high cost of materials. Many scientists see research in advanced nanotechnology and nanomaterials as an opportunity to address our significant energy and environmental challenges (e.g., see the article by R. Smalley, a winner of the Nobel Prize, in the June issue of MRS Bulletin in 2005). Nanomaterials have attracted great interest in recent years because of their unusual catalytic, mechanical, electrical and optical properties, all of which are obtained by confining their dimensions. For example, gold in bulk form is not chemically active, but at the nanoscale, a gold particle 3 nm in size is highly chemically active. Gold nanoparticles used as catalysts are therefore considered promising in chemical reactions such as the oxidation of CO. Further, gold nanowires are 100 times stronger than bulk gold because nanowires have fewer defects. Nanowires will be discussed in more detail later in the chapter. Among the advanced nanomaterials, nanotubes and nanowires are a class of novel nanostructures that have attracted much attention as model systems for nanoscience and for various potential applications, including those related to composite materials, electrode materials, field emitters, nanoelectronics, and nanoscale sensors. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892061765

They are there from the small zinc-air button cells to the lead acid batteries used in automobiles. In sharp contrast, electrochemical capacitors, devices that too store energy, are less known to the public; even though they have several distinct advantages over batteries. Electrochemical capacitor technology has marched quietly ahead and has reached a stage where it is a full grown industry with sales of several hundred million dollars per annum. It is poised for rapid growth in the near future due to the expansion of power quality needs, emerging energy management and conservation applications and the increased reliance on renewable energy sources. The present status of electrochemical capacitor technology is the result of research being conducted globally to continually design and develop new materials for use as components for electrochemical capacitors, notably for the construction of electrodes. Efforts are being made to overcome the limited energy density of electrochemical capacitors. This chapter, while briefly touching upon the fundamentals of electrochemical capacitors and their comparison with batteries, attempts to review the state-of-the-art research in materials for the construction of electrodes for electrochemical capacitors, albeit partially, owing to the voluminous amount of literature available in the field. Special emphasis is given to organic/inorganic composites.

Transfer coefficients determined from multiple years of data for the two smallest lakes were similar (1.26 x 10 -3 and 1.30 x 10 -3) while that for the largest lake was slightly smaller (1.10 x 10 -3). The coefficient for the medium-size lake was erroneously high (2.14 x 10 -3) likely due to generalizations in the calculation of heat storage. No strong relationships were found between the coefficient values and morphometric parameters. The linear regression comparison of measured and modeled daily fluxes using multi-year coefficients gave an average r2 of 0.78. The same coefficients performed the best at estimating cumulative latent and sensible heat loss. Absolute percent errors suggest that the multi-year coefficients give acceptable results for small and medium-size lakes only, and that these coefficients cannot be transferred from one lake to another, unless the lakes are similar in size. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892015890

It is well recognized that Cr plays an important role in energy transmission and storage in cells and tissues with high energy demand. Recent developments have revealed alteration in the levels of the above-mentioned metabolites in different disease states, i.e. guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency, L-arginine:glycine amidino transferase (AGAT) deficiency and Cr transporter (SLC6A8) deficiency. This group of diseases is referred to as creatine deficiency syndromes (CDS) and can be detected in vivo by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain. Quantification of GA and Cr in body fluids forms the biochemical basis for the (differential) diagnosis of the CDS. This current chapter describes a detailed procedure for the simultaneous measurement of GA and Cr in urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid employing Stable-Isotope Dilution Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. In addition, recent analytical developments using tandem mass spectrometry for the measurement of GA and Cr are briefly discussed. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889856159

The chemical structure was determined by FTIR-ATR and Solid-state 29Si-NMR. The char yield was increased with the IPEP content in nitrogen or air atmosphere. Meanwhile, the silica char not only provided thermal insulation but also the anti-oxidant property. The activation energies of thermal degradation were calculated by Ozawa and Kissinger's method. In nitrogen atmosphere, the energy values were 159.7∼193.81 kJ/mol and 165.5∼200.69 kJ/mol, and in air atmosphere, the values were 98.67-134.08 kJ/mol and 138.49∼281.55 kJ/mol by Ozawa and Kissinger's method, respectively. The activation energies were increased with IPEP moiety. SEM, EDX, and TEM confirmed that the inorganic silica segments (POSS) of IPEP nanocomposites were dispersed uniformly and no phase aggregation occurred. Furthermore, the size domain of POSS was less than 5 nm. The XRD photography showed a broad peak about 14∼15°, the phenomenon resulted from the chain entanglement of the epoxy/amine curing reaction. From the mechanical properties investigations, the bulky POSS cage side chain might interrupt the cross-linking structure of the curing reaction of the epoxy/amine. And the storage modulus and the hardness tests would be decreased with the higher IPEP content.","Morphology; Nanocomposite; POSS; Thermal stability","Antioxidant properties; Chain entanglements; Cross-linking structures; Curing reactions; Epoxy nanocomposites; Nitrogen atmospheres; Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes; POSS; Activation energy; Chains; Composite materials; Crosslinking; Curing; Mechanical properties; Morphology; Nitrogen; Silica; Thermodynamic stability; Nanocomposites",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887554133

The primary function of plasma lipoproteins is to transport hydrophobic, water-insoluble lipids within the circulation to other tissues. The TG-rich lipoproteins contain apo B and deliver TGs made in the liver and intestine to other tissues in the body for either storage or utilization as an energy source. VLDLs and CM can be converted into low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) in the circulation. Lipoproteins remove cholesterol from tissues for delivery to the liver and excretion into bile in a process termed ""reverse cholesterol transport.""

It argues that the NEM has worked well. Prices have remained among the lowest in the world, reliability has been maintained, and the market has produced new generation investment of the magnitude, type, and timing that has been appropriate. These results point to the superiority, at least in the Australian context, of an energy-only market approach that operates without the potential distortions that separate capacity payments bring. Among the many issues with which electricity market designers have wrestled is how to ensure reliable and uninterrupted supply. The concerns cover short-run operations and longer-term investment adequacy. Electricity is jointly supplied to the whole community, has virtually no storage capabilities, and faces a peaky demand with little capacity or desire of consumers to respond to excess demand (and hence price surges) by reducing their demand. In addition, it is subject to political oversight of prices and many facets of supply. Many have argued that as a result there will be ""missing money"" in the market and that we must, therefore, have a dual market for electricity generation, covering energy on the one hand and capacity on the other.

Now the use of a storage function in such intermittent power supply systems is crucial in order to get better adequacy between the peaks of energetic consumption and production. The integration degree of photovoltaic systems will be improved if all the components: panel, battery, converters, electronic control unit, cablings can be combined in a compact single unit. Different battery technologies are currently used with photovoltaic systems along with some of the charging and discharging techniques that are available. Lithium-ion technology appears to be the best candidate because of its high energetic efficiency, high specific energy density, deep discharge ability, its long cycling life and its possible different shapes (cylindrical or prismatic styles) to obtain an integrated design. To optimize the battery performance, different conditions are required and achieved by control sub-systems, integrated into battery and module construction. The electronic management system presented in this paper aims to optimize the use of the battery making the overall system more reliable and cost effective. On the one hand, a research algorithm of the optimal power to charge and discharge an advanced lithium-ion battery for photovoltaic application is necessary to obtain an optimum electronic management system. On the other hand, a Maximum Power Point Tracking is also incorporated into the electronic control unit, to optimize the solar array production under varying atmospheric conditions.

The integration of supercapacitors with battery cells optimizes power supply of satellite equipments requiring very high power for short times (such as SARs, mechanisms, and transmitters), i.e. it can increase battery lifetime and involve a significant mass reduction of the satellite energy storage system. Such mass saving is a function of peak power/average power ratio. Supercapacitors are electrochemical devices able to store energy through a physical process. The absence of chemical reactions grants higher power densities and higher charge/discharge currents, but lower energy densities with reference to common battery cells. Such characteristics make supercapacitors particularly suitable for the integration in hybrid energy storage systems, e.g. to support Li-ion battery cells in case of peak power requests.

Such power exports have been caused in part by exceptional conditions, in partly by structural changes, such as insufficient reserve at peak load in some central European countries and conversely increasing reserve in Italy. The price difference between the Ipex (Italian Power Exchange) and the central European exchanges is a consequence of the different production mix, primarily based on gas-fired power plants in Italy. Italian power prices are thus strongly driven by: (a) the variable generation costs (i.e. the gas cost including variable transportation costs and taxes), and (b) the investment costs in the power plant, which can only be recovered if the market price exceeds the variable cost. Prices between the two areas will tend to converge, as producers in Central Europe try to rapidly develop new capacity to increase the reserve margin at peak times. However, opportunities for power exchange between the two areas will remain. Possible power flows are however constrained, in the north to south direction, at two points, one at the German / Swiss border, the other one at the Swiss / Italian border. This paper proposes an hourly analysis of expected cross border exchanges between the Italian electric system and the Swiss / German one for the year 2012, taking into account different marginal prices and congestions. Hourly prices in Italy have been determined by using the NEWPROMED software, a simulator of the electricity market on a yearly horizon. Hourly prices in Central Europe (Eex) have been generated by means of statistical analysis based on the quoted forward values at the Eex. The auction premium to be paid at the German / Swiss border (direction north to south) causes a bid / ask spread at the Italian border. Such auction premium is in turn dependent on Italian market prices. The analysis of past data shows that the auction premium has been overstated in several hours. Some predictions can be made based on the analysis of Italian market prices in 2012 and on oil price scenarios.","Bidding strategy; Cross border trading; Electricity market; Energy trading; European power markets; Investment signals; Italian Power Exchange; Market simulator; Price forecasting; Transfer capacity","Bidding strategy; Cross-border trading; Electricity market; Energy trading; Market simulators; Power exchange; Power markets; Price forecasting; Transfer capacities; Computer software; Cost accounting; Costs; Digital storage; Electric industry; Electricity; International trade; Power plants; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876780488

Several opportunities are now available for small energy users which are about to change their role of passive consumers becoming active customers. Continuous increase of energy demand and the recent peak-shifting from winter to summer especially in urban areas represent new challenges for distribution utilities. Not always network upgrade is possible, often it is neither the more efficient solution. Forecast of the capacity improvement and planning of the most adequate investment is always necessary. An analysis on the Milan urban area and a comparison with regional and national data is reported. A simple model is then proposed to support the planning process. Steep increasing in demand and inadequacy of the distribution network can be temporarily mitigated by short term-actions like promotion of energy efficiency in end-uses and providing customers and households with the technology enabling them to become ""active nodes"" of the electric network. Responding customers, in a liberalized market scenario, may offer services both to the network (power modulation) and to the market (reduce energy price volatility). The interaction between customers and distribution networks can be provided by a local ICT platform (at customer side) which supports both energy management and bi-directional communication with energy retailers, traders and distributors.

The main activities, supported by site tests and carried on in this installation are: the monitoring of the microgrid using the standard protocol (IEC 61850 part. 7-420); the assessment of the impact of the microgrid on the transformation centre; the switching between connected and isolated mode; the microgrid power quality and stability improvement; the connection of fuel cell to the grid. The main contribution to the TPB microgrid has been the DER technologies demonstration facility located in LABEIN-TECNALIA's premises.

Due to the current state of computational capability and data storage capacity, the technology can marginally provide fair speed and efficiency including well-established software developments.

They are-among other reasons-caused by large amounts of stochastic generation such as wind. The inclusion of energy storage devices, distributed in future systems (distributed energy storage-DES), is continuously being mentioned as a possibility to alleviate some of the problems arising from stochastic generation. The authors show that the potential ownership of the DES systems is an important criterion on which probabilistic methods will be applied for assessment. The potential owners are either the grid operators, the generation owners, or the energy traders. For the grid operators being the DES owners, storage operation will have to be integrated into the planning of the system, therefore multivariate nonparametric time series analysis and synthesis methods have to be applied to recorded data of stochastic energy resources. Together with suited storage models, the implications of DES on the planning of the system can then be assessed. For the producers or traders being the owners of the DES, the topic to be addressed is the real-time operation of each storage device in the power system, which is linked to the optimisation of the economic value of the stochastic resources. In this case, forecasting and operations research issues are paramount. Recently developed methods including scenario development from non-parametric forecast models for the following trading period and probabilistic assessment of necessary storage capacities for hedging with given financial risks are explained. It is generally stated that the non-standard distributions of the stochastic infeeds, as well as complex chronological persistence and interdependence phenomena complicate the modelling procedure and leave space for a large range of research activities on DES in the future. The exact description of how the owners of storage assets are embedded into the energy market frameworks of the future is crucial for the probabilistic quantification of benefits introduced by DES.","Correlation; Energy storage; Forecasting; Operation; Planning; Renewable energy; Stochastic generation; Wind power","Distributed energy storages; Non-parametric forecasts; Operation; Power system planning and operation; Probabilistic assessments; Probabilistic quantification; Renewable energies; Stochastic generation; Commerce; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Energy storage; Forecasting; Operations research; Optical correlation; Planning; Risk perception; Time series analysis; Wind power; Stochastic systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876760117

However, there are obstacles to the widespread deployment and integration of wind energy, many are a result of the nature of Canadian electricity systems-a relatively small number of large load centres with long transmission lines-but also due to problems that have been experienced elsewhere, such as capacity constraints due to the remote nature of good wind resources. The growth of wind and the associated challenges that it imposes on the planning and operation of power systems will need to be carefully weighed as the evolution of Canadian power systems is charted. Options, including energy storage in one form or another, for mitigating negative impacts of large amounts of intermittent generation need to be compared, considering the overall value that is brought to the power system and the costs incurred. In this paper, we will consider energy storage, particularly in the form of battery storage, as a means of facilitating the integration of wind energy into remote communities and distribution systems.

The paper presents the results of an experimental activity on different typologies of storage systems, based on electrical energy storage and fuel storage. The various storage technologies have been characterized in laboratory tests and afterward have been installed and connected to a low voltage grid test facility used for distributed generation studies and analysis. The test facility consists of conventional and innovative renewable energy generators, co-generators plants, fuel cells, controllable loads, traditional and innovative electrical energy storage systems including electrochemical and mechanical equipments, such as a lead acid battery, ZEBRA™ batteries, a high speed flywheel, a Vanadium Redox Flow battery. The distributed resources can be connected at different points of an automated LV grid working in radial, ring and meshed configuration. Experimental activity and tests results are described in the paper. In particular storage systems characterisation tests and performances verification at different operating and ambient conditions are reported, including systems reliability. Tests performed in test facility were also focused on energy storage systems management in a DG grid, demonstrating possible applications and evaluating systems performances both in islanding operation and connected to the main grid. In particular overall systems managing tools have been developed and tested for grid operation. The experimental results concerning a diagnostic tool for on-line estimation of the state of health (SOH) of VRLA and ZEBRA™ batteries are also reported. In addition to electrical energy storage systems, hydrogen storage systems have been designed and tested, coupled to PEM fuel cell and connected to the DG test facility. Hydrogen storage systems developed in our laboratories use metal hydride technology (La-Ni or Mg based) that allows hydrogen storage at low pressures. Different storage tanks with hydrogen capacity from 150 to 6500 Nl have been designed and tested. In particular a storage system with a volume of about 30 l and filled with 50 kg of metal hydride (LaNi based), operating at a pressure between 1 to 6 bars and in a temperature range between 10 and 70C, characterised by a hydrogen storage capacity of 6500 Nl (energy storage of about 19 kWh) has been developed. The same hydrogen capacity can be obtained with a 30 l compressed bottle operating at about 200 bar. The storage system has been previously tested in a stand-alone configuration verifying hydrogen charge and discharge cycles characteristics at different pressure and temperature conditions and evaluating negligible performance degradation after about 100 cycles. Afterward hydrogen storage system has been connected to a 3 kW PEM fuel cell in order to demonstrate that fuel cell heat losses can be recovered and used by the storage system during hydrogen discharge phase.

The first three LNG tanks in Taiwan in operation from 1990 till 2006 have exceeded the time limit for an internal inspection as required by law. Since Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER), Taiwan has accumulated over 25 years' matured Probabilistic/Quantitative Risk Assessment (PRA/QRA) experience on nuclear power plants, the TCLA encourages utilities to implement QRA on LNG tank systems as an alternative to the required internal surveillance inspection. The TCLA granted the Taiwan Chinese Petroleum Corp. (TCPC) with 2 additional years of extension in March 2007, depending on the final results of the QRA of the LNG tank systems in this study. The TCPC saved more than 60 million U.S. Dollars of direct costs with the exemption of periodic inspections of LNG tanks. The primary initiating events source of LNG tank system from this QRA study attribute to the leakage of auxiliary piping of the LNG tank systems. The ratio of initiating events caused by the leakage of LNG tank membrane is lower than 1% within the period of 10 years. The LNG tank membrane is not the major source of initiating events. From the viewpoint of risk, the probability of leakage on LNG tank membrane will grow with time. However, due to the small amount of LNG leakage and the small impact area, the contribution of initiating events caused by LNG tank membrane failure on the F-N (Frequency-Number of Fatalities) curve of Individual Risk and Societal Risk is minor. The operating risk of the LNG receiving terminal will not be significantly affected with respect to the exemption of internal inspections on LNG tank membrane. The QRA technique has demonstrated its effectiveness in helping managers to make decision on the base of associated risk information and to optimize the resource taking full consideration between safety and operation requirements.","Liquefied Natural Gas; Quantitative Risk Assessment; Tank system","Institute of nuclear energy researches; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Lng receiving terminals; Periodic inspection; Quantitative risk assessment; Quantitative risk-assessment techniques; Surveillance inspections; Tank system; Cost accounting; Failure (mechanical); Fuel tanks; Gas fuel purification; Inspection; Liquefied natural gas; Membranes; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Offshore pipelines; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Tankers (ships)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876471319

CCS involves capturing CO2 from large industrial or energy-related sources, transporting, and injecting it into the subsurface for long term storage. One of the main challenges of this action is to guarantee that the storage site performs and will continue to perform according to the initial requirements. Site performance is measured by storage capacity, injectivity, and containment of injected CO2. Due to the limited knowledge and feedback experience about CO2 behaviour during and after injection, new predictive methods to assess site performance throughout its lifecycle (thousands of years) are starting to be developed. Within this frame, the paper will present a methodology that uses risk assessment as a driver. The core of the methodology is the identification of the possible short/mid/long-term losses of performance of the system, their description in terms of reference risk pathways, defined as the mechanism of exposure of a receptor to a stressor, and their probabilistic quantification. The current limited knowledge of the site and of the behaviour of CO2 underground introduces a large amount of uncertainty on the initial conditions and input parameters and the methodology aims at determining how this uncertainty affects the final results.","CO2 subsurface storage; Performance assessment; Risk scenarios; Uncertainty analysis","Atmospheric greenhouse; Carbon capture and storage; Initial conditions; Performance assessment; Predictive methods; Probabilistic performance; Probabilistic quantification; Risk scenarios; Carbon capture; Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Storage (materials); Uncertainty analysis; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876471207

The plate formulation is derived from Kirchhoff's theory for the elastic faces and Mindlin's theory for the core. The frequency-temperature dependence of the viscoelastic material properties are taken into account using an experimentally derived viscoelastic constitutive law. The results presented deal with a laminated glass subjected to a diffuse sound field. It is found that the dip of the TL curve at the coincidence frequency of the plate is totally removed for temperatures where this frequency is in the transition region of the used viscoelastic material.

To utilize gas hydrate as an energy storage and transportation medium, two important key features - storage capacity and storage conditions - must be considered. In this study, we describe the inclusion phenomena of methane occurring in a tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) hydrate through thermodynamic measurement and spectroscopic studies. The X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopic analysis revealed that a sII TBA hydrate (cubic, Fd3m) forms in the presence of methane but does not form the same structure in the presence of TBA alone. Under equilibrium conditions, the pressure-lowering effect of methane + tert-butyl alcohol di-hydrate was also observed. These results provide several key features for a better understanding of inclusion phenomena occurring in the complex hydrate systems and further developing methane or other gas storage and transportation techniques.",,,Abstract Report,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874477832

HUGE raises high expectations because of the potential of its specific UCG concept to integrate large scale in situ production of hydrogen-rich gases with on site geological storage of carbon dioxide. This would allow transferring underground generated low carbon and partly purified hydrogen or synthesis gases to the surface as major product, while leaving behind the wastes generated during their conversion from coal. The project, which primarily addresses a European issue, also has a global dimension because of the environmental constraints related to the technologies involved. Major attention in the technology oriented project HUGE is paid to optimizing the integration of mature elements of coal gasification and hydro-gasification processes with heat and mass transfer phenomena taking place in geological multiphase systems of complex geometry. Because the coal to hydrogen conversion process may be carried out at high depths in the composite geological structures of coal seams, aquifers and surrounding strata, only a limited number of methods and tools are available for controlling the conversion processes.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are a family of biopolyesters that have been recognized as potential good substitutes for traditional thermoplastics with possible applications in the field of packaging. PHA are produced by a variety of bacteria as intracellular carbon and energy storage compounds under conditions of carbon excess and nitrogen limitation. Biosynthesis of two types of length chain polyhydroxyalkanoates and the preparation and characteristics of the resulting bionanocomposites were described. Poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) (PHO) was produced in fed-batch fermentation of Pseudomonas oleovorans (ATCC 29347) grown on octanoic acid. P3HB-4HB, with a range of mol% HB, was obtained from cultures of Cupriavidus necator (ATCC 17699) when feeding the growth medium with appropriate ratios of fructose and γ-butyrolactone. PHO and P3HB-4HB-based nanocomposites were prepared by solution intercalation method using organically modified montmorillonite (Cloisite 15 A). The microstructure (dispersed state of the silicate layers in the polymer matrix), thermal stability and mechanical variation in tensile strength, Young's modulus, and elongation at break of PHO and P3HB-4HB-based nanocomposites were discussed as a function of the clay content and compared with the pure polymers and actually used food packaging materials.

In the past century especially western economies have been heavily dependent on fossil fuels, primarily coal, oil and natural gas. As demand for these products rose whilst production levels either fell or levelled off, countries began looking for alternatives to 'fossil fuel economies', with the main contenders being hydrogen, biofuels (primarily methanol and ethanol) and electricity. There are several issues involved with moving to a 'hydrogen economy'. Most hydrogen is currently produced from fossil fuels resulting in the production of greenhouse gas. The distribution and storage of hydrogen also presents numerous problems, due to its extremely low density, boiling point and small molecular size Another possibility is the 'Methanol economy' (Olah et al., 2006) which involves the use of methanol as a fuel or a basis for chemicals used in plastics, pharmaceuticals, etc. In actuality ethanol has become the alcohol of choice in recent years, although there are suggestions that in another few years butanol could become the alcohol of choice for fuels. Most methanol is currently produced by reforming fossil fuels, whereas ethanol is generally produced from agricultural products. Advances in the biofuel arena may lead to improvements in the efficiency and sustainability of (m)ethanol production. Advances in battery (and other electrical storage) technology, over the last decade especially, have been primarily due to the advancements in miniaturisation that has led to laptop computers and mobile phones. Their demand for portable power sources led to an ability to keep such devices running for several days. Advances in battery and super-capacitor technology could see an eventual move into an 'electric economy'.",,"Australia; Energy production systems; Ethanol production; Hydrogen economy; Low density; Miniaturisation; Molecular size; Portable power sources; Production level; Storage of hydrogen; Super-capacitor; Toxic emissions; Agricultural products; Biofuels; Economics; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Laptop computers; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866330603

Small energy systems integrating renewable sources (especially PV) and electrolysers are discussed. In this framework, some early technical developments are focusing on hydrogen production directly at high pressure: in a certain range of pressure, this solution shows favorable influence on the total conversion process (from electric power to already compressed hydrogen), and even a positive effect on the cost reduction in terms of system components, due to the elimination of the whole compressor or of some compression stages. In the paper the design and the construction of laboratory for high pressure hydrogen production developed at the Dipartimento di Energetica of the Politecnico di Torino in the framework of an agreement with Giner Electrochemical Systems (US), producer of a a-prototype electrolyser, are described. The system has an expected production of 0.1 kg/h of H 2 at 70 bar. The main aim of the paper is the description and analysis of the operating results of the first experimental tests.

Metal-hydride systems have become a secure and effective way to store hydrogen for fuel cells and to produce thermodynamic or electrochemical work for stationary and mobile applications (Sandrock G&amp;Bowman Jr, 2003). Indeed, they reach the highest volumetric capacity of all hydrogen storage techniques and new hydride compounds are currently being developed to enhance their gravimetric storage ability (Züttel. A et al 2004). The heat energy exchanged during the absorption and desorption processes is quite large (near -30.8 kJ per mole of hydrogen gas for LaNi5 hydride (Sandrock G, 1999) and -75.0 for MgH2 (Kapischke J&amp; Hapke J, 1998) and the metal hydride reactor should manage this heat to prevent inhibiting reaction. Several experimental studies on hydride powder beds or compacted mixtures have been carried out to determine the limit reaction rate that corresponds to a nearly isothermal process (Goodell PD&amp; Sandrock G, 1980). They show that, in AB5 hydrides, the intrinsic reaction kinetics is very fast but the heat transfer controls the overall reaction rate. In fact, because metal hydrides have rather low thermal conductivity (around 0.1W/mK for AB5 powders (Dehouche Z et al 2005)), for this type of storage a fast heat transfer during filling the tank is crucially important. The time of filling is depending on the temperature of hydride, and filling can be stopped if the temperature is too high. Controling the temperature is then an important issue. This paper deals with the temperature assessment during the hydrogen refueling (or decharging). A detailed mathematical model is developed to assess the temperature of a tank during the hydrogen absorption. The model is based on assumption on the shape of the tank and on the heat process generation. A numerical solution is provided by using the finite difference method. The model provides the profile of temperature in time for various tank dimensions. This model provides an easy way to investigate the problem of heat exchange and firsthand information about the temperature at the surface of the tank at different times. A practical example is investigated. The parameters used in the model are based on experimental data obtained for LaNi 4.78Sn 0.22. The investigated system is a closed ended tube made of aluminum alloy. This tank shell is filled by hydride particles. Hydrogen is introduced in this reactor, at ambient pressure. The aim is to get information about the temperature developed at the surface of the cylinder in order to aid the design of the tank by taking into account the thermal loading.",,"Ambient pressures; Compacted mixtures; Decharging; Desorption process; Experimental data; Experimental studies; Heat energy; Heat exchange; Heat process; Heat transfer control; Hydrogen absorption; Hydrogen for fuel cells; Hydrogen gas; Intrinsic reaction; Isothermal process; Low thermal conductivity; Metal hydride systems; Metal hydrides; Mobile applications; New hydrides; Numerical solution; Overall reactions; Powder bed; Sandrock; Storage of hydrogen; Storage tank; Storage technique; Tank dimension; Thermal loadings; Volumetric capacity; Desorption; Filling; Heat transfer; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Lanthanum alloys; Mathematical models; Powder metals; Reaction rates; Storage (materials); Tanks (containers); Temperature; Tin; Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866324374

According to the main idea of this technique the transition through the EL is accompanied by the sharp change of damage kinetics and as consequence changing of specimen temperature. The combination of two different registration techniques (acoustic emission and infrared thermography) allows us to estimate the number of defects, their size distribution and spatial and time evolution of heat sources induced by defects. As a result, we determine the difference between thresholds of defect accumulation and heat dissipation. We also link the dissipation activity of metals with acoustic emission (AE) rate. The special experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of grain size on dissipation ability of metals. The fine grain titanium specimens were prepared by the method of intensive plastic deformation. It was shown that high initial defect density has great influence on dissipation ability of metals and leads to linear temperature kinetics versus stress amplitude up to specimen failure.","Acoustic emission; Bulk nanocrystalline materials.; Energy dissipation and storage; Infrared monitoring","Bulk nanocrystalline materials; Cyclic loadings; Damage kinetics; Defect accumulation; Endurance limit; Fine grains; Grain size; Heat sources; Initial defects; Intensive plastic deformation; Linear temperature; Registration techniques; Specimen temperature; Stress amplitudes; Time evolutions; Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic emissions; Cyclic loads; Defects; Energy balance; Energy dissipation; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Plastic deformation; Titanium; Metals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866134633

This relatively high availability of solar energy has recently led to annual growth rates of 30% - 40% in sales of solar energy equipment in Canada - although only a small portion of this equipment is used for space heating. However, due to the geographic location and climatic conditions of the northern U.S. and Canada, the bulk of the solar radiation is received in the summer months and is relatively low during the winter months, when the demand for space heating reaches a peak. The ability to effectively store thermal energy for a period of months provides an opportunity to substantially increase the use of solar energy. A large-scale solar seasonal storage project has seen a full year of successful operation in Okotoks, Alberta. The Drake Landing Solar Community (DLSC) is a community of fifty-two modern, detached homes that derive most of their heat requirements from solar energy, using borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) to store heat collected in the summer for use in the winter. DLSC is the largest solar seasonal thermal energy storage system of its kind in North America and is designed to have the highest annual solar fraction (90%) of any solar-based seasonal storage system in the world. Thermal energy is stored in 35,000 m 3 (322,930 ft 3) of soil and rock under a corner of the neighborhood park; the heat is transferred to and from the earth by water flowing through U-tubes in 144 boreholes, each 35 meters (115 ft) deep. This paper will review the rationale for solar seasonal energy storage, the key elements of this technology and describe this first-of-its-kind project in North America, performance expectations and actual results of its first year of operation.",,"Alberta; Annual growth rate; Arizona; Borehole thermal energy storage; Climatic conditions; Energy equipments; First year; Geographic location; Germany; Heat requirements; High availability; Hotspots; Key elements; Performance expectations; Population centers; Seasonal storage; Solar fraction; Summer months; Thermal energy storage systems; Winter months; Boreholes; Heat storage; Solar radiation; Space heating; Sun; Thermography (temperature measurement)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865724581

In 2006, three new supply icebreakers, equipped with azimuth thrusters, which were capable of managing ice with the wake of their propulsion, were introduced to the support of the oil production in this project [3-7]. They enabled safe production of a Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) via a Single Arm Leg Mooring (SALM) Buoy and allowed exportation of oil from the FSO with a tanker. Furthermore, SEIC also acquired new terminal tugs equipped with azimuth thrusters that were available for 2007.

The EIS analysis that has been widely employed to measure the energy storage and dissipation properties of a physicochemical system in frequency domain was adopted to sense the impedance parameters of the nano-pore.

Because molten salts are corrosive at high temperatures, the corrosion behaviour of metallic components to be used in such environments must be carefully evaluated. Within this objective isothermal and stagnant gravimetric corrosion tests were conducted with preselected alloys in two molten salt media: the 54%KNO3/46%NaNO3 and the 68%ZnCl2/32%NaCl eutectic compositions. In order to increase the thermal conductivity of the salts, expanded natural graphite was added to both systems in concentrations up to 5%wt. For the nitrate media the unalloyed carbon steel St52.3 and the 316L stainless steel were selected, whereas 316L steel and Incoloy 825 were chosen for the chloride mixture. Corrosion tests were conducted for more than 2600 hours at a temperature of 340°C. Corrosion rates were determined by chemically descaling coupons. Post corrosion test studies included SEM/EDS and XRD analysis. Obtained results indicate that for the KNO3/NaNO3 salt media ST52.3 carbon steel and 316L stainless steel could be considered technically acceptable. Corrosion rates of 10 microns/year were observed for ST52.3 steel, and less than 2 microns/year for 316L steel. Passive ""non-soluble"" films were observed for both steels. For the ZnCl2NaCl media, Incoloy 825 showed metal losses up to 13 microns/year whereas 316L steel coupons were totally destroyed after 1500 hours. For the stagnant gravimetric tests general corrosion was the only corrosion phenomenon observed. However tests performed with TIG sealed 316L steel capsules filled with the nitrate composite, showed secondary cracking when testing at 340°C, thus indicating SCC sensitivity. This behaviour was mainly attributed to the high chloride content of the nitrate salt (up to 0.5%wt). As a conclusion, the SCC behaviour of metallic alloys should be evaluated for stressed components. In addition, the chloride content of nitrate salts should be kept as low as possible.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049350893

This increased concentration is thought to be responsible for the trend towards global warming already observed and might have far more dramatic consequences in the future if steps are not taken. Reducing these emissions, in particular by exploiting technologies to capture, transport and store CO2, is a major challenge for society. A line of action is to capture CO2 and store it in underground geological formations. This option is applicable to fixed, concentrated energy production facilities (such as refineries and power stations) and to fossil fuel-based hydrogen production. Corrosion and accurate materials selection is a major challenge for the development of relialable CO2 capture and storage technologies. In order to reduce CO2 emission, its capture is based on separation techniques such as absorption, membrane, adsorption or low temperature separation processes. As an example, for refinery, petrochemical plants and energy production facilities, post treatment capture from industrial gas streams are mainly operated at low pressure (1 bar) and low CO2 content (3-15%) using absorption processes based on chemical solvents. In order to improve the energetic outcome, extensive works are performed on better efficient solvents. One of the most severe operational difficulties encountered is the corrosion of the process equipment. In practice, corrosion mitigation have to be achieved by using appropriate inhibitors, by adequate design and use of corrosion resistant alloys, or by applying process modifications when no other solution is acceptable. For the CO2 transportation and storage, the selection of proper materials is a critical issue in order to avoid deterioration risks and to reduce the costs of underground CO2 disposal. Corrosion problems of steels and degradations of cements have to be overtaken to avoid CO2 leakage along the wells and to assure its long term storage in the reservoirs.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049344673

Future developers, in order to give a correct estimation of the expected power output of their devices, will have to apply these models and will be asked about the accuracy they ean provide, particularly on what concerns the performance of the device in a determined location. A general mathematical outline of this approach was firstly proposed by Cummins by using, under linear assumptions, a classical way of representing the equation of motion of a floating body with a system of integro-differential equations with convolution terms that involve frequency-dependent coefficients. Many methods have been proposed, in literature, to solve this system in the most efficient and accurate way. Some of them relied on a direct numerical integration using standard methods for the solution of Ordinary Differential Equations, while, in turn, others are based on the approximation of the radiation convolution term with a determined number of linear sub-systems or properly chosen transfer functions. This paper presents a general scheme for a simple heaving single-body WEC, whose hydraulic Power Take-Off is coupled to a gas accumulator that serves as a storage devicc. Different time-domain methods will be used and compared. Particular attention will be paid to the accuracy of the performance calculation of this WPA. lt is expccted that the results of the simulations provide deeper understanding of the importance of the numerical parameters used in the estimation of the device performance and in this way will constitute an additional suggestion for the choice of a time-domain model for the evaluation of a WPA performance.

To establish this method as an industrial gas storage process, existing problems should be resolved, that is, the rapid gas hydrate formation and the minimized induction time. In this work we tried and investigated the feasibility of gas storage method by using porous material as a storage media. It was expected that porous material could provide huge amount of contact area between water and gas molecules so that higher rate and amount of gas consumption could be achieved. In this report, we measured the equilibrium dissociation pressures of methane and natural gas hydrates in silica gel pores at first. As the pore sized diameter of silica gel particles becomes smaller, the inhibition effect of equilibrium dissociation pressures of each hydrate goes larger. Based on the equilibrium data, the gas consumption along time was also measured and the results were transformed into the rate and amount of geis consumption during hydrate formation by using isobaric method.

Results are provided for the dynamic hourly modeling of the cogeneration system for the micro turbine-equipped building throughout the winter heating (3700 HDD) and summer cooling (305 CDD) season. Dynamic modeling over the entire annual operating cycle allows for an assessment of the microturbine/ diurnal storage impacts during all seasons including ""shoulder months"" in the spring and fall when the weather is more temperate. The analysis discusses the relative merits of operating the CHP system to track the electrical demand of the building with surplus heat stored for use by building systems as well as operating the microturbines continuously with the additional power generated exported and sold to the provincial electricity grid. The dynamic modeling scenarios considered (through the full annual operating cycle) include a number of different equipment and operating scenarios: 1) CHP system operating at full capacity with surplus power exported to the grid 2) CHP system operating to meet the building's electric power demand (electrical load-following) 3) Scenario's 1 and 2 above re-run without the diurnal storage capacity The modeling results showed that there were clear operating savings associated with diurnal storage. Not surprisingly, running the generators at full capacity with a net-metering buy-back scheme is less attractive than running the generators using load-following; as the buy-back rate increases, there is a tipping-point where full capacity runs make economical sense. An unanticipated result was that although the day-time grid demand can be effectively eliminated, the current building operating strategy will result in significant night time power demand. Consideration will be given to changing the building operating strategy to reduce these loads.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953707241

Peugeot, 92563 Rueil-Malmaison Cedex, France","Underground storage is a technology applied since 1915 to the storage of large quantities of compressed natural gas (CNG). The main options available encompass reservoir storage in oil and gas fields or in aquifers, and storage in salt leached caverns. Underground natural gas storage (UGS) facilities developed rapidly and ensured originally a triple role of securing strategic supply, covering seasonal swing in demand and contributing to overall optimisation of the gas grid management. The technology used in the UGS industry called on proven solutions originating mainly from the oil and gas industry. As gas markets developed, and quite recently as an answer to drastic changes entailed by the liberalisation of the gas industry in mature gas countries, the UGS industry had to call on new techniques and approaches to answer new challenges in terms of performance, flexibility, safety, environmental impact, societal acceptance and economic efficiency. New technology was introduced for upgrading the existing UGS to more flexible and efficient storage facilities and for implementing new generation grass root UGS projects; and innovative approaches were developed in the field of usage and marketing of UGS. The corresponding innovation effort consisted mainly in the improvement of existing techniques or the adaptation of technology used in other industries (such as the Oil and Gas Exploration and Production or the Information Technology). In parallel, new types of UGS facilities emerged to overcome the absence of geological conditions suitable to the more traditional UGS techniques, in areas where a need for storage capacity had been identified (CNG storage in lined rock caverns), or to answer storage demand for new products (LNG storage in underground lined caverns, storage of DME produced by Gas -or Coal- to Liquid conversion processes or storage of Hydrogen). Additionally, new forms of underground storage of energy are currently investigated such as Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), whereas the storage of CO2 which widely calls on UGS storage techniques, contributes to trigger a large R&amp;D effort with a view to bridge the gap between the time scale applicable to underground storage of natural gas and the much longer time frame required to be considered for CO2 sequestration. Based on the above, the UGS industry is believed to have a bright future, combining the continuous improvement of its more conventional techniques to serve evolving natural gas markets, and the development of innovative new underground storage techniques to safely and economically store the energy of tomorrow.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953706162

Hydrogen gas, both as energetic vector and as non-greenhouse gas, is therefore of prime interest to help solve them: it can indeed be produced by numerous sources (natural gas, nuclear power-plants, coke,...) and also by different renewable energies (biomass, solar, wind-machines). However, in specific conditions, hydrogen gas can weaken metallic materials, notably high strength steel containing ferritic phases; From about twenty years ago, high ferritic-pearlitic steel grade like X80, has been developed and is nowadays used for new natural gas transmission pipelines at high pressure. Some money is saved through wall thickness reduction and eased time-consuming welding. But this high strength steel is not yet selected for hydrogen gas pipelines which are limited to low and medium grades to avoid risks of brittle failures by hydrogen interaction. The ""CATHY-GDF"" project explores the ability of commercial X80 steel grade for transmission or storage of high pressurised hydrogen gas in large diameter pipeline (36′). The project focuses on base metal as well as girth weld in high hydrogen gas pressure environment. This 3-year project is granted by the French National Agency for Research and brings together French industrial and academic partners: GDF Suez, CEA, Air Liquide, and CNRS-LIMHP*.

In underground gas storage sector and operation of gas transportation system there are following sources of pollution: booster compressor stations, gas distribution stations, boilers, production wells, gas pipelines, etc. Though one of the major source of atmospheric contamination is automobile transport. To reduce the share of emissions in atmosphere, injection of industrial gases into geological reservoirs and depleted fields may be used. For this purpose underground gas storage construction technologies may be employed. Technological process of industrial emissions sequestration has several stages: catching, concentrating, transporting and storing. CO2 as a component of power plant gaseous emissions is the major chemical substance which is to be injected into reservoirs. This work treats physical and chemical processes in a layer caused by industrial gases injection, with regards to changes in electro-kinetic and thermodynamic properties. Surface of a solid particle which comes in contact with aqueous electrolyte (formation water) spontaneously acquires a surface electric charge which is compensated by counter-ions. As a result, a double electric layer (DEL) is formed on the edge of interface «solid - liquid - gas». Formation of DEL takes place spontaneously as a consequence of surface energy approaching to a minimum and in connection with specific properties of interface «solid - liquid - gas». Movement of phases under external mechanical force leads to displacement of charges and to occurrence of potential gradient in a direction of displacement. To characterize this potential in pore structure the concept of Τ-potential is used. Due to comprehensive investigations of physical, chemical, electrokinetic, corrosive phenomena and reservoir properties observed during injection of CO2 and liquefied gas mixtures in a reservoir, the movement of CO2/water or liquefied gas mixture/water front can be mapped by means of computer tomogram. With the objective of full scale testing the core storage from all Russian UGS was organized, and sampling of gas industrial emissions discharged at different compressor operation stages was provided. As soon as leakages of industrial emissions stored in a reservoir may occur during the storage period, much attention should be paid to risk minimization. The former investigations enable using UGS construction and operation experience to prevent leakage risks. To evaluate leakage risks associated with gas industrial emissions sequestration in depleted oil &amp; gas fields and storage sites constructed in compliance with UGS construction technologies in porous formations methods and routines accepted for UGS are used. For gas leakage elimination, a monitoring and remedial strategy is adopted. The available monitoring methods prove to be efficient. The environmental monitoring procedure complies with methods and regulations adopted in gas industry. To carry out the environmental monitoring the source data on environment contamination by production facilities is provisioned. This research has the objective of studying behavior of gases injected into system of layers under influence of mineralized formation water, high temperatures and pressure.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953692958

These distributed energy resources have production patterns, which are either partially stochastic (e.g. wind, solar cells) or are coupled to the primary user process (e.g. co-generation of heat and electricity). Furthermore, on the demand-side, and increasingly on the electricity storage side, opportunities exist for actively serving stability applications in the grid by real-time supply/demand coordination. In the future, an information and communication layer for grid coordination could serve a portfolio of ICT-applications on timescales running from seconds to hours. To get a grip on these (r)evolutionary developments, possibly toppling the electricity grid, in this paper, architecture requirements for future high proportion DG-RES electricity grids are collected from a Power Electronics System point of view as well as from an ICT point of view using an inventory of business models in the power grid that focus on coordination of multiple small-scale DG-RES resources. Modeled from an ICT point-of-view, these give rise to architectures for applications that can successively be implemented in hardware and software as active components in the distribution grid. A number of possible grid control strategy coordination patterns (GCPs), which are defined in a generic, reusable manner, can be seen to emerge. GCPs, connected and intertwined to one another on several layers (physical, commercial) of the grid, together, can provide the framework for coordination in the overall intelligent grid. Bottom-up approaches of implementing coordination in future active grids appear to be the method of choice to use in implementing the GCPs. Software agents [2], [3] coordinating primary processes using market algorithms, as implemented in the PowerMatcher approach [3]-[4], appear to be very suited for this.",,"Active components; Active control; Bottom up approach; Business models; Co-generation; Demand-side; Distributed energies; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution grid; Electricity grids; Energy infrastructures; Evolutionary development; Grid control; Hardware and software; Heat and electricity; Information and communication; Multi-Agent; Power electronics systems; Power grids; Production patterns; Renewable energy source; Time-scales; Control system analysis; Electric energy storage; Energy resources; Galerkin methods; Power electronics; Power generation; Software agents; Wind power; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952390100

This chapter presents the overall background on which this approach is based, then reviews the different capture technologies and finally discusses the different options for underground storage. Carbon dioxide is responsible for about 60% of the present-day additional radiative forcing in the atmosphere. CCS has an important and inevitable energy cost, implying that when it is applied, more primary energy is needed and, ultimately, more CO2 is generated to produce a given amount of final energy. Carbon dioxide capture has been applied to industrial gas streams for almost a century, for process purposes but not for storage purposes. The main applications were ""sweetening"" of natural gas and treatment of ""synthesis gas"" for the manufacture of ammonia and methanol. In the present context, CO2 captures producing a concentrated stream of CO2, suitable for transport and subsequent storage, starting with dilute effluents. There are a number of potential geological reservoirs that can be considered as storage options for captured CO2. These storage options include depleted oil and gas fields, CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR), CO2 enhanced gas recovery (EGR), CO2 enhanced coal-bed methane recovery (ECBM), deep saline aquifers and other storage options. There is little experience of combining capture, transport and storage of CO2 in a fully integrated system, and none applied to large-scale power plants. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950573106

Because these schemes did not consider features of WSNs and its applications, they consume a lot of energy caused by long execution times, and waste the memory space caused by fragmentation. In this paper, we found features of WSNs applications and made the model which adapts these issues. Through this research, we suggest the slab allocator that reduces the execution time and the memory management space. Also, we evaluate the performance of our scheme by comparing to one of the previous systems.","Dynamic memory management; Performance evaluation; Sensor operating system; Slab","Allocators; Dynamic memory allocation; Dynamic memory management; Execution time; General purpose; Memory management; Memory space; Operating systems; Performance evaluation; Computer operating systems; Energy conversion; Sensor networks; Storage allocation (computer); Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76749131117

Laser cleaning is a potential technology to remove various pollutants on a wafer surface. The stripping of the photoresist (PR) layer on a silicon wafer was investigated by using the line beam of a KrF excimer laser with a wavelength of 248 nm. The silicon wafer surfaces were measured by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the compositions of the PR covered wafers were determined by an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). PR layers with various thickness were removed perfectly at an energy density of 600 mJ/cm2 after a 30-pulse irradiation or less. The EDS results show that the PR layer was removed more than 95%.

The simulation of the operation of the combined nuclear-wind-hydrogen system is discussed first, where the selling and buying of electricity, the selling of excess oxygen, and the selling of heat from the stationary fuel cells is optimized to maximize profits, in the context of existent markets for all these services and products. The simulation is done in two phases: In the predispatch phase, the system model is optimized to obtain optimal hydrogen charge levels for the given operational horizons. In the second phase, a real-time dispatch is carried out on an hourly basis to optimize the operation of the system as to maximize profits, following the storage levels of the predispatch phase. Based on the operation planning and dispatch results, an economic evaluation is performed to determine the feasibility of the proposed scheme for investment purposes; this evaluation is based on calculations of modified internal rates of return and net present values for a realistic scenario. The results of these studies demonstrate that the use of hydrogen for the sole purpose of storage of electricity, in spite of oxygen and heat utilization and considering current hydrogen production and utilization technologies, is not economically feasible at this time. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Economic evaluations; Excess oxygen; Heat utilization; Hydrogen charge; Net present value; Novel methodology; Operation planning; Oxygen utilization; Real-time dispatch; Realistic scenario; Residual heat; Second phase; Stationary fuel cells; Storage level; System models; Two phasis; Wind-hydrogen system; Fuel cells; Hydrogen production; Investments; Model structures; Nuclear energy; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Optimization; Oxygen; Profitability; Sales; Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73849118199

Building on these studies, process based models were improved, as shown by a better ability to model changes in snow-covered area during the melt period. In addition, various landsurface and hydrologic models were tested, demonstrating an enhanced capability to model melt related runoff.

The evolution of the Raman spectra upon Li intercalation indicates local structural and chemical changes. For the first time, the Raman fingerprints of the different lithiated phases in the Li/V 2O5 and Li. TiO2 systems are clearly evidenced. Moreover, in the case of lithiated titanate, the theoretical analysis of the spectroscopic data based upon lattice dynamics calculation has allowed to propose a complete interpretation of the experimental Raman spectra of the lithiated phase. This provides valuable information on the Li atom positions and coordination. In particular, the high wavenumber Raman modes in the 900-950 cm-1 range can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of rather short Li-O bonds.

Different authors have correlated the energy released by the electron beam impact with the mean atomic number (Z) of the sample to study, and deduced that the nature of the scattering events induced by the electron beam is strongly controlled by the Z value. If we compare the amount of electron backscattering with respect to the response to the beam energy, and so deduce a mathematical function, for each specimen studied, using digital image processing (based on the linear transformation of grey levels range in those energies), it is possible to improve the discrimination and quantification of some phases in cements that, due to overlapping processes, until now, could not be isolated. Through these theoretical studios it is possible, for example, to identify interstitial cations that affect the Z factor of the phase, deducing for each type of energy emitted a series of mathematical functions, whose coefficients are fitted with the use of digital image techniques, allowing to improve the discrimination and quantification of certain phases in cements that appear visible as grey levels in a digital image. The electron microscope has to be set up very precisely (DW=10 mm, V0=20 KeV), being possible then to determine, from a pattern specimen, the grey levels of image histogram for those working conditions, and fit the data using a linear function - when operating in backscattering mode - that takes into account the theoretic phases deduced from the EDX (Energy Dispersive X-Ray) and the quantitative analysis of the stoichiometric formula. Given a coefficient (η) its effective Z is calculated; the measured deviation, therefore, gives the interstitial cations presence. With this tool, for example, the ettringite of gypsum is discriminated; as well as C-S-H products and C3S. Once the grey levels of the image of the surface of the sample are obtained, it is immediate to deduce by means of threshold images process (a value of limit grey level or phase identification) stereological relations (working with planar surfaces, which facilitate the treatment and the development of algorithms of mathematical morphology) and quantitative values for each phase. © 2008 Materials Research Society.",,"A-coefficient; Atomic numbers; Back-scattered; Beam energies; Cement and concretes; Complex interaction; Digital image; Digital image processing; Digital image technique; Electron backscattering; Energy dispersive x-ray; Ettringites; Grey levels; Image histograms; Incident electrons; Interstitial cations; Linear functions; Linear transformation; Mathematical functions; Overlapping process; Phase identification; Planar surface; Quantitative analysis; Quantitative values; Scattering events; Working conditions; Z value; Atoms; Backscattering; Blind source separation; Cements; Digital image storage; Electron beams; Gypsum; Image processing; Imaging systems; Mathematical morphology; Mathematical transformations; Positive ions; Scanning electron microscopy; Electrons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350326068

This will apply particularly to the transport sector. A general trend toward electric drive on-board vehicles is already evident and hydrogen converted to electricity by a fuel cell is likely to be a major source of on-board electricity. The major car manufacturers continue to invest heavily in this option and signficant government initiatives in both the USA and Canada are beginning demonstration deployments of the infrastructure needed for hydrogen refueling. However, early adoption of hydrogen as a transport fuel may well be concentrated on heavy-duty transportation: trains, ships and trucks, where battery storage of electricity is unlikely to be practical. But both hydrogen and electricity are secondary fuels and are only effective f the source of the primary energy is a low CO2 emitter such as nuclear and wind. A competitive cost is also essential and, to achieve this, one must rely on off-peak electricity prices. This paper examines historical data for electricity prices and the actual output of the main wind farms in Ontario tO show how nuclear and wind can be combined to generate hydrogen by water electrolysis at prices that are competitive with fossil-based hydrogen production. The NuWincPM concept depends on operating electrolysis cells over an extended range of current densities to accommodate the inherent variability of wind and of electricity prices as they vary in open markets. The cost of co-producing hydrogen with electricity originating from nuclear plants (80%) and from wind turbines (20%) is very close to that of production from a constantly available electricity source. In contrast, the price of hydrogen produced using electricity from wind alone is estimated to cost about $1500/tonne more than hydrogen from NuWind or nuclear alone because the electrolysis facility must be much larger (Ontario wind averages just over 30% on nameplate capacity factor) and cavern storage capacity must be much increased to accommodate the large seasonal variation in wind.",,"Battery storage; Car manufacturers; Cavern storage; Competitive costs; Electricity prices; Electricity source; Electrolysis cell; Extended range; General trends; Government initiatives; Historical data; Inherent variability; Nameplate capacity; Nuclear plant; Nuclear sources; Ontario; Open market; Peak electricity; Primary energies; Seasonal variation; Secondary fuels; Transport fuel; Transport sectors; Water electrolysis; Wind farm; Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Cell membranes; Costs; Electric drives; Electric utilities; Electricity; Electrochemistry; Electrolysis; Electrolytic cells; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Locomotives; Nameplates; Nuclear energy; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Oxygen; Railroad cars; Ships; Wind power; Hydrogen fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349858092

Korea power system has been using the Loss of Load Expectation criterion (0.5 days/year) to determine the adequacy of installed capacity (ICAP) requirement. The criterion is that load shall not exceed the available capacity, on the average, more than five days in ten years. In order to identify the relationship, this paper describes an effective algorithm for evaluating probabilistic reliability and calculating the production cost for all the generators in the system using Fast Hartley Transform (FHT). The FHT has been used in convolution process. Convolution process is not performed in the capacity domain. But original function is transformed into the frequency domain by FHT and convolution process is performed in this domain. The FHT is as fast as or faster than using FFT because the transformed function using FHT has real numbers, while the transformed function using FFT has complex numbers. The convolution becomes quite simple. In here, the scheduling of pumped-storage plants and hydro plants with energy constraints is considered. To do this, the de-convolution formula is newly derived. Also, the models which includes multi-block by loading of units to equal marginal cost levels in an economic dispatch mode and multi-state by the partial loading caused from de-rates are considered. In future, the proposed method will be useful for the reliability pricing model (RPM), which is the capacity construct to implement forward procurement of generating capacity requirement recognizing its locational value.","Fast Hartley Transform; Loss of Load Expectation; Probabilistic reliability; Supply Reserve Rate","Available capacity; Complex number; Economic Dispatch; Effective algorithms; Energy constraint; Fast Hartley Transform; Fast hartley transforms; Frequency domains; Generating capacity; Hydro plants; Installed capacity; Loss of Load Expectation; Marginal costs; Multi state; Partial loading; Power systems; Probabilistic reliability; Production cost; Pumped storage plants; Real number; Reliability criterion; Reliability pricing model; Supply Reserve Rate; Convolution; Electric load loss; Electric power transmission networks; Fast Fourier transforms; Number theory; Power transmission; Stress analysis; Reliability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349089785

Nuclear power is virtually carbon free and it contributes to energy security, being a quasi-domestic source. Whilst it cannot provide a complete answer to these challenges, it is certainly capable of providing a significant component of the answer. However, nuclear power remains controversial. In order to gain public acceptance, it is widely recognised that a number of key issues need to be addressed, amongst which is resolution of the high-level radioactive waste (HLW) (including spent fuel) disposal issue. This is an important issue for all countries with an existing nuclear programme, whether or not it is intended that nuclear power should be phased out or expanded - the waste already exists and must be managed in any event. It is equally important for countries planning a new nuclear power programme where none has previously existed. Since nuclear power was first developed over fifty years ago, HLW arisings have been stored as an interim measure. It is widely believed by experts (though not by many opponents of the nuclear industry, nor by the public) that deep geological disposal, after a reasonable cooling time in interim storage, is technically feasible and constitutes a safe option [ 1 ] at an acceptable cost. The total volume of HLW from nuclear reactors is relatively small. A key issue, however, is the time-scale for developing such a final disposal solution. Considerations of security and inter-generational equity suggest that geological disposal should be implemented as soon as possible irrespective of whether or not new arisings are created. The question of managing HLW is not necessarily related to the issue of building new nuclear power stations. However, many opponents argue that there has been insufficient demonstration of the long-term safety of deep geological disposal. The same opponents also argue that there should be a moratorium on building new nuclear power plants (NPPs) until the issue of long-term management of HLW is resolved. These arguments have a powerful influence on public opinion towards both the construction of a waste repository and the building of new NPPs. The intent of this paper (developed from the current OECD NEA study on ""Timing of High Level Waste Disposal"") is to identify and discuss some of the factors influencing the timing of the implementation of a HLW disposal strategy and to demonstrate to decision makers how these factors are affecting country strategies, based on current experience. Determining an optimum timescale of HLW disposal may be affected by a wide range of factors. The study examines how social acceptability, technical soundness, environmental responsibility and economic feasibility impact on the timing of HLW disposal and can be balanced in a national radioactive waste management strategy taking the social, political and economic environment into account. There is clear evidence that significant fractions of the public still have serious misconceptions with respect to the issues surrounding nuclear waste. The nuclear industry, together with governments in those countries who would like a component of nuclear power in their energy mix, has a responsibility for and a significant challenge in presenting its case to the public.

A safety analysis points out the absolute necessity to get rid of all organic substances in nuclear fuel long-term storage. In the past decades, R and D activities have been producing quantities of rod fuel samples embedded in polymer resins for characterization purposes. Until recently, resin has not been removed from samples and today large sample quantities have to be reprocessed. The ""STAR"" nuclear facility at CEA Cadarache in France devoted to used fuel stabilization and conditioning, recently decided to implement in the hot cell a particular process to achieve the safety requirements. In order to define a versatile process, efficient for any kind of polymer, thermal treatment has been chosen over a chemical or mechanical process. The definition of this particular thermal treatment must take into account; the hot cell environment, the nuclear safety rules and the behavior of resins. A prototypic furnace has been built for study purposes and thermal cycle validation. Today, the thermal cycle has been defined in two phases as follow: First phase: pyrolysis is used to transform resin into residues and gases. A post gas treatment will be added to the furnace for total gas oxidation. Second phase: Air thermal treatment will achieve the complete residue oxidation and guarantee a hydrogen free product. The final equipment will be available in 2009 for testing and validation cycles with a radioactive free simulator before it is to be implemented in the hot cell in 2010. © 2008 by ASME.",,"Cadarache; Fuel samples; Fuel transportations; Gas oxidation; Gas treatment; Hot Cell; Hydrogen gas; Long-term storage; Mechanical process; Nuclear facilities; Nuclear safety; Organic substances; Polymer resins; Reprocessing nuclear fuels; Safety analysis; Safety requirements; Second phase; Thermal cycle; Thermal treatment; Two phasis; Cell membranes; Fuel storage; Furnaces; Heat treatment; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear industry; Oxidation; Polymers; Radiation chemistry; Radioactivity; Resins; Safety engineering; Security systems; Thermal cycling; Nuclear fuel reprocessing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70249119318

The two options for large size plants are pumped storage hydro and Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES). In the present paper, a CAES plant both with and without water compensation, is considered. The time window is an entire year as there is a remarkable difference between the seasons. Indeed in winter and summer the price fluctuation amplitude can be profitably exploited while between seasons are less suitable in a storage perspective because of the relative flatness of the daily price pattern. The adopted strategy is based on two price thresholds: below the former, a single charging step is carried out at night, above the latter, one or more steps of electricity production are carried out at peak hours. Finally, amid the thresholds, the plant works as a mere gas turbine or is shut off. Of course the mere GT working is available only if turbo compressor and expander are consistent and this affects the performance of each machine during charge or discharge phases. The shape of the daily price pattern strongly impacts on the cash flow. The proposed model is applied to the present Italian scenario as the energy market, taxes and services are concerned. The water compensated plant attains a storage density nearly twice higher than without compensation.

An air accumulator provides pressurized air, which is passed through the expander section of the same microturbine used to charge the accumulator. The air passing through the IBC is cooled due to expansion, simultaneously providing power and cooling flow. As the microturbine is indirectly fired, the flow passing through the engine or IBC can be directly vented into the household; eliminating the need for additional heat exchangers. The size of the cycle studied is on the order of 10 kW(e), suitable for a domestic household, however the system is easily scaled for larger commercial applications. The majority of the components in the system studied are 'off the shelf products. A feasibility study was conducted to ensure the proposed system is economically competitive with systems currently used, such as individual generation provided by an air conditioner, high efficiency natural gas furnace, and grid power. Simulations were run for a full year based on actual external temperature, electrical, and thermal loads for a single family detached dwelling located in Winnipeg, Canada. Performance data was generated using MatlabTM while economic performance was determined with time-based simulations conducted using SimulinkTM. The system is designed to allow energy islanding by providing for all household energy needs throughout the year, however integration with a power grid is optional. It was found the operating costs for the proposed trigeneration system in an energy islanding mode of operation were marginally higher than individual generation (A/C unit, NG furnace, grid power) during heating modes of operation, and more expensive for cooling modes of operation. The yearly energy cost for the trigeneration system exceeded the individual generation costs by 30 to 40 %, however there remains much room for improvement to the trigeneration concept. All economic data was based upon fair market energy prices as found in central Canada.

A framework under which the system designer can optimize the performance of EHS when the channel is Rayleigh fading is developed. For example, the highest average data rate that can be supported over a Rayleigh fading channel given the energy harvesting capability, the battery power storage efficiency and the maximum allowed transmit energy per slot is derived.

In these cases, application of heat storage gives the possibility of significantly improving the energetic and economic performance of the system. This paper discusses the development and testing of an optimization model for the selection of the best operating strategy and component sizing for cogeneration systems with heat storage, based on the code DCOGEN already presented in a previous work. The model employs a multiple-step optimization approach, discussed in detail in the paper, aiming to select the best hourly operating schedule on a daily basis. Optimization allows to (i) minimize or eliminate the waste of useful heat of the cogeneration prime mover (e.g. a microturbine or a reciprocating engine) and (ii) maximize the economic benefit of running the prime mover at high load, selling excess electricity to the grid when convenient. Results show that an optimized system with heat storage can reduce the thermal power produced by the auxiliary boiler and substantially increases the primary energy savings of the cogeneration unit. The model is tested towards a real application, with time-variable loads and several day-types profiles. The discussion compares different size cogeneration systems, based on micro gas turbine and internal combustion engines. Test case specifications also include tariffs, regulatory and climate data, provided that performance of the main components are corrected as a function of load and ambient conditions.

New approach to utilization of fossil fuels through near-zero emission energy conversion systems represents an emerging opportunity for developing new concepts and designs, increasing the efficiency of the baseline combustion processes and reducing their environmental footprints, including greenhouse gas emissions, through C O2 capture and storage. Oxy-fuel combustion process provides an elegant way to address the environmental issues, in particular CO2 emissions, associated with current combustion systems. In this process nearly pure O xy gen (instead of air) is burned with fuel. The resulting flue gas is composed mainly of CO2 and H2O, and other trace contaminants (e.g., SOx, NOx and particulates). The challenge faced in the development of Oxy-fuel systems is the inability of current design configurations and materials for combustors, boilers, and turbo-machinery, to operate at the high temperatures resulting from burning the fuel in pure Oxygen. Recent development at CANMET has been focused on design of a new generation of advanced Oxy-fuel systems. These systems are very compact and can be integrated with a modified gas turbine to generate electricity, while the products of combustion can be sent to another turbine for recovery. The resulting CO2-rich stream at the outlet of the turbine is then sent to a CO2 capture and compression unit to separate and compress CO2 for pipeline transport. In this paper we present this proposed gas turbine integrated high-efficiency Oxy-fuel combustion process and its main components, including the gas turbine and heat recovery system design. Moreover, we will present the results of the overall system integration, performance modeling and simulation to develop the tools required to asses the efficiency and viability of the overall integrated system and its components.",,"Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Combustion pro-cess; Combustion systems; Conversion process; Design configurations; Environmental issues; Fossil fuel energy; Fuel combustion; Generate electricity; Heat recovery systems; High efficiency; High temperature; Integrated systems; Main component; Near-zero emissions; New approaches; New concept; Performance modeling and simulation; Pipeline transport; Primary sources; System integration; Trace contaminants; Combustion; Computer simulation; Energy conversion; Engines; Flue gases; Fossil fuels; Fuel systems; Gas turbines; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Integrated optics; Leakage (fluid); Machine design; Smoke; Turbomachinery; Waste heat; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949120975

Gas turbine performances may be reduced by site altitude and inlet losses due to air ducts and filters. Increasing inlet pressure by fans allows the restoring of gas turbine power output and efficiency at least to ISO reference conditions. Coupling such a system with inlet air cooling may completely suppress the temperature increase given by inlet air compression and the pressure losses through air coils as well; therefore, by this way, a further increase of electric energy production can be achieved. An in-house simulation code, developed for evaluating inlet air cooling system performance by cool thermal storage, has been adapted in order to also simulate off-design behaviour of boosting applied to combined cycle plants. A 127 MW reference power plant, operating in the Italian scenario, has been considered. Inlet pressure increase has been evaluated with and without inlet cooling, and in comparison with inlet cooling solution alone. Both thermodynamic and economical results have been analyzed. A parametric analysis on both system sizing parameters has been carried out. Best solution was found in coupling boosting to inlet cooling system through cool thermal storage; it produced an important increase in electric energy production.

Furthermore, power supply is usually less reliable on islands. Increasing the share of intermittent renewables like sun or wind could worsen grid stability problems. However, technical solutions that are adapted to islands' generation and grid specificities are emerging. For small generating capacities, renewable-based technologies tend to be more cost effective than a diesel generator - but they are land-consuming. Various examples show how a balanced generation mix, coupled with adapted storage means, is a potent lever for increasing the penetration of renewables. Hybrid generation systems like wind-hydro combine renewability with reliability. But as of today it seems difficult to do without fossil fuels. For renewables to become predominant, an overall reflection on an island's actual need for power reliable has to be conducted.",,"Comparative studies; Cost effective; Diesel generators; Energy mix; Generating capacity; Generation mix; Grid stability; Hybrid generation system; Power grids; Power supply; Renewable resource; Renewables; Technical solutions; Fossil fuels; Hybrid systems; Hydrocarbons; Landforms; Mesh generation; Power generation; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649671919

Distribution networks must be carefully controlled in order to maintain an acceptable power supply quality. In the current climate change and environment, wind energy will not only be able to contribute to securing Australian energy independence and climate goals in the future, it could also turn a serious energy supply problem into an opportunity in the forms of commercial benefits, technology research, exports and employment. The economic future of Australia can be planned on the basis of known and predictable cost of electricity derived from an indigenous energy source free of all the security, political, economic and environmental disadvantages associated with oil and gas. Connecting wind energy, photovoltaic and storage battery through power electronics combined with solid state circuit breakers, static condenser (STATCON) and dynamic voltage regulator (DVR) has several impacts on operation and protection aspects of the whole system network. Utilities can supply high quality power at less cost and significantly lower losses using appropriate power electronic controllers combined with non-conventional energy sources and storage battery. These concepts will also apply to uninterruptible power supplies in utilities. The aim of this paper is to analyse the dynamic behaviour of the renewable energy sources interconnected to the power grid, in terms of its stability. In particular the impact of interconnection of wind generator and photovoltaic and storage battery to the utility power grid is analysed. The main purpose of this study is to assess if renewable energy sources stay in synchronism and with power oscillations reducing to 50% in 5 seconds following a credible fault. Therefore swing curves are plotted to see the impact of renewable on the system. Studies show that for all faults under all scenarios, the system remains stable and well damped, i.e. oscillations damped to 50% within 5 seconds. Even for the most severe fault with 220kV line cleared by CB fail protection by tripping all the lines connected to 220kV bus, the system remains stable and well damped. © 2008 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC'08).",,"Australia; Cost of electricity; Distribution network; Dynamic behaviours; Dynamic stability analysis; Dynamic voltage regulators; Economic future; Electronic controllers; Energy independence; Energy source; Energy supplies; Forward looking; High quality power; Modern technologies; Non-Conventional Energy Sources; Oil and gas; Power grids; Power oscillations; Power supply quality; Renewable energy source; Solid State Circuit Breaker; STATCON; Storage battery; Swing curve; Technology research; Uninterruptible power supplies; Utility power; Whole systems; Wind energy; Wind generators; Climate change; Distributed parameter networks; Distribution of goods; Dynamic analysis; Electric batteries; Electric circuit breakers; Electric equipment protection; Electric potential; Electric power distribution; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Interconnection networks; International trade; Natural resources; Power electronics; Power generation; System stability; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649663855

The proposed BMS control strategy utilizes the dc bus power and battery state of charge (SOC) for the charging and discharging of the battery with a bidirectional converter. The bidirectional converter includes fewer components and switches, has less switching losses with zero voltage switching, and has high gain buck-boost operations. A new control algorithm of charging-discharging control for the battery storage system is proposed.

In this work, firstly, through a power flow analysis, the vehicle components are sized to meet the expected power and energy requirements of a typical 5- passenger car. Then, the model is tested numerically in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment using the Highway Fuel Economy Test drive cycle with the proposed EMS.

In particular, the requirements for the tape mass storage systems are quite strong, amounting to several PetaBytes of data that should be available for near-line access at any time. Besides the solutions already widely employed by the High Energy Physics community so far, an interesting new option showed up recently. It is based on the interaction between the General Parallel File System (GPFS) and the Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) by IBM. The new features introduced in GPFS version 3.2 allow to inteface GPFS with tape storage managers. We implemented such an interface for TSM, and performed various performance studies on a pre-production system. Together with the StoRM SRM interface, developed as a joint collaboration between INFN-CNAF and ICTP-Trieste, this solution can fulfill all the requirements of a Tier-1 WLCG centre. The first StoRM-GPFS-TSM based system has now entered its production phase at CNAF, presently adopted by the LHCb experiment. We will describe the implementation of the interface and the prototype test-bed, and we will discuss the results of some tests. ©2008 IEEE.","GPFS; HSM; Mass storage; SRM; StoRM; TSM; WLCG","GPFS; HSM; Mass storage; SRM; TSM; WLCG; Colliding beam accelerators; Experiments; High energy physics; Phase interfaces; Reluctance motors; Storms; Managers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649231491

Data centres are normally able to provide tens of petabytes of storage space through a large variety of heterogeneous storage and file systems. However, storage systems shared by applications need a common data access mechanism, which allocates storage space dynamically, manages stored content, and automatically remove unused data to avoid clogging data stores. To accommodate these needs, the concept of Storage Resource Managers (SRMs) was devised in the context of a project that involved High Energy Physics (HEP) and Nuclear Physics (NP). The Storage Resource Manager (SRM) interface specification was defined and evolved into an international collaboration in the context of the Open Grid Forum (OGF). SRM interface provides the technology needed to share geographically distributed heterogeneous storage resources, with an effective and common interface regardless of the type of the back-end system being used. By implementing the SRM interface, grid storage services provide a consistent homogeneous interface to the Grid to manage storage resource as well as advanced functionality such as dynamic space allocation and file management on shared storage systems. Within Worldwide LHC Grid project exists more than five interoperating implementations of SRM services, and every one shows peculiarity. In this paper, we describe the flexibility of StoRM service, an implementation of the Storage Resource Manager Interface version 2.2. StoRM is designed to foster the adoption of cluster file systems, and thanks to the marked flexibility, StoRM can be used in small data centre with human resource deficiency to administer an other grid service and, at the same time, capable to grow in terms of storage managed and workload. StoRM can be used to manage any storage resources with any kind of POSIX filesystem in a transparent way. As demonstration of the StoRM flexibility, the paper describes how applications scheduled via Grid can access files on a file-system directly via POSIX calls, how StoRM can be deployed in a clustered configuration to address scalability needs and finally how StoRM can be used to manage also storage classes based on Storage Cloud, like Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). ©2008 IEEE.","Storage Resource Manager, SRM, StoRM, Amazon AWS-S3","Backend system; Cluster File Systems; Data access; Data centres; Data store; File management; File systems; Filesystem; Grid projects; Grid services; Grid Storage; Human resources; Interface specification; International collaborations; Petabytes; Scientific data; Shared storage; Small data; Space allocation; Storage Resource Manager, SRM, StoRM, Amazon AWS-S3; Storage resources; Storage services; Storage spaces; Storage systems; High energy physics; International cooperation; Nuclear physics; Reluctance motors; Storms; Weather information services; Managers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649208598

Although previous approaches using graph cuts have shown good performance for image segmentation, they manually obtained prior information to estimate the data term, thus automatic image segmentation is one of issues in application using the graph cuts method. To automatically estimate the data term, GMM (Gaussian mixture model) is generally used, but it is practicable only for classes with a hyper-spherical or hyper-ellipsoidal shape, as the class was represented based on the covariance matrix centered on the mean. For arbitrary-shaped classes, this paper proposes graph cuts-based image segmentation using mean shift analysis. As prior information to estimate the data term, we use the set of mean trajectories toward each mode from initial means randomly selected in Luv feature space. Since the mean shift procedure requires many computational times, we transform features in continuous feature space into 3D discrete grid, and use 3D kernel based on the first moment in the grid, which are needed to move the means to modes. In the experiments, we investigated problems of normalized cuts-based and mean shift-based segmentation and graph cuts-based segmentation using GMM. As a result, the proposed method showed better performance than previous three methods on Berkeley segmentation dataset. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Automatic image segmentation; Color image segmentation; Computational time; Data sets; Data terms; Energy functions; Feature space; First moments; Gaussian Mixture Model; Graph cut; Image domain; Mean shift; Mean shift analysis; Normalized cuts; Prior information; Covariance matrix; Digital image storage; Magnetostrictive devices; Three dimensional; Vector quantization; Video signal processing; Image segmentation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67549119492

One of the main weak points of the fuel cell is its time constants dominated by temperature and fuel delivery system (pumps, valves, and in some cases, a hydrogen reformer). As a result, fast load demand will cause a high voltage drop in a short time, recognized as a fuel starvation phenomenon. Therefore, to employ a PEM fuel cell in dynamic applications, the electrical system must have at least an auxiliary power source to improve system performance when electrical loads at a dc bus demand high energy in a short time. The possibilities to use a supercapacitor or battery bank as an auxiliary source with a fuel cell main source is presented in detail. The very fast power response and high specific power of a supercapacitor or high specific energy of battery can complement the slower power output of the main source to produce the compatibility and performance characteristics needed in a load. The studies of two hybrid power systems for vehicle applications: a fuel cell/battery and a fuel cell/ supercapacitor hybrid power sources are explained. Experimental results in laboratory authenticate that energy storage devices can assist the fuel cell to meet the vehicle power demand and help achieve a better performance.","Battery; Converters; Energy conversion; Fuel cell; Supercapacitor","Auxiliary power; Auxiliary source; Battery; Battery banks; Bus demand; Converters; Distributed generation system; Dynamic applications; Electrical load; Electrical systems; Energy storage devices; Fuel-delivery systems; High energy; High voltage; Hybrid power sources; Hybrid power systems; Hybrid source; Load demand; PEM fuel cell; Performance characteristics; Power out put; Power sources; Specific energy; Specific power; Supercapacitor; Time constants; Vehicle applications; Vehicle power demand; Weak points; Automobile electronic equipment; Automobile parts and equipment; Capacitors; Electric automobiles; Electric power measurement; Electrochemistry; Energy conversion; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen; Power electronics; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Vehicles; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67449086363

Zones are created by using dual radio mode of sensor nodes i.e. high and low power transmission ranges define zone size. In order to realize much larger cumulative cache, a node along with its own storage utilizes storage of sensor nodes in zone formed around it. Zone size is taken such that all nodes in a zone communicate with each other in single-hop using low power radio and hence conserves energy in cumulative cache management. Considering multiple and mobile sinks in sensor field, we develop unique token based cache admission control, cache discovery and least importance based item replacement policy.

The experience shows that only large enterprises bit not SMEs could cope with the relevant aspects of stable interaction with engineering curriculum development because their internal capabilities and recruitment needs advise them to be deeply involved. This process is more intense in postgraduate studies where the level of specialization closes up the contents associated to academic curricula to job positions in industry.

Leptin is one of the most important hormones secreted by the adipocyte, with a variety of physiological roles related with the control of metabolism and energy homeostasis. One of these functions is the connection between nutritional status and immune competence. The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin has been shown to regulate the immune response both in normal as well as in pathological conditions. Leptin's modulation of the immune system is exerted at the development, proliferation, anti-apoptotic, maturation, and activation levels. The role of leptin in regulating immune response has been assessed in vitro as well as in clinical studies. Both the innate and adaptative immune responses are regulated by leptin. Every cell type involved in immunity can be modulated by leptin. In fact, leptin receptors have been found in neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, as well as belonging to the family of class I cytokine receptors. Moreover, leptin activates similar signaling pathways to those engaged by other members of the family. The overall leptin action in the immune system is a proinflammatory effect, activating proinflammatory cells, promoting T-helper 1 responses, and mediating the production of the other proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-2, or IL-6. Leptin receptor is also upregulated by proinflammatory signals. It has been shown that conditions of reduced leptin production are associated with increased infection susceptibility. Conversely, immune-mediated disorders such as autoimmune diseases are associated with increased secretion of leptin and production of proinflammatory pathogenic cytokines. Thus, leptin is a mediator of the inflammatory response, and could have also a permissive role in the development of autoimmune diseases. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Autoimmunity; Cellular immunology; Immune response; Immune tolerance; Inflammation; Leptin","cytokine; gamma interferon; interleukin 2; leptin; leptin receptor; recombinant leptin; adaptive immunity; autoimmune disease; cell migration; cell survival; cellular distribution; cytokine production; cytokine release; dendritic cell; gene expression; human; immune response; immune system; immunocompetence; immunomodulation; immunoregulation; in vitro study; innate immunity; lymphocyte proliferation; macrophage function; monocyte; natural killer cell; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; phagocytosis; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; review; T lymphocyte activation; thymus atrophy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65949091997

It is demonstrated that aquifer thermal energy storage supplemented with surface water heat collection in summer, yields sufficient heat to compensate total heat demand of a residential district. Using the urban water system as energy source makes natural gas supply obsolete, provides a CO2 reduction of 60% and is preferable in terms of costs compared to conventional gas based central heating installations. The feasibility of the urban groundwater system, urban surface water system, and the economic feasibility are determined in this paper. The local groundwater feasibility to supply the design discharge is determined by soil and aquifer characteristics from the national groundwater data-base, reference projects, and bore-hole data. A heat balance model is used to quantify effects on the water system. Internal rate of return calculation for the investments and full lifetime exploitation costs are used to determine the economic feasibility of the concept. In summer, there is a net water temperature decrease of 1.5-1.6 °C. Water quality and ecological improvement take place because a lower temperature results in increasing oxygen content. Moreover, the expected water temperature increase by climate change can be prevented. The concept is economically feasible. Considering the full lifetime and all investment and exploitation costs, the concept is more profitable than a conventional system.","Aquifer thermal energy storage; Sustainable energy; Urban water",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65449181620

A proposed parallel power converter with interleaving algorithm is chosen to boost a low dc voltage of fuel cell to a dc bus utility level. The present interleaved step-up converter is composed of two identical boost converters connected in parallel. Modules are controlled by interleaved switching signals, which have the same switching frequency and the same phase shift. During the past decade, power electronics research has focused on the development of interleaved parallel converters. For an interleaving technique with a real fuel cell source, this work is the first presentation; it is not just a fuel cell simulation. So, the design and experimental verification of 1.2-kW prototype converter at a switching frequency of 25 kHz connected with a Nexa™ PEM fuel cell system (1.2-kW, 46-A) in a laboratory are presented. Experimental results corroborate the excellent system performances. The fuel cell ripple current can be reduced. As a result, the fuel cell mean current is nearly equal to the fuel cell rms current.","Converters; Current control; Energy conversion; Fuel cell; Storage device","BOOST converter; Bus utility; Cell sources; Converters; Current control; DC voltage; Distributed systems; Experimental verification; Fuel cell generators; Fuel cell simulation; Fuel-cell power sources; High-power; Interleaved boost converters; Interleaving algorithms; Interleaving technique; Mean currents; Parallel converter; PEM fuel cell system; Power electronics research; Prototype converter; Ripple currents; Step-up converter; Storage device; Switching signals; Cells; Electric current control; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electrochemistry; Energy conversion; Fuel cells; Parallel algorithms; Power converters; Power electronics; Switching frequency; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65149099074

These sources are, in general, a mix of non-conventional (e.g. wind, photovoltaic etc.) and/or conventional sources. An HDGS can either be grid connected or stand alone system. In what proportion should the energy be drawn from each source of the HDGS is a critical issue which affects the per unit cost of the generated electric power. This paper presents an optimization algorithm, suitable for use by the utility, for economical and optimal use of energy from different sources. An example HDGS with wind and FV sources is considered. But the algorithm can be extended to any number of sources. An HDGS is normally supported by a back-up (storage) medium like battery or a fuel cell stack. The proposed algorithm considers the Levelised Unit Cost of Electricity (LUCE) and also takes into account the backup source(s). LUCE of the example hybrid system has been estimated and its sensitivity to factors such as the energy produced by the system, battery life, optimal sharing of excess energy storage between the battery and the fuel cell stack etc. is analyzed in detail.

A photovoltaic device based that has been decorated with CdS QDs yields power conversion efficiency over 4 times greater than that for a similar device without CdS QDs.

In the first step of this experimental research, edible rice bran oil used as test material and converted into methyl ester and non-edible jatropha vegetable oil is converted into jatropha oil methyl ester, which are known as biodiesel and they are prepared in the presence of homogeneous acid catalyst and optimized their operating parameters like reaction temperature, quantity of alcohol and the catalyst require ment, stirring rate and time of esterification. In the second step, the physical properties such as density, flash point, kinematic viscosity, cloud point, and pour point were found out for the above vegetable oils and their methyl esters. The same characteristics study was also carried out for the diesel fuel for obtaining the baseline data for analysis. The values obtained from the rice bran oil methyl ester and jatropha oil methyl ester are closely matched with the values of conventional diesel and it can be used in the existing diesel engine with out any hardware modification.

Comparing with conventional wire bonding interconnection package method, flip chip interconnection can offer excellent electrical performance, very small chip size packages and high input/output handling capability. Recently, organic substrates have replaced conventional ceramic substrate. It is due to that the organic substrate can provide a minimal board area requirement, such as a reduction in weight and height profile. Therefore, the interconnection of flip chip was made of high melting solders on the chip combined with low melting solders on the organic substrates. Solder joint fatigue failure is a serious reliability concern in area technologies. Different test environment induced solder joint microstructure change and intermetalic compound growth, such as the thermal cycle test, high temperature and mechanical bending cycle. Therefore, the solder joint microstructures is the important information to find out the root cause of failure for varied test environment. In this study, the microstructure of high lead bump attached on 63Sn/37Pb solder substrate is investigated. Back scattered scanning electron microscopy (BS-SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) were employed to examine the morphology and the composition of combination solders and intermetallic compounds layers. The solder microstructure of the change with the reflow process, high temperature storage test and mechanical 3 point bending cycle test is observed. There are three kind of loading force, as 5, 30 and 45 psi. The study results showed that the solder microstructure coarsened and intermetallic compound layers grew after solid aging condition. Most of Sn phase congregated at the substrate side and coarsening. If the solid aging time increases, the Sn phase in the solder is gradually consumed and diffuses to the interface of bump and substrate side to form the IMC formation. © 2008 IEEE.","95Pb/5Snbump; Fatigue; Flip chip","3-point bending; 95Pb/5Snbump; Aging conditions; Aging time; Area requirements; Back-scattered; Ceramic substrates; Electrical performance; Energy-dispersive x-rays; Fatigue; Flip chip; Flip chip interconnections; Flip chip technologies; Handling capabilities; Height profiles; High melting; High temperature storage tests; High temperatures; Input/output; Intermetallic compound layers; Intermetallic compounds; Loading forces; Low melting; Mechanical bending; Organic substrates; Reflow process; Root cause of failures; Sem; Small chip sizes; Solder bumps; Solder joint fatigues; Solder joint microstructures; Solder microstructures; Test environments; Thermal cycle tests; Wire bondings; Brazing; Chip scale packages; Electric batteries; Electronic equipment manufacture; Flip chip devices; Lead; Microstructure; Microsystems; Phase interfaces; Scanning electron microscopy; Semiconducting intermetallics; Soldered joints; Soldering alloys; Technology; Testing; Tin; Welding; Substrates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64049107879

The reverse plating time, frequency, and current shape was controlled or modified to observe the influence factors on BMV filling and thickness uniformity. Pulse-reverse plating system can reduce the surface thicknesses and had good ability to filling high aspect hole. During reverse time plating, the etching rate of surface copper was larger than that of via copper and it helped the filling of BMV. It mechanism was due to the effects of geometry and surface absorption of levller. The dimple thickness showed an inverse ratio with reverse time. Reverse time dominated the reverse reaction of Cu Cu +2e-, and had influence on surface uniformity. Ferric ionic also plays an important role in the plating system. It reacts as a reductant which controls the reduction rate of Cu 2+ and prevents the formation of void in the BMV. The reverse time was control in the range of 2-8 ms.

The various factors identified as causes for the reticence can be broadly classified as Internal Barriers and External Barriers. The SMEs require support to overcome the barriers, some of which may be provided internally and some with the help of external interventions or both. With pilot exploratory interviews and a survey with SME organizations in Sri Lanka it was revealed that SMEs adopt the technologies in small but progressive steps. This created sub stages within the main stages of the roadmap. The sub stages were identified depending on the availability of technology infrastructure and applications, and also the extent of features adopted by SMEs. These findings led to the development of a model ""the eSME roadmap"" towards et transformation of SMEs in developing countries.. This paper highlights efforts towards the eSME roadmap for SMEs in developing countries taking Sri Lanka as the test bed.

Consequently, the associated GHG emissions could be potentially huge and operators are seeking options to reduce them. Among the possible options, Carbon Capture and geological Storage (CCS) appears to be the most promising option in addition to power efficiency increase and use of renewable or alternatives energies. For EHO thermal production, a huge quantity of steam is required; therefore a large quantity of CO2 per produced barrel cpuld be emitted. The existing and future boilers will have to capture these emissions efficiently, either with post-combustion like amine unit, or oxycombustion. New boilers have to be designed to integrate the most appropriate ""capture ready"" solutions. TOTAL launched at the end of 2006 an integrated CCS project at Lacq, in the South-West of France. It entails the conversion of a steam boiler into an oxy-fuel combustion unit. The pilot plant, which will produce some 40 t/h of steam, will emit up to120,000 tons of CO2 over a 2-year period. The CO2 rich flue gas will be cleaned up and compressed. The resulting CO2 will be conveyed via pipeline to a depleted gas field, 30 kilometers away, where it will be injected into a deep carbonate reservoir. CO2 injection start-up is scheduled beginning 2009. This paper demonstrates that oxycombustion could have some adavantages compared to post-combustion for CO2 capture in term of energy efficiency for steam generation. Secondly, it presents the characteristics of the 30MWth oxy-gas boiler, one of the first world industrial oxy-combustion units. Then, it focuses on the new equipment to retrofit the drum boiler to oxycombustion: the Air Separation Unit, the Oxy-combustion System developed by Air Liquide, the Flue Gas Recycle set up, the CO2 cooling, compression and drying before transportation.

The velocity of sound is related to the polymer storage modulus and density, whereas the absorption of ultrasonic waves is related to the energy dissipation in the material and, therefore, to the loss modulus. Accordingly, ultrasonic measurements have been used by several authors to monitor the evolution of the viscoelastic moduli of polymers as a function of time or temperature and, recently, become a characterization technique of its own right, generally known as ultrasonic dynamic mechanical analysis (UDMA). Often the technique is used in conjunction with rheological methods as a means of providing a better insight into the viscoelastic behavior of polymer systems. As yet UDMA is underutilized primarily because of the low operating temperatures (usually below 100°C) of commercially available ultrasonic transducers, and also due to the requirement of a coupling medium to ensure an efficient energy transfer mechanism between the transducer and the test material. Despite these limitations, this paper shows that the use of ultrasonics is potentially a powerful method for the characterization of polymers, particularly as a tool for online monitoring of events occurring during polymer processing and in the manufacture of polymer matrix composites. The aim of this paper is to review the progress made in recent years, highlighting the potential and reliability of UDMA for monitoring physical transitions in polymers such as glass transition, melting, crystallization, as well as physical changes taking place during curing of thermosetting resins. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Curing of polymers; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Thermoplastics; Viscoelastic properties; Wave propagation","Coagulation; Crystallization; Curing; Dynamic analysis; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Electroacoustic transducers; Energy dissipation; Gelation; Glass; Glass transition; Metallic matrix composites; Monitoring; Piezoelectric transducers; Polymer melts; Polymers; Processing; Reinforced plastics; Resins; Thermoplastics; Thermosets; Ultrasonic measurement; Ultrasonic testing; Ultrasonic transducers; Ultrasonic waves; Ultrasonics; Viscoelasticity; Wave propagation; Characterization techniques; Coupling mediums; Curing of polymers; Efficient energy transfers; Function of time; High-frequency dynamics; Loss modulus; Low operating temperatures; Low-intensity ultrasounds; On-line monitoring; Physical changes; Physical phenomenon; Polymer characterizations; Polymer processing; Polymer systems; Rheological methods; Storage modulus; Test materials; Thermosetting resins; Ultrasonic wave propagation; Velocity of sounds; Viscoelastic behaviors; Viscoelastic modulus; Viscoelastic properties; Polymer matrix composites",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63349109877

MEMS-based storage devices should also be energy efficient for deployment in mobile systems. The problem is that MEMS-based storage devices are mechanical, and thus consume a large amount of energy when idle. Therefore, a power management (PM) policy is needed that maximizes energy saving while minimizing performance degradation. In this work, we quantitatively demonstrate the optimal-ity of the fixed-timeout PM policy for MEMS-based storage devices. Because the media sled is suspended by springs across the head array in MEMS-based storage devices, we show that these devices (1) lack mechanical startup overhead and (2) exhibit small shutdown overhead. As a result, we show that the combination of a PM policy, that fixes the timeout in the range of 1-10 ms, and a shutdown policy, that exploits the springs, results in a near-optimal energy saving yet at a negligible loss in performance.

To perform the mission successfully, the satellite should be provided with the sufficient power until End-of-Life (EOL). To supply the sufficient power, it is not easy to install of larger power generation and storage source with power control units on satellite. Also, the thermal control is difficult in the space. The various technologies have been developed to reduce the satellite power sizing and to design power efficiently. The peak power tracking (PPT) method has been developed for spacecraft power system to use maximum available power of solar array. In general, to compensate for the solar cell's degradation at EOL in satellite, the solar array will be designed with big enough margin. And, when the spacecraft exits eclipses, the peak output power of a solar array becomes very higher than its peak output power in the normal sunlight operation power. As a result, the spacecraft power system should dissipate high excess power through shunt regulators in the beginning of mission and after eclipse exit. To avoid the high power dissipation in the beginning of life and to utilize maximum available power after eclipse exit, the PPT is used in many recent spacecraft. Particularly, this PPT method is useful for the spacecraft in lower orbit because it goes through a large number of eclipse. ©2008 IEEE.","Electrical power system (EPS); End-of-life (EOL); Peak power tracking (PPT); Satellite","Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power transmission networks; Orbits; Power transmission; Satellites; Solar cell arrays; Solar system; Beginning of lives; Electrical power system (EPS); End-of-life (EOL); Energy balance analysis; High-power; Low-earth orbits; Maximum available power; Mission performance; Operation power; Peak output power; Peak power tracking (PPT); Power control units; Shunt regulators; Small satellites; Solar arrays; Spacecraft power systems; Thermal controls; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63049131592

This paper explores the possibility of reduction in the energy dissipation in 6T-SRAM cell. This paper evaluates SRAM cell with and without introducing stacking in nanometer regime. Overall leakage in a stack of transistors reduces due to modification of gate to source voltage, threshold voltage and drain induced barrier lowering.

Because of the storage, transmission bandwidth and the limitations of the conventional compression methods, the medical imagery need to be compressed selectively to reduce the transmission time and storage cost along with the preservance of the high quality of the image. The other important reason of context based medical image compression is the high spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity requirements. In medical images, contextual region is an area which contains the most useful and important information and must be coded carefully without appreciable distortion. A novel scheme for context based coding is proposed here and yields significantly better compression rates than the general methods of JPEG and JPEG2000. In the proposed method the contextual part of the image is encoded selectively on the high priority basis with a very low compression rate (high bpp) and the background of the image is separately encoded with a low priority and a high compression rate (low bpp). As a result, high over all compression rates, better diagnostic image quality and improved performance parameters (CR, MSE, PSNR and CoC) are obtained. The experimental results have been compared to the Scaling, Maxshift, Implicit and EBCOT methods on ultrasound medical images and it is found that the proposed algorithm gives better and improved results. © 2008 IEEE.","CoC (correlation coefficient); CR (compression ratio); EBCOT (embedded block coding with optimized truncation).; MSE (mean square error); PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio)","CoC (correlation coefficient); CR (compression ratio); EBCOT (embedded block coding with optimized truncation).; MSE (mean square error); PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio); Acoustic waves; Bandwidth compression; Block codes; Compression ratio (machinery); Digital image storage; Image compression; Image quality; Mean square error; Medical imaging; Signal encoding; Signal to noise ratio; Strain energy; Ultrasonics; Ultrasonic imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63049103006

PQCC is consisted of a series voltage compensator and a parallel battery energy storage system (BESS). The series voltage compensator is composed of high performance DVR (Dynamic Voltage Restorer) with the neural network controlled voltage disturbance detector and the real-time output voltage regulator. DVR supplies the high quality power to the premium quality load by compensating the voltage disturbance such as voltage sag. On the other hand, BESS was employed to make the microgrid voltage to be stable during the isolation mode operation while to compensate the harmonic current of load and to reduce the peak load during the grid-connected mode. During the isolation mode operation, BESS can quickly respond to the sudden changes in both demand and supply of electricity that gas engine can't copy with. In addition, BESS is for the stabilization of power fluctuation caused by the uncontrollable power source such as the photovoltaic power and the wind power. During grid-connected mode operation, BESS is operated as APF (Active Power Filter) with the function of battery charger.

PSO is a powerful tool for optimizing multidimensional discontinuous nonlinearity problems. The optimization problem in power system like minimization of energy capacity of a dynamic voltage restorer is identified and analyzed in the proposed work. The growing interest in power quality has led to a variety of devices designed for mitigating power disturbances, primarily voltage sags. Among several devices, a Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is a novel custom power device proposed to compensate for voltage disturbances in a distribution system. The compensation capability of a DVR depends primarily on the maximum voltage injection ability and the amount of stored energy available within the restorer. A novel PSO based Phase Advancement Compensation(PAC) strategy is proposed in this work for optimizing the energy storage capacity of the DVR in order to enhance the voltage restoration property of the device. The proposed algorithm is tested on a sample three phase system for various levels of sag in a particular phase. The proposed algorithm identifies the required value of phase advancement angle corresponding to minimum power injection from the energy storage element such as a capacitor or a battery. The results of swarm intelligence based DVR are compared with the conventional DVR techniques and is found encouraging. ©2008 IEEE.","Dynamic voltage restorer; Particle swarm optimization; Power quality","Compensation capabilities; Custom power devices; Discontinuous nonlinearities; Distribution systems; Dynamic voltage restorer; Electric power; Energy capacities; Energy storage capacities; Minimum power injections; Optimization problems; Particle swarm optimization; Particle-swarm optimizations; Power disturbances; Power systems; Storage elements; Stored energies; Swarm intelligences; Three-phase systems; Voltage disturbances; Voltage injections; Voltage restorations; Voltage sags; Cellular automata; Electric generators; Electric measuring instruments; Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Flywheels; Power transmission; Videodisks; Voltage regulators; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62949179611

The system can be used as an effective means to improve power quality issues, such as LVRT, voltage sags, sudden load demands, etc., that encountered in typical power networks. The proposed PSCAD model consists of two separate modules- one for the SRM and the other for the grid side power interface. The SRM module has the flexibility to operate both in motoring and generating modes whereas the power interface module facilitates the bidirectional power flow between the grid and the flywheel in accordance with the mode of operation of the SRM. During standby operation of the flywheel, both modules ensure that the speed of the flywheel is maintained at the desired constant value by operating the SRM machine in the motoring mode. In the event of grid supply failure or voltage sag or sudden load increase, the modules change their mode of operation to generation, during which the flywheel provides its stored kinetic energy back into the grid.

After the induction current is turned on, a second smaller induction current triggers an external electromagnet after certain time delay, to apply a magnetic field perpendicular to the plasma axis, diverting the electrons in the conduction current 90 degree towards the fifth electrode, thus causing the charge unbalance in the conduction plasma and breaking off the main current.

To solve the problem, we first develop a minimum-cost distributed algorithm which involves only simple message-passing rules. The algorithm is then tuned to be energy-aware so that high-energy sensor nodes are preferably selected to become cluster heads (CHs), which act as encoding and relaying nodes for the raw sensing data from their corresponding one-hop member nodes. After the cluster formation phase, joint-entropy coding technique with explicit communication (specifically, foreign coding) is applied at every CH to remove possible data redundancy (due to the spatial data correlation) for in-network aggregation.

The present short-term power markets are designed for trading conventional generation. For wind generation to participate in the shortterm energy markets, lengthy wind power production forecasts are required. Since the wind power forecasts are never perfect, they lead to forecast errors in wind power prediction. The predicted wind power is bid in the power market in the 24 hours day ahead power market and that power is called contracted power. Due to the errors in the forecasting techniques, the wind power producers are penalized for the deviations from the contracted power, which lead to commercial risk to wind farm owners while advance contracting, known as imbalance cost. This paper addresses the problem of high imbalance costs and studies the optimal market structure for effective trading of wind power. The solution to the problem has been obtained with the use of grid connected wind hydrogen system.

The wind generated power is always fluctuating due to its time varying nature and causing stability problem. This weak interconnection of wind generating source in the electrical network affect the power quality and reliability. The localized energy storages shall compensate the fluctuating power and support to stabilize the weak grid. In this paper, it is proposed to control the voltage source inverter (VSI) in current control mode with energy storage, that is, batteries across the dc bus. The dc bus voltage control is obtained by using bi-directional dc/dc converter. The generated wind power can be extracted under varying wind speed and stored in the batteries. This energy storage maintains the stiff voltage across the dc bus of the voltage source inverter. The propose scheme enhances the stability and reliability of the power system. The power exchange across the wind generation and the load under dynamic situation is feasible while maintaining the power quality norms at the common point of coupling. This control strategy is evaluated on the test system under dynamic condition by using simulation. © 2008 IEEE.","Battery energy storage system; Power quality; Wind energy generating system","Battery energy storage system; Bi-directional DC/DC converters; Control strategies; Current controls; Dynamic conditions; Electrical grids; Electrical networks; Power exchanges; Power systems; Stability problems; Test systems; Time-varying; Voltage source inverters; Weak grids; Wind energy generating system; Wind energy generations; Wind generations; Wind speed; Electric generators; Electric inverters; Electric measuring instruments; Electric potential; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Flywheels; Induction motors; Mesh generation; Power converters; Power transmission; Storage (materials); System stability; Voltage regulators; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62949107085

To overcome non homogeneous background, nuclei are firstly modeled into circles with some additive noise and Laplacian of Gaussian filter as a blob-detector is applied. Then, nuclei centers are obtained by energy minimization of fast marching towards the boundaries of desired objects. Here, multiple optimal points are selected as the initial condition to avoid undersegmentation. In order to achieve higher accuracy, the system is designed in a hybrid-structure so that selectable modules will permit manual adjustment to prevent errors propagation. The appropriate centers of nuclei divide the original image into Voronoi meshes. In each mesh, geodesic active contour evolves toward the minimum energy, and the influence of internal and external forces fit the accurate nuclear edge. The algorithm is successfully applied 3D nuclei segmentation from bovine trophoblast. Experiments show that noise in images can be effectively reduced and touching in clusters can be naturally managed.","Confocal microscopy; Hybrid framework; Image segmentation; Level set","Confocal images; Energy minimizations; External forces; Fast-marching; Geodesic active contours; Hybrid framework; Initial conditions; Laplacian of gaussian filters; Level set; Level-set approaches; Minimum energies; Non-homogeneous; Nuclei segmentations; Optimal points; Original images; Voronoi; Biomedical engineering; Confocal microscopy; Digital image storage; Image segmentation; Level measurement; Quality assurance; Quality function deployment; Three dimensional; Total quality management; Edge detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62949096364

High accessibility of the sensed data can be kept by deploying the data centric storage approach in which data is stored over the nodes in the sensor network itself rather than external storages or systems. Sensor nodes themselves can be regarded as storage space in data centric sensor networks for real-time applications in which a node may store its gathered data over several nodes scattered in the particular area that is computed by a hash function, say, a geographic hash table (GHT) and later users can access to any node of them to get the data using the hashing. One of the critical problems coming up with such hash-based data centric storage scheme is that data queries from many users interested in some particular data may tend to concentrate around some specific node. Thus severe delay and power dissipation around the hot-spot would be non-trivial. In this paper, we propose an adaptive square-shaped trajectory (ASST) based data dissemination method to relieve such burden for real-time sensor networks. In the method a source node that wants to put some gathered data first establishes a square-shaped trajectory over the nodes that surround the specific position or area called target point. The nodes now on the trajectory possess the data and later, any user can access it using the hash method by developing any route to one of nodes on the square-shaped trajectory. Storing data into the near nodes from the users by considering spatial data-access locality, the proxy trajectory can be built around the hot-spot users and it can provide faster response to the users. Both width and size of the trajectory is dynamically adjustable depending upon the amount of the queries made to the node on the trajectory. This makes it feasible to distribute the query processing loads into several nodes and help the mobile users roam freely within the area they dwell without severe location registration overheads. We show with NS-2 simulator that both the delay of the query response and energy dissipation are significantly reduced compared to GHT method at cost of sacrificing data duplication over the nodes on the trajectory.","Data dissemination; Localized user; Mobile user; Proxy; Sensor networks; Trajectory","Access localities; Critical problems; Data dissemination; Data dissemination techniques; Data duplications; Data queries; Data-centric; Data-centric storages; Geographic hash-tables; Hot spots; Localized user; Location registrations; Mobile user; Non-trivial; Ns-2 simulators; Power dissipations; Proxy; Query response; Real-time applications; Real-time sensor networks; Source nodes; Spatial datum; Storage spaces; Target points; Distributed computer systems; Energy dissipation; Global system for mobile communications; Query processing; Sensor nodes; Storage (materials); Telecommunication equipment; Trajectories; Wireless networks; Sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62749100667

The severe resource constraints in a sensor node make it very challenging to secure sensor networks using existing strong security mechanisms.

In order to apply the multi-banked register file to a low-power microprocessor, we have to design a dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) approach for the MBRF to reduce its power consumption. However, when the temporary values are stored into a MBRF, their distributed storage locations will make us difficultly identifying when a register bank should be powered up or powered down. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we analyze the accessed frequencies of the temporary-values in a program and cluster them into register banks by their frequencies. The major goal is to make those infrequently accessed register banks have more opportunities to stay in the idle mode. Through a proposed DVS circuit, we can then turn these infrequently-accessed register banks into a low supply-voltage to save the static power. Simulation results show that, for a four-banked register file, on average, our approach reduces about 50% energy consumption while performance loss can be limited to less than 17%, compared to a MBRF without DVS.","Dynamic voltage scaling; Low-power register file; Register assignment","Banked register files; Distributed storages; Dynamic voltage scaling; Energy consumption; Idle modes; Low-power register file; Performance loss; Power consumption; Power-aware; Register assignment; Register banks; Simulation results; Static power; Design; Voltage stabilizing circuits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62649096302

Many efforts have been made to reduce the contamination level on the photomask surface by applying wet or dry processes. We have successfully reduced surface contamination down to subppb level for organic and inorganic chemicals. No matter how well the mask surface is cleaned, chemical contaminant cannot be perfectly eliminated from the surface. As long as contaminants exist on the surface, they are getting aggregated around certain points with higher energy to create defects on it during laser exposure. Also, the cleaned mask surface could be contaminated again during following processes such as shipping and storage. Here, we propose a new paradigm for Haze retardation where we severely decelerate defect generation and growth rather than eliminate chemical contaminants on the mask surface. We have made mask surface on which chemical contaminants are hardly accumulated to generate Haze defects even during laser exposure. By creating mask surface insensitive to chemical impurity level up to a certain degree, we are able to retard Haze occurrence much better than by reducing surface impurities down to sub-ppb level. This approach has another advantage of allowing a freedom for mask environment during the process of shipping, storage, and exposure. We further investigate how the treated mask surface should have strong resistance against chemical contaminant aggregation towards Haze defect generation around specific points with high energy. © 2008 SPIE.","Deceleration of defect creation and growth; Freedom for mask environment; Haze retardation; Insensitive to contamination level; Protective layer","Chemical contaminants; Chemical contaminations; Chemical impurities; Defect generations; Dry process; Freedom for mask environment; Haze defects; Haze retardation; High energies; Insensitive to contamination level; Laser exposures; Mask substrates; Pattern sizes; Ppb levels; Protective layer; Surface contaminations; Surface impurities; Water surfaces; Aerospace vehicles; Contamination; Defects; Impurities; Inorganic chemicals; Inorganic compounds; Organic chemicals; Photomasks; Surface defects; Agglomeration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62649086978

By using leakage inductance of the transformer, the system conversion efficiency can be improved and a simple control is achieved. Adding clamping-diodes in series with leading-leg can greatly lessen the ringing of the transformer and filter diodes. The system consists of three power stages, including a bi-directional DC-DC converter, a ZVS-FB DC/DC converter, and a DC/AC inverter. The DC/AC inverter is used to transfer the power for ac applications (110Vrms /60Hz). Due to the PEMFC cannot respond quickly, its output voltage is easily affected by load variations and polarization loss. The bi-directional converter with flexible control strategy can provide power sharing and energy storage at different conditions of the load, which makes its suitable for PEMFC powered AC applications.

Iron oxide nanoparticles were incorporated into 200 μm polystyrene microparticles for separation of particle-bound cells from non-bound cells in suspension by means of a permanent magnet. The polystyrene microparticles were further encoded with fluorescent quantum dots (QD) as identification tags to distinguish between specific microparticles in a mixture. Cluster of differentiation (CD) antibodies were displayed on the surface of the microparticles through direct adsorption and various methods of covalent attachment. In addition, a protein A coating was used to orientate the antibodies on the microparticle surface and to maximise accessibility of the antigen-binding sites. Microparticles which carried CD antibodies via covalent attachment showed greater cell attachment over those modifications that were only adsorbed to the surface through weak electrostatic interactions. Greatest extent of cell attachment was observed on microparticles modified with protein A - CD antibody conjugates. B and T lymphocytes were successfully isolated from a mixed population using two types of microparticles displaying B and T cell specific CD antibodies, respectively.

The same is true for energy derived from mineral and fossil fuel resources. Very recently, the developed & developing countries have encountered the effects of energy shortages for the first time, including increase in the prices of energy and products produced from petroleum. Nearly 85 percent of the total energy consumed today is produced from coal, natural gas and petroleum, with small amounts of hydropower and, more recently nuclear power and other non-conventional sources. Some basic strategies for energy conservation and brief information about the consumption of various energy sources by different industrials as well as by domestic sector is given with their conservation option. The basic strategy discussed in this paper can be applied to the entire spectrum of energy consuming sectors. The policy of conservation is founded on the concept that mineral resources are one-time indispensable assets.

Phospholipids make up the essential milieu of cellular membranes and act as a barrier for entry of compounds into cells. Phospholipids also function as precursors of second messengers such as diacylglycerol (DG) and inositol-1,4,5-P3. A third, and usually overlooked, function of phospholipids is the storage of energy in the form of fatty acyl components. This function is probably quantitatively important only under extreme conditions such as starvation. Phosphatidic acid (PA) is an intermediate that occurs at a branchpoint in glycerolipid biosynthesis. An important step in PA biosynthesis is the activation of fatty acids by acyl-CoA synthetases to yield acyl-CoA. Five different forms of rat acyl-CoA synthetase have been identified, each encoded by a separate gene. Distinct forms of the enzyme have been found on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM), a sub-fraction of the ER. Hence, these synthetases might provide distinct pools of acyl-CoA substrates for the biosynthesis of phospholipids and triacyglcyerols (TGs). © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Driven by the need to minimize power usage, these devices are characterized by their low-power CPUs, limited memory, slow yet vast amounts of persistent storage, and one or more wireless network interfaces. As the dominant form of future computing, understanding and adapting to the trade offs that exist between computing and communication resources and energy consumption will become increasingly important. In this paper we consider the effect of a constrained computing environment on opportunistic communication. Drawing from our experiences with two existing mobile systems, we detail the constraints that inhibit opportunistic communication. We also show how these constraints can be satisfied using a set of design principles for systems that depend on opportunistic communication.

The indices of SWOT are voted, weighted and quantified to assess the competitive strategy, from top to the bottom, meanwhile the total weighted scores method will be used to get the best strategy alternatives. The competitive strategies of the Taiwanese Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the Environmental Management Systems (EMS) are taken as a case study, where eighteen certificated ISO9000 or ISO14000 auditors (or lead auditors) are invited to establish a decision group. Under the impact of environmental factors, the results show that company's image and profitability is the most important strategy for SMEs within the global markets. Lastly, Taiwanese SMEs apperceive the significance of EMS and also recognize the importance to survive within the diversified competing market environment, whereas they need to build up its environmental management that has to suit the EMS specification and attention. The findings are also applicable for other developing countries within the global markets or barriers.","Environmental Management System (EMS); Opportunity and Threat (SWOT); Small and Medium Enterprises (SME); Strength; Weakness","Decision theory; Developing countries; Electric energy storage; Environmental management; Environmental management systems; Magnetic properties; Magnetic susceptibility; Management; Online searching; Environmental Management System (EMS); Opportunity and Threat (SWOT); Small and Medium Enterprises (SME); Strength; Weakness; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-59249104585

They are - among other reasons - caused by large amounts of stochastic generation such as wind. The inclusion of energy storage devices, distributed in future systems (distributed energy storage - DES), is continuously being mentioned as a possibility to alleviate some of the problems arising from stochastic generation. The authors show that the potential ownership of the DES systems is an important criterion on which probabilistic methods will be applied for assessment. The potential owners are either the grid operators, the generation owners, or the energy traders. For the grid operators being the DES owners, storage operation will have to be integrated into the planning of the system, therefore multivariate nonparametric time series analysis and synthesis methods have to be applied to recorded data of stochastic energy resources. Together with suited storage models, the implications of DES on the planning of the system can then be assessed. For the producers or traders being the owners of the DES, the topic to be addressed is the real-time operation of each storage device in the power system, which is linked to the optimisation of the economic value of the stochastic resources. In this case, forecasting and operations research issues are paramount. Recently developed methods including scenario development from non-parametric forecast models for the following trading period and probabilistic assessment of necessary storage capacities for hedging with given financial risks are explained. It is generally stated that the non-standard distributions of the stochastic infeeds, as well as complex chronological persistence and interdependence phenomena complicate the modelling procedure and leave space for a large range of research activities on DES in the future. The exact description of how the owners of storage assets are embedded into the energy market frameworks of the future is crucial for the probabilistic quantification of benefits introduced by DES. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Correlation; Energy storage; Forecasting; Operation; Planning; Renewable energy; Stochastic generation; Wind power","Data storage equipment; Electric load forecasting; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Energy storage; Flywheels; Forecasting; Mesh generation; Power transmission; Random processes; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Time series; Time series analysis; Correlation; Operation; Planning; Renewable energy; Stochastic generation; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-59049089718

White Rose, which attained First Oil in November 2005, has been developed using a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) concept. It is the second FPSO to operate in North America in a harsh North Atlantic environment frequented by sea ice and icebergs. This paper will describe the main attributes of the White Rose development and will cover the following areas: • Environmental Overview • Reservoir/depletion strategy • Facilities Overview including the design of the SeaRose FPSO • General overview of performance & reliability to date • Future Growth Opportunities • Project Delivery The success of the initial development, sustained strong global demand for hydrocarbons and strong performance of the SeaRose FPSO have enabled the White Rose Partners to focus on further development of the field. These growth opportunities are being developed through the SeaRose FPSO Tieback Project. The SeaRose FPSO Tieback Project is currently being progressed through the Husky Energy Project Delivery Model with First Oil from the Tieback Project scheduled for late 2009, early 2010. The project scope covers the development of three additional growth opportunities that will be tied back to the SeaRose FPSO through a series of subsea flowlines.

Based on the dielectric continuum model, the plasmon-confined phonon coupling and plasmon-symmetric () interface phonon coupling are considered. By using renormalized phonon propagators, six branches involving plasmon-like and phonon-like modes are obtained and used to study the effect on the hot-carrier average energy-loss rate (AELR). Plasmon-like modes are demonstrated to enhance the AELR around the sheet carrier density of 1011 cm-2 due to a significant contribution of the plasmon-symmetric (+) interface phonon coupled mode. The importance of interface phonon modes on the plasmon-phonon coupling (PPC) is also indicated. If the interface phonon is not considered, the AELR enhancement due to the PPC will not appear. In addition, the carrier temperature is found to be important for the AELR enhancement. As the carrier temperature is as low as possible, the AELR enhances more remarkably because the effect of reabsorption of plasmon-like modes for hot carriers (hot-plasmon effect) can be greatly suppressed. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Arsenic; Civil aviation; Continuum mechanics; Gallium; Phonons; Photolithography; Plasmons; Semiconductor quantum wells; Semiconductor quantum wires; Average energies; Carrier temperatures; Confined phonons; Coupled modes; Dielectric continuum models; Double heterojunctions; Interface phonons; Loss rates; Phonon couplings; Plasmon effects; Quantum wells; Sheet carrier densities; Optical data storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149459315

A video player may prefetch many frames to give disk an opportunity to go to standby mode, but this may cause playback to be distorted or stopped if timely power mode transitions are not incorporated. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of a data prefetching scheme for energy-aware video data retrieval for portable media players (PMP). We formulate the problem when the prefetching is used for variable-bit-rate (VBR) streams to reduce disk energy consumption and then propose a new energy-aware data retrieval scheme that prefetches video data in a just-in-time way so as to increase the period in which disk stays in standby mode while guaranteeing the real-time service. We implemented our scheme in the legacy video player called Mplayer that is typically used for Linux-based consumer devices.

In this context, the hydrodynamic transfer of two glyoxylate cycle enzymes, such as isocytrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MS), could accomplish the shift of using fat for the synthesis of glucose. Therefore, 20 mice weighing 23.37 ± 0.96 g were hydrodinamically gene transferred by administering into the tail vein a bolus with ICL and MS.

To perform the mission successfully, the satellite should be provided with the sufficient power until End-of-Life (EOL). To supply the sufficient power, it is not easy to install of larger power generation and storage source with power control units on satellite. Also, the thermal control is difficult in the space. The various technologies have been developed to reduce the satellite power sizing and to design power efficiently. The peak power tracking (PPT) method has been developed for spacecraft power system to use maximum available power of solar array. In general, to compensate for the solar cell's degradation at EOL in satellite, the solar array will be made big enough. And, when the spacecraft exits eclipses, the peak output power of a solar array becomes very higher than its peak output power in the normal sunlight operation power. As a result, the spacecraft power system should dissipate high excess power through shunt regulators at the beginning of mission and after eclipse periods. To avoid the high power dissipation at the beginning of mission and to utilize maximum available power after eclipse periods, the PPT is used in many recent spacecraft. Particularly, this PPT method is useful for the spacecraft in lower orbit because it goes through a large number of eclipse.",,"Electric network analysis; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Orbits; Power transmission; Satellites; Solar cell arrays; Solar system; Spacecraft; Spacecraft power supplies; Eclipse periods; Electrical power systems; High powers; Leo satellites; Maximum available powers; Mission performances; Operation powers; Peak output powers; Peak powers; Power control units; Power requirements; Shunt regulators; Solar arrays; Spacecraft power systems; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149187796

This paper presents an actuator model of flexoelectric membranes based on a Helmholtz free energy that incorporates tension, bending, and torsion as well as polarization and dielectric energies. The electro-elastic components of the membrane tension, moment tensor and tensor are derived and used to construct an actuator model that includes dissipation due to viscous fluids in contact with the membrane. The actuator model is expressed by a balance between the externally imposed electric forces, the viscous dissipation of the contacting fluid phases, and the elastic storage of the membrane. The nonlinearity is shown to originate in the viscous dissipation. The model is analyzed for externally imposed oscillating electric fields. The Deborah number De given by the ratio of driving frequency and the resonant frequency is shown to control the viscoelastic response. The key findings are: (i) for De « 1 the response is purely elastic and the electric energy is stored in the elastic deformations of the membrane; (ii) at larger De, the response is anharmonic and viscoelastic; (iii) due to the nature of the viscous nonlinearity only even harmonics are generated in the response; and (iv) secondary resonant frequencies appear at lower driving frequencies. These finding contribute towards the emerging understanding of flexoeletricity in biological membranes, pioneered by Petrov and co-workers (Petrov, A.G., The Lyotropic State of Matter, Gordon and Breach Science Publishers: Amsterdam, 1999).","Actuator model; Electro-elastic response; Flexoelectric membranes; Frequency response","Actuators; Biological materials; Biological membranes; Cytology; Electric field effects; Electric fields; Forced convection; Free energy; Membranes; Natural frequencies; Tensors; Viscous flow; Actuator model; Adaptive materials; Amsterdam; Deborah numbers; Driving frequencies; Elastic components; Elastic storages; Electric energies; Electric forces; Electro-elastic response; Even harmonics; External electric fields; Flexoelectric membranes; Fluid phasis; Helmholtz free energies; Lyotropic; Membrane tensions; Moment tensors; Non linearities; Nonlinear actuators; Resonant frequencies; Viscoelastic responses; Viscous dissipations; Viscous fluids; Frequency response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149152999

While other digital operations may be performed in parallel (shift, data storage, etc.), addition requires a carry propagation. Various solutions have been proposed to solve the carry propagation problem, such as carry save and redundant binary representations. The general objective of our work is to focus on the A2 binary representation and its use for neural network applications. The area and power-delay performances of redundant binary full adder cells in different CMOS logic styles for arithmetic circuits are also investigated. In this paper, a highly area-efficient CMOS adder using the arithmetic A2 redundant binary representation is presented. This structure is very suitable for implementation in VLSI of simple mixed-signal neural networks with on-chip learning. This adder is based on The Manchester carry chain with two input/output stages of trans-coding. To operate at high speed, the G-P cell that co-generates the ""Generate"" and ""Propagate"" signals has been also improved to overcome the switching delay problem.

The ESS reduces primary energy consumption without affecting transport capacity and punctuality. In addition, the ESS can stabilize the system voltage. The ESS is considered to be one of the useful devices for energy storing and recycling. This paper presents the factory test of the ESS. Characteristics with/without the ESS are also presented for comparison. The verification test in a factory focused on stabilizing voltage. The catenary voltage with the ESS did not drop.

The flywheel is supported by two radial permanent magnet passive bearings. Permanent magnet passive bearings use the repulsive forces between two sets of permanent magnets so that contact free rotation is possible. A set of voice coil actuator provides the axial stability, resulting in a complete magnetic levitation. The toroidally-wound BLDC motor which has high efficiency and little additional negative radial stiffness is used for motoring and generation.

This clustering of vascular risk factors in (visceral) obesity is often referred to as metabolic syndrome. The close relationship between an increased quantity of visceral fat, metabolic disturbances, including low-grade inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases and the unique anatomical relation to the hepatic portal circulation has led to an intense endeavour to unravel the specific endocrine functions of this visceral fat depot. The objective of this paper is to describe adipose tissue dysfunction, delineate the relation between adipose tissue dysfunction and obesity and to describe how adipose tissue dysfunction is involved in the development of diabetes mellitus type 2 and atherosclerotic vascular diseases.

In small and medium-sized enterprises, the application of security standards has an additional problem, which is the fact that they do not have enough resources to carry out an appropriate management. This security management system must have highly reduced costs for its implementation and maintenance in small and medium-sized enterprises (from here on refered to as SMEs) to be feasible. In this paper we show the practical application of our proposal for a maturity model with which to manage the security in SMEs, centring upon the phase which determines the state of the enterprise and some of the mechanisms which allow the security level to be kept up to date without the need for continuous audits.

The study of this phenomenon has attracted the attention of many scientists working in the fields of optics and condensed matter physics. This confluence of scientists has given rise to different theories, some of them controversial. The first theoretical explanation was based on the excitation of surface plasmons along the metalair interfaces. However, since periodically perforated dielectric (and perfect conductor) slabs also exhibit extraordinary transmission, diffraction by a periodic array of scatterers was later considered as the underlying physical phenomenon. From a microwave engineering point of view, periodic structures exhibiting extraordinary optical transmission are very closely related to frequency-selective surfaces. In this paper, we use simple concepts from the theory of frequency-selective surfaces, waveguides, and transmission lines to explain extraordinary transmission for both thin and thick periodically perforated perfect conductor screens. It will be shown that a simple transmission-line equivalent circuit satisfactorily accounts for extraordinary transmission, explaining all of the details of the observed transmission spectra, and easily gives predictions on many features of the phenomenon. Although the equivalent circuit is developed for perfect conductor screens, its extension to dielectric perforated slabs and/or penetrable conductors at optical frequencies is almost straightforward. Our circuit model also predicts extraordinary transmission in nonperiodic systems for which this phenomenon has not yet been reported. © 2006 IEEE.","Extraordinary transmission; Frequency-selective surfaces (FSSs); Surface plasmon polaritons","Circuit theory; Electric lines; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Energy absorption; Light; Light transmission; Optical data storage; Phonons; Photons; Plasmons; Quantum theory; Solids; Circuit models; Extraordinary Optical transmissions; Extraordinary transmission; Frequency-selective surfaces (FSSs); Metal plates; Metalair interfaces; Microwave engineerings; Optical frequencies; Optical transmissions; Periodic arrays; Physical phenomenons; Small holes; Subwavelength holes; Surface plasmon polaritons; Surface plasmons; Transmission lines; Periodic structures",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849158663

Such conditions are found in the acidic vacuoles of macrophages, which M. tuberculosis is known to target. We used DECAL (differential expression using customized amplification library) to identify the genes expressed under acidic and hypoxic conditions, following the cultivation of M. tuberculosis H37Rv at an acidic pH and/or under hypoxic or anoxic conditions in vitro. Of 960 clones analysed, 144 genes, consisting of 71 induced and 8 repressed genes, were identified by sequencing and divided into functional categories to characterize their cellular roles. In general, the genes induced under acidic and hypoxic conditions were involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (e.g. pks4), lipid metabolism, energy production (e.g. pckA) and cell wall biogenesis (e.g. Rv0696 and plcB). The combination of genes identified may explain the energy processing and energy storage of M. tuberculosis during latent infection. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the mechanism of dormancy, but they also may be useful in the design of therapeutic tools and vaccines for latent tuberculosis. © 2008 SGM.",,"acidity; anoxia; article; bacterial cell wall; bacterial gene; bacterial metabolism; bacterial strain; bacterial survival; bacterium culture; biosynthesis; cell function; clone; controlled study; differential expression using customized amplification library; energy metabolism; energy yield; gene amplification; gene expression profiling; gene identification; gene induction; gene library; gene repression; gene sequence; genetic procedures; genetic variability; hypoxia; in vitro study; lipid metabolism; metabolite; microenvironment; molecular cloning; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; priority journal; Bacterial Proteins; Culture Media; Gene Amplification; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genomic Library; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Plasmids; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749196742

Limited capabilities of sensor nodes in terms of communication, computation, and storage, present challenges to protocols designed for WSNs. Due to the severe energy constraint of sensor nodes, among the major concerns is the problem of designing efficient energy-aware routing protocols. Numerous routing protocols have been proposed in the literature. Cluster-based routing protocols for large-scale WSNs have some advantages as compared to a flat network topology. Clustering results in a reduced number of messages that propagate through the network in order to accomplish a sensing task. It also offers improved power control. Quality of Service (QoS) is becoming an important feature of data routing in WSNs. QoS is required for real-time data transmission when the result of a sensing task is dependent not only on the correct sensing of the environment but also on the timely delivery of the event notification to the monitoring center, the Sink. The emergency preparedness and response class of applications, for instance, impose delay requirements on the delivery of event notification messages. Transmitting video and imaging data poses certain bandwidth, delay, and jitter requirements on the routing protocols. Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are envisioned to improve intervehicle coordination and become a part of intelligent transport systems with an ultimate goal of increasing safety on the roads and improving travel comfort. VANETs may include WSNs that are placed along the sides of roads and provide monitoring of road conditions. Routing protocols for VANETs also aim at satisfying end-to-end QoS requirements. This paper first discusses energy-efficient clustering routing protocols for WSNs, followed by approaches aimed at satisfying QoS in WSNs and VANETS. Lastly, a discussion and comparison of features of the selected routing protocols and QoS-based approaches is presented. © 2008 Institut TELECOM and Springer-Verlag.","Energy-efficiency; Quality of service; Routing; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks","Cluster-based routing; Data routing; Data transmissions; Delay requirements; Designing efficient; Emergency preparednesses; Energy constraints; Energy-aware; Energy-efficient; Event notifications; Flat networks; Imaging datums; Intelligent transport systems; Monitoring centers; OF sensors; Remote monitoring; Road conditions; Routing; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Clustering algorithms; Electric network topology; Energy efficiency; Hybrid sensors; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Jitter; Metropolitan area networks; Quality assurance; Quality control; Quality of service; Real time systems; Roads and streets; Routing protocols; Sensor networks; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Transportation; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ad hoc networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749181292

Using a new approach, it is shown here that the protein interaction networks of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and bacteria Escherichia coli consist of two large-scale modularity layers, central and peripheral, separated by a zone of depressed modularity. This finding based on the analysis of network topology is further supported by the discovery that there are many more Gene Ontology categories (terms) and KEGG biochemical pathways that are overrepresented in the central and peripheral layers than in the intermediate zone. The categories of the central layer are mostly related to nuclear information processing, regulation and cell cycle, whereas the peripheral layer is dealing with various metabolic and energetic processes, transport and cell communication. A similar center-periphery polarization of modularity is found in the protein domain networks ('built-in interactome') and in a powergrid (as a non-biological example). These data suggest a 'polarized modularity' model of cellular networks where the central layer seems to be regulatory and to use information storage of the nucleus, whereas the peripheral layer seems devoted to more specialized tasks and environmental interactions, with a complex 'bus' between the layers. © The Author 2008.

Mullick Road, Kolkata 700032, India","Deoxyribonucleic acid is the site of storage and retrieval of genetic information through interaction with proteins and other small molecules. In the present study, the interaction of two natural cytotoxic protoberberine plant alkaloids, berberine and palmatine, and a synthetic derivative, coralyne, with mammalian herring testis DNA was investigated using a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, and optical melting experiments to characterize the energetics of their binding. The binding constants of these alkaloids to DNA under identical conditions were evaluated from the UV melting data, and the enthalpy of binding was elucidated from isothermal titration studies. The binding constants of berberine, palmatine, and coralyne to DNA were found to be 1.15 × 104, 2.84 × 104, and 3.5 × 106 M-1 at 20°C in buffer of 20 mM [Na+]. Parsing of the free energy change of the interaction observed into polyelectrolytic and nonpolyelectrolytic components suggested that although these alkaloids are charged, the major contributor of about 75% of the binding free energy arises from the nonpolyelectrolytic forces. The binding in case of palmatine and coralyne was predominantly enthalpy driven with favoring smaller entropy terms, while that of berberine was favored by both negative enthalpy and positive entropy changes. Temperature dependence of the binding enthalpies determined from ITC studies in the range 20-40°C was used to calculate the binding-induced change in heat capacity (ΔC po) values as -117, -135, and -157 cal/mol K, respectively, for berberine, palmatine, and coralyne. Taken together, the results suggest that the DNA binding of the planar synthetic coralyne is stronger and thermodynamically more favored compared to the buckled natural berberine and palmatine. © Copyright 2008, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"berberine; coralyne; DNA; palmatine; article; DNA binding; energy transfer; enthalpy; entropy; isothermal titration calorimetry; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; thermodynamics; ultraviolet radiation; Alkaloids; Animals; Berberine; Berberine Alkaloids; Calorimetry; Cytotoxins; DNA; Energy Metabolism; Male; Models, Biological; Nucleic Acid Denaturation; Osmolar Concentration; Temperature; Clupeidae; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57149104107

The silica particles, synthesized by the Stöber method, had a diameter of about 300 nm, with little size dispersion. They were deposited on glass in a hexagonal pattern by the Langmuir-Blodgett process. The resulting film consisted of a single monolayer of particles. The final step of sample preparation consisted of depositing a discontinuous gold layer on top of the 2D crystal. In order to evaluate the effects of small compositional and structural changes on the optical properties of the 2D crystal, the gold layer was applied to a thickness of less than 2 nm. Anisotropy in the metallic coating was induced by tilting the deposition angle by 10° from the vertical: a discontinuous layer was obtained on top of the particles, with elongated shapes pointing towards the source of the evaporation. The shape of the particles and the film structure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Ellipsometric measurements were performed in transmission mode in order to assess the sample anisotropy, and the plasmon response of the samples was determined by extinction measurements. The original 2D crystal presented unexpected optical and uniaxial anisotropy which was increased by a factor of 2 after gold coating. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The model is based on the concept of social networks and addresses trust at different levels: user, data, service and node. The model allows fast bootstrapping of trust by importing existing trust relationships from outside DE systems and by relying on certificates issued by trusted authorities external to the DE.

A few electrons tunnel from the channel of a metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor into the two-dimensional array of nanocrystals. A realistic three-dimensional model is proposed for electron tunneling into the floating gate. The energy subbands of the channel are explicitly included, together with the doping density. The model is solved thanks to a finite element method. Therefore many simulations can be carried out to better understand the relation between the tunneling times for charging a single NC, or the whole NC floating gate, and the geometrical parameters for example. Moreover a detailed statistical study concerning the dispersion of the relevant parameters can be led, helping the experimentalists to determine the optimal operating conditions of quantum flash memories. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Applications of KNN queries may include vehicle navigation, wildlife social discovery, and squad/platoon searching on the battlefields. Current approaches to KNN search in mobile sensor networks require a certain kind of indexing support. This index could be either a centralized spatial index or an in-network data structure that is distributed over the sensor nodes. Creation and maintenance of these index structures, to reflect the network dynamics due to sensor node mobility, may result in long query response time and low battery efficiency, thus limiting their practical use. In this paper, we propose a maintenance-free itinerary-based approach called Density-aware Itinerary KNN query processing (DIKNN). The DIKNN divides the search area into multiple cone-shape areas centered at the query point. It then performs a query dissemination and response collection itinerary in each of the cone-shape areas in parallel. The design of the DIKNN scheme takes into account several challenging issues such as the trade-off between degree of parallelism and network interference on query response time, and the dynamic adjustment of the search radius (in terms of number of hops) according to spatial irregularity or mobility of sensor nodes. To optimize the performance of DIKNN, a detailed analytical model is derived that automatically determines the most suitable degree of parallelism under various network conditions. This model is validated by extensive simulations. The simulation results show that DIKNN yields substantially better performance and scalability over previous work, both as k increases and as the sensor node mobility increases. It outperforms the second runner with up to a 50 percent saving in energy consumption and up to a 40 percent reduction in query response time, while rendering the same level of query result accuracy. © 2008 IEEE.","Distributed databases; Indexing methods; Mobile environments; Query processing; Sensor networks; Wireless communication","Data fusion; Data storage equipment; Data structures; Dynamic response; File organization; Indexing (materials working); Indexing (of information); Maintainability; Maintenance; Neural networks; Query processing; Sensor data fusion; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks; Analytical models; Degree of parallelisms; Distributed databases; Dynamic adjustments; Energy consumptions; Extensive simulations; Index structures; Indexing methods; K-nearest neighbors; KNN queries; Knn searches; Long queries; Mobile environments; Mobile sensor networks; Network conditions; Network dynamics; Number of hops; OF sensors; Practical uses; Query disseminations; Query points; Query response times; Query results; Search areas; Sensor nodes; Simulation results; Spatial indices; Spatial queries; Vehicle navigations; Wireless communication; Sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55949114131

The computational methodology is based on the point kernel technique employed in QADCGPIC (and hence QADCGGP) code. In IGSHIELD, all the features of QADCGPIC code written in FORTRAN and its user interface GUI2QAD-3D written in visual basic have been incorporated and several additional improvements have been made. The new improvements made in the code are (i) handling of multiple source shapes with accompanying energy distributions, (ii) incorporation of hexagonal cylinder as a shield body in the combinatorial geometry routine, (iii) provision to declare hexagonal cylinder and truncated right circular cone as source bodies, (iv) provision to declare point, line and plane as source bodies and (v) arbitrary orientation of sources such as cylinder, hexagonal cylinder and truncated cone. The newly introduced source bodies will be of immense use for calculations involving hexagonal shaped cylindrical sub-assemblies of fast reactors and cone shaped radioactive plume release from stack. The source array option will be of use for calculations involving stacked radioactive drums in vast storage areas. The code is validated by comparing the results with (i) simple source-shield configurations that can be solved using analytical equations and MCNP code, (ii) a point source in an infinite shield medium configuration that is solved using simple analytical equation and (iii) a standard problem in which an irradiated fuel is surrounded by various shielding materials and the problem is solved using MCNP. Several sample problems encountered in nuclear industry and other useful information required for shield designers and analysts are the other highlights of the code. The input for any kind of situations can be prepared easily using the forms that flash with appropriate prompts. Since entry of data is the important part of the input, its validity is checked immediately and the user is cautioned against incorrect data. The input module accepts only the correct data.

The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of chronic administration (13 weeks) of DHEA (5 g/kg diet) to old female rats fed on a high-fat diet on body weight and adiposity, and concretely on the expression of the adipokines related to obesity and insulin resistance, such as leptin, adiponectin and resistin. DHEA treatment induced a decrease in body weight, adipose tissue mass and serum insulin, adiponectin and leptin levels. Adiponectin mRNA expression in visceral fat depots decreased with aging, but this reduction was attenuated by DHEA treatment. DHEA treatment also stimulated resistin gene expression in the ovaric and renal adipose depots, which is associated with an increase in its circulating levels. In conclusion, DHEA treatment decreases body weight and adiposity in old female rats fed a high-fat diet, leading to an improvement of the HOMA index for insulin sensitivity, with decreasing circulating insulin levels, and preventing the age-associated decline of visceral-adipose adiponectin expression. © 2008.","Adiponectin; DHEA; Insulin resistance; Leptin; Resistin","adipocytokine; adiponectin; insulin; leptin; messenger RNA; prasterone; resistin; adipose tissue; aging; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight; chronic drug administration; controlled study; female; gene expression; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intraabdominal fat; lipid diet; lipid storage; nonhuman; obesity; protein expression; rat; senescence; Sprague Dawley rat; therapy effect; Adipocytes; Adiponectin; Aging; Animals; Appetite; Body Weight; Dehydroepiandrosterone; Energy Intake; Female; Insulin; Leptin; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Resistin; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55549137715

In this paper, a control method allowing the use of a small size dc-link capacitor for the cascade of voltage controlled-rectifier/inverter-motor drive system is proposed. This is achieved by adding the power balance equation in the system's model and the application of an exact input/output feedback linearization technique in a way that the rectifier controller compensates any sudden change in the inverter load, which is here an induction motor. Since the exact input/output feedback linearization technique is sensitive to the uncertainties over system parameters, a robust control strategy based on sliding mode controller is proposed. By this approach, the dc-link voltage becomes almost insensitive to the load variations. As a result, the level of the dc-link voltage could be stabilized with a small size dc-link capacitor. Without any considerations of the RMS current stress on this dc-link capacitor, a calculation method of a minimum value of this capacitor based on its storage energy is proposed. All the investigations are shown by computer simulations and the performance of controlled system is verified by experimentation results. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Those applications require high performance specific computation that general purpose processors can not deliver at a reasonable energy consumption. Very long instruction word architectures seem a good solution providing enough computational performance at low power with the required programmability to speed up the time to market. Those architectures rely on compiler effort to exploit the available instruction and data parallelism to keep the data path busy all the time. With the density of transistors doubling each 18 months, more and more sophisticated architectures with a high number of computational resources running in parallel are emerging. With this increasing parallel computation, the access to data is becoming the main bottleneck that limits the available parallelism. To alleviate this problem, in current embedded architectures, a special unit works in parallel with the main computing elements to ensure efficient feed and storage of the data: the address generator unit, which comes in many flavors. Future architectures will have to deal with enormous memory bandwidth in distributed memories and the development of address generators units will be crucial for effective next generation of embedded processors where global trade-offs between reaction-time, bandwidth, energy and area must be achieved. This paper provides a survey of methods and techniques that optimize the address generation process for embedded systems, explaining current research trends and needs for future. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Address generation; Embedded; Optimization","Address generation; Address generators; Computational performance; Computational resources; Computing elements; Data parallelisms; Data paths; Distributed memories; Embedded; Embedded architectures; Embedded processors; General-purpose processors; Generator units; Global trading; High-performance processors; Low powers; Memory bandwidths; Number of data; Parallel computations; Programmability; Reasonable energy; Research trends; Running-in; Speed ups; Time-to-market; Very long instruction words; Architecture; Computer programming languages; Concurrent engineering; Data storage equipment; Integrated circuits; Optimization; Program compilers; Rate constants; Surveys; Telecommunication systems; Very long instruction word architecture; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53649099340

It is flexible to support different types of sonic anemometers, it has storing capability on internal memory, and data processing capability. The software is written in the Visual Basic .NET platform, entirely based on standard Windows operating systems thus allowing easy installation and configuration for a wide range of handheld PCs. The software computes half hourly statistics and fluxes with a simplified procedure, stores binary data with efficient memory usage and can be configured to send periodically, to a remote control station, system status information and basic computations using a GSM modem. The use of a handheld computer resulted in an average real conditions power consumption of 2.9 W, very low if compared with other standard logging devices, allowing important savings especially when systems are powered with solar panels in remote areas. Compact_Eddy has been installed and tested in three locations, with very different environmental conditions ranging from eastern European mountain forests to African semi-desertic areas. The field results demonstrated that the system operated reliably, resulting to be a good low-cost alternative to laptop computers and dataloggers. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

An experimental facility, the Prova Collettori Solari (PCS), was built at the ENEA Casaccia Research Centre to test the most innovative components before industrialization and to determine the effectiveness of the foreseen thermodynamic cycle utilizing a molten salt mixture, heated in a solar collector irradiated by parabolic mirrors. In parallel with the experimental investigation, the development of a numerical tool for thermal-fluid-dynamic simulation of circuits, with such a mixture as the primary heat transfer fluid, was pursued and the RELAP5 code was modified accordingly. Thermo-physical property tables were developed for the liquid and steam phases of the molten salt mixture and inserted into the RELAP5 code. The modified code was benchmarked versus experimental data. The entire PCS facility was then simulated with various operational transients aimed at studying both the dynamic and thermal behavior of the whole system.

Ultraviolet-Visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) absorption and photoluminescence upconversion properties with the spectrochemistry of the 15K2O-15B2O3-70Sb2O 3 (mol%) glasses have been studied doping with different concentrations (0.1-1.0 wt%) of Sm2O3. UV-Vis-NIR absorption band positions have been justified with quantitative calculation of nephelauxetic parameter and covalent bonding characteristics of the host. NIR to visible upconversion has been investigated by exciting at 949 nm at room temperature. Three upconverted bands originating from the 4G5/2→6H5/2, 4G5/2→6H7/2 and 4G5/2→6H9/2 transitions are found to be centered at 566 (green, weak), 602 (orange, weak) and 636 (red, remarkably strong) nm, respectively. These bands have been explained from the evaluation of the absorption, normal (downconversion) fluorescence and excitation spectra. The upconversion processes have been explained by the excited state absorption (ESA), energy transfer (ET) and cross-relaxation (CR) mechanisms involving population of the metastable (storage) energy level (4G5/2) by multiphonon deexcitation effect. It is evident from the IRRS study that the upconversion phenomena are expedited by the low multiphonon relaxation rate in antimony glasses owing to their low phonon energy (602 cm-1, the main and highest intensity Sb-O-Sb stretching band) which is very close to that of fluoride glasses (500-600 cm-1). © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Cellular materials are often used as core in sandwich structures and their behaviour has a significant influence on the response of the sandwich under impact. Syntactic foams are widely used in many impact-absorbing applications and can be employed as sandwich core. To optimize their mechanical performance requires the characterisation of the foam behaviour at high strain rates and identification of the underlying mechanisms. Mechanical tests were conducted on syntactic foams under quasi-static and high strain rate compression loading. The material behaviour has been determined as a function of two parameters, density and strain rate. These tests were complemented by experiments on a new device installed on a flywheel. This device was designed in order to achieve compression tests on foam at intermediate strain rates. With these test machines, the dynamic compressive behaviour has been evaluated in the strain rate range up [6.7 · 10-4 s-1, 100 s-1]. Impact tests were conducted on syntactic foam plates with varying volume fractions of microspheres and impact conditions. A Design of Experiment tool was employed to identify the influence of the three parameters (microsphere volume fraction, projectile mass and height of fall) on the energy response. Microtomography was employed to visualize in 3D the deformation of the structure of hollow spheres to obtain a better understanding of the micromechanisms involved in energy absorption. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Polymer films find many applications as individual materials or as laminates with other films, foams, membranes, etc. In these cases it is necessary to improve the low intrinsic surface energy of polymer films to ensure their optimum mechanical performance. In this work, low-pressure glow discharge plasma with different gases is used to improve the adhesive properties of a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film, to obtain the optimum mechanical response of laminates with polyolefin foam for automotive applications (steering wheels). The results show a remarkable increase in T-peel strength of the adhesive joints. Furthermore, since automotive industry is characterized by high technical requirements, the evaluation of the durability of the adhesive joints (in terms of storage conditions: temperature and relative humidity) shows that the T-peel strength of adhesive joints is subjected to an aging process that slightly decreases their mechanical performance, but does not restrict the use of these laminates in automotive uses. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, mass spectrometry (MS) has been used to produce three-dimensional maps that elucidate the lipid composition of complex cellular lysates. The identification of individual lipids within these maps is slow and requires the synthesis and spiking of each candidate lipid. We present a novel MS-based technique that rapidly elucidates the atomic connectivity of the fatty acid/alcohol substituent on the sn-1 position of several different families of glycerophosphocholine-containing lipids within the confines of a chromatographic separation. Sodiated lipid species were fragmented to produce radical cations which lost successive methylene groups upon further collisional activation to reveal the identity of the parent molecule. This approach was demonstrated to be effective on isobaric members of the lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and platelet activating factor (PAF) families of glycerophospholipids. We demonstrate the application of this technique to unambiguously identify these species within complex cellular lysates and tissue extracts.

The reason for this is twofold. First of all the efficiency of a diesel generator is dependent on the ratio between the average power and the peak power of the generator. The smaller this ratio, the lower the efficiency. Furthermore some loads can regenerate energy. In small grids this energy is mostly not needed elsewhere and should be dissipated. A solution solving both above mentioned problems is using an energy storage device in the system. This storage can be used for peak shaving and storing regenerated energy. In this paper for six defined power management strategies, simulation models are developed. These strategies are: Only Generator, Peak Power Shaving, Dynamic Solution, Max On or Off, Average Power and Only Storage. In this paper a system based on a Li-ion HP battery is under consideration. Two models for the a Li-ion HP battery are compared: the simple model and the Thévenin model. It is shown that the Thévenin battery model gives the best results. Simulation results for all power management strategies are given. From this it can be concluded that the model for the Only Generator method is too simple if the voltage is under concern. For the other methods the simulation models seems to be appropriate. One problem can be observed when scaled models are used: the internal resistance of a battery doesn't scale with the same factor as the energy content. So the observations made are only an indication if a scaled model is used. From the simulations it is concluded that the power management strategies are correct. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Electric power measurement; Energy management; Lithium; Management; Power electronics; Technical presentations; Average powers; Battery models; Diesel generators; Dynamic solutions; Electricity grids; Energy contents; Energy Storage devices; Internal resistances; Peak power shavings; Peak powers; Peak shavings; Power management strategies; Scaled models; SIMPLE models; Simulation models; Simulation results; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56649088334

This thin film consists of a gold coated periodic array of hybrid material of CdSe and poly(methyl methacrylate) on indium tin oxide coated glass substrate. The main surface plasmon resonance was red shifted as we increased the column diameter of the array. By adjusting the column diameters and lattice constants of the array to coincide with the 488 nm excitation wavelength, an evident increase in luminescence intensity was obtained due to the surface plasmon resonance of gold. As a result of likely efficient energy transfer from gold surface plasmon resonance to CdSe, the photoluminescence intensity of CdSe has been increased to 248% at 570 nm.

About 70 virtual phases, of various possible structures and different alkali metal compositions are investigated by DFT simulations. The thermodynamic stability of each of the 10 phases found to exhibit relative low formation energies is tested versus the decomposition into mixtures of monoalkali hexa-alanates. Three potentially stable candidate phases are revealed. Among them, only LiNaKAlH6 may compete with the stability of the mixture of bialkali hexa-Alanate and monoalkali tetra-alanate phases according to DFT calculation. We attempt to synthesize different trialkali hexa-alanates by ball milling of NaH, LiH, KH, Al, and 2 mol % TiCl3 under hydrogen pressure of 10 MPa near room temperature. For the various tested compositions, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals only the formation of monoalkali hydrides and bialkali hexa-alanates mixed with the tetra-alanate KAlH4 phase. As a consequence of the experimental and theoretical investigations, the alternative furnished by trialkali hexa-alanates is seriously questioned. The LiNaKAlH 6 phase, the best potential candidate according to DFT calculations, was not successfully formed by ball milling synthesis. Finally, we propose a general interpretation of the relative difference of Van't Hoff plots of the first and the second dehydrogenation steps, which gives out the thermodynamic limit of alkali alanates as potential materials for on board reversible hydrogen storage. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Ball milling; Density functional theory; Experiments; Grinding (machining); Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Light metals; Lithium; Milling (machining); Milling machines; Phase diagrams; Probability density function; Sodium; Structural metals; Sulfur compounds; Thermodynamic properties; Thermodynamics; X ray analysis; X ray diffraction analysis; Alanate; Alanates; Bialkali; DFT calculations; Experimental studies; Formation energies; Hydrogen pressures; Metal compositions; Near room temperatures; Periodic density functional theories; Potential materials; Potentially stables; Thermodynamic limits; Van't Hoff plots; X-ray diffractions; Thermodynamic stability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57549092304

These aerogels are further carbonized in nitrogen in order to obtain their corresponding carbon aerogels (CA); a sample which was carbonized at 900°C was also activated in a carbon dioxide atmosphere at 900°C. The chemical reaction mechanism and optimum synthesis conditions are investigated by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermoanalyses (thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyses) with a focus on the sol-gel process. The carbon aerogels were investigated with respect to their microstructures, using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nitrogen adsorption measurements at 77 K. SAXS studies showed that micropores with a radius of gyration of &lt;0.35 ± 0.07 to 0.55 ± 0.05 nm were present, and TEM measurements and nitrogen adsorption showed that larger mesopores were also present.

The energy available from the regenerative braking of the motor is stored into supercapacitor sets placed on board and reused subsequently for the acceleration of the train. This auxiliary storage system allows the reduction of the losses on the line, because the power peaks are shaved by supercapacitors and, hence, the rms power supplied is reduced. In addition, also the energy consumption of the train can be reduced respect to traditional convoys, especially if the characteristic duty-cycle presents many accelerations and braking periods as the case of subways trains. The set of supercapacitors needs the use of an intermediate dc/dc converter in order to harmonize the voltage with that of the dc-link of the drive and control the power flows of the supercapacitors. The mathematical model of the whole system and the control strategy of energy management are presented. The actual possibilities of the energy recovery are shown by means of numeric simulations and expressed in percentage respect to the energy drawn during accelerations. The control strategy has been experimentally validated on a scale system made of an asynchronous drive supplied by a dc source and a set of supercapacitors as auxiliary storage device. © 2008 IEEE.","Energy recovery; Supercapacitors; Traction drives","Automobile electronic equipment; Braking; Capacitors; Data storage equipment; Drives; Energy management; Locomotives; Motion control; Motion planning; Photolithography; Power electronics; Railroad cars; Railroads; Traction (friction); Asynchronous drives; Control strategies; DC sources; Dc/dc converters; Duty cycles; Electrical drives; Energy consumptions; Energy recoveries; Energy recovery; Numeric simulations; Power flows; Power peaks; Railway vehicles; Regenerative braking; SCALE systems; Storage devices; Storage systems; Supercapacitors; Traction drives; Whole systems; Control systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449091600

The reason for this is twofold. First of all the efficiency of a diesel generator is dependent on the ratio between the average power and the peak power of the generator. The smaller this ratio, the lower the efficiency. Furthermore some loads can regenerate energy. In small grids this energy is mostly not needed elsewhere and should be dissipated. A solution solving both above mentioned problems is using an energy storage device in the system. This storage can be used for peak shaving and storing regenerated energy. This paper focuses on the costs of a generator-set with energy storage. This calculation is done for the general case and for six different power management strategies: Only Generator, Peak Power Shaving, Dynamic Solution, Max On or Off, Average Power and Only Storage. Calculation of the costs shows that adding an energy storage device lowers the cost for all methods. Calculations show that the Max On or Off method is the best choice. © 2008 IEEE.","Costs; Diesel driven generators; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Lithium ion battery; Power electronics; Super capacitor","Costs; Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy storage; Flywheels; Lithium; Motion control; Motion planning; Photolithography; Power electronics; Average powers; Cost evaluations; Diesel driven generators; Diesel generators; Dynamic solutions; Electricity grids; Energy Storage devices; Lithium ion battery; Peak power shavings; Peak powers; Peak shavings; Power management strategies; Super capacitor; Data storage equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449084716

The calculated potential-energy surface shows that there are two main adsorption regions: both near the OZn4 oxide cores at the vertices of the cubic skeleton of MOF-5. The adsorption energies in those regions are between 100 and 130 meV/molecule. Those adsorption regions have the shape of long, wide, and deep connected trenches and passage of the molecule between regions needs to surpass small barriers of 30-50 meV. The shape of these regions, and not only the presence of metal atoms, explains the large storage capacity measured for MOF-5. The elongated shape explains why some authors have previously identified only one type of adsorption site, associated to the Zn oxide core, and others identified two or three sites. One should consider adsorption regions rather than adsorption sites. A third region of adsorption is near the benzenic rings of the MOF-5. We have also analyzed the possibility of dissociative chemisorption. The chemisorption energy with respect to two separated H atoms is 1.33 eV/H atom; but, since dissociating the free molecule costs 4.75 eV, the physisorbed H2 molecule is more stable than the dissociated chemisorbed state by about 2 eV.

Contrary to computing focus quality locally by summing all values in a 2D or 3D window obtained after applying a focus measure, a vector consisting of seven neighboring pixels is populated for each pixel in the image volume. Each vector in the sequence is decomposed by using DWT and then PCA is applied on the energies of detailed coefficients to transform the data into eigenspace. The first feature, as it contains maximum variation, is employed to compute the depth. Though DWT and PCA are both computationally expensive transformations, the reduced data elements and algorithm iterations have made the proposed method efficient. The new approach was experimented and its performance was compared with other methods by using synthetic and real image sequences. The evaluation is gauged on the basis of unimodality, monotonicity and resolution of the focus curve. Two other global statistical metrics Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and correlation have also been applied for synthetic image sequence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of the new method.","3D shape recovery; Depth map; PCA; Shape from focus; Wavelet","Digital arithmetic; Digital image storage; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image processing; Imaging systems; Mathematical transformations; Pixels; Principal component analysis; Shape optimization; Vectors; Wavelet transforms; 3D shape recovery; Depth map; PCA; Shape from focus; Wavelet; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56249126355

In high level molding component technology development, the appearance of liquid lens has become the focus of mobile phone and digital camera companies. The liquid lens sets with solid optical lens and driving circuit has replaced the original components. As a result, the volume requirement is decreased to merely 50% of the original design. Besides, with the high focus adjusting speed, low energy requirement, high durability, and low-cost manufacturing process, the liquid lens shows advantages in the competitive market. In the past, authors only need to inspect the scrape defect made by external force for the glass lens. As to the liquid lens, authors need to inspect the state of four different structural layers due to the different design and structure. In this paper, authors apply machine vision and digital image processing technology to administer inspections in the particular layer according to the needs of users. According to our experiment results, the algorithm proposed can automatically delete non-focus background, extract the region of interest, find out and analyze the defects efficiently in the particular layer.

A flywheel would not be expected to provide effective mitigation to prevent column separation in such a long system.

It is difficult to manage because conventional chemical and physical methods are not sustainable or effective. Shading was investigated as a management technique. Floating pool covers were used to impose three shade treatments (0, 70, and 99%) at three depths (1, 2, 3 m) at a lake in subtropical Australia. The 99% shade treatment reduced biomass to zero within 120 days, and inspection found that no live material remained on or in the sediment. The 70% treatment reduced biomass at 2 and 3 m depth, but did not affect biomass at the 1-m depth. We conclude that shade can be used to create bare patches in dense cabomba infestations for subsequent revegetation, irrigation, or recreational activities. In addition, eradication of outlying populations is the most important means of reducing spread at a regional scale. There are many small farm dams and public ponds (<1 ha) in Australia with cabomba infestations (primarily brought in on eel traps). Because no viable seeds or energy storage mechanisms (i.e., tubers) are produced throughout much of cabomba's introduced range, shading can also be used to eradicate cabomba from these small outlying infestations.","Alien aquatic plant; Buoyant floating shading; Control; Eradication; Fanwort; Introduced weed; Spread reduction","Cabomba; Cabomba caroliniana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56049111661

The use of the extended invariance principle is proposed to circumvent the difficulty arising from non-negative definite terms in the time derivative of the proposed energy function.

The calculations have been carried out using plane-wave-based pseudopotential method under the formalism of density functional theory. First we have calculated the stability of the M atoms on the Mg surface. On the basis of the energetic criteria, we found that all these M atoms prefer to substitute one of the Mg atoms from the second layer than the top surface atom. In the second step we have studied the interaction of a hydrogen molecule with the clean and doped Mg surface. The results show that for M atoms at the surface, the hydrogen molecule undergoes spontaneous dissociative chemisorptions. However, for M atoms in the second layer, it requires to cross an activation barrier to undergo molecular dissociation. Furthermore, to understand the mobility of hydrogen atoms on the surface we have calculated the diffusion energy barriers for the M doped surface. Contrary to the molecular dissociation behavior, it is found that the mobility of hydrogen atoms on the surface is easier if the M atoms are placed in the second layer in comparison to that in the top surface layer. It is believed that the results of the present study provide useful information based on the first-principles calculations for synthesizing Mg based materials for hydrogen storage with optimal performance. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Atomic physics; Chemisorption; Density functional theory; Diffusion barriers; Dissociation; Flow interactions; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Lithium batteries; Magnesium printing plates; Molecules; Nickel alloys; Nonmetals; Solid state physics; Surface diffusion; Surfaces; Transition metals; Activation barriers; Diffusion energy barriers; Dissociative chemisorptions; First-principles calculations; Hydrogen atoms; Hydrogen molecules; Mg surfaces; Mg(0001) surfaces; Molecular dissociations; Optimal performances; Pseudopotential methods; Second layers; Storage materials; Top surfaces; Atoms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849093196

Despite this, there has been relatively little application of runoff generation theory to cold regions, particularly the expansive treeless environments where tundra vegetation, permafrost, and organic soils predominate. Here, the hydrological cycle is heavily influenced by 1) snow storage and release, 2) permafrost and frozen ground that restricts drainage, and 3) the water holding capacity of organic soils. While previous research has adapted temperate runoff generation concepts such as variable source area, transmissivity feedback, and fill-and-spill, there has been no runoff generation concept developed explicitly for tundra environments. Here, we propose an energy-based framework for delineating runoff contributing areas for tundra environments. Aerodynamic energy and roughness height control the end-of-winter snow water equivalent, which varies orders of magnitude across the landscape. Radiant energy in turn controls snowmelt and ground thaw rates. The combined spatial pattern of aerodynamic and radiant energy control flow pathways and the runoff contributing areas of the catchment, which are persistent on a year-to-year basis. While ground surface topography obviously plays an important role in the assessment of contributing areas, the close coupling of energy to the hydrological cycles in arctic and alpine tundra environments dictates a new paradigm.

Nodes are classified as sensor nodes and routers. Some nodes act both as sensors and routers. While traditional MAC protocols must balance between throughput, delay, and fairness concerns, WSN MAC protocols place an emphasis on energy efficiency as well. Schedule-based MAC protocols have been proposed for WSN. A common theme through all these protocols is putting radios to a low-power ""sleep mode"" either periodically or whenever possible when a node is neither receiving nor transmitting. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the Neighbor-Aware Clusterhead (NAC) under different sleep scheduling protocols. We study the characteristics and performance of the NAC protocol by means of simulation. In NAC protocol, nodes are synchronized with their clusterheads and are allowed to go into a sleep mode. The simulation provides a promising results that makes NAC protocol to be considered as a good candidate protocol for sensor network (SNET). © 2008 IEEE.","MAC; Sensor networks; Sleep-scheduling","Data storage equipment; Energy efficiency; Network protocols; Scheduling; Sensor networks; Sensors; Sleep research; Technical presentations; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless sensor networks; Candidate protocols; Centralized administrations; Low powers; MAC; Mac protocols; Mobile Hosts; Sensor nodes; Sleep modes; Sleep scheduling protocols; Sleep-scheduling; Support services; Computer networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55749088416

The results reveal that an endohedral capping of Ti is energetically favorable compared to exohedral capping, albeit marginally by ̃0.1-0.4 eV/Ti atom. However, this endohedral insertion process is difficult since it requires overcoming of a rather high energy barrier of ̃4 eV/Ti atom, as obtained from our nudge elastic band calculation of the minimum energy path. We observe that the exohedral Ti@BC4N can bind up to four hydrogen molecules with successive energies of adsorption lying in the range of ̃0.4-0.7 eV. We further predict that, at high Ti coverage, the system can absorb up to 5.6 wt % of hydrogen. After establishing the adsorption of hydrogen molecules on the Ti@BC4N nanotube, we have performed molecular dynamics simulation to understand the desorption behavior. It is observed that at 300 K the system remain stable with all four H2 attached with Ti, while at 500 K hydrogen gets released in molecular form from the Ti@BC4nanotube without breaking the cage.

First, nuclei are modelled as blobs with additive noise and a filter derived from the Laplacian of a Gaussian kernel is applied for blob detection. Second, nuclei segmentation is reformulated as a front propagation problem and the energy minimization is obtained near the boundaries of the nuclei with the Fast-Marching algorithm. For each blob, multiple locally optimized points are selected as the initial condition of the front propagation to avoid image under-segmentation. In order to achieve higher accuracy, a graphical interface is provided for users to manually correct the errors. Finally, the estimated nuclei centres are used to mesh the image with a Voronoi network. Each mesh is considered as a Geodesic Active Contour and evolves to fit the boundaries of the nuclei. Additional post-processing tools are provided to eliminate potential residual errors. The method is tested on confocal microscopy images obtained during trophoblast elongation in ruminants. Experimental results show that cell nuclei can be segmented with controlled accuracy and difficulties such as inhomogeneous background or cell coalescence can be overcome.","Confocal microscopy; Fast marching; Geodesic active contour; Image segmentation; Level-set","Computerized tomography; Confocal microscopy; Customer satisfaction; Digital image storage; Errors; Geodesy; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image segmentation; Level measurement; Mammals; Microscopic examination; Quality assurance; Quality function deployment; Signal processing; Total quality management; Blob detections; Confocal microscopy images; Energy minimizations; Fast marching; Front propagations; Gaussian kernels; Geodesic active contour; Geodesic active contours; Graphical interfaces; Hybrid frameworks; Hybrid segmentations; Initial conditions; Laplacian; Level set approaches; Level Set methods; Level-set; Marching algorithms; Nuclei segmentations; Post-processing; Residual errors; Voronoi; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55649097752

An efficient en-route data authentication method is proposed to limit data authentication within a small neighboring range. In addition, a greedy location-based secure and energy-efficient data aggregation approach is integrated with the design.

A Sheet resistance measurement, X-ray diffractometry, and cross-sectional view transmission electron microscopy analysis combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy showed that the interdiffusion between Cu and Al was retarded until 400 °C and 450 °C annealing by inserting the IPVD-TiN or IPVD-TaN between Cu and Al, respectively. Noticeably, ALD-WN prepared using a sequential supply of B2H6, WE6, and NH 3 could effectively prevent the interdiffusion of Cu and Al until 550 °C.

A model where molecular localized properties directly reflect on macroscopic behavior of a complex system has been tested in the present work, which is focused on the structural and electronic properties of the 8HQ-PS mixture modeled in a continuum scheme: one 8HQ molecule with a polarizable continuum model (PCM) whose reliability has been checked by comparison with periodic DFT calculations of 8HQ-PS crystalline structures. A comprehensive study of the keto-enolic tautomerization of 8HQ has been performed, at the DFT level using B3LYP, LC-PBE, and M052X functionals and a polarized double-ζ basis set. The energetics of the obtained structures (minima and transition states) have been refined by single point calculations at the CCSD(T) level with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. Our calculations predict the enolic tautomer to be the most stable for the isolated and PS-solvated 8HQ in its neutral form, with a tautomerization barrier much larger than the thermal energy at the working conditions. The opposite trend has been found for the charged (both positive and negative) 8HQ, with ketonic tautomers being the most stable.

This kind of networks were originally built with the idea of transmitting elementary information to external sinks for further processing and querying. Nowadays, the growth of sensors memory and computational capability together with the significant reduction of energy consumptions have changing the potential of sensor networks allowing in-network storage and processing. The W-Grid infrastructure follows a Data Centric approach that indexes data according to any number of attributes so that it is possible to query events of interest through multi-dimensional range queries. Differently from existing Data Centric solutions W-Grid does not use either sensors physical position (i.e. GPS) nor estimation of their positions. For this reason W-Grid can be applied to a wider number of scenarios than existing solutions, as it works both indoor and outdoor, and can be easily suitable to other kind of ad-hoc networks, such as mesh networks and wireless community networks. In this paper we describe how W-Grid is able to efficiently managing and querying data in wireless sensor networks and we report, by means of an extensive number of simulations, several performance measures of its efficiency in comparison with a well-know competitor solution in literature. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Ad hoc networks; Competition; Data storage equipment; Distributed computer systems; Sensor networks; Sensors; Solutions; Wireless telecommunication systems; Computational capabilities; Distributed devices; Energy consumptions; Environmental conditions; Extensive numbers; External-; Grid infrastructures; Load balancing; Mesh networks; Multi-dimensional; Multidimensional range queries; Network storages; OF sensors; Performance measures; Querying datums; Range queries; Significant reductions; Wireless ad hoc and sensor networks; Wireless Community Networks; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55149087958

For some specific classes of geometric images, this discrete set of points is sampled along a low-dimensional smooth manifold. The construction of differential operators on this lifted space allows one to compute PDE flows and perform variational optimizations. All of these schemes lead to regularizations that exploit the manifold structure of the lifted image. Depending on the specific definition of the lifting, one recovers several well-known semilocal and nonlocal denoising algorithms that can be interpreted as local estimators over a semilocal or a nonlocal manifold. This framework also allows one to define thresholding operators in adapted orthogonal bases. These bases are eigenvectors of the discrete Laplacian on a manifold adapted to the geometry of the image. Numerical results compare the efficiency of PDE flows, energy minimizations, and thresholdings in the semilocal and nonlocalsettings. The superiority of the nonlocal computations is studied through the performance of nonlinear approximation in orthogonal bases. © 2008 Society for Industrial and applied Mathematics.","Adapted bases; Image processing; Manifold; Nonlocal denoising","Aircraft engines; Differential equations; Digital image storage; Image processing; Mathematical operators; Optimization; Partial differential equations; Adapted bases; Denoising algorithms; Differential operators; Dimensional spaces; Discrete laplacian; Discrete sets; Eigen vectors; Energy minimizations; Image pixels; Manifold; Nonlinear approximations; Nonlocal denoising; Numerical results; Orthogonal bases; Regularization schemes; Smooth manifolds; Specific classes; Thresholding; Variational optimizations; Imaging systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55149083501

However, the direct effects of leptin on adipocytes have been controversial in the cellular level. In this study, the effects of leptin on rosiglitazone-induced adipocyte differentiation were investigated in the primary preadipocytes prepared from subcutaneous fat tissues of C57BL/6-Lepob/ob mouse. We found that acute and prolonged treatment of leptin on preadipocytes inhibited the rosiglitazone-induced transcription factor expression and adipocyte differentiation, respectively, accompanied with decreased expression of PPARγ and aP2. Either PD98059, an ERK inhibitor or fludarabine, a STAT1 inhibitor restored leptin-inhibited PPARγ expression and subsequent lipid accumulation, but inhibitors for PI-3K (LY294002) and for STAT3 (piceatannol) did not. Furthermore, leptin decreased PPARγ expression also in fully differentiated adipocytes, which was reversed by either PD98059 or fludarabine. Taken together, these data suggest that leptin has a direct inhibitory effect on the rosiglitazone-induced adipocyte differentiation and PPARγ expression, in which ERK1/2 MAP kinase and JAK/STAT1 signaling pathways are involved. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To understand and predict the gel rheological properties, data fitting with the Maxwell model as well as comparing the system's concentration-dependent behavior with Cates' model'for reversibly breaking chains were performed. To investigate the influence of the polymer architecture, networks were also prepared by replacing the cholesterol-derivatized 8-arm star-shaped PEG by linear bifunctional PEG-cholesterol or by using 4-arm instead of 8-arm polymers. Rheological analysis showed that the 8-arm polymer-based mixtures yielded tight viscoelastic networks, but their storage and loss moduli significantly deviated from those predicted by the Maxwell model. The scaling of the plateau moduli, relaxation times, and zero-shear viscosities with concentration for gels composed of 8-arm cholesterol- and βCD-derivatized PEG followed a power law with exponents higher than predicted by Cates' model. On the other hand, hydrogels in which linear bifunctional PEG-cholesterol was used instead of 8-arm star-shaped PEG-cholesterol or which were based on 4-arm polymers showed a substantially better fit with the Maxwell model and reduced differences between empirical and Cates' theoretical scaling exponents. Rheological analysis also showed that the hydrogels were thermoreversible. At low temperatures, the gels showed viscoelastic behavior due to slow overall relaxation of the polymer chains. At higher temperatures, however, a reduced number of βCD/cholesterol complexes and concomitant faster chain relaxation processes eventually led to liquid-like behavior. The relationship between temperature and the relaxation time was used to determine an activation energy of 46 kJ/mol for breaking and reptation of the polymers. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"ABS resins; Activation energy; Cholesterol; Colloids; Concentration (process); Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Forecasting; Gelation; Gels; Glycols; Hydrogels; Maxwell equations; Photoresists; Polyethylene oxides; Polymers; Relaxation processes; Rheology; Viscosity; Bifunctional; Chain relaxation processes; Data fittings; Higher temperatures; Hydrogel systems; Loss modulus; Low temperatures; Maxwell models; Plateau modulus; Poly(ethylene glycol); Polymer architectures; Polymer chains; Power laws; Reptation; Rheological analyses; Rheological behaviors; Rheological properties; Scaling exponents; Viscoelastic behaviors; Polyethylene glycols; beta cyclodextrin; beta cyclodextrin derivative; cholesterol; macrogol derivative; article; chemistry; flow kinetics; hydrogel; beta-Cyclodextrins; Cholesterol; Hydrogels; Polyethylene Glycols; Rheology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449121481

Frozen (-30 and -80 °C) and freeze-dried algae yielded ulvan extracts mainly composed of high molecular weight polysaccharides. These had the highest intrinsic viscosity and conservation modulus (G′) as copper/borate gels compared to ulvan from fresh algae (taken as a reference) or ulvan extracted from algae stabilized by other means. Cold stabilizations of algae yielded the lowest amounts of ulvan. High ulvan yields were obtained from Ulva air-dried at 50 and 70 °C but that at 50 °C was lower than that at 70 °C. Gelling properties and intrinsic viscosities from these ulvans were better than that of fresh algae but lower than from cold treated seaweeds. Brining induced ulvan degradation with poor rheological properties of the extracts compared to ulvan from fresh algae. However, this process appears to ease extraction of polysaccharides. Compared to fresh algae, salted seaweeds stored at room temperature yielded degraded ulvan. Decreasing the salting process temperature to 4 °C preserved ulvan composition, structure and properties. However, Ulva salting hinders drastically ulvan extraction. The different stabilization processes affected the chemical composition of ulvan extracts and in particular, sulphate and protein contents.

Glycol CTES is an application of sensible heat storage where the temperature of a storage material changes in order to store cold energy, usually generated from electricity when its cost is low. Exergoeconomic analysis combines thermodynamic analysis based on the first and second laws with principles of economics, mostly cost accounting. Exergy analysis accounts for energy quality and irreversibilities, and provides more meaningful and useful information than energy analysis about efficiency and losses. A storage tank with a capacity of 350 000 kg is considered for this investigation and a water solution based on ethylene glycol is used as the storage medium. Several thermodynamic system factors are analysed, such as change in storage temperature, coefficient of performance (COP) of the chiller, heat losses from the storage tank, and the mass flow rates. Simulation results indicate that the system exergy efficiency is much less (∼ 45%) than the energy efficiency. The average exergy efficiency of the storage tank is determined to be 35% and the average energy efficiency 80%. The system exergy efficiency is determined to be 30% and 40% at 45 and 25°C ambient temperatures, respectively. The chiller COP is observed to be strongly related to storage temperature, and to vary approximately between 2.4 and 5.8 at a 35°C ambient temperature. As ambient temperature decreases, COP increases. The exergoeconomic analysis indicates that the ratio of exergy-based thermodynamic loss to capital cost of the glycol CTES ranges from 0.00233 to 0.00225 kW $-1 at a 35°C reference environment temperature, and from 0.00235 to 0.00227 kW $-at a 25°C reference environment temperature. The reference environment temperature affects significantly exergy destruction and efficiency, e.g. a 10°C change in ambient temperature causes a 37.5% change in exergy efficiency. This result implies that cold energy is more valuable at higher ambient temperatures. Heat loss from the storage tank exhibits a mild dependence on ambient temperature, e.g. a 10°C increase in ambient temperature causes a heat loss increase of 7.1%.

An attempt has been made to utilize the maximum amount of solar energy and to reduce the heat loss from the sides and bottom of the still. The conventional still is modified with an energy storage medium of black granite gravel of 6 mm size which is provided in the basin for different (quantity) depths. The black granite gravel functions as energy storage medium and also as an insulation layer to reduce the bottom and side loss coefficients. The black gravel is used for absorbing the excess heat energy from solar radiation during the noon hours. Due to this, the heat accumulated in the space between the water and glass surface is reduced and hence the temperature difference between the water and glass surfaces increases. The depth (quantity) of the gravel layer in the basin will influence the performance of the still and some of the parameters like basin temperature, water temperature, glass temperature and still productivity. This study deals with the effect of aforesaid parameters on the performance of the still. An attempt has been made to optimize the still performance for the above-mentioned parameters. A mathematical model is developed to estimate the water, gravel, and inside glass temperatures theoretically and to estimate the hourly and daily yield. To show the effectiveness of the modification, its performance is compared with the conventional still under the same climatic condition. It is found that the still yield is increased by 17-20% with almost no cost for this modification as black granite gravel is very cheap. Error analysis was done by comparing the theoretical and experimental results to show the validity of the mathematical model. It is found that the maximum percentage of discrepancy for all the parameters is about ± 18%. Theoretical value of yield per day has 8% discrepancy over experimental value.

The definition of measurement programs is even less encouraging in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), since most of the outstanding measurement program models are not suited to these types of companies. Additionally, the literature provides few cases of measurement program implementation, which could be used as a source of reference for good practices through which to successfully perform these activities.

Thus, the dynamic performance of the flywheel is related to the electromagnetic torque for the motoring and generating power of the PMSM/G. Moreover, in the idling mode without generating loads, speed reduction of the flywheel is mainly caused by drag torque generated in the slotless iron-cored stator of this PM machine. In this paper, the operating torque, defined as the electromagnetic torque and drag toque, is estimated from the magnetic-field analysis by the PM rotor with diametrical magnetization.

The energy loss of the SFES is mainly caused by drag force induced by magnetic field parts such as the superconductor magnetic bearing (SMB) and permanent magnet (PM)-type motor/generator (PMSM/G). In this paper, a vertical-shaft-type SFES with journal-type SMB was manufactured. We assessed the characteristics of the energy loss by drag force generated in the SMB, drag force by eddy current generated in the stator core and the PM of the PMSM/G, and drag force by leakage flux. The results of quantitative assessment showed that energy loss caused by the PMSM/G was the largest. To assess energy loss caused by the PMSM/G, the characteristics of energy loss by variation of core size and by leakage flux according to core size were assessed. The new rotation-core-type PMSM/G, which can minimize energy loss, was proposed and the energy loss characteristics were assessed. © 2008 IEEE.","Drag force; Energy loss; Permanent magnet (PM)-type motor/generator (PMSM/G); Superconductor flywheel energy storage (SFES) system","Core size; Drag forces; Energy loss; Flywheel energy storage; Flywheel energy storage system; Leakage flux; Permanent magnet rotors; Practical use; Quantitative assessments; Stator core; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Flywheel propulsion; Flywheels; Magnetic bearings; Magnetic fields; Permanent magnets; Superconducting materials; Superconductivity; Wheels; Drag",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349483686

We do not claim to cover all of the theories of apatite mineralization but have tried to collect historical work in apatite biomineralization research and show how the observations in the literature may be tied together by polyphosphate chemistry and biochemistry. Enzymatic polymerization of phosphate enables an organism to store high concentrations of phosphate and calcium without risking an undesired precipitation of apatite. Enzymatic hydrolytic degradation allows for the controlled increase of orthophosphate by the destruction of polyphosphate. Polyphosphates also serve as storage sites for cations, such as calcium, and as alternate energy sources for some organisms who are exposed to anoxic environments. The sequestration power of the calcium-polyphosphate complex offers an excellent chemical method for biological control and transport of free calcium as well as phosphate concentrations within amorphous electron-dense bodies. We conclude this review by presenting the theory that the hydrolytic degradation of polyphosphates, either by spontaneous hydrolytic degradation or by controlled enzymatic hydrolytic degradation with enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, links the formation of apatite mineral to both induced and controlled biomineralization processes. A phosphatic mineral within the vertebrate skeleton offers more flexibility for metabolic processing because it can be dissolved by biologically controlled acidification and its component ions can be stored as bioavailable calcium polyphosphate complexes. This bioavailable store of the building blocks of a metabolically active apatite skeleton offers more biological processing flexibility than a skeleton composed of carbonate minerals, which do not polymerize, or a silicate skeleton, which polymerizes but is not hydrolyzed by any known biological action. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Apatite; Biochemistry; Biomineralization; Calcium; Calcium alloys; Carbonate minerals; Chemical reactions; Data storage equipment; Degradation; Dissolution; Mineralogy; Minerals; Monomers; Ocean habitats; Phosphate minerals; Phosphates; Polymers; Silica; Silicate minerals; Silicates; Alkaline phosphatases; Anoxic environments; Biological actions; Biological controls; Biological processing; Biomineralization processes; Building Blocks; Calcium polyphosphate; Chemical methods; Dense bodies; Energy sources; Enzymatic polymerizations; High concentrations; Hydrolytic degradations; Metabolic processing; Phosphate concentrations; Polyphosphate; Polyphosphates; Storage sites; Calcium phosphate; apatite; calcium; polyphosphate; animal; biochemistry; cell granule; chemistry; human; metabolism; mitochondrion; review; Animals; Apatites; Biochemical Processes; Calcium; Cytoplasmic Granules; Humans; Mitochondria; Polyphosphates",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57449098271

While UCP3's function is still unknown, it has been hypothesized to act as a fatty acid (FA) anion exporter, protecting mitochondria against lipid peroxidation and/or facilitating FA oxidation. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of long-term feeding of a 45% fat diet on whole body indicators of muscle metabolism in congenic C57BL/6 mice that were either lacking UCP3 (Ucp3-/-) or had a transgenically induced approximately twofold increase in UCP3 levels (UCP3tg). Mice were fed the high-fat (HF) diet for a period of either 4 or 8 mo immediately following weaning. After long-term HF feeding, UCP3tg mice weighed an average of 15% less than wild-type mice (P &lt; 0.05) and were 20% less metabolically efficient than both wild-type and Ucp3-/- mice (P &lt; 0.01). Additionally, wild-type mice had 21% lower, whereas UCP3tg mice had 36% lower, levels of adiposity compared with Ucp3-/- mice (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively), indicating a protective effect of UCP3 against fat gain. No differences in whole body oxygen consumption were detected following long-term HF feeding. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests revealed that both the UCP3tg and Ucp3-/- mice were more glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive compared with wild-type mice after short-term HF feeding, but this protection was not maintained in the long term.

On the other hand, optimization of industrial processes is an important goal in order to increase operation efficiency and to minimize costs. This paper deals with an experimental hybrid solar-gas desalination system designed, built, and operated at the Plataforma Solar de Almería (Spain) under the framework of a European R&D project. This desalination system, based on a multieffect distillation process, is partially powered by a low temperature static solar collector field of a compound parabolic concentrator type. With the aim of performing an optimal operation of the plant working with the solar resource, process dynamics have to be studied and modeled. This paper shows control-oriented low complexity models for the solar field and thermal storage subsystems as well as a model of the distillate production rate depending on process temperature. These models are validated with real data with the objective of being useful in the evaluation of optimal operating points, the design of operational procedures, and the establishment of adeauate control references to maximize the use of the solar resource and to improve process efficiency.

Usually its degradation reactions, being very slow, are neglected. This study reports the findings concerning the degradation kinetics of HMF, in honeys of different floral origin at a temperature between 25 and 50 °C. The results highlighted higher degradation rates (kHMF degradation) compared to the corresponding formation rates (k HMF formation) in chestnut and citrus samples. Similar k-values were found in multifloral honey. Moreover, the reaction of HMF degradation was characterized by lower activation energy (Ea) values compared to Ea formation values. The final concentration of HMF in honey, during storage at room temperature, should be ascribed to high sugar concentration. The fluctuation of HMF in honeys could depend on the equilibrium between the accumulation and the degradation processes. This can affect the validity of HMF as storage index in some honeys, above all during the analysis of those honeys whose legislation is too restrictive (citrus) or in chestnut honey analysis where it does not accumulate. © 2008 Institute of Food Technologists®.","Browning; HMF kinetics; Honey quality; Shelf life","5 hydroxymethylfurfural; 5-hydroxymethylfurfural; drug derivative; fructose; furfural; glucose; lactone; article; citrus fruit; flower; honey; kinetics; metabolism; nut; pH; standard; Citrus; Flowers; Fructose; Furaldehyde; Glucose; Honey; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Lactones; Nuts; Citrus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55649086610

Currently, Canadian Blood Services is implementing the BC method. This article summarizes results of the validation testing performed to qualify the process of PLT production from whole blood and compares the quality of PLTs produced in routine production by either the PLT-rich plasma method (PRP-PCs) or the BC method (BC-PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Validation data included variables used for routine quality control (QC; pH, PLT count, volume, sterility, residual white blood cell count) as well as nonroutine testing of PLTs for PLT activation, metabolic changes during storage, and PLT responsiveness to hypotonic shock and the extent of shape change induced by adenosine 5′-diphosphate. BC-PCs were tested on Days 1 and 6. QC of production runs included the same routine tests performed on Day 6. RESULTS: PLTs produced by the BC method during validation and pilot implementation met all Canadian Standards Association standards with respect to yield, volume, pH, and leukoreduction. Additional validation testing indicated a moderate level of PLT storage lesion development. In comparison to PRP-PCs, in vitro variables of BC-PCs, either pH in this study, or other markers compared to the literature were better, suggesting that BC-PCs have less evidence of production-related damage and improved PLT quality during storage. CONCLUSIONS: PLT concentrates produced from whole blood by the BC method after an overnight hold have laboratory variables suggestive of a higher quality than those concentrates produced by the PRP method. © 2008 American Association of Blood Banks.",,"adenosine diphosphate; article; leukapheresis; leukocyte count; muscle hypotonia; pH measurement; thrombocyte; thrombocyte activation; thrombocyte rich plasma; validation process; Blood Platelets; Blood Preservation; Blood Specimen Collection; Cell Separation; Centrifugation; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Leukocyte Count; Leukocyte Reduction Procedures; Platelet Count; Platelet-Rich Plasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55349110645

Bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid (ZA) and pamidronate (PAM) are potent inhibitors of bone resorption. The local delivery of bisphosphonates via acrylic bone cement could decrease osteolysis and prolong implant lifespan. Conflicting studies suggest that bisphosphonate loading may or may not reduce the mechanical properties of acrylic bone cement. We assayed acrylic bone cement laden with ZA or PAM at different concentrations and diluent volumes. Four-point bend testing and compressive testing indicated that high volumes of diluent (with or without bisphosphonate) significantly reduced bending modulus and compressive strength. Radiography and electron microscopy indicated that high diluent volumes generated abnormal acrylic bone cement structure. After 6 weeks of incubation in saline, only 0.9% w/w of the total bisphosphonate incorporated in acrylic bone cement eluted in vitro, indicating a slow elution rate. In vivo testing was performed using a rat model. Cement cylinders were inserted into incisions in rat distal femora and ZA delivered locally (via elution from acrylic bone cement) or systemically (via injection). At 4 weeks postoperatively, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry demonstrated no significant increase in local bone mineral density (BMD) adjacent to ZA-laden implants. In contrast, systemic ZA delivery (0.1 mg/kg) led to a large (48.6%) and significant increase in BMD. Thus, systemic delivery appears more effective than local delivery. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Acrylic bone cement-PMMA; Bisphosphonates; Hip prosthesis; Mechanical properties; Osteolysis","Acids; Architectural acoustics; Associative storage; Bending strength; Bone; Cements; Compressive strength; Hip prostheses; Ice; Mechanical properties; Microscopic examination; Pneumatic drives; Pulse amplitude modulation; Silica; Silicate minerals; Strength of materials; X ray radiography; Absorptiometry; Acrylic bone cement-PMMA; Acrylic bone cements; Bending modulus; Bisphosphonate; Bisphosphonates; Bone minerals; Bone resorptions; Dual energies; Implant loosening; In vitro; In vivo activities; In-vivo; Local deliveries; Osteolysis; Pamidronate; Point bent; Potent inhibitors; Rat models; Total hip replacements; With or without; Zoledronic acids; Bone cement; acrylic cement; diluent; pamidronic acid; zoledronic acid; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bone density; compressive strength; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; electron microscopy; elution; experimental rat; femur; male; nonhuman; radiography; rat; Animals; Diphosphonates; Femur; Fractures, Bone; Indicator Dilution Techniques; Male; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Polymethyl Methacrylate; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55049083777

Samsung Electronics recently announced the OneNAND fusion memory, in which a NAND flash array is integrated with dual SRAM buffers to provide a NOR-type I/O interface. OneNAND has the low cost and large capacity of a NAND flash but also permits eXecution-in-Place (XIP) like a NOR flash. The deployment of such devices requires careful system-level resource management because of their impact on energy consumption and performance, and existing memory optimization techniques, such as the demand paging used with NAND flash, may no longer be appropriate for systems with a fusion memory. We introduce a new online demand paging scheme that fully exploits the XIP capability of OneNAND flash by classifying pages as load preferred (residing in the on-chip SRAM) and XIP preferred (accessed directly from the OneNAND flash and discarded after use). This achieves, on average, a 26 % reduction in energy consumption and a 19% increase in performance, compared with conventional NAND flash demand paging. © 2008 IEEE.","Demand paging; eXecute-In-Place (XIP); Flash memory; OneNAND; Page allocation; Page replacement","Data storage equipment; Electronic equipment; Embedded systems; Fusion reactions; Information management; Integrated circuits; Management; Optimization; Paging systems; Resource allocation; Static random access storage; Demand paging; eXecute-In-Place (XIP); OneNAND; Page allocation; Page replacement; Flash memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54949105011

Investigation of dispersion characteristics shows that in the case of MPCs, photonic band gaps arise due to the contrast in the wave impedance, not due to the contrast in the refractive index, while contrast in the refractive index of the two layers decides the position and number of the band gaps. We also study the effect of permittivity and permeability on reflection bands, which shows that the structure that has larger values of magnetic permeability (μ) than dielectric permittivity (ε) have wider TM-reflection bands, whereas the structure for which ε is greater than μ has wider TE-reflection bands. But the gap to mid-gap frequency ratio for TM-reflection bands is larger than TE-reflection bands. Thus, magnetic permeability has greater impact on the reflectivity of MPCs than dielectric permittivity.

The system, consisting of an activated carbon reactor connected to a solar collector and to an evaporator/cold box, is able to produce and store 5 kg of ice/day, in a north Mediterranean climate. The simulations were carried out by a dynamic mathematical model which uses measured climatic data and that is based on energy balances of the components of the system. A parametric analysis, based on a Full Factorial Design (FFD) - a known statistical method used to evaluate the effects and interactions of different independent variables on a dependent variable - was accomplished. The results obtained evidenced that the most influencing parameters on the system performance are the transmittance/absorptivity coefficient of the solar collector and the heat transfer coefficient between the solar collector and the adsorbent material. Finally, the application of the Steepest Ascent Method (SAM) allowed to optimize the solar-powered adsorptive system, in terms of performance, and to determine the corresponding optimal values of the key parameters. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

CdS films have been deposited from aqueous solutions of sulphur and cadmium, keeping the molar concentrations of S:Cd = 0.01:0.01, 0.02:0.02, 0.04:0.04 and 0.06:0.06 in the starting solutions. The structural studies reveal that the S:Cd concentration has a strong influence on the microstructural characteristics of the sprayed CdS films. It was found that there is a transition in the preferred orientation from (0 0 2) plane to (1 0 1) plane when S:Cd molar concentration increases. The SEM images depict that the films are uniform and homogeneous. All the films have high optical transmittance (>80%) in the visible range. The optical band gap values are found to be in the range of 2.46-2.52 eV. CdS films fabricated by this simple and economic spray technique without using any carrier gas are found to be good in structural and optical properties which are desirable for photovoltaic applications.

Emanuele II, 244, Rome, Italy","The optimization of synthesis, design and operation in trigeneration systems for building applications is a quite complex task, due to the high number of decision variables, the presence of irregular heat, cooling and electric load profiles and the variable electricity price. Consequently, computer-aided techniques are usually adopted to achieve the optimal solution, based either on iterative techniques, linear or non-linear programming or evolutionary search. Large efforts have been made in improving algorithm efficiency, which have resulted in an increasingly rapid convergence to the optimal solution and in reduced calculation time; robust algorithm have also been formulated, assuming stochastic behaviour for energy loads and prices. This paper is based on the assumption that margins for improvements in the optimization of trigeneration systems still exist, which require an in-depth understanding of plant's energetic behaviour. Robustness in the optimization of trigeneration systems has more to do with a ""correct and comprehensive"" than with an ""efficient"" modelling, being larger efforts required to energy specialists rather than to experts in efficient algorithms. With reference to a mixed integer linear programming model implemented in MatLab for a trigeneration system including a pressurized (medium temperature) heat storage, the relevant contribute of thermoeconomics and energo-environmental analysis in the phase of mathematical modelling and code testing are shown. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this approach, a multi-dimensional Schrödinger equation is reduced to a system of the coupled second-order ordinary differential equations on a finite interval with homogeneous boundary conditions: (i) the Dirichlet, Neumann and third type at the left and right boundary points for continuous spectrum problem, (ii) the Dirichlet and Neumann type conditions at left boundary point and Dirichlet, Neumann and third type at the right boundary point for the discrete spectrum problem.

RAM: This depends on1.the number of differential equations;2.the number and order of finite elements;3.the number of hyperradial points; and4.the number of eigensolutions required. The test run requires 2 MB. Classification: 2.1, 2.4. External routines: GAULEG and GAUSSJ [2]. Nature of problem: In the hyperspherical adiabatic approach [3-5], a multidimensional Schrödinger equation for a two-electron system [6] or a hydrogen atom in magnetic field [7-9] is reduced by separating radial coordinate ρ from the angular variables to a system of the second-order ordinary differential equations containing the potential matrix elements and first-derivative coupling terms. The purpose of this paper is to present the finite element method procedure based on the use of high-order accuracy approximations for calculating approximate eigensolutions of the continuum spectrum for such systems of coupled differential equations on finite intervals of the radial variable ρ ∈ [ρmin, ρmax]. This approach can be used in the calculations of effects of electron screening on low-energy fusion cross sections [10-12]. Solution method: The boundary problems for the coupled second-order differential equations are solved by the finite element method using high-order accuracy approximations [13]. The generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem AF = E BF with respect to pair unknowns (E, F) arising after the replacement of the differential problem by the finite-element approximation is solved by the subspace iteration method using the SSPACE program [14]. The generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem (A - E B) F = λ DF with respect to pair unknowns (λ, F) arising after the corresponding replacement of the scattering boundary problem in open channels at fixed energy value, E, is solved by the LDLT factorization of symmetric matrix and back-substitution methods using the DECOMP and REDBAK programs, respectively [14]. As a test desk, the program is applied to the calculation of the reaction matrix and corresponding radial wave functions for 3D-model of a hydrogen-like atom in a homogeneous magnetic field described in [9] on finite intervals of the radial variable ρ ∈ [ρmin, ρmax]. For this benchmark model the required analytical expressions for asymptotics of the potential matrix elements and first-derivative coupling terms, and also asymptotics of radial solutions of the boundary problems for coupled differential equations have been produced with help of a MAPLE computer algebra system. Restrictions: The computer memory requirements depend on:1.the number of differential equations;2.the number and order of finite elements;3.the total number of hyperradial points; and4.the number of eigensolutions required. Restrictions due to dimension sizes may be easily alleviated by altering PARAMETER statements (see Section 3 and [1] for details). The user must also supply subroutine POTCAL for evaluating potential matrix elements. The user should also supply subroutines ASYMEV (when solving the eigenvalue problem) or ASYMS0 and ASYMSC (when solving the scattering problem) which evaluate asymptotics of the radial wave functions at left and right boundary points in case of a boundary condition of the third type for the above problems. Running time: The running time depends critically upon:1.the number of differential equations;2.the number and order of finite elements;3.the total number of hyperradial points on interval [ρmin, ρmax]; and4.the number of eigensolutions required. The test run which accompanies this paper took 2 s without calculation of matrix potentials on the Intel Pentium IV 2.4 GHz. References:. [1] O. Chuluunbaatar, A.A. Gusev, A.G. Abrashkevich, A.

The proposed algorithm obtains an estimation of the mismatch between sampling capacitors in the MDAC (multiplying digital-to-analogue converter) inside each stage, without the necessity of interrupting the ADC operation, and therefore, suitable for background calibration applications. The technique also shows its applicability for the amplifier finite DC-gain error, providing a low-cost solution for full calibration of the main static errors in the Pipeline topology with less convergence time, memory resources and simpler calibration hardware than other existing calibration methods. In addition, this work overcomes practical limitations of previous adaptive approaches based on capacitor swapping by introducing a novel modulation scheme. This new scheme minimizes the impact on the analogue part and employs a very simple digital modulation logic. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Background (on-line) calibration; Capacitor swapping technique; Full calibration of capacitor mismatch and amplifier finite DC-gain; Pipeline ADC; Switched-capacitor","Capacitance; Capacitors; Convergence of numerical methods; Dielectric devices; Digital arithmetic; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Energy storage; Error analysis; Modulation; Pipelines; Applications.; Background (on-line) calibration; Calibration methods; Capacitor mismatches; Capacitor swapping technique; Convergence time; Digital converters; Digital modulations; Error calibration; Full calibration of capacitor mismatch and amplifier finite DC-gain; Gain errors; Low-cost solution; Memory resources; Non-linear; Novel modulation; Pipeline ADC; Pipeline ADCs; Sampling capacitors; Static errors; Switched-capacitor; Calibration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849135159

However, to support the operations of a VE, a resource planning system (RPS) is required. In this study, a systematic and hierarchical approach which consists of top-down modeling and bottom-up implementation steps is proposed and used for developing the RPS. Following this approach, a Predicate/Transition (Pr/Tr) net model for resource planning is derived. In addition, activity-based costing (ABC) is applied to provide a financial measure, profit, which is believed to be more meaningful in a collaborative environment. The Pr/Tr net model is further transformed into Horn clauses, and implemented by a logical programming language, Visual Prolog. Finally, a RPS which contains graphical user interface, model and knowledge database is developed. In the RPS, the goals and dispatching rules can be easily included and evaluated. In addition, the schedules based on the best dispatching rule can be generated. An example of horizontal collaborative manufacturing is used to illustrate the application of the RPS and the generation of the schedules. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The PE films were spread from chloroform, chloroform/ethanol (1/4: v/v) and chloroform/hexane (1/4: v/v) solutions on pure water/air and cyclodextrin solution/air interfaces. The experiments have been carried out at pH 3, 5.5 and 7. Plots of surface pressure (π) against mean area per molecule (A) were recorded at constant temperature (20 °C). The influence of the subphase pH on the behavior of PE monolayers was explained by the ionization of the polar head-group, whereas the effects of the spreading solvents were attributed to changes in the orientation of the polar head with respect to the interface. Isotherms of PE spread on subphases containing CDs were shifted to lower A values. This corroborates the interaction between the monolayer and CDs, which modifies the arrangement of the PE molecules at the interface. Static stability tests of the PE liquid condensed (LC) monolayers spread on pure water and on CD solutions have also been undertaken (π-time curves). The decay of surface pressure observed after 2 h in the tests carried on CD solutions proves that the film molecules are complexed by the macrocycles and, finally, desorbed into the bulk phase. It occurred that γ-CD includes the PE molecules less specifically, regardless the orientation of the lipid polar head-group at the water/air interface. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The approach combines superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) system with static series synchronous compensator (SSSC). Considering the energy absorption/injection ability of SMES, in transient states the combination exchanges both active and reactive powers with power system. Since direct Lyapunov method implies time derivative of both active and reactive powers, prepares an effective control strategy for the integrated SSSC-SMES system to decrease power swings damping time. Using direct Lyapunov method for structure preserving model (SPM) of power system, dq components of SSSC injecting voltage are calculated. Decentralizing method is used to locally control the SSSC-SMES independent of state variables of synchronous generators which require wide area measurements.

Such materials are capable of converting mechanical vibration energy into electrical energy, but developing piezoelectric generators is challenging because of their poor source characteristics (high voltage, low current, high impedance) and relatively low power output. This paper presents a theoretical analysis and design of piezoelectric power generation in low frequency applications (2to 5 Hz), where the design method is obtained by a piezoelectric equivalent circuit andan analysis of internal stress. Some important considerations in designing such generators are explored, including of parameter estimation, load matching, efficiency, energy conversion, and energy storage. A prototype hand-shaking piezoelectric generator is proposed, which can be used to drive a wireless-switch device (the driving voltage being 5V). Experimental results show that the average electrical power in the hand-shaking piezoelectric generator can be approximated to 48.5 μ W.©2008 IEEE.","Electrical generator; Equivalent circuit; Piezoelectric; Wireless-switch device","Building materials; Current voltage characteristics; DC generators; Electric network analysis; Electric power generation; Electric rectifiers; Electricity; Energy conversion; Parameter estimation; Piezoelectric actuators; Piezoelectric devices; Piezoelectric materials; Piezoelectric transducers; Piezoelectricity; Sensor networks; Vibrations (mechanical); Analysis and designs; Design methods; Driving voltages; Electrical energies; Electrical generator; Electrical generators; Electrical powers; Equivalent circuit; High impedances; High voltages; Internal stresses; Load matching; Low currents; Low frequencies; Low-power; Mechanical vibrations; Piezoelectric; Piezoelectric generators; Piezoelectric powers; Pzt ceramics; Sensors and actuators; Switch devices; Theoretical analyses; Wireless-switch device; Electric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54549087951

The climate of these islands, in terms of diurnal and seasonal variations, wind and energy balance, is representative of the climate of the tropical Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Measurements were obtained at two characteristic sites of this region; a mountainous island (Punaauia, Tahiti Island) and an atoll (Tikehau, Tuamotu Archipelago). Dew was measured daily on a 30° tilted, 1 m2 plane collector equipped with a thermally insulated radiative foil. In addition, an electronic balance placed at 1 m above the ground with a horizontal 0.16 m2 condensing plate made of PolyTetraFluoroEthylene (Teflon) was used in Tahiti. Dew volume data, taken during the dry season from 16/5/2005 to 14/10/2005, were correlated with air temperature and relative humidity, wind speed, cloud cover and visible plus infrared radiometer measurements. The data were also fitted to a model. Dew formation in such a tropical climate is characterized by high absolute humidity, weak nocturnal temperature drop and strong Trade winds. These winds prevent dew from forming unless protected e.g. by natural vegetal windbreaks. In protected areas, dew can then form with winds as large as 7 m/s. Such strong winds also hamper at night the formation near the ground of a calm and cold air layer with high relative humidity. As the cooling power is lower than in the Mediterranean islands because of the high absolute humidity of the atmosphere, both effects combine to generate modest dew yields. However, dew events are frequent and provide accumulated amounts of water attractive for dew water harvesting. Slight modifications of existing rain collection devices on roofs can enhance dew formation and collection. Dew harvesting thus appears as an attractive possibility to provide the local population with a complementary - but on occasion, essential - water resource. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Energy intake and genetic background are major determinants of fattening in most animals, including humans. Previous studies have evidenced that fat deposition depends upon balance between various metabolic pathways. Using divergent selection, we obtained rainbow trout with differences in fat allocation between visceral adipose tissue and muscle, and no change in overall body fat content. Transcriptome and proteome analysis were applied to characterize the molecular changes occurring between these two lines when fed a low or a high energy diet. We focused on the liver, center of intermediary metabolism and the main site for lipogenesis in fish, as in humans and most avian species. Results: The proteome and transcriptome analyses provided concordant results. The main changes induced by the dietary treatment were observed in lipid metabolism. The level of transcripts and proteins involved in intracellular lipid transport, fatty acid biosynthesis and anti-oxidant metabolism were lower with the lipid rich diet. In addition, genes and proteins involved in amino-acid catabolism and proteolysis were also under expressed with this diet. The major changes related to the selection effect were observed in levels of transcripts and proteins involved in amino-acid catabolism and proteolysis that were higher in the fat muscle line than in the lean muscle line. Conclusion: The present study led to the identification of novel genes and proteins that responded to long term feeding with a high energy/high fat diet. Although muscle was the direct target, the selection procedure applied significantly affected hepatic metabolism, particularly protein and amino acid derivative metabolism. Interestingly, the selection procedure and the dietary treatment used to increase muscle fat content exerted opposite effects on the expression of the liver genes and proteins, with little interaction between the two factors. Some of the molecules we identified could be used as markers to prevent excess muscle fat accumulation. © 2008 Kolditz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"proteome; transcriptome; proteome; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; caloric intake; cell transport; controlled study; fat content; fat intake; fatty acid synthesis; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; gene interaction; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipid transport; lipogenesis; lipolysis; liver metabolism; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; protein degradation; protein determination; protein expression; protein function; protein interaction; protein metabolism; rainbow trout; unindexed sequence; adipose tissue; animal; cytology; diet; gene expression profiling; intraabdominal fat; liver; metabolism; muscle; Animalia; Aves; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Diet; Energy Intake; Gene Expression Profiling; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Lipogenesis; Liver; Muscles; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Proteome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149295563

The system can extend the working hours by 1.94 times and the standby hours by 5.67 times. Instead of the memory effect of the rechargeable battery our design uses a non-memory self-sufficient component of a 15 Farad 4.6 V large capacitor with a smaller size than that of the rechargeable battery.

All animals were then subdivided into 3 groups: before-exercise (BE); during-exercise (DE); after-exercise (AE). The DE group was exercised on treadmill for 1 hour just before being sacrificed. Animals in the AE group were allowed to take a rest for 2 hours after being exercised like the DE group. Glucose and free fatty acids were compared in plasma. Glycogen and triglyceride were compared in liver and skeletal muscle. Protein levels were compared in plasma, liver, and skeletal muscle. Compared with the B6+ group, plasma glucose levels of the B6- group were significantly lower before and after exercise. Muscle glycogen levels of the B6- group were significantly lower than those of the B6+ group regardless of exercise. The liver glycogen level of the B6- group was also significantly lower than that of B6+ group during and after exercise. Before exercise, plasma free fatty acid levels were not significantly different between the B6+ and B6- groups, and plasma free fatty acid levels of the B6- group were significantly lower during and after exercise. The muscle triglyceride level of the B6- group was significantly lower than that of the B6+ group before exercise, and there were no differences between B6+ and B6- groups during and after exercise. Liver triglyceride levels were not significantly different between B6+ and B6- groups. Plasma protein levels of the B6-group were lower than those of B6+ before and after exercise. Muscle protein levels of the B6- group were not significantly different from those of the B6+ group. Liver protein levels of the B6- group were significantly lower than that of the B6+ group after exercise. Liver protein levels of both B6+ and B6- groups were not significantly changed, regardless of exercise. Thus, it is suggested that vitamin B6 deficiency may reduce fuel storage and utilization with exercise in physically trained rats. © Hogrefe &amp; Huber Publishers.","Glycogen; Moderate physical training; Protein; Stored fuel; Triglyceride; Vitamin B6","animal experiment; article; controlled study; dietary intake; energy consumption; energy recovery; energy resource; fatty acid blood level; glucose blood level; glycogen liver level; glycogen muscle level; lipid liver level; liver level; male; muscle level; nonhuman; protein blood level; protein liver level; protein muscle level; pyridoxine deficiency; rat; skeletal muscle; training; treadmill exercise; triacylglycerol liver level; triglyceride muscle level; animal; animal experiment; blood; body weight; liver; metabolism; physiology; Sprague Dawley rat; Animalia; Rattus; fatty acid; glycogen; triacylglycerol; Animals; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Glycogen; Liver; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Triglycerides; Vitamin B 6 Deficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54249148407

Therefore, we have tested the hypothesis that food supplementation with an antioxidant molecule such as vitamin C could prevent fat deposition induced by a high-fat diet in rodents. Ascorbic acid dietary supplementation reduced body weight and the retroperitoneal and subcutaneous fat depots in cafeteria diet-induced obese rats, without affecting food intake. Microarray technology has been applied in rat subcutaneous fat to assess the molecular mechanisms underlying the depletion of fat stores induced by ascorbic acid. Thus, expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, regulation of transcription, and host response are upregulated while a number of genes participating in lipid metabolism, cell adhesion, differentiation, and steroidogenesis (such as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and hydroxysteroid 11-β dehydrogenase 2) are downregulated. These data provide new insights to understand that not only calories count in weight gain, but also that the antioxidant status and other mechanisms affecting energy conversion efficiency could participate in energy homeostasis, in which glucocorticoids could be involved. © Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.","Antioxidant; Ascorbic acid; Cafeteria diet; Glucocorticoids; Microarray; Obesity","11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; ascorbic acid; glucocorticoid; steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; animal experiment; animal model; antioxidant activity; article; body fat; cell adhesion; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; energy balance; energy conversion; experimental model; food intake; gene expression regulation; immune response; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; microarray analysis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; rat; retroperitoneal fat; steroidogenesis; subcutaneous fat; transcription regulation; upregulation; vitamin supplementation; weight gain; weight reduction; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Antioxidants; Ascorbic Acid; Body Composition; Body Weight; Dietary Fats; Eating; Gene Expression Regulation; Male; Obesity; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Organ Size; Oxidative Stress; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Steroids; Animalia; Rattus; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54249118108

Based on the time-resolved responses of a source pulse, it is found that the dipole-SP coupling features can be excited in several femtoseconds with the decay times ranging from 5 to 20 fs.

The weakness of wind power generation is its dependence on nature-the power output varies in quite a wide range due to the change of wind speed, which is difficult to model and predict. The excess fluctuation of power output and voltages can influence negatively the quality of electricity in the distribution system connected to the wind power generation plant. In this paper, the authors propose an intelligent adaptive system to control the output of a wind power generation plant to maintain the quality of electricity in the distribution system. The target wind generator is a cost-effective induction generator, while the plant is equipped with a small capacity energy storage based on conventional batteries, heater load for co-generation and braking, and a voltage smoothing device such as a static Var compensator (SVC). Fuzzy logic controller provides a flexible controller covering a wide range of energy/voltage compensation. A neural network inverse model is designed to provide compensating control amount for a system. The system can be optimized to cope with the fluctuating market-based electricity price conditions to lower the cost of electricity consumption or to maximize the power sales opportunities from the wind generation plant. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Adaptive control systems; Adaptive systems; Asynchronous generators; Control systems; Cost effectiveness; Customer satisfaction; Data storage equipment; Electric network topology; Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Electricity; Fuzzy logic; Network protocols; Neural networks; Power quality; Quality assurance; Quality control; Quality function deployment; Renewable energy resources; Sensor networks; Total quality management; Wind power; Conventional batteries; Cost of electricities; Distribution systems; Electricity generations; Electricity prices; Electricity qualities; Environmentally friendliest; Flexible; Fuzzy logic controllers; Induction generators; Intelligent; Intelligent controllers; Inverse models; Neural-network; Power industries; Power outputs; Power systems; Public concerns; Sales opportunities; Smoothing; Static VAR compensators; Wind generations; Wind generators; Wind power generation plants; Wind power generations; Wind speeds; Electric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54049146358

Quantum dots of the II-VI semiconductor CdS, in the size regime of 2.0-3.3 nm, were prepared in the cubic phase by a wet chemical method. Five organic thiols were used for capping: (i) 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), (ii) 2-mercaptoethanol (ME), (iii) cysteine (Cys), (iv) methionine (Meth), and (v) glutathione (GSH). Structural studies were carried out by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which revealed the cubic phase of CdS. Optical properties were studied by FT-IR, UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, and a comparison was made between uncapped and capped CdS. FT-IR studies suggested two different bonding mechanisms of the capping agents with the CdS. GSH and DTT capped CdS showed significant decrease in absorption wavelengths. An increase in band gap was observed in two cases: when (i) capped and (ii) decreased in size. The band gap was increased from 2.50 eV for the uncapped to 2.77 eV for the DTT capped CdS. DTT was found to be the best capping agent for CdS among these five organic thiols in two aspects: (i) yielding lower grain size in cubic phase, and (ii) good fluorescence properties with efficient quenching of the surface traps. © IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agents; Cadmium compounds; Data storage equipment; Energy gap; Fluorescence; Gallium alloys; Light emission; Luminescence; Microscopic examination; Optical properties; Optical waveguides; Quantum electronics; Quenching; Semiconductor quantum dots; X ray analysis; Absorption wavelengths; Band gaps; Bonding mechanisms; Capping agents; CdS quantum dots; Dithiothreitol; Fluorescence properties; Glutathione; Grain sizes; In bands; Mercaptoethanol; Organic thiols; Photophysical; Photophysical studies; Quantum dots; Semi-conductors; Spectroscopic techniques; Structural studies; Surface modifications; Surface traps; Uv-visible; Wet chemicals; X-ray diffractions; Semiconducting cadmium compounds; cadmium sulfide; cysteine; dithiothreitol; glutathione; mercaptoethanol; methionine; quantum dot; thiol derivative; article; chemical analysis; chemical structure; crystal structure; diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; energy absorption; fluorescence spectroscopy; infrared spectroscopy; nanoencapsulation; optics; photochemical quenching; photoluminescence; polarimetry; priority journal; semiconductor; structure analysis; surface property; thermal analysis; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet spectroscopy; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349141695

HRXPS data revealed that the Sb 4d shallow core level was split into two components having different binding energies and that the spin-orbit splitting feature of the Ge 3d level was enhanced as the system became metastable. Negligible change was observed in the Te 4d shallow core level, and in contrary to the previous report's prediction less change in valance band spectra was observed. The results imply that Sb movement is also involved in the phase-change mechanism and that acquisition of shallow core-level spectra can be a useful measure for understanding phase-change mechanism. Hydrogenated SbTe6 octahedral-like cluster model was introduced to schematically interpret the generation of the two components in the Sb 4d level in metastable state, having an isotropic six-bonds configuration, and an anistropic six-bonds (three-short and three-elongated bonds) configuration. The amorphous state was modeled to have three-short bonds configuration. Finally, Stibnite-like building block model was used to show that the existence of the above two configurations for Sb atoms is feasible in the Ge2 Sb2 Te5 system. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Atomic physics; Atoms; Binding energy; Germanium; Metastable phases; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Random access storage; Semiconducting germanium compounds; Tellurium compounds; Thick films; Three dimensional; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Amorphous; Amorphous states; Atomic structures; Building blocks; Change mechanisms; Chemical state informations; Chemical states; Cluster models; Core levels; Film using; High-resolution; Metastable; Metastable states; Nonvolatile; Orbit splitting; Random accesses; Two components; Valance band spectrum; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies; Phase change memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54049107309

We can define two major areas therein: the structural prediction of protein-protein binding mode, and the identification of the relevant residues for the interaction (so called 'hot-spots'). These hot-spot residues have high interest since they are considered one of the possible ways of disrupting a protein-protein interaction. Unfortunately, large-scale experimental measurement of residue contribution to the binding energy, based on alanine-scanning experiments, is costly and thus data is fairly limited. Recent computational approaches for hot-spot prediction have been reported, but they usually require the structure of the complex. Results: We have applied here normalized interface propensity (NIP) values derived from rigid-body docking with electrostatics and desolvation scoring for the prediction of interaction hot-spots. This parameter identifies hot-spot residues on interacting proteins with predictive rates that are comparable to other existing methods (up to 80% positive predictive value), and the advantage of not requiring any prior structural knowledge of the complex. Conclusion: The NIP values derived from rigid-body docking can reliably identify a number of hot-spot residues whose contribution to the interaction arises from electrostatics and desolvation effects. Our method can propose residues to guide experiments in complexes of biological or therapeutic interest, even in cases with no available 3D structure of the complex. © 2008 Grosdidier and Fernández-Recio; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"3D Structure; Computational approach; Computational dockings; Positive predictive values; Protein-protein binding; Protein-protein interactions; Rigid-body docking; Structural knowledge; Amino acids; Binding energy; Biochemistry; Dissociation; Electrostatics; Experiments; Forecasting; Proteins; angiogenin; barnase; barstar; beta lactamase TEM 1; binding protein; CD4 antigen; FtsZ protein; glycoprotein gp 120; growth factor; growth factor receptor; immunoglobulin Fc fragment; interleukin 4; interleukin 4 receptor; protein A; protein G; protein p53; protein SEC3; ribonuclease A; ribonuclease inhibitor; sialidase; T lymphocyte receptor; trypsin; unclassified drug; amino acid; accuracy; article; computer prediction; computer simulation; molecular docking; normalized interface propensity value; protein analysis; protein binding; protein protein interaction; structure analysis; binding site; biology; information retrieval; metabolism; methodology; protein analysis; protein domain; static electricity; thermodynamics; Amino Acids; Binding Sites; Computational Biology; Information Storage and Retrieval; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Interaction Mapping; Static Electricity; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55649090573

A series of novel epoxy/clay nanocomposites (ERPC) was then prepared with a selected epoxy resin and varying amounts of RPC. The results of XRD and TEM of the nanocomposites showed that the RPC particles were well dispersed in the epoxy matrix with a highly exfoliated structure due to the presence of the reactive epoxide group of RPC. The as-prepared epoxy/RPC nanocomposites (ERPC) were thermally stable up to 388 °C. Thermal stability was increased by increasing the RPC content as indicated by the corresponding activation energies (Ea) and the integral procedural decomposition temperatures (IPDT). Furthermore, the storage modulus in the glass state of the nanocomposites was dramatically increased with the increase in RPC content.

There is substantial variation in running economy, even among elite runners. This variation might be due to variation in the storage and reutilization of elastic energy in tendons. Using a simple musculoskeletal model, it was predicted that the amount of energy stored in a tendon during a given movement depends more critically on moment arm than on mechanical properties of the tendon, with the amount of stored energy increasing as the moment arm gets smaller. Assuming a link between elastic energy reutilization and overall metabolic cost of running, a smaller moment arm should therefore be associated with superior running economy. This prediction was confirmed experimentally in a group of 15 highly trained runners. The moment arm of the Achilles tendon was determined from standardized photographs of the ankle, using the position of anatomical landmarks. Running economy was measured as the rate of metabolic energy consumption during level treadmill running at a speed of 16 km h-1. A strong correlation was found between the moment arm of the Achilles tendon and running economy. Smaller muscle moment arms correlated with lower rates of metabolic energy consumption (r2=0.75, P&lt;0.001).","Elastic; Energy; Long distance; Moment arm; Oxygen uptake; Runner; Strain; Stretch; Tendon","achilles tendon; adult; anthropometry; article; biological model; biomechanics; energy metabolism; heel; histology; human; male; physiology; running; skeletal muscle; Achilles Tendon; Adult; Anthropometry; Biomechanics; Energy Metabolism; Heel; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Muscle, Skeletal; Running; Young Adult; Elagatis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55549083532

The moisture sorption and transport processes consider two computational domains-water vapor diffusion inside each particle and water vapor convection and diffusion in the interstitial air space in the urea particle bed. For energy transport, the temperature is assumed to be uniform inside each particle, but convective heat transfer and conduction between the urea particles and the interstitial air outside particles occur throughout the bed.

However, many DVFS algorithms discuss the issue from the perspective of the processors only. Some researches have started to study the effects of memories in the DVFS algorithms. In this paper, an approximation equation (called MAR-CSE) based on the correlation of the memory access rate and the critical speed for the minimum energy consumption is conducted for frequency and voltage prediction. The memory access information is obtained from the performance monitoring unit (PMU) provided on an Intel XScale platform which we used in this study. With MAR-CSE, an MA-DVFS (Memory-aware DVFS) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm has been realized in the Linux kernel.

A coupled approach based on electrochemical measurements and pH measurements allowed us to give information about electrodeposition mechanism of birnessite. An intermediary Mn(III) compound, α-MnOOH (groutite), is formed in deaerated solutions leading to mixed thin layers of birnessite and groutite. But, thin layers of pure birnessite can be efficiently electrodeposited in aerated solutions due to the oxidation of groutite by dissolved oxygen in such solutions.

Technology is moving toward a situation in which automated energy management systems could control domestic energy generation, storage, and consumption. In previous work we have proposed a controller based on model predictive control for controlling an individual household using a micro combined heat and power plant in combination with heat and electricity storages. Although the controller provides adequate performance in computer simulations, the computational time required to determine which actions to take can be significant, due to the precise predictions made over a long prediction horizon. In this paper we propose to make the computations less time consuming by coarsening the quality of the predictions made over the prediction horizon by decreasing their time resolution. In simulation studies we illustrate the performance of the proposed approach. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Computational methods; Computer simulation; Control systems; Data storage equipment; Electric power plants; Electricity; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy resources; Feedback control; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Power plants; Predictive control systems; Security of data; Storage (materials); Adaptive predictions; Combined heat and power plants; Computational time; Control applications; Distributed Energy Resources; Electricity infrastructure; Energy generations; Energy Management Systems; Heat and electricity; Household energy; International conferences; Minimizing costs; Prediction horizon; Predictive control; Residential energy; Simulation studies; Time consuming; Time resolutions; Model predictive control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53349095492

By studying the behavior of MiBench and MediaBench programs, we observed that many data values stored in the data cache have a few word patterns in which one byte is repeated and/or the rest of bytes are all zeros.

Ge nanocrystals were deposited on a silicon dioxide/ p -doped silicon structure and capped with a thin amorphous silicon layer. Results evidenced an electron storage phenomenon in nanocrystals that presented two different behaviors depending on the temperature. For temperatures higher than ∼140 K, the storage was mainly controlled by the nanocrystal density. At low temperatures the storage was reduced due to lowering of the tunneling barrier that resulted from a carrier quantum confinement process. Thermal activation energy of the carrier emission process was revealed as varying linearly with nanocrystal energy band gap. Activation energy was identified as a barrier height to be overcome by the emitted electrons. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54749155221

In a state of energy balance, increasing meal frequency, and thereby decreasing inter-meal interval, may prevent large metabolic fluctuations. Our aim was to study the effect of the inter-meal interval by dividing energy intake over two or three meals on energy expenditure, substrate oxidation and 24 h satiety, in healthy, normal-weight women in a state of energy balance. The study was a randomised crossover design with two experimental conditions. During the two experimental conditions subjects (fourteen normal-weight women, aged 24.4 (SD 7.1) years, underwent 36 h sessions in energy balance in a respiration chamber for measurements of energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. The subjects were given two (breakfast, dinner) or three (breakfast, lunch, dinner) meals per d. We chose to omit lunch in the two meals condition, because this resulted in a marked difference in inter-meal-interval after breakfast (8.5 h v. 4 h). Eating three meals compared with two meals had no effects on 24 h energy expenditure, diet-induced thermogenesis, activity-induced energy expenditure and sleeping metabolic rate. Eating three meals compared with two meals increased 24 h fat oxidation, but decreased the amount of fat oxidised from the breakfast. The same amount of energy divided over three meals compared with over two meals increased satiety feelings over 24 h. In healthy, normal-weight women, decreasing the inter-meal interval sustains satiety, particularly during the day, and sustains fat oxidation, particularly during the night. © The Authors 2007.","Fat oxidation; Meal pattern; Satiety","lipid; adult; appetite; article; caloric intake; controlled study; energy balance; energy expenditure; feeding behavior; female; food intake; human; human experiment; lipid oxidation; lipogenesis; meal; metabolic rate; normal human; nutrient supply; oxidation; physical activity; sleep; thermogenesis; weight gain; area under the curve; basal metabolic rate; body composition; caloric intake; calorimetry; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; crossover procedure; diet restriction; energy metabolism; fat intake; metabolism; obesity; oxidation reduction reaction; psychological aspect; psychophysiology; randomized controlled trial; satiety; Adult; Appetite; Area Under Curve; Basal Metabolism; Body Composition; Calorimetry, Indirect; Cross-Over Studies; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Satiation; Satiety Response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45549084479

In this way, five different types of feature extraction techniques were compared, using the Spanish version of the SDC-Aurora database, either with or without dropping frames labeled as silence by a voice activity detector. According to the results, which were obtained after extensive parameter tuning, the MVDR method is capable of improving slightly the results for both cepstral coefficients (CC) and FF parameters in most tested conditions. On the other hand, the FF-based techniques show a significantly better performance under the high-mismatched conditions than the CC ones (more than 33% of relative improvement).

Industrial inductors are used to decrease the current variations, resulting from the use of modern power converters. To reduce these variations, the magnetic energy stored in these components is automatically used when the receptor is unconnected to the principal sources. Such storage is generally obtained by using a magnetic circuit containing air-gaps. The rigidity of this circuit, associated with the magnetic stresses which appear in these areas, causes the structure to produce mechanical vibration and to emit audible sounds. Design/methodology/approach - Experiments, simulations and test devices are used to determine the main physical phenomenon that generates the undesirable audible noise. The resulting knowledge is used to design a quieter device. Findings - The mechanical vibrations and emitted noises are attached to magnetic effects. Even if it is not possible to suppress all these effects, the level of sound emitted can be decreased through a suitable design of the magnetic core. Originality/value - Industrial inductors are usually built and designed using methods coming from the transformer studies. A new concept for the design of the magnetic core is presented. Experimental approaches and numerical simulations are performed in order to highlight the physical behaviours of the coils and their magnetic coupling to the magnetic core. It appears that breaking the magnetic core into free parts is an original solution that decreases the emitted noise. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Acoustic testing; Electrical engineering; Mechanical systems; Noise control; Stress (materials)","Computer simulation; Lattice vibrations; Magnetic circuits; Magnetic cores; Magnetic couplings; Magnetic devices; Magnetic materials; Stresses; Underwater acoustics; Vibrations (mechanical); Acoustic testing; Air-gaps; Design/methodology/approach; Electrical engineering; Experimental approaches; Low-noise; Magnetic effects; Magnetic energies; Magnetic stresses; Magnetic-core; Mechanical systems; Mechanical vibrations; New concept; Noise control; Numerical simulations; Passive components; Physical phenomenon; Stress (materials); Test devices; Magnetic storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52949122485

The power sharing capability of the generation system satisfies the different power demand from the two output drives. This architecture can be applied to road vehicles (i.e. buses, urban light truck) where the two wheels are driven by the two motor drives, and to naval ship propulsion systems (i.e leisure craft, work craft) where two propeller shafts are driven by two motor drives. This powertrain configuration can be easily integrated with a battery energy storage system for pure electric operation of the system.","Dual two-level inverter; Hybrid series transmission; Multilevel converter","Amplifiers (electronic); Automobile electronic equipment; Automobile parts and equipment; Automotive engineering; Drives; Electric drives; Electric energy storage; Electric windings; Electronic equipment; Internal combustion engines; Magnets; Marine engineering; Modulation; Motors; Optimization; Oscillators (electronic); Power generation; Propulsion; Ship propulsion; Synchronous generators; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicle wheels; Warships; Battery energy storage systems; Control principle; DC-link; Dual two-level inverter; Electric operations; Electrical and electronic equipment; Hybrid power trains; Hybrid series transmission; International conferences; Level converters; Mechanical transmissions; Modulation strategies; Motor drives; Multi-level converters; Multilevel converter; Naval ships; Open-end windings; Permanent-magnet synchronous generator; Power demands; Power sharing; Powertrain configuration; Propulsion systems; Road vehicles; Three phase; Mechanical drives",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52949114535

Therefore, the analysis of fabrication uncertainties and their outcome on a device performance is a vital task before finalizing the design. In this paper, the effects of process inaccuracy on the performance of MEMS tunable capacitors are studied. Design parameters such as dimensions of electrodes and the initial gap between them and the stiffness of supporting beams are considered as random variables. The variation of these parameters within tolerance ranges drastically alters the capacitor's actual response from the desired one and results in low yield. Hence, design optimization with the objective of maximizing yield in early steps becomes very important. An effective method for yield optimization of MEMS capacitors under given fabrication uncertainties is introduced. The method utilizes aspects of the advanced first-order second-moment (AFOSM) reliability method to find a linearized feasible region to estimate the yield. The yield is calculated directly using the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) over the tolerance box requiring no numerical integration and avoiding computational complexity. The optimal design verified by Monte-Carlo (M-C) simulation exhibits a significant increase in the yield. The main advantage of this method comparing to other design optimization methods is that the proposed method does not change the design topology or fabrication accuracy. It increases the yield by finding the optimum design variables as demonstrated in this paper. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To unravel the molecular mechanisms that underlie the metabolic adaptations to disturbed energy balance, wild and laboratory animal models are of primary importance. Previous studies have highlighted some aspects of the metabolic and endocrine variations that are triggered by marked energy reserve depletion/ repletion. A brief overview of studies addressing the adaptive mechanisms to fasting/refeeding is presented here. This review also emphasises the necessity to not only consider gene or protein expression levels but to also take into account protein structures, to enable one to fully unravel the exact steps of intermediary metabolism and/or signal transduction pathways that are modulated by nutritional transitions. In this context, proteomic analysis, which uses high-performance tools for peptide/protein separation and mass spectrometry, has emerged as an indispensable tool to elucidate the complex molecular basis of various pathophysiological processes. Proteomics provides a global view of the protein dynamics in a given tissue of any organism. It provides hundreds of protein identifications and quantifications, as well as structure characterizations, from a single complex biological sample. Therefore, proteomic analysis is detailed here in terms of its analytical approaches, strategies, methods, instrumentation, and its limitations. The benefits of performing such analysis are discussed in the context of the fasting/ refeeding paradigm and expected insights into the associated molecular mechanisms. Importantly, unravelling the adaptive responses to food deprivation may provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment and/or prevention of numerous pathophysiological conditions characterized by energy depletion. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Body reserves; Cross-species identifications; Mass spectrometry; Prolonged food deprivation; Protein characterization and quantification; Refeeding signal; Sample fractionation; Structure-function relationships","adiponectin; hormone; leptin; neuropeptide; resistin; somatomedin C; peptide; protein; body weight; diet restriction; electrospray mass spectrometry; energy balance; energy metabolism; feeding behavior; gel electrophoresis; gene expression; gene function; gene mutation; homeostasis; hormone action; hormone blood level; human; lipid storage; lipolysis; mass spectrometry; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; metabolic disorder; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; obesity; protein analysis; protein blood level; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; protein processing; protein protein interaction; protein structure; proteomics; refeeding; review; signal transduction; solid phase extraction; animal; body composition; eating; food deprivation; gene expression regulation; metabolic disorder; metabolism; methodology; nutrition; pathophysiology; physiology; Animals; Body Composition; Eating; Fasting; Food Deprivation; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolic Diseases; Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Peptides; Proteins; Proteomics; Signal Transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149237896

In addition, land is scarce and expensive in densely populated areas. Environmental requirements are getting stricter, resulting in more investments or high penalties. These are all factors that contribute to an increasing tendency to include environmental aspects and land use into cost accounting. In addition it contributes to a critical assessment of conventional solutions and to compare them with innovative or environmental friendly solutions. This assessment can be done by applying Environmental Management Accounting (EMA). EMA converts all financial cost accounting data into useful information in order to increase material efficiency, energy efficiency, and to reduce environmental impacts and costs.

Stable isotope and fatty acid trophic marker (FATM) techniques were employed together to assess trophic level (TL), carbon sources (phytoplankton vs. ice algae), and diet of the three Calanus species. In addition, population development, distribution, and nutritional state (i.e. storage lipids) were examined to estimate their population status at the time of sampling. In May and August, the vertical distribution of the three Calanus species usually coincided with the maximum algal biomass. Their stable isotope and fatty acid (FA) composition indicated that they all were essentially herbivores in May, when the algal biomass was highest. Their FA composition, however, revealed different food preferences. C. hyperboreus had high proportions of 18:4n3, suggesting that it fed mainly on Phaeocystis, whereas C. glacialis and C. finmarchicus had high proportions of 16:4n1, 16:1n7, and 20:5n3, suggesting diatoms as their major food source. Carbon sources (i.e. phytoplankton vs. ice algae) were not possible to determine solely from FATM techniques since ice-diatoms and pelagic-diatoms were characterised by the same FA. However, the enriched δ13C values of C. glacialis and C. finmarchicus in May indicated that they fed both on pelagic- and ice-diatoms. Patterns in absolute FA and fatty alcohol composition revealed that diatoms were the most important food for C. hyperboreus and C. glacialis, followed by Phaeocystis, whereas diatoms, Phaeocystis and other small autotrophic flagellates were equally important food for C. finmarchicus. During periods of lower algal biomass, only C. glacialis exhibited evidence of significant dietary switch, with a TL indicative of omnivory (mean TL=2.4). Large spatial variability was observed in population development, distribution, and lipid store sizes in August. At the northernmost station at the southern margin of the Arctic Ocean, the three Calanus species had similarly low lipid stores as they had in May, suggesting that they ascended later in the year. In December, relatively lipid-rich specimens had TL similar to those during the peak productive season (TL≈2.0), suggesting that they were hibernating and not feeding on the available refractory material available at that time of the year. In contrast, lipid-poor specimens in December had substantially high TL (TL=2.5), suggesting that they were active and possibly were feeding. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we set out to determine if existing approved drugs may represent a good source of compounds from which initial lead inhibitors of protein-protein interactions mediated by short peptide regions may be drawn. Peptide structures were defined in terms of pharmacophores and searched against U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to identify similar compounds. The top ranking matches (using a score that corrects root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) for the number of matched pharmacophores and for the number of drug rotatable bonds) included a number of nuclear receptor ligands that matched allosterically to the corepressor binding site of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). The top ranking drug matches were docked to the peptide-binding site using AUTODOCK. The majority of the top-ranking matches showed a negative estimated free energy change upon binding that is comparable to, or greater than, that of the original peptide. We conclude that the usage of certain approved drugs may represent a useful strategy in inhibiting specific protein-protein interactions. Such a strategy may benefit from the increased likelihood that developed compounds might have favorable bioactivity and safety profiles in clinical use. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Amines; Binding energy; Binding sites; Cytology; Digital signal processing; Flow interactions; Lead compounds; Ligands; Pharmacodynamics; Autodock; Biological functions; Clinical uses; Complex networks; Food and Drug administrations; Free energy changes; Nuclear receptors; Peptide ligands; Peptide structures; Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptors; Pharmacophores; Protein interactions; Ranking matches; Drug interactions; drug; ligand; peptide; peptide library; protein; article; chemical structure; chemistry; information retrieval; molecular mimicry; protein binding; protein conformation; structure activity relation; Information Storage and Retrieval; Ligands; Models, Molecular; Molecular Mimicry; Peptide Library; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Proteins; Structure-Activity Relationship",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449096489

We show that natural variation in the foraging (for) gene, which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, affects behavioral and physiological responses to short-term food deprivation. Rover and sitter, natural allelic variants of for, differ in their stored carbohydrate reserves as well as their response to short-term deprivation. Fewer carbohydrates are stored in the fat body of rovers compared with sitters, and more labeled glucose is allocated to lipid stores compared with carbohydrate stores during a short feeding bout. Short-term food deprivation decreases hemolymph glucose levels in rovers but not in sitters. After food deprivation, rovers increase their food intake more slowly than sitters, and rover hemolymph levels take longer to respond to re-feeding. Finally, rovers have lower adipokinetic hormone (akh) mRNA levels than sitters. Our data suggest that for mediates larval responses to short-term food deprivation by altering food intake and blood glucose levels.","Adipokinetic hormone; Behavior genetics; cGMP-dependent protein kinase; Food intake; Foraging; Glucose homeostasis","adipokinetic hormone; cyclic GMP dependent protein kinase; Drosophila protein; drug derivative; foraging protein, Drosophila; glucose; insect hormone; messenger RNA; oligopeptide; pyroglutamic acid; animal; article; Drosophila melanogaster; eating; feeding behavior; genetic variability; genetics; glucose blood level; hemolymph; homeostasis; lipid metabolism; metabolism; physiology; Animals; Blood Glucose; Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Eating; Feeding Behavior; Genetic Variation; Glucose; Hemolymph; Homeostasis; Insect Hormones; Lipid Metabolism; Oligopeptides; Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid; RNA, Messenger; Drosophila melanogaster; Emmelichthyidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55549146129

Methods: Protein coding genes, ribosomal protein genes, and pathogenicity- related genes were analysed with Codon W and CAI (codon adaptation index) Calculator. Results: Translational efficiency plays a role in codon usage variation in Salmonella genes. Low bias was noticed in most of the genes. GC3 (guanine cytosine at third position) composition does not influence codon usage variation in the genes of these Salmonella strains. Among the cluster of orthologous groups (COGs), translation, ribosomal structure biogenesis [J], and energy production and conversion [C] contained the highest number of potentially highly expressed (PHX) genes. Correspondence analysis reveals the conserved nature of the genes. Highly expressed genes were detected. Conclusions: Selection for translational efficiency is the major source of variation of codon usage in the genes of Salmonella. Evolution of pathogenicity-related genes as a unit suggests their ability to infect and exist as a pathogen. Presence of a lot of PHX genes in the information and storage-processing category of COGs indicated their lifestyle and revealed that they were not subjected to genome reduction.","Codon bias and expression; Pathogenicity; Salmonella","article; biogenesis; codon usage; comparative study; controlled study; energy yield; gene expression; gene identification; horizontal gene transfer; molecular evolution; nonhuman; pathogenicity; RNA translation; Salmonella enterica; Salmonella enterica cholerasuis; Salmonella enterica paratyphi; Salmonella enterica typhi; Salmonella typhimurium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55549110090

Beet quality was analysed before and after storage, including additional parameters. Laboratory experiments, calculating sugar losses from measured carbon dioxide production, showed the effect of both storage temperature and beet injuries. Increasing the storage temperature from 11 to 17°C increased sugar losses by approx. 50%. Intensive cleaning by harvesters also affected the storability of the beet. Intensive cleaning of beet compared to less aggressive cleaning with the same harvester increased sugar losses by approx. 30%. Large beet showed slightly lower storage losses when compared to smaller beet. Defoliation and topping also had some effect on the storability too. Beet store better when there are no petioles left on the beet, this can be achieved by using a good defoliation system or sufficient topping. In practice the effect of covering strategies (incidental coverage at low temperatures and permanent covering with special sheets) on sugar losses were investigated using the ""paired net"" method. Similar storage losses were found with different covering strategies. All experiments showed a decrease of internal beet quality after storage. However, under good storage conditions the reduction in beet quality was limited. Sugar losses may be kept to approx. 150g/1000kg beet/day, with some increase in reducing sugars. Sugar content after storage was higher using polypropylene fleece (TopTex) coverings compared to occasionally covering the clamp during frost, this was due to drying of the beet. However, with TopTex additional covering is required during low temperatures, because it gives insufficient frost protection during windy conditions.","Covering stategies; Netherlands; Quality; Respiration losses; Storage; Sugar beet","Covering stategies; Laboratory experiments; Low temperatures; Netherlands; Reducing sugars; Storage condition; Storage temperatures; Windy conditions; Carbon dioxide; Cleaning; Energy storage; Experiments; Frost protection; Harvesters; Image quality; Polypropylenes; Sugar beets; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54849421106

In this paper, we measured the energy content of greater snow goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica Kennard, 1927) eggs and evaluated their perishability when cached in tundra soil for a whole summer. We estimated that eggs lost only ∼8% of their dry mass over 60 days of storage in the ground. We used published estimates on digestibility of nutrients by arctic foxes to estimate that fresh and stored goose eggs contained 816 and 730 kJ of metabolizable energy, respectively, a difference of 11%. Using information on arctic fox energetics, we evaluated that 145 stored eggs were required to sustain the growth of one pup from the age of 1 to 3 months (nutritional independence). Moreover, 23 stored eggs were energetically equivalent to the average fat deposit of an arctic fox during winter. Finally, we calculated that an adult arctic fox would need to recover 160-220 stored eggs to survive 6 months in resting conditions during cold winter temperatures. This value increased to 480 when considering activity cost. Based on egg acquisition and caching rates observed in many goose colonies, we conclude that cached eggs represent an important source of energy relative to the needs of an arctic fox during winter, and have thus a high fitness value. © 2008 NRC.",,"arctic environment; bioenergetics; caching; canid; digestibility; egg predation; metabolism; nutrition; survival; waterfowl; winter; Alopex lagopus; Anser; Aves; Chen; Chen caerulescens atlantica; Vulpes lagopus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54349102357

The ABL turbulence parameterizations examined are the Blackadar scheme coupled to a simple soil slab model (SSM), and the Troen-Mahrt scheme coupled to SSM or to the more sophisticated Noah land-surface model (NSM). The comparison of several two-way nested high resolution (9-km) MM5 short term 24-h simulations indicate that, although the model is able to capture the trend in the observed data, the computed results deviate from observations. The NSM with a modest treatment of vegetation outperforms the SSM in capturing the observed daily variations in surface heat fluxes and aspects of ABL structure over the tropical land surface at local scales. Detailed analysis showed that, with the incorporation of observed local vegetation and soil characteristics, the NSM reproduced a realistic surface energy balance and near-surface temperature. It is further found that the coupling of the NSM with the Troen-Mahrt ABL scheme leads to excessive ABL mixing and a dry bias in the model simulations. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Atmospheric boundary layer; Indian region; Land surface processes; Mesoscale model; Surface energy balance","Arid regions; Atmospherics; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Climatology; Digital storage; Geologic models; Heat flux; Numerical methods; Soils; Surface chemistry; Surface measurement; Surface tension; Troposphere; Vegetation; Atmospheric boundary layer; Indian region; Land surface processes; Mesoscale model; Surface energy balance; Surface treatment; boundary layer; clear sky; land surface; numerical model; parameterization; semiarid region; turbulence; Asia; Eurasia; Gujarat; India; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53649084186

The preferred crystallographic orientation of the films in both the as-prepared and hydrogenated state made it difficult to unambiguously identify the crystal structure up to now. In this work, identification of the unit cells was achieved by in situ recording diffraction patterns at various tilt angles. The results reveal a hexagonal closed packed structure for all alloys in the as-deposited state. Hydrogenating the layers under 105 Pa H2 transforms the unit cell into face-centered cubic for the Mg70Ti30 and Mg80Ti20 compounds, whereas the unit cell of hydrogenated Mg90Ti10 has a body-centered tetragonal symmetry.

Copolymerization of hydroxyethyl methacrylate-derivatized dextran (dex-HEMA), emulsified in an aqueous poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) solution, with methacrylic acid (MAA) or dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) resulted in negatively or positively charged microspheres, respectively, at physiological pH. The monomer/HEMA ratio ranged between 6 and 57, resulting in microspheres with zeta (ζ)-potentials from -6 to -34 mV and +3 to + 23 mV, for the monomers MAA and DMAEMA, respectively. By altering the emulsification procedure, microsphere batches with various sizes and size distributions were obtained. The aim of the research was to assess the effect of particle size (distribution) and charge on the network properties of the macroscopic hydrogels. The ability to tailor the mechanical properties such as strength and elasticity increases the potential of the hydrogels to be used in a variety of pharmaceutical applications. Additionally, the injectability of these self-assembling hydrogels was investigated. Injectability is an important feature of drug delivery systems, since it allows avoiding surgery. Rheological analysis showed that an increasing surface charge of the microspheres led to stronger hydrogels. Relatively small microspheres (7 μm) with a narrow size distribution (99% smaller than 14 μm) gave rise to stronger hydrogels when compared to larger microspheres of 20 μm with a broad distribution (99% smaller than 50 μm). When small microspheres were combined with large microspheres of opposite charge, it was found that the strongest gels were obtained with 75% small and 25% large microspheres, instead of equal amounts (50/50) of positively and negatively charged microspheres. Computer modeling confirmed these findings and showed that the most favorable composition, related to the lowest potential energy, comprised of 75% small microspheres. Taking both charge and size effects into account, the storage moduli (G′) of the almost fully elastic hydrogels could be tailored from 400 to 30,000 Pa. Injectability tests showed that hydrogels (G′ up to 4000 Pa) composed of equal amounts of oppositely charged microspheres (-7 and +6 mV, average particle size 7 μm) could be injected through 25G needles using a static load of 15 N, an ISO accepted value. In conclusion, a variety of options to control the network properties of macroscopic hydrogels are provided, related to the charge and particle size of the composing dextran microspheres. Furthermore, it is shown that the hydrogels are injectable, making them attractive candidates for a diversity of pharmaceutical applications. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It allowed identifying genes expressed at each developmental stage and the shift occurring from one stage to the other. A major change occurred at the transition from lag phase where final grain size is established to grain filling where starch and protein are accumulated in the endosperm storage tissue. Although the expression of enzymes involved in storage product synthesis is dominant in the accumulation phase, the proportion of protein destination and protein synthesis gene products is still important. Detailed proteomic analysis of metabolism shows an upsurge of the pyruvate-Pi-dikinase (PPDK) in the late filing period (21 DAP onwards) that is interpreted as a switch in the starch/protein balance. This hypothesis is based on biochemical arguments involving the negative effect of PPi on the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Agpase), a key-enzyme of starch synthesis, and the role of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in aromatic amino acid synthesis. It is substantiated by the data on the Opaque-2 gene encoding a transcription factor with pleiotropic effect affecting lysine content and carbohydrate metabolism, thus acting indirectly on starch/amino acid ratio. The direct effect of O2 on PPDK gene expression provides a clue for explaining the competition between C and N metabolisms. This epistatic relationship between PPDK and O2 is further supported by quantitative and association genetics. To cite this article: J.-L. Prioul et al., C. R.

TAGs are synthesized in many animal and plant species to act as an energy reserve. Here, we review some of the studies that have contributed to decipher the metabolic and regulatory networks responsible for the biosynthesis of TAGs in two contrasted model systems: the liver of mice and the maturing oilseed of Arabidopsis. A comparison of the two systems illustrates how distinct transcriptional regulatory systems trigger lipogenesis in response to specific signals: a high carbohydrate diet induces TAG synthesis in the liver of mammalians whereas a developmental program initiates TAG accumulation at the onset of embryo maturation in Arabidopsis.

Capacitor studies of Co (OH)2 over a limited potential window in alkaline electrolytes are reported. A high potential window of a capacitor material is desirable for use in a device. Furthermore, as the specific energy and specific power of a capacitor depend strongly on its voltage, experiments are conducted in the present work to understand the reason for a low potential window for Co (OH)2 as a capacitor material and also to increase its potential window. Experiments are conducted in NaOH and Na2 S O4 electrolytes of various concentrations using electrochemically precipitated Co (OH)2 on stainless steel current collectors in an aqueous Co (N O3)2 electrolyte. Based on the potential window, specific capacitance, and specific energy, it is found that 0.05 M NaOH electrolyte is more appropriate for capacitor properties of Co (OH)2 than the rest of the electrolytes studied. Using a Co (OH)2 electrode with a specific mass of 1.0 mg cm-2 in 0.05 M NaOH, a specific capacitance of about 380 F g-1 is obtained with a potential window of 0.85 V at a charge-discharge current density of 10 A g-1 (10 mA cm-2). © 2008 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Capacitance; Cobalt; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Energy storage; Transition metals; Cobalt hydroxides; Research activities; Super capacitors; Capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52649131851

By employing the wet spinning technique and choosing an appropriate coagulant, the stable suspension of TiO2 and TiO2 composite were directly injected into the coagulation bath to produce fibres. These fibres were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), conductivity measurement, and Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, the AFM results indicated the samples characteristics according to SWNTs at various concentrations in TiO 2 suspension. This study also suggested that different concentration of SWNTs affected the RMS roughness value. The Raman spectra showed peaks which corresponded to their characteristic peaks of TiO2 and SWNTs. The SEM results revealed that the bundles of SWNTs connecting with 2 points of the TiO2 surface was clearly seen whereas some aggregations obtaining from either TiO2 or a dispersant were found. The compounds were identified mainly by comparing their Raman spectra with those of bare TiO 2 and SWNTs. In addition, the combination between CNTs and TiO 2 has been studied to improve the properties of these composite fibres. The mechanical and electrical properties along with surface morphology and electrochemistry of the resulting fibres were also investigated. The presence of SWNTs clearly improved the electrical properties of the composite fibres compared to bare TiO2. The application of the TiO 2/SWNTs composites will be further investigated. © 2008 IEEE.","Coagulant; Composite; Fibre; Single-walled carbon nanotubes; Titanium dioxide; Wet spinning","Chemical properties; Chemical stability; Electric properties; Electronics engineering; Electronics industry; Materials properties; Mechanical properties; Microelectronics; Molecular electronics; Nanocomposites; Nanoelectronics; Nanopores; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN); Titanium; Titanium dioxide; Titanium plating; Carbon nanotubes (CNTs); Characterisation; Chemical-; Coagulant; Composite; Composite fibres; Composite materials; Electrical properties; Fibre; High conductivity; Large surface area; Low density; Mechanical strengths; Single-walled carbon nanotubes; Structural properties; Wet spinning; Wet-spinning technique; Carbon nanotubes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52649123862

The problem is formulated as the maximization of the savings produced by the reduction in energy losses and the avoided costs due to investment deferral in the expansion of the network. The proposed method selects the nodes to be compensated, as well as the optimal capacitor ratings and their operational characteristics, i.e. fixed or switched. After an appropriate linearization, the optimization problem was formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer linear problem, suitable for being solved by means of a widespread commercial package. Results of the proposed optimizing method are compared with another recent methodology reported in the literature using two test cases: a 15-bus and a 33-bus distribution network. For the both cases tested, the proposed methodology delivers better solutions indicated by higher loss savings, which are achieved with lower amounts of capacitive compensation. The proposed method has also been applied for compensating to an actual large distribution network served by AES-Venezuela in the metropolitan area of Caracas. A convergence time of about 4 seconds after 22298 iterations demonstrates the ability of the proposed methodology for efficiently handling large-scale compensation problems.1 © 2008 IEEE.","Capacitor placement; Distribution systems; Large-scale optimization; Mixed-integer linear programming","Buses; Capacitance; Capacitors; Dielectric devices; Distributed parameter networks; Distribution of goods; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Energy conservation; Energy conversion; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Finance; Metropolitan area networks; Optimization; Paper capacitors; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; 21st century; Avoided costs; Capacitor placement; Compensation problems; Computationally efficient; Convergence time; Distribution networks; Distribution systems; Efficient methods; Electrical energy; Energy losses; Large-scale optimization; Linear problems; Metropolitan areas; Mixed-integer linear programming; Operational characteristics; Optimal locations; Optimiz ation problems; Optimizing method; Shunt capacitors; Test cases; Venezuela; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52649121769

The power conditioning is achieved via a DC-DC converter and a DC-AC inverter stages to produce the desired AC source. This is also the case even when the load is of DC type such as the typical electronic devices which require AC adaptors to be powered from the AC mains. The paper presents a hybrid photovoltaic-battery powered DC bus system that eliminates the DC-AC conversion stage resulting in lower cost and improved efficiency. It is also shown experimentally that the AC adaptors associated with the various commonly used electronic devices can be reused with the proposed system and in some cases offer higher operating efficiencies when powered from a DC bus instead. A novel high-gain modified boost converter is also introduced with several times higher voltage conversion ratio than the conventional boost converter topology. This arrangement results in higher DC bus levels and lower cable conduction losses. Moreover, the voltage stress on the modified boost converter power switch is within half the output voltage.

The sample stack structure is Al2 O3 ZnOITO. The effects of the ZnO deposition conditions, such as plasma power, film thickness, and oxygen flow rate, on the electrical characteristics of the MIS capacitors were investigated. The thicknesses of the ZnO and Al2 O3 layers were changed independently in order to examine the influence of full depletion of carriers on the capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics. It was found that the electrical properties of the ZnO thin films changed according to their thickness. This was attributed to a chemical interaction with the under-indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layers during the long growth time (over 2 h), which made it difficult to determine the semiconductor parameters, such as the carrier density. During the process of Al2 O3 film deposition, an interfacial layer was grown between the ZnO and Al2 O3 films. This interfacial layer deteriorated the C-V characteristics of the MIS capacitors because of the interface state increment. It was found that there was a certain range of ZnO and Al2 O3 thicknesses where the optimal properties were achieved. © 2008 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Administrative data processing; Atomic physics; Atoms; Capacitance; Capacitors; Chemical vapor deposition; Civil aviation; Dielectric devices; Electric conductivity; Electric equipment; Electric properties; Energy storage; Insulation; Metal insulator boundaries; Metals; MIS devices; Molecular beam epitaxy; Nonmetals; Optical design; Oxygen; Ozone water treatment; Paper capacitors; Plasma deposition; Plasmas; Pulsed laser deposition; Semiconducting indium; Semiconducting zinc compounds; Semiconductor growth; Semiconductor materials; Switching circuits; Thick films; Tin; Titanium compounds; Zinc alloys; Zinc oxide; Al2 O3 films; Atomic layer depositions; Atomic layers; Atomic-layer-deposited; C-V characteristics; Capacitance-voltage characteristics; Carrier density; Che mical interactions; Deposition conditions; Electrical characteristics; Electrical properties; Film deposition; Film-thickness; Full depletion; Growth time; Indium-tin oxide; Insulating layers; Interface states; Interfacial layer; Metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitors; MIS capacitors; Optimal properties; Oxygen flow rate; Plasma powers; Semiconducting layers; Semiconductor parameters; Stack structures; ZnO thin films; Atomic layer deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52649086770

Under rain-fed farming systemswith little external inputs, their grain yield levels are often low(<1t /ha).However, improvedhybrid cultivars, when grown under well-irrigated and well-fertilized conditions, have been reported to give 8-9 t/ha of grain yield in sorghum and 4-5 t/ha in summer-season pearl millet, indicating high grain yield potential of these crops and the place they deserve in commercial agriculture. Both crops are highly tolerant to drought and soil salinity and high air temperatures, which enhance their agro-ecological adaptation under increasing severity of these major abiotic production constraints and make them increasinglymore relevant in view of climate change.Research shows that sorghum and pearl millet grains are nutritionally comparable or even superior to major cereals such as wheat and rice owing to higher levels of protein with more balanced amino acid profile, dietary energy, vitamins, several minerals (especially micronutrients such as iron and zinc), insoluble dietary fiber leading to lower glycemic index, and phytochemicals with antioxidant properties. Technologies for various processing treatments, such as milling, malting, blanching, acid treatment,dry heating,andfermentation,whichreduceantinutritional factorsandincrease the digestibility and shelf life of various alternative food products such as unleavened flat bread (roti/chapati), porridges, noodles, bakery products, and extruded and weaning food products, have been developed and tested at the laboratory scale. These propertiesandtechnologies enhance the value of both crops for nutritional security of the undernourished vulnerable population and food-based health management of the elite class. Commercialization of these processing and food product development technologies through public and private partnerships can enhance the pace of large-scale adoption of these products and technologies. This should be supported by a demand-driven grain production, procurement, storage, and handling to ensure the consistency of high-quality grain supplies.

The ball-milled PrMg11Ni-Ni composite has the highest initial discharge capacity (973 mAh/g) and high-rate dischargeability (HRD). The cycle life improves with the increase of Ni content, which was confirmed by the XRD results of the ball-milled composites after 10 cycles. By means of electrochemical impedance spectra, linear polarization and anodic polarization measurements, the electrochemical kinetic parameters were studied. It is suggested that the high hydrogen diffusivity and moderate reaction resistance are responsible for the higher discharge capacity and HRD of the PrMg11Ni-Ni sample, while the lower discharge capacity and HRD of the PrMg10Ni2-Ni sample is probably due to the excessively high reaction resistance. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Ball-milling; Cycle performance; Electrochemical hydrogen storage; High-rate dischargeability","Electrochemical properties; Hydrogen; Nonmetals; Ball-milled; Ball-milling; Cycle performance; Electrochemical hydrogen storage; High-rate dischargeability; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52049092732

It evaluates two allocation schemes: Multi-Stage and Contraction &amp; Convergence. It was found that abatement costs as percentages of GDP vary significantly by region, with high costs for the Middle East and the former Soviet Union, medium costs for the OECD regions and low costs or even gains for (other) developing regions. In addition to the abatement costs they incur, fossil-fuel-exporting regions are also likely to be affected by losses of coal and oil exports while the former Soviet Union and South America could experience increased bio-energy exports. Especially in the former Soviet Union and Asia, non-CO2 abatement options are important in the short term in reducing their emissions. Carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, bio-energy use and the use of renewables dominate reductions in the long term in all regions. It was found that the regional costs are influenced more by the assumed stabilisation level and baseline scenario than by the allocation regimes explored or the assumptions for different technologies. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Greenhouse gases; Atmospheric greenhouse; Carbon management; Emission allowances; Carbon monoxide; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); emission control; greenhouse gas; OECD; Asia; Eurasia; Middle East; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749124884

The chain with CCS comprises post-combustion CO2 capture with monoethanolamine, compression, transport by pipeline and storage in a geological reservoir. The two reference chains represent sub-critical and state-of-the-art ultra supercritical pulverized coal fired electricity generation. For the three chains we have constructed a detailed greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, and disclosed environmental trade-offs and co-benefits due to CO2 capture, transport and storage. Results show that, due to CCS, the GHG emissions per kWh are reduced substantially to 243 g/kWh. This is a reduction of 78 and 71% compared to the sub-critical and state-of-the-art power plant, respectively. The removal of CO2 is partially offset by increased GHG emissions in up- and downstream processes, to a small extent (0.7 g/kWh) caused by the CCS infrastructure. An environmental co-benefit is expected following from the deeper reduction of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride emissions. Most notable environmental trade-offs are the increase in human toxicity, ozone layer depletion and fresh water ecotoxicity potential for which the CCS chain is outperformed by both other chains. The state-of-the-art power plant without CCS also shows a better score for the eutrophication, acidification and photochemical oxidation potential despite the deeper reduction of SOx and NOx in the CCS power plant. These reductions are offset by increased emissions in the life cycle due to the energy penalty and a factor five increase in NH3 emissions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However one of the main disadvantages is related to the large quantities of heat required to regenerate the amine solvent that means an important power plant efficiency penalty. Different studies have analyzed alternatives to reduce the heat duty on the reboiler and the thermal integration requirements on existing power cycles. In these studies integration principles have been well set up, but there is a lack of information about how to achieve an integrated design and the thermal balances of the modified cycle flowsheet. This paper proposes and provides details about a set of modifications of a supercritical steam cycle to overcome the energy requirements through energetic integration with the aim of reducing the efficiency and power output penalty associated with CO2 capture process. Modifications include a new designed low-pressure heater flowsheet to take advantage of the CO2 compression cooling for postcombustion systems and integration of amine reboiler into a steam cycle. It has been carried out several simulations in order to obtain power plant performance depending on sorbent regeneration requirements. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Following two complementary approaches, this study conceptualizes innovativeness at two levels of abstraction: general innovativeness (GI), that is, the degree of openness to newness; and specific innovativeness (SI), that is, the predisposition to be among the firsts to adopt innovations in a specific domain. This study measures GI and SI on a sample of SME entrepreneurs by using two different scales that are based on inventories extensively used in this field (i.e., the KAI [Kirton, J.M., 1976. Adaptors and innovators: a description and measure. Journal of Applied Psychology 61 (5), 622-629; Kirton, J.M., 2003. Adaption-Innovation in the Context of Diversity and Change. Routledge, London] and DSI [Goldsmith, R.E., Hofacker, C.F., 1991. Measuring consumer innovativeness. Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 19 (3), 209-222] inventories) and tests their effects on the entrepreneurs' intention to adopt innovations. Secondly, this study relates entrepreneurs' innovativeness (both GI and SI) to their basic personality traits as assessed through the Five-Factor Model of human personality (cf. [Digman, J.M., 1990. Personality structure: emergence of the five-factor model. Annual Review of Psychology 41 (1), 417-440; McCrae, R.R., John, O.P., 1992. An introduction to the five-factor model and its implications. Journal of Personality 60 (2), 1-26]). Finally, it compares the predictive power of both GI and SI on the entrepreneurs' intention to adopt innovations against that of a cognitive model that represents the framework of reference in this field (i.e., the Theory of Planned Behavior [Ajzen, I., 1991. The theory of planned behavior. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 50 (2), 179-211]).

PHAs are polyesters of hydroxyalkanoates synthesized by numerous bacterial species with atleast five different PHA biosynthetic pathways. These are accumulated as an intracellular carbon and energy storage material. This diversity, in combination with genetic and molecular engineering has opened up this area for development of optimum PHA producing organisms. Even though PHAs have been recognized as a good candidate for biodegradable plastics, their industrial application is limited owing to high production cost. The classical microbiology and modern molecular biology have been brought together to decipher the intricacies of PHA metabolism both for production purposes and for the unraveling of the natural role of PHA. This review provides an overview of the different PHA biosynthetic systems, the enzymes involved in PHA biosynthesis and there genetic background followed by a detailed summation of how this natural diversity is being used to develop commercially attractive recombinant process for large scale production of PHAs. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Biodegradable plastic; CAB operon; Metabolic engineering; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Vector","Bacteriology; Biochemical engineering; Biopolymers; Environmental protection; Esters; Industrial applications; Metabolism; Molecular biology; Plastics; Polymers; Sailing vessels; Technology; Bacterial species; Bio-production; Biodegradable plastic; Biodegradable plastics; Biosynthetic pathways; CAB operon; Environmental awareness; Genetic backgrounds; Hydroxyalkanoates; Intracellular carbon; Large scale productions; Metabolic engineering; Molecular engineering; Molecular-biological techniques; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Production costs; Vector; Biochemistry; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50249166573

The present study investigates mainly transient behaviors for carrier number density, electron temperatures, and phonon temperatures, and it compares the results of 3TM with those of 2TM for energy transfer characteristics. In particular, the one-dimensional model is extended to two-dimensional model for the direct estimation of laser-induced crater formation. In addition, the thin film optics and the electromagnetic theory are used to simulate the propagation of laser energy absorption in stratified media with variation of complex refractive index. It is found that quite different tendencies are observed for femtosecond pulse lasers between 2TM and 3TM. For the 3TM, there is clearly nonequilibrium between optical phonons and acoustic phonons when the femtosecond lasers are irradiated, whereas as the laser pulse becomes longer, two different phonons are thermally in equilibrium state. The crater depths and shapes are significantly affected by film thickness, laser fluence, and pulse duration because of the wave interference effect as well as the difference in energy relaxation times. Moreover, the optical properties are found to depend on laser absorption and laser pulses.

The MRTS is designed in such a way that the vertical distance between the two consecutive trays (H) and width of the tray (W) is optimised for different months of the year at different latitudes so that the shadow of the upper tray does not fall on the lower one. The number of stacks in a greenhouse of fixed height (say 4 m) is a direct function of the maximum altitude angle of the sun at noon (αs) at particular latitude. It is observed that at 10°N and 20°N latitudes αs remains greater than 45° (H/W &gt; 1) even during the winter months. It means not more than two stacks are possible inside a 4 m high greenhouse during December and January. The computations show that at 30°N, 40°N and 50°N latitude, the number of stacks inside a greenhouse can be five, seven and twelve, respectively during the winter months of December and January. A transient thermal model coupled with MRTS is also developed to predict the soil, plant and air temperature inside the greenhouse. It is observed that the predicted and measured values are in close agreement. It is also observed that due to the increased mass of soil (in the trays) inside the greenhouse and due to reduced conduction losses to the ground beneath, MRTS also acted as a soil heat storage system before germination of the plants which stored heat during the sun-shine hours and released the same during the off-shine hours and resulted in 5-2°C higher inside air temperature till the early night hours as compared to ambient air temperature. Nursery of marigold (ornamental plant) is successfully raised using the MRTS inside a 3 m high greenhouse having three stacks at 30°N latitude. Experiments showed that there was almost uniform growth of plants in all the three trays. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Complex formation of L with Li+ and H+ causes an appreciable increase in singlet state quantum yield and lifetime of L implying photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the cryptand moiety to naphthalene unit in the free L. The system exhibits photoinduced ET at 77 K in its Tb3+ and Eu3+ complexes with either NO3-1 or Cl-1 as counter-anion. The extent of ET is higher for the Tb3+ complex as compared to that for the Eu3+ complex. In both Tb3+ and Eu3+ complex, the NO3-1 ions influence the relative orientation of donor (L) and acceptor (Ln3+) more in favour of ET than the Cl-1 ions. The rate constants for the ET from the naphthalene moiety of L to the acceptor (Ln3+) have been evaluated at 77 K. The results suggest ET from the triplet state of naphthalene using an exchange mechanism.

Moreover, for the electrooxidation of small organic molecules catalysts have to be multifunctional. For these reasons, the development of various synthesis methods of multimetallic electrocatalysts allowing to control the atomic composition and the microstructure is needed in order to improve the electrocatalytic activity. For this purpose, several methods for the preparation of nanostructured catalysts have been developed in our laboratory (impregnation-reduction method, colloidal route, carbonyl route, microemulsion and electrochemical methods), which allow to prepare multimetallic particles. These catalysts were characterized using physical and physico-chemical methods (XRD, TEM, EDX, electrochemical methods, etc.) in order to check their composition, structure, dispersion, active surface area, etc. Amongst the developed methods, some of them can lead to the formation of alloyed or non-alloyed multimetallic compounds depending on the synthesis procedure. XRD analysis allows us to discriminate the catalyst structures. The influence of the atomic composition and of the nature of foreign metals added to platinum is discussed in terms of electrochemical activity towards oxidation of small organic molecules of interest in energy storage and production. In particular, it appears that non-alloyed Pt-Ru catalysts display higher electroactivity towards methanol oxidation. Electrochemical and DEMS measurements were used to study and to evaluate the influence of the electrocatalyst structure on its electroactivity. The effect of the composition in terms of foreign metal atoms and atomic content of platinum based and platinum-tin based catalysts towards the electrooxidation of ethanol is also discussed from electrochemical experiments and fuel cell test results. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This causes the increase, not only of electricity consumption, but also organic refrigerant leakage due to the use of vapour-compression machines. An experimental research on solar absorption cooling has been carried out at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) in order to evaluate alternative lower impact AC techniques. The facility is based on an on-Campus field of 50 m2 flat plate solar collectors driving a single-effect commercial LiBr/H2O absorption machine through a hot-water storage tank. Experimental operating parameters have been recorded during 2004 summer season in periods of 10 min showing all the relevant figures of merit. Results show that absorption machine cooling power reaches 6-10 kW, with a generator driving power input of 10-15 kW, achieving a mean cooling period of 6.5 h of complete solar autonomy on a seasonal average day. In order to measure the market applicability of this setup, the instantaneous thermal load and demand of a single detached housing of total floorspace of 90 m2 were calculated using standard techniques. Its peak ranged from 6 to 8 kW. Seasonal solar fraction of AC provided by the facility reached 56%. This work shows results on system performance, economic investing, energy and economic savings and includes environmental impact reduction, when comparing the solar absorption system with a conventional vapour-compression machine. A sensitivity study to solar field size has been performed to yield the reasonable share of the absorption machine in the seasonal cooling demand. The result indicates that the dimensioning of the facility is correct. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, grids have emerged to utilize the collective power of many computers. One of them, the data grid, provides a mechanism for handling a large amount of data. One of the characteristics of a data grid is to replicate files to many different computers such that a popular file would be more available. If a grid site does not have a file, it will have to download it from other grid sites. Thus, the parallel download method, which allows a user to download different parts of a file from various computers simultaneously, is used to decrease download time. However, multiple parallel downloads will affect one another. Thus if all jobs in the grid system use parallel download, the problem of resource competition and conflict will happen. In this paper, we propose a parallel download scheme considering the server output throughput limits and client input bandwidth constraints.

In a STFPIC controller, the output-scaling factor is adjusted on-line by an updating factor (α). The value of α is determined from a fuzzy rule-base defined on error (e) and change of error (Δe) of the controlled variable. The proposed self-tuning controller is designed using a very simple control rule-base and the most natural and unbiased membership functions (MFs) (symmetric triangles with equal base and 50% overlap with neighboring MFs). The comparative performances of the proposed STFPIC and the standard fuzzy PI controller (FPIC) have been investigated on two multi-machine power systems (namely, 4 machine, 2 area system and 10 machine 39 bus system) through detailed non-linear simulation studies using MATLAB/SIMULINK. From the simulation studies it has been found out that for damping oscillations, the performance of the proposed STFPIC is better than that obtained by the standard FPIC. Moreover, the proposed STFPIC as well as the FPIC have been found to be quite effective in damping oscillations over a wide range of operating conditions and are quite effective in enhancing the power carrying capability of the power system significantly. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Crumbly sensation relates strongly to the breakdown behaviour of the gels, which is primarily determined by their viscoelastic properties. These properties result from the balance between elastically stored energy and energy dissipation during deformation. The stored energy is determined as the percentage of the recoverable energy in a compression-decompression test. Gels breaking readily via a free-running crack (i.e. high recoverable energy) were perceived as the most crumbly ones. Gels showing slow, yielding-like breakdown (i.e. high energy dissipation) were sensed as the least crumbly by assessors during quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA). Serum release from the gels contributed to a large extent to the energy dissipation and thus decreased crumbliness. Microstructure affects serum release and therefore indirectly microstructure affected the crumbly sensation. The relations between crumbly sensation and physical and structural properties of the gels are, to our knowledge, reported here for the first time and can be applied to control and engineer crumbliness of semi-solid foods. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to compete in the global environment, the ability and effectiveness of acquiring new technology are essential for firms, especially for the traditional machinery industry. In Taiwan, the societal structure is built on the foundation of Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Thus most new technologies need and depend on the Technology Transfer (TT) from international firms and research institutes. Due to the complicity of influence factors of TT, such as features of industry, technology, organization, and talent, difficulties are encountered in evaluating the effectiveness of TT. This study develops a rule-based decision support mechanism using fuzzy set theory and the method of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate the effectiveness of TT. The characteristic of adopting fuzzy set theory is to construct the membership function for those features of influence factors and differentiate the indistinct linguistic terms in order to match true conditions. Finally this study discusses the hierarchical influence factors of TT and provides suggestions for machinery firms with respect to TT effectiveness. © 2008 PICMET.",,"Analytic hierarchy process; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Electric energy storage; Fuzzy sets; Hierarchical systems; Industrial management; Linguistics; Machinery; Membership functions; Set theory; Societies and institutions; Technological forecasting; Technology transfer; Advanced technologies; Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); Decision supports; Fuzzy set theory; Global environments; High-technology; Influence factors; International firms; Linguistic terms; Machinery firms; Machinery industry; New technologies; Portland; Research institutes; Rule-based; Small-medium enterprises; Sustainable economy; Technology managements; Technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52449129362

Without a power converter between the BESS and electronic ballast stage, no power processing loss occurs between these components; therefore, the developed system reduced power losses. The proposed topology is very simple and requires a single active power switch. Carefully selected circuit parameters enable the active power switch to be driven directly by BESS and operated at zero-voltage switching, yielding high circuit efficiency. A prototype circuit that is designed for a PL-27W compact fluorescent lamp is constructed and tested to verify the theoretical predictions. The measured efficiency of the electronic ballast is as high as 94.33%.

Box 1, 1755 ZG Petten, Netherlands","In the traditional operation of electricity networks the system operator has a number of ancillary services available for preservation of system balance. These services are called upon near real-time, after the planning phase. Ancillary services consist of regulating power, reserve capacity and emergency capacity, each with their own characteristics. Regulating power is deployed via load frequency control. Reserve capacity is used to release regulating power and can be called upon to maintain a balance or to counterbalance or resolve transmission restrictions. Both are traded at the Dutch energy market under an auction model with a single buyer (TenneT). Emergency capacity is rewarded on the basis of accessibility/availability within 15 minutes. In local electricity networks neither planning nor ancillary services exist. Planning is done by aggregation into large customer groups. For ancillary services one relies on the system operation as sketched above. In local electricity networks with a large share of distributed generation the costs of keeping the electricity system reliable and stable will increase further and technical problems may arise. The European SmartGrids initiative responds to these challenges in their strategic research agenda. One of the issues addressed in this agenda is the changing role of the distribution grid in which users get a more active role. One opportunity is the introduction of ancillary-type services at the distribution level, utilizing different types of producing and consuming devices in the local network, in order to make the total system more dependable. Distributed generation has a number of characteristics that are similar to characteristics of consumption. Part of it is intermittent / variable, although to a large extent predictable (PV, wind versus lighting, electronic devices). Another part is task-driven (micro-CHP versus electrical heating). Yet another part is controllable or shiftable in time. And storage can behave both ways. The main key words here are flexibility and variability. This flexibility provides a virtual storage capacity within the electricity grid that can be utilized for balancing services at the local grid. We will present how the PowerMatcher concept, developed by ECN, supports the setting up of local balancing markets in a flexible and logical way. The ICT is already available as an enabling technology. The concept has been demonstrated in several field tests. © 2008 IEEE.","Cooperative systems; Distributed control; Multi-agent systems; Power distribution; Power system control","Agglomeration; Customer satisfaction; Electric power systems; Energy conversion; Food preservation; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Power generation; Virtual storage; Wind power; 21st century; Ancillary services; Auction model; Cooperative systems; Coordinated operation; Distributed control; Distributed generation; Distribution grids; Electrical energy; Electrical heating; Electricity grids; Electricity networks; Electricity systems; Electronic devices; Energy markets; European; Field testing; Key words; Large customer; Load-frequency control; Local balancing; Micro-CHP; Multi-agent systems; Planning phase; Power distribution; Power system control; Regulating power; Reserve capacity; Storage capacities; Strategic research agenda; System operations; System operators; Technical problems; Electric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349121865

Next, we present the results of a wind power integration study performed in order to estimate the amount of wind curtailment due to the technical limitations of the conventional units in the Netherlands. It is found that due to must-run constraints on the combined heat and power units, which constitute over 50% of the Dutch production park, sufficient reserve is available to cover wind fluctuations and prediction errors for up to 8000 MW installed wind power. The only limiting factor is the minimum output of the conventional units, which may result in increasing curtailed wind starting around 4000 MW installed capacity.

This paper is to show that the conventional definition of the BETS is inadequate and results in an unfair value for the PF unless the transmission line is perfect and lossless (which is an unrealistic condition). The paper also investigates an alternative definition for the BETS which exists in the literature. The paper concludes that the second definition of BETS is also inadequately used and the line losses are overlooked in the existing formulations. However, the paper shows that the second BETS can be modified and properly used to calculate a fair value for the PF in realistic conditions without overlooking the impact of transmission line losses. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Electric lines; Electric power factor; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Power transmission; Public utilities; Transmission line theory; 21st century; Electric powers; Electric-utility; Electrical energy; Line losses; Lossless; Power factor; Realistic conditions; Reference point; Transmission line; Transmission line losses; Energy conversion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349115416

A smooth transition between these two modes of operation is necessary for reliable operations of the wind turbine under fluctuating wind. This paper presents the analysis and modeling of DFIG based variable speed wind turbine and investigates the control dynamics under two modes of operation. A battery energy storage (BESS) with a bidirectional dc-dc converter is added for a smooth transition between the modes. Mathematical analysis and corresponding modeling results show that the power flow in the rotor circuit under two modes can be controlled by changing current and voltage phase sequence through the rotor side converter (RSC) and line side converter (LSC). A coordinated control among RSC, LSC and DC link storage system ensure variable speed and maximum power extraction from the fluctuating wind and reduce the possibility of instability around synchronous speed.

In this paper, a multilevel converter is proposed to have an enhanced performance at a high speed range. The converter boosts voltage during phase excitation for a four-phase switched reluctance motor(SRM). By using one additional capacitor and switche, an extra controllable boosted voltage can be produced during the rise and fall periods of a motor phase current. Then this active boosted voltage can reduce the effect of EMF at high speeds. The operation and analysis of proposed converter are given for each operation mode. And effect of the boost capacitor voltage on the current waveform is studied. The attractive features of the proposed converter are as follows: obtaining boosted voltage to improve performance of SRM with same numbers of switch and diode as asymmetric converter, having higher control flexibility and capability of boosting voltage compared with passive boosting converters, possessing lower cost and simpler control in comparison with existing active boosting converters. The performances of the proposed circuit are verified by the simulation and experiment results. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Capacitor voltages; Current wave form; Driving performances; During phase; Electromagnetic force; Enhanced performance; Four-phase; Four-phase switched reluctance; High speeds; Lower cost; Motor phase; Multi-level; Multi-level converters; Operation modes; SRM drives; Automobile drivers; Capacitance; Capacitors; Decoding; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electromagnetic waves; Electromagnetism; Energy storage; Motors; Power electronics; Speed; Reluctance motors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349113554

On the other hand, their voltage regulation is poor (or non-existent) during the normal mode of operation. Moreover, both UPSs have a transfer time (also defined as switching time) from normal mode to stored energy mode when the utility power fails. During this switching time (a few milliseconds), the load is still connected to the grid and, therefore, it is affected by the abnormal line conditions. In previous papers, authors proposed different methods for filling voltage notches in line-interactive UPSs. In this paper, a method which eliminates not only notches, but also voltage surges, is proposed. It is based on two capacitors charged one with positive and the other with negative voltage. If any abnormal line condition takes place in the, for example, positive period, the positive capacitor is connected to the load. This connection is then modulated in order to obtain a sinusoidal waveform. This method can make line-interactive UPS more competitive than the double conversion UPS in many situations and cases. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric inverters; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Energy storage; Power electronics; Power supply circuits; Turbulent flow; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Voltage regulators; Double conversion; In-line; Line-interactive UPS; Lower cost; Negative voltages; Normal modes; Sinusoidal waveform; Stored energy; Switching time; Transfer time; Uninterruptible power supplies; Utility power; Voltage regulations; Voltage surges; Uninterruptible power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349113282

Therefore, a clear need exists for small-form-factor high-efficiency DC-DC converters having the necessary passive components integrated within one package. This will enable the integration of a DC-DC converter with the load and consequently the system integration of power management. This paper describes the measurement results of an integrated inductive down converter, where the active electronics (power stage and driver circuitry) has been implemented in 0.18-μm CMOS technology and the passive components (output LC filter and decoupling capacitor) have been implemented in a state-of-the-art proprietary passive-integration process technology using high-density trench-MOS capacitors (80 nF/mm2) and an 8-μm thick copper top metallization layer. The active die of the converter has been flip-chipped on top of the passive die to reduce parasitic component values. This yields a System-in-Package (SiP) that achieves a step-down DC-DC conversion without any external components. Due to the limited inductance achievable with the used planar air coil in the acceptable area, the switching frequency of the DC-DC converter has been increased. At the same time, Zero-Voltage-Switching (ZVS) measures have been implemented to reduce the switching losses at this increased frequency. A maximum efficiency of 65% at 80 MHz has been achieved for an input voltage of 1.8 V, an output voltage of 1.1 V and an output current of 100 mA. After explaining the motivation behind integrated power management and the choice for an integrated inductive converter, this paper describes the main design aspects of the realized integrated inductive DC-DC down converter. Next, it presents some details of the used passive-integration process, the design of the passive die including the LC filter and the construction of the SiP.

ESS using a single technology, such as batteries, or supercapacitors, will have difficulties providing both large power and energy capacities. This paper proposes a flow-battery supercapacitor hybrid ESS, which takes advantage of the two complementary technologies to provide large power and energy capacities. The flow-battery is directly coupled to the WTG dc bus while the supercapacitor has a dc/dc IGBT converter interface. The dc bus voltage varies within a certain limit determined by the variable battery terminal voltage. With the supercapacitor absorbing high frequency power surges, the battery power rating, degree of discharge, and power losses are all reduced.

In grid isolated operation the induction generator requires a proper excitation. A suitable machine excitation can be achieved relying on a Current Controlled Voltage Source Inverter (CC-VSI) with a proper capacitors bank in the DC side. In this way, higher efficiency, higher control dynamic and a very robust behavior in case of transient variation of the prime mover speed is accomplished. A suitable capacitors bank is still used on the AC side, in order to reduce the ratings of the CC-VSI and to avoid pre-charging. This paper presents the quantitative design of the CC-VSI and of capacitors bank used for the power management in grid isolated operation. The aim is to achieve the minimum ratings doing to operate the CC-VSI in two quadrants. The quantitative procedure starts from the load requirements that lead to the choice of induction generator.

The transfer function of the external feedback network is continuously updated by the readouts of the input variables. A rough discretization of the inputs is obtained by a small number of fast comparators that digitally program the filter by means of a look-up table. The analog output drives the error amplifier of the switching converter controller whether it is PWM or phase-shifted or resonant. The present paper refers to a DC/DC converter even though the application can be addressed to any kind of power converter. The possibility of including the circuit into IC controller drivers is open. The non-linear overall characteristics of the power cells often show large differences in the dynamic behaviour depending on the operating point when the variations of the inputs are very large. The possibility of different conduction modes makes the use of a single time-invariant feedback network extremely downgrading the frequency performances. This paper describes a possible circuit topology implementing the switched capacitor adaptive feedback as a second order external network whose transfer function, in the Z domain, can assume as many different forms as required. The potential of this solution is illustrated with a simple example concerning a PWM flyback converter spanning over the discontinuous and the continuous conduction modes. The difficult work of defining the feedback transfer functions set can be carried out by an automatic analysis and CAD tool.

Most of today's VRMs are with inductor-capacitor type output filters. The inductor in the output filter limits the current transient speed. Hence, the secondary-side controlled series resonant converter with capacitor type filter is introduced in this paper to overcome this limitation. The lack of the inductor in its output filter makes it have very quick dynamic response. Also an adaptive control scheme is proposed to control the current-type synchronous MOSFETs, which eliminates the current sensor in the power path.

Also, the clamping circuit does not include additional active switches, so a low cost can be achieved without degrading the efficiency.

It operates in continuous current and PFC modes. This topology is close from the ""VIENNA"" one. By involving two coils, it permits to get a ""Double Boost Effect"", thus improves the rectifier features. Indeed, it exhibits the following advantages: (a) a Boost and a Buck-Boost effects operate and permit to transmit the energy to the DC capacitors even if the mains voltage is positive or negative, (b) for given capacitor values, the DC ripples decrease, (c) the mains current is under control of a self-oscillating controller which accurately tracks its reference. Furthermore, the ""VIENNA I"" rectifier power cell is not able to transmit the energy to both DC capacitors during the positive or negative half-period of the mains. The proposed rectifier can do it. The disadvantage of the investigated topology is to implement two coils. But if the sum of the ""Double Boost Effect"" topology coil inductance values equals the ""VIENNA I"" coil inductance one, the AC/DC ""Double Boost Effect"" rectification works better in term of DC ripple amplitudes. Then, it could be possible to reduce the ""Double Boost Effect"" rectifier capacitor values. In the proposed work, the operating of this new rectifier is studied and verified.

It is assumed that the DSTATCOM controls the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage. An LC output filter is connected at the output of the VSC. With the help of both filter inductor current and filter capacitor voltage control, the voltage across the filter capacitor is controlled. Based on the voltage error, the control is switched between voltage and current control mode. In this scheme, an extra diode state is used that makes the VSC output current discontinuous. This diode state reduces the switching losses because half of the total switching occurs at nearly zero converter current. The effects of different source conditions on voltage at PCC are studied. Voltage angle at PCC is controlled using a PI controller. Simulation studies are performed using PSCAD to validate the efficacy of the proposed controller. © 2008 IEEE.","Discontinuous current; DSTATCOM; Hybrid control; LC output filter","Capacitance; Capacitors; Dielectric devices; Electric equipment; Electric fault currents; Electric potential; Energy storage; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Power converters; Spatial variables control; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; Wave filters; 21st century; Capacitor voltages; Current control; Discontinuous control; Discontinuous current; Distribution static compensator; DSTATCOM; Electrical energy; Filter inductors; Hybrid control; LC output filter; Output currents; Output filtering; Phase distributions; PI controllers; Point of common coupling; Simulation studies; Source conditions; Switching losses; Voltage errors; Voltage-source converter; Energy conversion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349096532

A rotational rheometer (ARES 2000) with the SER Universal Testing Platform were used for the measurement of dynamic data (storage G' and loss G'' moduli) and uniaxial extensional viscosity. It was shown that both processed (branched) mPPs (with and without peroxide) exhibit distinct behavior in uniaxial extensional viscosity (appearance of strain hardening) in comparison to the virgin (linear) mPP. The XPP and PTT-XPP models proved their usefulness for a branching level quantification based on the measurements of steady shear and elongational viscosities. On the other hand, poorer models predictions of the transient extensional viscosity indicate absence of an H branching for the processed mPPs.","Branched PP; Constitutive equations; Extensional rheology","Data storage equipment; Elastomers; Electronic equipment testing; High energy forming; Hydrodynamics; Organometallics; Oxidation; Plasticity; Polymer blends; Polymers; Polypropylenes; Rheology; Strain hardening; Thermoplastics; Viscosity; And modeling; Branched PP; Constitutive equations; Dynamic data; Elongational viscosities; Extensional rheology; Extensional viscosity; Metallocene; Metallocene polypropylenes; Reactive extrusion processing; Reactive processing; Rheological behaviors; Rheological characterization; Rotational rheometer; Steady shear; Technical conferences; Plastic products",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349096179

When in future small nonsynchronous generation units replace a significant part of the synchronous power generation capacity, the total rotational inertia of the synchronous generators is decreased significantly. This causes large frequency variations that can end up in an unstable grid. A way to stabilize the grid frequency is to add virtual rotational inertia to the distributed generators. A virtual inertia can be attained for any generator by adding a short-term energy storage to it, combined with a suitable control mechanism for its power electronics converter. In this way a generator can behave like a ""Virtual Synchronous Generator"" (VSG) during short time intervals, and contribute to stabilization of the grid frequency. © 2008 IEEE.","Distributed energy resources; Distributed generation; Microgrids; Synchronous generators","Electric power generation; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Power electronics; Power generation; Synchronous generators; Synchronous machinery; 21st century; Con trol algorithms; Control mechanisms; Distributed energy resources; Distributed generation; Distributed generators; Electrical energy; Electricity grids; Frequency variations; Generation capacity; Generation units; Grid frequency; Microgrids; Power generators; Rotating mass; Rotational inertia; Rotational speeds; Short time intervals; Electric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349095968

The long-term diffusion of PV is foreseen to depend on the achievable module efficiencies and on the maturity of the different technologies in terms of their manufacturing costs, energy pay-back times, additional BOS costs, and even raw material reserves. Last but not least, the co-evolution of a suitable energy storage network (e.g. hydrogen) is also foreseen to be a mandatory requirement. Cumulative installed capacity worldwide is projected to reach 9,000 GWp in 2050 in the most optimistic scenario, which is reduced to 2,400 GWp in the intermediate scenario. In the third ""pessimistic"" scenario the current economic incentives are not assumed to be sustained long enough to allow PV to become competitive with bulk electricity, resulting in a stunted market growth (500 GWp in 2050). The resulting predictions in terms of costs range from 0.50 to 1.50 €/Wp in 2050, respectively corresponding to 2 - 8 €-cents per kWh in Southern Europe and 4-14 €-cents per kWh in Northern Europe. Within the framework of these three general scenarios, special attention is then put to the role that is likely to be played by thin film technologies, namely amorphous Si, CdTe and CIS/CIGS. These technologies are expected to collectively reach a market share of approximately 45% by as early as 2025 in all but the most pessimistic scenario, wherein the same goal is put off until 2050.

The approach substitutes Double Fourier harmonic series for the PWM switching waveforms and the frequency response of the motor, to create a linear state space model of this type of load. The model requires the mid-frequency response (500Hz - 20kHz) of the induction motor impedance to be identified, and takes skin and proximity effects into account by adding parallel R-L networks to a standard motor model. Model parameters were measured by applying FFT analysis to variable frequency square waves injected into the motor terminals, and fitting parameter values to these measurements using a least squares minimisation method. From the analysis, it was found that the converter voltage balancing behavior degrades substantially at low motor speeds, and that a balance booster filter, as previously proposed, considerably improves the dynamic response.

This constraint leads us to propose a control based on a simplified state-space model. The model allows predicting the state vector evolution for every converter configuration. The control algorithm directly determines the converter switching state which minimizes a simple cost function. A normalization of the state variables is proposed for the cost function calculation in order to ensure a trade-off between the tracking of the load current and the tracking of the capacitor voltages.

First it is shown a design-oriented analysis of the converter considering DCM mode (due to PFM operation for low output currents) and with low values of the floating capacitor (to improve integrability). At transistor-level, a self-driving scheme is proposed which allows supplying the tapered buffer drivers fromthe floating capacitor, thereby reducing the voltage across the power MOSFETs gate dielectric and improving efficiency. The presented converter exhibits enhanced degrees of freedom in the design space defined by the switching frequency, inductor and capacitors values, which have an impact on the achievable efficiency, occupied silicon area and output ripple. An optimized design exploration is carried out for Vbat = 3.6 V, Vo = 1 V, Io = 100 mA, ΔVo = 50 mV, which yields a converter with the following main characteristics: L = 20.9 nH, Co = 18.6 nF, Cx = 3.8 nF and fs = 51.79 MHz (for Io = 100 mA), a power efficiency of 68.51 % and a occupied area of 3.77 mm2, which results in a clear improvement when the same structured design method is applied to classical Buck converter.

The proposed converter features good power factor correction, low current harmonic distortions, tight output regulations and low voltage of link capacitor. An 85W prototype was implemented to show that it meets the harmonic requirements and standards satisfactorily with nearly unity power factor and high efficiency over universal input. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric power factor; Energy storage; Power electronics; Standards; Ac/dc converters; Boost PFC; Capacitor voltages; Dc converters; DC/DC conversion; Doubler; Half-bridge; High-efficiency; Low current; Low load; Low voltages; Output regulations; Power factor corrections; Single-stage; Unity power factor; Voltage conversion ratio; AC generator motors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349086295

The reason for this is twofold. First of all the efficiency of a diesel generator is dependent on the ratio between the average power and the peak power of the generator. The smaller this ratio, the lower the efficiency. Furthermore some loads can regenerate energy. In small grids this energy is mostly not needed elsewhere and should be dissipated. A solution solving both problems mentioned above, is using an energy storage device in the system. This storage can be used for peak shaving and storing regenerated energy. This paper suggests six different power management strategies: Only Generator, Peak Power Shaving, Dynamic Solution, Max On or Off, Average Power and Only Storage. The implications of these algorithms are given for a typical case study on a crane used in the harbor. Calculations show that the Max On or Off, Average Power and Only Storage methods save the most energy. Calculation of the costs shows that adding an energy storage device lowers the cost for all methods. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Data storage equipment; Electric power measurement; Energy management; Energy storage; Flywheels; Power electronics; Average power; Case studies; Diesel generator; Diesel generators; Dynamic solutions; Electricity grids; Energy Storage Device; Peak power shaving; Peak powers; Peak shaving; Power management strategies; Energy conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349086070

Safety is one of the four broad goal areas which was identified and used by the Gen-IV roadmap task force for the screening process implemented to assess the potential of future nuclear energy system candidates. Today, the R&D phase on the 6 selected Gen-IV nuclear energy systems is launched and safety issues play a major role in the definition of the associated programs. In this frame, a special international working group, called RSWG (Reactor Safety Working Group), and in France, a specific group, called GCFS (Groupe Consultatif Français pour la Sûreté) have been set up to address these topics. One of the topics to be dealt with by the GCFS, is the development of evolutionary approaches for the safety evaluation of Gen-IV nuclear energy systems, in particular for future nuclear reactors. However, in the frame of this work, the question was raised on the applicability of these new approaches for the present and future Nuclear Fuel Cycle Facilities (NFCF). Consequently, thoughts were initiated on this theme and the present paper will describe this work. In a first part we describe the facilities which have been considered for this study. Five main categories of plants are identified: uranium conversion, uranium enrichment, fresh fuel fabrication (including MOX fuels), spent fuel storage, spent fuel reprocessing. We exclude here uranium mines, transport of radioactive material and final disposal of nuclear waste because these facilities feature very specific safety characteristics and require particular safety approaches. Then, one identifies; the characteristics of these installations which clearly distinguish them from those of the nuclear reactors in the field of safety. After that, we review the main risks which must be considered for the NFCF by distinguishing 3 main categories of risks: non nuclear internal risks, nuclear internal risks, external risks. The relative importance of each of these risks is analysed and some example of past accidents related to them are provided and commented. In a second part, we describe the general safety principles and the methodology currently used in the French NFCF, and we compare them with those implemented for the safety of the nuclear reactors. We propose in particular a list of fundamental ""safety functions"" which is different from the one usually considered for nuclear reactors. We explain how the fundamental principle of ""defence in depth"" is implemented in French NFCF and we clarify notably how it is applied for the design of confinement barriers. In a third part of this paper, we present the thoughts of the group for the safety of future NFCF. On one hand, we try to anticipate which innovative technologies could be implemented at an industrial scale in the next generation of NFCF, and we identify how these technologies could modify significantly the spectrum of the risks in these facilities. On the other hand, we examine how new safety approaches developed for nuclear reactors could be applied to these facilities.

Independence manifested inequitable water allocations, giving rise to the perception that especially Uzbekistan is the hydro-hegemon in the Amu Darya Basin. But the post-Soviet basin may be, in fact, without a hydro-hegemon. Data presented in this paper suggest that the riparian states are currently engaged in strategies of resource capture, by increasing their water demand without renegotiating agreements. In addition, while during the Soviet hegemony the increase of reservoir capacity upstream was perceived as 'integration' into the larger framework, today the re-emergence of these plans are perceived as a threat.

In this context, which culminated in parliament's adoption of the radioactive waste management bill, it analyses, from an industrial viewpoint, the motivation for separating and transmuting minor actinides, as well as the technical and economic consequences for waste management, given the performance levels that can be envisaged for the various options. The new law underlines the need to reduce the harmfulness of radioactive waste and research into separation and transmutation is continuing with a view to ""an assessment in 2012 of the industrial perspectives for these technologies"" that makes allowance for the developments made with new reactors. This very clearly marks a new departure since researchers are being required to contribute to the creation of consistent industrial plans and to be fully part of them. These plans must include the separation of elements to be transmuted, the fabrication of fuels or targets to be transmuted, and their treatment once they have been unloaded from the reactor. As a world wide operator of the fuel cycle, AREVA intends to make available its experience and to be part of the evaluation of the industrial plans. After all, plutonium recycling, fully mastered by AREVA, is an industrial reality and contributes impressively in the reduction of the waste potential harmfulness. It is admitted that the waste will not be eradicated by transmutation and therefore that the geological disposal is inevitable. But destroying the waste, however partially, is worthy of consideration if it helps to simplify disposal and reduce costs. It may also merely reduce safety assessment uncertainty or increase calculation margins. The results of previous studies, which revealed the difficulty in transmuting long-lived fission products, have shown that research has to focus on the minor actinides. On the one hand, they account for practically all the radiotoxicity of waste and on the other hand, with the exception of two fission products with relatively short half-lives for which suitable interim storage is to be envisaged, they are the main contributors to the thermal load. We therefore examine the possible consequences of management through actinide separation and transmutation on the fuel cycle as a whole, and the advantages to be gained for disposal or release. For example, americium makes a considerable contribution to the thermal load and transmutation would appear possible. Conversely, curium is known to be difficult to transmute and would complicate target or fuel fabrication operations. The potential savings to be made in disposal costs should also make allowance for future optimization, notably thermal. Separation/transmutation costs should include not only special separation workshops and target fabrication units, but also the impact of the modifications required if actinides are to be burnt in power reactors. These issues must be examined in detail now so that all the necessary information is available for the 2012 assessment. If a prototype is to be commissioned before 2020, as envisaged in the law, the objective has to be perfectly clear, given that it will be impossible to continue all the lines of research.",,"Actinides; Americium; Curium; Electric power plants; Fission products; Fuels; Fusion reactions; Industrial research; Industrial waste treatment; Isomers; Laws and legislation; Leakage (fluid); Neutron detectors; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Nuclear industry; Nuclear physics; Nuclear power plants; Optical design; Plutonium; Power plants; Radioactive materials; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Real time systems; Separation; Targets; Thermal load; Thermoanalysis; Transuranium elements; Waste disposal; Waste management; Actinide; Disposal costs; Economic consequences; Fuel cycles; Fuel fabrications; Geological disposals; Half-lives; International Congress on Advances in Nuclear Power Plants; Long-Lived Fission Products; Minor actinides; Nuclear renaissance; Nuclear waste; Performance levels; Plutonium recycling; Power reactors; Radioactive waste management; Radiotoxicity; Safety assessments; Target fabrication; Technical developments; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52249112457

In such reactors the ""warm"" temperature of the diagrid is say 400°C and the ""hot"" sodium temperature above the core is say 550°C. The cold bottom vessel comprises a flat bottom steel plate cooled at about 100°C laying on the concrete basemat, and a cylindrical wall welded to this plate. From the bottom plate, cylindrical skirts support the diagrid at a height of about 2 m. In this bottom space, the sodium remains stagnant and the conductive loss to the bottom is lower than 1/4000 of the reactor power. Relatively to the suspended vessel design, selected for Phenix and Superphenix, several advantages are claimed : weight-related stresses are relieved, and structural masses are much reduced, the construction, sturdy and technically simple, with cylindrical walls, allows easier inspections, all components inside the vessel may be extracted, the volume between the vessel and its concrete vault is reduced, limiting the effect of leaks, the lower fixation of the diagrid, pumps and exchangers provides a better behaviour toward accidents, the thickness of the diagrid, supported by several concentric skirts, may be reduced and its diameter increased, allowing a many years fuel storage on the periphery and easier discharging procedures, heavy refractory elements below the diagrid are able to stop potential melted material flows without external accident, while suspended vessels could not support a such heavy protection. these elements reduce the heat and neutron fluxes reaching the bottom. this bottom space may act as a cold trap for Na2O and NaOH, a useful negative coefficient appears since the core dilates upwards and the control rods downwards. The cold bottom design is here applied to loop type reactors. In known loop reactors, with complex arrangements of pipes connected to vessels, the primary sodium area is extended, with corresponding aggression risks, but exchangers and pumps may be repaired independently. Here the following features are selected : External vessels for exchangers, sodium pumps and steam generators, containing less heavy components, may rest on dry skirts, Sodium is introduced from the bottom in the diagrid, using U-shaped pipes, The core vessel wall is protected against thermal transients by a static sodium layer, The hot sodium exits radially from the core vessel upper part to the exchanger vessels. Secondary circuits may use a gas instead of sodium and be driven by gas turbines, Lined, leak monitored cooled concrete vaults surrounds the vessels, Argon ascends in the spaces between the wall and the liner from the bottom to the top space of the reactor. In known designs, nitrogen volumes surround the reactor vessel and argon circuits. In these cylindrical spaces, insulation screens could slide for an emergency natural cooling to the liners. A general concrete caisson contains the reactor, exchangers vessels and connecting pipes, and possibly steam generators. For safety against aggressions, this caisson is built below the soil level, without sodium pipes or tanks above the soil. For compactness, a large use of pipe bellows is proposed. At the end of the reactor life, concrete and metallic structures below the soil level may be left in place. Then the advantages of the cold resting bottom vessel are maintained in the loop design and the complexity of known pipe systems is reduced. Calculations are annexed on connection stresses. If a robust and economical design is selected, as here attempted, sodium cooled fast reactors are the easier way to satisfy the energy needs in the world without undue recourse to fossil fuels.",,"Bottom plates; Cold trapping; Cylindrical walls; External-; International Congress on Advances in Nuclear Power Plants; Material flows; Nuclear renaissance; Nuclear technologies; Primary circuits; Reactor power; Refractory elements; Sodium cooled reactor; Sodium reactor; Steel plates; Vessel designs; Electric power plants; Extraction; Fuel storage; Leakage (fluid); Liquid metal cooled reactors; Molecular beam epitaxy; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Nuclear reactors; Plates (structural components); Power plants; Pumps; Refractory concrete; Sodium; Walls (structural partitions); Accidents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52249106866

Numerous criteria for partner selection are given by researchers and each seems to be critical in its own setting. However, these criteria do not help organisations that wish to apply these criteria to their business collaborations as there are too many to be considered. As market opportunities move rapidly, organisations could lose their chances to pursue those opportunities due to the amount of time that is needed to consider all the criteria. There are two categories of criteria for partner selection - task-related and partner-related criteria. Nevertheless, the focus of this paper is on partner-related criteria.

Several previsions on the evolution, time dependant, of the world primary energy sources, and the world population are available, showing similar results up to 2030/2050. The discrepancies appear beyond that period. Based on these previsions, the different scenarios are presented and analyzed for the electronuclear production. Until 2050, the different previsions are quite consistent; while they differ by a factor 2 or more for year 2100. Thus, the installed nuclear capacity for year 2050 corresponds to a mean value of about 1100 GWe within a reasonable range between 700 to 1200 GWe. While for year 2100, these installed capacities range from 2404 GWe to 5773 GWe. However, it should be noticed that all scenarios, whatever their assumptions, show an increase of the electronuclear capacity. Then, evolution of uranium consumption and cost with time, according to various scenarios is calculated. The Uranium consumed in 2050 jumps from a value ranging between 5 and 8 Mtons, to a value reaching 17 Mtons, in order to account for the uranium needs for the new nuclear reactors built before, which are aimed to last 60 years. In 2100, a minimum level of 20 Mtons can be reached, for the scenario IIASA C which is the least conservative. The sharp increase of uranium price due to extraction from ores with very low uranium content (academically from sea water) can be foreseen before end of the century. This increase leads to clear tension on the uranium market. In spite of this high price of uranium, and in spite of higher anticipated construction costs of Gen IV systems in comparison to those of Gen II or Gen III reactors (20 to 30% more expensive), Gen IV systems still appear more competitive economically between 2050 and 2080 due to their recycling/reprocessing capacities, allowing also to save the specific ""resource"" for long term storage of spent fuels.",,"Electric power plants; Extraction; Fuel storage; Minerals; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear propulsion; Nuclear reactors; Ore treatment; Ores; Power plants; Solvent extraction; Spent fuels; Storage (materials); Transuranium elements; Uranium; Water content; Construction costs; Energy needs; High prices; International Congress on Advances in Nuclear Power Plants; Long-term storage; Mean value; Nuclear capacity; Nuclear renaissance; Primary energy sources; Sea-water; Sharp increase; Uranium contents; World populations; Actinides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52249100956

Computers & and Chemical Engineering, 31(7), 677-691] is applied to derive robust decentralized controllers in the challenging benchmark of the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). The hierarchical control design is based on the link between thermodynamics and passivity theory as well as on the fundamentals of process networks. First, the TEP process network is decomposed into abstract mass and energy inventory networks. It is over these subnetworks where conceptual inventory control loops are developed to guarantee the convergence of the mass and energy inventories to a given compact region defined by constant inventories. Thermodynamics gives us a function (the entropy) which has a definite curvature (concavity) over these compact regions of the state space. This function can then be employed on these regions to derive natural storage or function candidates which can be used in designing controllers for stabilizing the network. The last step in the systematic control design procedure will be the realization of the controllers using the available degrees of freedom of the process. The inventory control laws will be obtained as a composition of control loops implemented over the real manipulated variables (degrees of freedom). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The current research aims to investigate the interaction between these different scales as well as the estuarine morphodynamic evolution. Use is made of a process-based, numerical model describing 2-D shallow water equations and a straightforward formulation of the sediment transport and the bed level update. This was done for an embayment with a length of 80 km on a timescale of 3200 years, with and without bank erosion effects. Special emphasis is put on analyzing the results in terms of energy dissipation. Model results show that the basins under consideration evolve toward a state of less morphodynamic activity, which is reflected by (among others) relatively stable morphologic patterns and decreasing deepening and widening of the basins. Closer analysis of the tidal wave shows standing wave behavior with resonant characteristics. Under these conditions, results suggest that the basins aim for a balance between the effect of storage and the effect of fluctuating water level on wave celerity with a negligible effect of friction. Evaluating the model results in terms of energy dissipation reflects the major processes and their timescales (pattern formation, widening, and deepening). On the longer term the basin-wide energy dissipation decreases at a decreasingly lower rate and becomes more uniformly distributed along the basin. Analysis by an entropy-based approach suggests that the forced geometry of the configurations prevents the basins from evolving toward a most probable state.

The second stage approaches the final truncation point through calculating rate-distortion slopes. The third stage incorporates the evaluation of perceptible distortion into the rate-distortion control scheme of PCRD method to achieve the optimal truncation point without encoding all the image data.

Centrifugal compressors have been one of the main workhorses in meeting these challenges. Their thermodynamic evolution is reaching maturity with efficiencies reaching the 90% level. However, their mechanical evolution is still far from optimum. The latest evolutionary steps have been the introduction of dry gas seals and active magnetic bearings in the 80's, each with strongly fluctuating levels of success. This was followed by seal-less compressor solutions for clean gas applications in pipeline transmission and gas storage. The majority of the compressor applications in Oil & Gas, however, handle nonclean, i.e., dirty gas. Furthermore, the industry is facing an increased demand for handling toxic gases (high H2S content) in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.

In this paper, a distributed computing model suitable for industrial applications such as surveillance systems or mobile robots is introduced. The computing model is called the Dynamic Distributed Computing (DDC) model. The dynamic join of distributed devices for sharing data together and processing tasks in parallel is an important characteristic of the proposed DDC model. For battery-enabled devices, the required electrical energy can be shared between the devices. Consequently, it not only can avoid the early termination of the devices due to running out of battery powers, but also can maintain the full functions provided by the complete devices for a steady period. The DDC model also supports a logical shared data space, through which information can be easily exchanged between devices. In addition, parallel programming over shared memory architecture is usually thought to be simpler than other methods. An environment supporting the DDC model, called D2MCE, is introduced in this paper. Experiment results show that good performance can be obtained by the DDC model, and the required electrical energy can be effectively shared by the participating devices. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Chlorine compounds; Data processing; Data storage equipment; Distributed computer systems; Industrial applications; Industrial electronics; Parallel programming; Complex tasks; Computing models; Distributed Computing; Distributed devices; Early termination; Electrical energy; Environment supporting; Industrial devices; Mobile robots; Shared data; Shared-memory architecture; Surveillance systems; Electronics industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51949108718

In order to execute spatial range query efficiently in sensor networks, many rectangle based index methods are researched, such as SPIX method. This kind of method is efficient to transmit user queries to the queried range, but it defines the sensor nodes' results return path as the opposite path of its query transmit path. As a result, the energy used in query results return path is as same as the queries transmit process. In this paper, query result back forwarding method is proposed by rearranging the query results transmit route to aggregate the result data in queried range adaptively. By using the proposed method the energy cost in the query result transmits process is reduced and the spatial range queries are processed energy efficiently. In the performance evaluation, the proposed method decreased the energy cost efficiently while processing the different kinds of spatial range queries. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Energy costs; Energy-efficient; International conferences; Language processing; Performance evaluation; Query results; Range queries; Range query processing; Sensor nodes; Spatial range queries; Transmit path; Ubiquitous sensor networks; User queries; Web information; Conservation; Data storage equipment; Energy efficiency; Information technology; Linguistics; Query processing; Sensors; Technology; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless sensor networks; Sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51949107486

The contribution of this paper is a methodology that facilitates the analysis of energy harvesting nodes.

Battery-operated sensors have to avoid heavy use of their wireless radio by compressing the time series sensed data instead of transmitting it in raw form. One of the most commonly used compacting methods is piecewise linear approximation. Previously, Liu et al. proposed a greedy PLAMLiS algorithm to approximate the time series into a number of line segments running in Θ(script N2log script N) time, however this is not appropriate for processing in the sensors. Therefore, based on our study we propose an alternative algorithm which obtains the same result but needs a shorter running time. Based on theoretical analysis and comprehensive simulations, it is shown that the new proposed algorithm has a competitive computational cost of Θ(script N log script N) as well as reducing the number of line segments and so it can decrease the overall radio transmission load in order to save energy of the sensor nodes. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Communication; Data processing; Data storage equipment; Piecewise linear techniques; Sensor networks; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Time series analysis; Wireless sensor networks; Communication technologies; Continuous data; Data collections; International conferences; Line segments; Physical phenomenon; Piece-wise linear approximation; Processing center; Running-in; Sensor nodes; Temporal correlation; Time-series; Wireless radios; Technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51949098055

ARM processor has been a major player in embedded system industry over the last 10 years. However, there are many restrictions on developing embedded software using ARM processor in the early design stage. For those who are not familiar with embedded software equipment, testing their software on a real ARM hardware platform is a challenging job. To overcome such a problem, we have designed Virtual ARM Platform, which offers easier testing and debugging environment to ARM based embedded system developers. Major benefits that can be achieved by utilizing a Virtual ARM platform are (1) reducing development cost, (2) lowering the entrance barrier for embedded system novices, and (3) making it easier to test and debug embedded software designs. Unlike many other purely software-oriented ARM simulators which are independent of real hardware platforms, our proposed Virtual ARM Platform is specifically targeted on SYS-Lab 5000 ARM hardware platform, (designed by Libertron, Inc.,) which means that Virtual ARM Platform imitates behaviors of embedded software as if the software is running on the target embedded hardware as closely as possible.

Previous 3D non-rigid model registration methods can only be applied to the mesh or volume representations, but not directly to implicit surfaces. To our best knowledge, the previous 3D registration methods for implicit surfaces can only handle rigid transformation and they must keep the data points on the surface. In this paper, we propose a new 3D non-rigid registration algorithm to register two multi-level partition of unity (MPU) implicit surfaces with a variational formulation. The 3D non-rigid transformation between two implicit surfaces is a continuous deformation function, which is determined via an energy minimization procedure. Under the octree structure in the MPU surface, each leaf cell is transformed by an individual affine transformation associated with an energy that is related to the distance between two general quadrics. The proposed algorithm can directly register between two 3D implicit surfaces without sampling on the two signed distance functions or polygonalizing implicit surfaces, which makes our algorithm efficient in both computation and memory requirement. Experimental results on 3D human organ and sculpture models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Deformation; Feature extraction; Image processing; Knowledge based systems; Mesh generation; Pattern recognition; Storage allocation (computer); Surface structure; Three dimensional; 3-D registration; Affine transformations; Continuous deformation; Data points; Energy minimization procedure; Implicit surfaces; Memory requirements; Multi-level Partition of Unity; Noisy data; Non-rigid registration; Non-uniform sampling; Registration methods; Rigid model; Rigid transformations; Signed distance functions; Variational formulations; Three dimensional computer graphics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849161390

We consider wireless data broadcasting as a way of disseminating information to a massive number of users. To address the issues of responsiveness, energy consumption and bandwidth contention in wireless communications, an index has to minimize the search time and maintain a small storage overhead. A linear index structure based on the D-Tree is used to support location dependent queries, which is reduced to planar point queries. In this paper, we propose a modified D-Tree index structure for processing location dependent information focusing on window queries via wireless data broadcast in a mobile environment. Hilbert curve is used to reduce the data regions that have to be searched from the whole space. Filtering mechanisms are used to find the real answer set. To improve the query processing two techniques namely, fixed grid assignment by which the given space is partitioned into several disjoint sub-grids and caching mechanism that improves access latency were used. ©2008 IEEE.","Data broadcast; Location dependent window queries","Access latency; Answer sets; Data broadcast; Data regions; Energy consumption; Fixed grids; Hilbert curves; Index structures; International networking; Killer applications; Location dependent window queries; Location-based Services; Location-dependent queries; Mobile environments; Search time; Storage overhead; Sub-grids; Wireless communications; Wireless data; Wireless data broadcast; Data processing; Data storage equipment; Energy policy; Location; Mechanisms; Query processing; Radio broadcasting; Telecommunication; Trees (mathematics); Windows; Wireless telecommunication systems; Data reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849159685

The overall system consist of a 640×480 array of capacitor sensors and actuators. Sensors detect dielectric permittivity variation thanks to dielectrophoresis (DEP) process. Usually for this kind of applications an off-chip analog-to-digital converter is used. As a consequence, the noise floor increases and high signal-to-noise ratios are difficulty achieved. On the other hand, these applications requires a stringent noise floor specification (>10b) and a relaxed linearity (≈8b). In this design, the noise coupled to the signal at the chip pad is reduced by using an on-chip analog-to-digital converter. The complete sensor readout channel is composed by two main blocks: a pre-amplifier with programmable gain and an algorithmic analog-to-digital converter with a 1.5-bit/stage architecture. Each one is realized with fully differential switched capacitor technique. In order to save chip area and power consumption a time sharing technique has been taken into account using a single operational amplifier for the pre-amplification stage and the conversion stage. The proposed A/D converter has lib resolution, a sampling rate of about 100ksample/s and an input full-scale range of 1.2Vp-p differential. Simulation results show a SNR=65.7 dB and an ENOB value of 10.6b. Its power consumption is about 150μW.

A main disadvantage of wind energy generation (WEG) is the variation of its output power with the variation of wind speed. Such variation may lead to significant consequences on the power quality. When a critical load is fed from both the infinite grid and a wind farm, such that, it is predominantly fed from the WEG while it is connected to the infinite grid via a much weaker transmission line, variation of wind speed will produce serious voltage fluctuations on the load bus. Such fluctuations could result in losing the load. This paper describes a simple test network presenting a rural critical load which is partially fed from a wind farm in addition to the grid. The effect of wind variation on the power quality is studied. A battery bank is connected to the load bus, and its effect is simulated and discussed. Although expensive, connecting a battery bank to critical loads predominantly fed from a wind farm establishes a significant improvement to power quality. © 2008 IEEE.","Power quality; Power system dynamics; Power system simulation; Wind energy; Wind power generation","Battery storages; Critical loads; Electrical and computer engineering; Output powers; Power system dynamics; Power system simulation; Renewable energy sources; Transmission line; Voltage fluctuations; Wind energy; Wind energy generation; Wind energy systems; Wind farms; Wind power generation; Wind speed; Wind variation; Buses; Conservation; Electric measuring instruments; Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Farms; Power generation; Power quality; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Speed; Technology; Wind effects; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849126156

Power delivery network designs are usually achieved by mounting the decoupling capacitors on power plates so that the designed power impedance is relatively lower on the interested frequency ranges. But, some parts out of frequency-dependant impedance profile of power delivery networks that make the major effect on noise performances of digital, RF, and analog chips does not be very clear according to chip's family. In this paper, we demonstrate the analysis of power delivery networks for the multiple voltage domains on an analog PLL jitter performance.

Capacitor cells made of activated carbon cloth are analyzed using ac impedance spectroscopy. To reduce the internal resistance, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are grafted on the carbon cloth via sputtering catalyst seeding, followed by chemical vapor deposition with C H4. The impedance spectra of the assembled capacitor cells showed that the internal resistance of the electrodes was significantly reduced from 0.9 to 0 . In addition to the increase in the electronic conductivity, the introduction of CNTs also enhanced the utilization factor of the carbon electrode, thus leading to a more efficient double-layer formation inside carbon micropores. Constant phase element analysis of the capacitive behavior in micropores showed that the deviation from ideality was less significant for the carbon cloth grafted with CNTs. This developed CNT-grafting technique significantly promoted the power performance of carbon cloth by enhancing the transport of both electrons and ions in the assembled capacitor cells. At a current density as high as 150 mA cm-2, a capacitance loss of only 7% (compared to the ultimate value) was obtained for the CNT-grafted carbon cloth. © 2008 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Charcoal; Chemical vapor deposition; Current density; Dielectric devices; Electric equipment; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolysis; Electrolytic capacitors; Energy storage; Grafting (chemical); Metallizing; Microporosity; Nanocomposites; Nanopores; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes; Sputter deposition; AC impedance spectroscopy; Activated-carbon cloths; Capacitive behavior; Capacitor cells; Carbon cloth; Carbon electrodes; Carbon nanotubes (CNTs); Chemical vapors; Constant phase elements; Double layers; Electric double-layer capacitors; Electronic conductivities; Impedance spectrum; Internal electrodes; Internal resistance; Micro-pores; Power capabilities; Power-performance; Utilization factor; Activated carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849087722

At 200 °C, temperature at which MgH2 does not show any activity, Mg H2 Nb F5 / 2 mol % composite desorbs 3.2 wt.% of H2 in 50 mins. Interestingly, the addition of NbF5 is also associated with an increase in the desorption pressure. At 300 °C, Mg H2 Nb F5 / 2 mol % composite starts to desorb hydrogen at 600 mbar in comparison with 1 mbar for MgH2. Further improvements were successfully achieved by pre-grinding NbF5 prior to ball-milling the catalyst with MgH2. Such pre-ground NbF5 catalyzed MgH2 composite desorbs 3 wt.% of H2 at 150 °C. Improved properties are associated with smaller activation energies down to values close to the enthalpy of formation of MgH2.

Therefore, in this paper, DTT is examined and treated for transform coding applications. A framework is laid to derive an approximationfree integer representation of DTT to meet the current application requirements. A fast algorithm is further proposed for multiplier-free computation of DTT. The image compression performance of the 4-point DTT is found to be superior to that of the 4-point discrete cosine transform (DCT) and integer cosine transform (ICT), the integer approximation of DCT. It is shown that the fast DTT is easily derived, has low complexity, does not involve approximations and can be carried out within the same dynamic range. Hence, DTT can be used for image and data compression applications. Since the image compression performance and computational simplicity of DTT are found to be significantly better than that of ICT, the use of DTT in place of ICT for transform coding in the H.264/AVC looks promising. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Applications; Boolean functions; Chebyshev approximation; Clutches; Compaction; Cosine transforms; Digital image storage; Discrete cosine transforms; Electric fault location; Image coding; Image compression; Mathematical transformations; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Polynomial approximation; Programming theory; Speech recognition; Technical presentations; Video signal processing; Compression performance; International symposium; Transform coding; Data compression",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749124485

Subsequently, the system moves into the analog tracking mode during which all areas outside of the WOI are entirely shut down, thus saving power to a number of orders of magnitude. In addition to its low power dissipation, the sensor features real-time operation, low fixed pattern noise, linearity and the ability to track a predefined number of targets throughout the entire field of view.

According to Amdahl's law, if the power consumption of cache memories is reduced, the embedded processor can significantly save much power. However, the cache misses result in the penalty of thousands of cycles waiting and power consumption due to increasing the number of external memory access. Based on the above reason, the phased cache design is proposed and can largely improve the power consumption which wastes a set-associative cache. In this paper, the embedded pipelining processor without stalling and low-power phase cache is practiced with high-level simulation to achieve high-performance and low-power design.

The simulation results show the leakage power reduction is 70.7% and energy metric of TCAM macro is 0.047 fJ/bit/search. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Associative storage; CMOS integrated circuits; Computer networks; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Microprocessor chips; Networks (circuits); Technical presentations; Energy-efficient; Power gating; Leakage currents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749097076

Previously, the GIS at Fengchia University has constructed and deployed state-of-the-art, stationary and mobile types of observation systems at nearly 20 sites throughout Taiwan. These sites collect data from sensors ranging from rain gauges and tension cables to ultrasonic sensors and CCD cameras, and transmit them back to the GIS via a lower-orbit satellite uplink in real-time. A new wireless sensor network and middleware system are being designed and implemented to overcome several limitations with the current system. Wireless communication capabilities are being incorporated to enhance the coverage. Previously, most connections between the sensors and the server before the satellite uplink are wired or Wi-Fi with fixed topology and limited range. New wireless interfaces with a 500m-1km range plus energy harvesting devices on the sensors reduces deployment effort and cost. More importantly, it is now becoming possible to construct and deploy brand new types of mobile sensor nodes that move with the debris flow along its path. Such sensor nodes are to be housed in pyramid-shaped, weather-proof capsules that contain motion sensors, GPS and other localization devices, energy harvesting and storage devices, and wireless transceivers. Normally in low-power or standby mode, these capsules would be deployed in the path of potential debris flows. They would stand steadily during normal weather conditions including wind, rain, and water flow. They would get triggered by a threshold motion detector or a rain gauge and start actively monitoring the flow. As it flows with the debris, these capsules transmit their sensor data wirelessly, via other relaying nodes if necessary. Based on the shape and mass of the capsule itself and the velocity, researchers can derive the direction and magnitude of the flow in brand new ways. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Ad hoc networks; Arsenic compounds; Cameras; Charge coupled devices; Communication; Computer networks; Data storage equipment; Debris; Fluid mechanics; Gages; Geographic information systems; Harvesting; Hybrid sensors; Insulating materials; Meteorological instruments; Middleware; Rain; Rain gages; Routing protocols; Satellites; Sensor networks; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Thickness measurement; Wind power; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Debris flows; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749084672

Most of these service requests are resolved by level-1 persons (service desk attendants) by providing information/quick-fix solutions to customers. For each service request, level-1 personnel identify important keywords and see if the incoming request is similar to any historic incident. Otherwise, an incident ticket is created and, with other related information, forwarded to incident's subject matter expert (SME). Incident management process is used for managing the life cycle of all incidents. An organization spends lots of resources to keep its IT resources incident free and, therefore, timely resolution of incoming incident is required to attain that objective. Currently, the incident management process is largely manual, error prone and time consuming. In this paper, we use information integration techniques and machine learning to automate various processes in the incident management workflow. We give a method for correlating the incoming incident with configuration items (CIs) stored in Configuration management database (CMDB). Such a correlation can be used for correctly routing the incident to SMEs, incident investigation and root cause analysis. In our technique, we discover relevant CIs by exploiting the structured and unstructured information available in the incident ticket. We present efficient algorithm which gives more than 70% improvement in accuracy of identifying the failing component by efficiently browsing relationships among CIs. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Incident Management; International conferences; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Computer networks; Database systems; Electric energy storage; Large scale systems; Learning systems; Life cycle; Security of data; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51649086425

We built two different-sized spring-mass models (SMM #1 and SMM #2). SMM #1 was built from the previously published data, and SMM #2 was built to be dynamically similar to SMM #1. The potential gravitational energy (EP), kinetic energy (EK), and potential elastic energy (EE) were taken into account to test our hypothesis. For both SMM #1 and SMM #2, NMo-Dela=(EP+EK)/EE reached the same mean value and was constant (4.1±0.7) between 30% and 70% of contact time. Values of NMo-Dela obtained out of this time interval were due to the absence of EE at initial and final times of the simulation. This phenomenon does not occur during in vivo running because a leg muscle's pre-activation enables potential elastic energy storage prior to ground contact. Our findings also revealed that two different-sized spring-mass models bouncing with equal NMo-Dela values moved in a dynamically similar fashion. NMo-Dela, which can be expressed by the combination of Strouhal and Froude numbers, could be of great interest in order to study animal and human locomotion under Earth's gravity or to induce dynamic similarity between different-sized individuals during bouncing gaits. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Especially, energy consumption affects the network lifetime so that energy efficiency is an important requirement for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It means that it is a considerable matter to choose the energy- and memory-efficient cryptographic algorithm suitable for wireless sensor networks. TinySec, de facto security architecture for wireless sensor networks, supports traditional cryptographic algorithms such as RC5 and Skipjack while the traditional cryptographic algorithms might be unsuitable for 8-bit computing devices of which wireless sensor networks consist. Accordingly, it is necessary to evaluate the traditional cryptographic algorithms and 8-bit oriented cryptographic algorithm in performance but there is no work in this area. In this paper, we consider another candidate HIGHT, designed to be proper to ubiquitous 8-bit computing devices (e.g. sensor node or RFID tag), for wireless sensor networks. After implementing new lightweight HIGHT on Mica2 and analyzing the performance between HIGHT and the traditional cryptographic algorithms, we can conclude that HIGHT, outstanding in security and efficiency, is recommended for TinySec as like traditional cryptographic algorithms on TinySec. Hence, we recommend new lightweight candidate HIGHT to be added to security module in TinySec. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Boolean functions; Computer networks; Cryptography; Data storage equipment; Efficiency; Electric load forecasting; Energy efficiency; Hybrid sensors; Information services; Radio navigation; Sensor networks; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51349161002

Nevertheless, energy storage and its degradation still keep on being the main issues in the design of any battery powered device. We present an autonomous power source based on a new system architecture, which uses the energy scavenging to replenish two different rechargeable energy buffers instead of the conventional single one. Combining appropriately a degradable large backup battery (Lithium-Ion) and a shorter but non degradable storage element (Supercapacitor), the lifetime of the group can be widely extended to what we can call near perpetual operation, for such a changing technology. This paper analyses and describes the keys of the design and the optimal hardware selection to implement an inexhaustible power source. Finally we implement a real one that takes advantage of the sunlight energy and intelligently manages both energy buffers, without the human intervention and without depending on any programmable device like microcontrollers. ©2008 IEEE.","Energy harvesting; Management; Photovoltaic power; Renewable energy; Wireless sensors","Computer networks; Data fusion; Electric network synthesis; Instruments; Lithium; Measurement theory; Sensor data fusion; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Energy harvesting; Management; Photovoltaic power; Renewable energy; Wireless sensors; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51349160510

As a result, autonomous sensors can be modeled as low-power pulsed loads. Power is provided by batteries, either primary or secondary. Whenever the autonomous sensor wakes up, a significant voltage drop can appear between the battery terminals, thus preventing to squeeze all the available energy from the battery and leading to a reduction of the load runtime. This work proposes the use of hybrid-storage units, formed by the parallel combination of a battery and a (super)capacitor, in order to extend the runtime of low-power pulsed loads. We show analytical expressions of the transient voltage drop at the terminals of the hybrid-storage unit and deduce the minimal value of the capacitor to be usedfor a given voltage drop. Experimental results support the theoretical analysis. We tested several combinations of batteries and capacitors as the hybrid-storage unit under pulsed loads of tens of milliamps. Finally, we assessed the performance of the hybrid-storage unit when using as a load a commercial transceiver intended for wireless sensor networks applications. ©2008 IEEE.","Autonomous sensors; Battery impedance; Battery squeezing; Battery-capacitor storage; Runtime extension; Wireless sensor networks","Arsenic compounds; Capacitance; Capacitors; Computer networks; Dielectric devices; Drops; Electric equipment; Electric network analysis; Fluid mechanics; Instruments; Measurement theory; Port terminals; Sensor networks; Sensors; Voltage control; Wakes; Autonomous sensors; Battery impedance; Battery squeezing; Battery-capacitor storage; Runtime extension; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51349127846

In order to compensate the voltage sag problem, power compensation devices have widely been developed. In the case of voltage sag, it needs an energy source to overcome the energy caused by voltage sag. According as the SMES device is characterized by its very high response time of charge and discharge, it has widely been researched and developed for more than 20 years. However, before the installation of SMES into utility, the system analysis has to be carried out with a certain simulation tool. This paper presents a real-time simulation algorithm for the SMES system by using the miniaturized SMES model coil whose properties are same as those of real size SMES coil. With this method, researchers can easily analyse the performance of SMES connected into utility network by abstracting the properties from the real modeled SMES coil and using the virtual simulated power network in RSCAD/RTDS. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the past few years, many works have been done to improve its efficiency by reducing redundant broadcast messages. However, most of these works assume that all sensor nodes are active throughout a broadcast process and thus are difficult to be deployed in low duty-cycled WSNs, where sensor nodes switch between work and sleep to save energy and extend the network's life time. This problem is further aggravated by the difficulties to achieve global synchronization and rigid work-sleep schedules as the number of sensor nodes increases. To solve this problem, this paper remodels the broadcast problem to consider low duty-cycle and shows the lower bounds for time and message costs. We then propose an adaptive algorithm for dynamic message forwarding scheduling in this context, which enables a reliable and efficient broadcast service with low delay. Also, we demonstrate by extensive simulations that the proposed algorithm is not only robust against wireless communication loss but also performs close to optimal in terms of both time and message costs. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Adaptive algorithms; Boolean functions; Broadcasting; Computer networks; Control theory; Energy conservation; Hybrid sensors; Problem solving; Radio broadcasting; Routing protocols; Sensors; Switching circuits; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Life-time; Sensor nodes; Sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249109447

We propose an adaptive Grey decision policy for efficiently decrease the number of write operations to reduce energy consumption by 15% and 35% compared to the least recently used and flash-aware buffer policies ,based on our optimal-read only-write buffer architecture. © 2008 IEEE.","FAB; Flash memory; Grey decision; LRU; Optimal-read only-write buffer architecture; Read/write buffer architecture","FAB; Grey decision; LRU; Optimal-read only-write buffer architecture; Read/write buffer architecture; Computer networks; Data storage equipment; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Mobile devices; Telecommunication equipment; Flash memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249092885

Obese people are theorized as metabolically 'thrifty', saving energy during times of food abundance. However, recent research has highlighted many neuro-behavioral and social aspects of obesity, with a suggestion that obesity, abdominal obesity in particular, may have evolved, as a social signal. We tested here whether body proportions, and abdominal obesity in particular, are percieved as signals revealing personality traits. Faceless drawings of three male body forms namely lean, muscular and feminine, each without abdominal obesity were shown in a randomized order to a group of 222 respondents. A list 30 different adjectives or short descriptions of personality traits was given to each respondent and they were asked to allocate the most appropriate figure to each of them independently. The traits included those directly related to physique, those related to nature, attitude and moral character and also those related to social status. For 29 out of the 30 adjectives people consistently attributed specific body forms. Based on common choices, the 30 traits could be clustered into distinct 'personalities' which were strongly associated with particular body forms. A centrally obese figure was rceived as ""lethargic, greedy, political, money-minded, selfish and rich"". The results show that body proportions are perceived to reflect personality traits and this raises the possibility that in addition to energy storage, social selection may have played some role in shaping the biology of obesity. © 2008 Manker et al.",,"abdominal obesity; adult; anthropometry; article; attitude; body build; female; human; lean body weight; male; morality; obesity; personality; social aspect; social status; adipose tissue; adolescent; body composition; body constitution; body mass; body weight; metabolism; obesity; pathology; perception; psychological aspect; social behavior; Adipose Tissue; Adolescent; Adult; Attitude; Body Composition; Body Constitution; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Female; Humans; Male; Obesity; Perception; Personality; Social Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52649109761

However, current SIMD architectures lack support for dynamic communication between processing elements, which is needed to efficiently map a set of non-linear algorithms. An architecture for dynamic communication support has been proposed, but this architecture needs large amounts of buffering to function properly. In this paper, three architectures supporting dynamic communication without the need of large amounts of buffering are presented, requiring 98% less buffer space. Cycle-true communication architecture simulators have been developed to accurately predict the performance of the different architectures. Simulations with several test algorithms have shown a performance improvement of up to 5x compared to a locally connected SIMD-processor. Also, detailed area models have been developed, estimating the three proposed architectures to have an area overhead of 30-70%compared to a locally connected SIMD architecture (like the IMAP). When memory is taken into account as well, the overhead is estimated to be 13-28%. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Communication; Computer networks; Conformal mapping; Data storage equipment; Distributed parameter networks; Electric load forecasting; Energy policy; Image processing; Dynamic communication; SIMD architectures; Architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51049115563

We present in this paper a different formulation where the level-set is modelled as a continuous parametric function expressed on a B-spline basis. Starting from the Mumford-Shah energy functional, we show that this formulation allows computing the solution as a restriction of the variational problem on the space spanned by the B-splines. As a consequence, the minimization of the functional is directly obtained in terms of the B-splines parameters. We also show that each step of this minimization may be expressed through a convolution operation. Because the B-spline functions are separable, this convolution may in turn be performed as a sequence of simple 1D convolutions, which yields a very efficient algorithm. The behaviour of this approach is illustrated on biomedical images from various fields. ©2008 IEEE.","B-spline; Level-set; Variational methods","Convolution; Digital image storage; Functions; Image processing; Image segmentation; Ship propellers; Technical presentations; B-spline; Biomedical Imaging; Level-set; Variational methods; Splines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51049113398

The project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of wireless communication between fixed and moving parts of industrial machines, which impose challenging latency requirements on the communication link. Other important requirements are in terms of processing capability, low power consumptions and modularity, which cannot be fulfilled by existing hardware. Therefore a complete new platform has been designed, including a high-performance ARM microntroller, a WiMedia compliant radio module, a general-purpose sensor connector and a Programmable System on Chip (PSoC). The ARM microntroller embeds a high preprocessing capability within the sensor node, while the WiMedia radio, that sets our platform apart from other existing solutions, allows to have a very low communication latency. The software architecture of the sensor node is based, on e Cos, an embedded, configurable and real-time operating system. Its realtime nature guarantees to fulfill the latency requirements at software side, and its high configurability enables to easily adapt the node to various types of industrial machines. A complete set of drivers has been developed to port the newplatform to the operating system, in particular as for the radio module, the sensor, and the power management.

An intriguing question in FRET studies involving QDs has been whether the dipole approximation, commonly used to predict the electronic coupling, is sufficiently accurate. Accurate estimates of electronic couplings between two 3.9 nm CdSe QDs and between a QD and a chlorophyll molecule are reported. These calculations are based on transition densities obtained from atomistic semiempirical calculations and time-dependent density functional theory for the QD and the chlorophyll, respectively. In contrast to the case of donor-acceptor molecules, where the dipole approximation breaks down at length scales comparable to the molecular dimensions, we find that the dipole approximation works surprisingly well when donor and/or acceptor is a spherical QD, even at contact donor-acceptor separations. Our conclusions provide support for the use of QDs as FRET probes for accurate distance measurements. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Cadmium compounds; Chlorophyll; Density functional theory; Distance measurement; Electric conductivity; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Optical properties; Optical sensors; Optical waveguides; Polynomial approximation; Porphyrins; Probability density function; Quantum electronics; Semiconducting cadmium compounds; Semiconducting cadmium telluride; Semiconductor materials; Separation; CdSe QDs; Dipole approximations; Donor acceptors; Donor-acceptor molecules; Electronic couplings; Excitation energy transfer; FRET probes; Length scaling; Molecular dimensions; Nano-crystalline; Photo-stability; Quantum Dot; Quantum dots; Resonant energy transfer; Semi-empirical calculations; Time-dependent density functional theory; Semiconductor quantum dots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52649179909

The induced modifications were followed, in situ, by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In-film modifications and hydrocarbon gas release were followed. In-situ measurements allowed one to avoid any spurious oxidation of the films after irradiation and also permitted studying in detail the evolution with dose of the FTIR spectra. The data were quantitatively analyzed, and we present a complete analysis of the effects of the Linear Energy Transfer (LET) on the radiation chemical yields of several radiation-induced modifications (alkynes, alienes, alkenes, benzene, and disubstituted benzenes). For a better understanding of the LET effects, the in-film modifications are compared to H2 release data from the literature and to our measurements of hydrocarbon gaseous molecule yields obtained by us. The overall destruction yield becomes very significant at high LET, and the radiation sensitivity of this aromatic polymer merges with typical values of aliphatic polymers: the radiation resistance conferred at low LET to polystyrene by the phenyl side groups is lost at high LET. This loss of radiation resistance equally affects the aromatic and aliphatic moieties. Monosubstituted alkynes are created above a LET threshold, whereas the other radiation-induced modifications are observed in the whole LET range. Several observations indicate that the phenyl ring is broken at high LET. Comparison of the alkyne yield in PS, polyethylene, and polycarbonate as well as the formation of nitrile bonds in poly(vinylpyridine-co-styrene) are consistent with a cleavage of the phenyl ring as the prominent source of alkynes. As the competing damage mechanisms do not have the same LET evolution, the relative importance of a specific modification on the global damage depends on LET. Some (benzene and disubstituted benzenes) dominate at low LET, while others (in-film alkyne and acetylene release) dominate at high LET. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Acetylene; Benzene; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fourier transforms; Hydrocarbons; Infrared spectroscopy; Ion bombardment; Irradiation; Leakage (fluid); Lighting fixtures; Nuclear physics; Olefins; Organic compounds; Polystyrenes; Radiation effects; Spectroscopic analysis; Anoxic conditions; Atactic; Atactic polystyrene; Chemical yields; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR); FT-IR spectrum; Glassy polystyrenes; Hydrocarbon gases; In-situ; In-situ measurements; Ion beams; Linear energy transfer; Radiation-induced modifications; Chemical modification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349105007

The B-Factory BaBar offers an excellent opportunity in searching new states and their decay modes to understand their nature (charm and charmonium physics). From December 2007 the possibility to run at the energy of Υ{hooked} (3 S) and Υ{hooked} (2 S) was opened, in order to search also for bottomonium states and light Higgs. In addition, a scan around Υ{hooked} (4 S), collecting a point every 25 p b-1, was done until the end of the runs, 10th of April 2008. There are several motivations to perform Spectroscopy studies at B-factories, mainly to do measurements of high precision and try to fully understand QCD. In fact, several resonances observed do not fit theoretical predictions. They can be classified in two main categories: light mesons (like f0, K*,...), and heavy hadrons (e.g. c over(s, -) and c over(c, -) mesons, and light baryons).

The life cycle assessment (LCA) described in this article compares the use of seawater neutralised red mud to treat acid mine drainage (AMD) at Mount Morgan in Queensland, Australia with that of lime. The aim of the LCA is to evaluate the environmental merits of each neutralant by comparing the carbon dioxide emissions and the net energy use over their respective life cycles. Both life cycles involve the collection and processing of raw materials from Gladstone in Central Queensland, their transportation to Mount Morgan (about 150 km away) and finally their application in a wastewater treatment plant. This plant, which currently uses lime as its treatment media, increases the pH of the acidic open cut pit water to acceptable levels for discharge. The results of the analysis revealed that seawater neutralised red mud would, over the entire life cycle, generate 20% of the carbon dioxide emissions and use 44% of the electricity compared with that of lime. This amounts to a saving of about 3500 kg of carbon dioxide for every 1000 m3 of pit water treated. However, as red mud is a much weaker neutralant compared with lime on a weight basis, significantly more red mud is required to perform the same duty; as a result the fuel usage in the red mud scenario is 12 times that compared with lime, which is primarily due to increased transportation requirements for red mud. The results of a sensitivity analysis demonstrated that even if the seawater neutralised red mud neutralisation capability was half the expected value, seawater neutralised red mud would still generate only 35% of the carbon dioxide and use 44% of the electricity compared with that of lime. The fuel usage for seawater neutralised red mud would, however, be nearly 24 times greater than that for lime. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Compared with controls, lower (P &lt; 0.05) concentrations (mmol/kg dry wt) of ATP (19.6 ± 0.65 vs. 17.8 ± 0.69) and phosphocreatine (81.3 ± 2.3 vs. 69.1 ± 4.2) were observed in COPD, which occurred in the absence of differences in the total adenine nucleotide and total creatine pools. Higher concentrations were observed in COPD for several glycolytic metabolites (glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, pyruvate) but not lactate. Glycogen storage was not affected by the disease (289 ± 20 vs. 269 ± 20 mmol glucosyl units/kg dry wt). Although no difference between groups was observed for the glucose transporter GLUT1, GLUT4 was reduced by 28% in COPD. For the monocarboxylate transporters, MCT4 was 35% lower in COPD, with no differences observed for MCT1. These results indicate that in resting VL, moderate to severe COPD results in a reduction in phosphorylation potential, an apparent elevation of glycolytic flux rate, and a potential defect in glucose and lactate transport as a result of reduced levels of the principal isoforms.

Thus, it renders nanometer imprinting applications, and its technology, more developed and mature. The research findings revealed that, PDMS, blended with magnetic powder, can accurately recast and duplicate nanometer microstructures. Under well-proportioned magnetic pressing, controlled by an electro-magnetic disk, it can effectively fill and shape resist microstructures. The composite material of PDMS, with added magnetic iron powder, can effectively improve mechanical strength properties of pure PDMS soft mold, which is easily transformed for imprinting. Meanwhile, owing to the unique features of PDMS soft mold, conformal contact with the base material is possible; therefore, the effective imprinting area and the duplicated representation are significantly improved. In addition, as magnetic PDMS soft mold is easily produced and fast in recasting, the costs can be effectively reduced. In addition, due to features such as low surface free energy and a tendency not to stick to resist in imprinting, the soft mold is evenly controlled by the electro-magnetic disk for imprinting duplication, highlighting the advantages of microstructure imprinting procedures.

N6A 5B9, Canada","This review reports recent advances on chemical-looping combustion (CLC). CLC is a promising technology for fossil fuel combustion preventing CO2 dilution with flue gases, mainly nitrogen. In CLC, the solid oxygen carrier supplies the stoichiometric oxygen needed for CO2 and water formation, and this leads to a free nitrogen mixture. As a result, the requirement of CO2 separation from flue gases, a major cost for CO2 capture, is circumvented. Furthermore, formation of NOx is also reduced. A good oxygen carrier for CLC shall readily react with the fuel gas and shall be reoxidized upon being contacted with oxygen. An oxygen carrier is typically formed by a metal oxide and an inert binder, which provide, respectively, oxygen storage, fluidizability and mechanical strength. Over the last 10 years, several research groups have been researching oxygen carriers which are both active and stable under fluidized bed conditions. While Fe, Ni, Cu, Mn and Co oxides are potential oxygen carrier materials, recent studies show that Ni is best suited for CLC. Few studies have been devoted to the solid-state kinetics of both reduction and oxidation with either a nucleation-nuclei growth or unreacted shrinking core models being considered. In order to implement CLC, two interconnected fluidized bed reactors (the fuel and air reactor) with the oxygen carrier circulated between units have been proposed. While reactor design, modeling and hydrodynamics are matters that have been analyzed by several research groups; these topics still require more attention and investigation. Preliminary economic assessments, have suggested that CLC holds great promise for combustion processes, having the potential for achieving very efficient and low cost CO2 capture. Even with these favorable prospects, commercial scale-up of CLC still depends nowadays on the availability of highly performing and stable oxygen carriers. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The issues of land availability, water availability, food, and energy requirement need to be resolved for the benefits of biofuel production. Battery technology has emerged as an alternative for vehicles due to zero emission and can be used in hybrid design to store electricity and reduce emissions.

When operating an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant with CCS to generate power, the centralized capture plant is operated in a mode where it only produces decarbonized electricity and/or heat. Electricity producers could initially turn to coal-fired IGCC with CCS to reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere with the bulk of global power generation capacity based on coal as the cheapest source of electricity.

Design: Longitudinal clinical study. Subjects: A total of 47 women and 30 men aged 71.6±2.3 and 71.7±2.2 years, respectively, at baseline with body mass index (BMI) values of 24.96±3.28 and 27.04±3.35 kg m-2 were followed for 7 years. Measurements: Body weight, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD), fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) by spirometry were evaluated at baseline and after a 7-year mean follow-up. Results: In women as in men there were no significant changes in weight, SAD and BMI. A significant decrease in height and FFM was observed in both women and men. Height-adjusted FEV1 and FVC decreased significantly in women and men over the 7-year follow-up. Changes in SAD were the most powerful predictors of 7-year follow-up of FEV1 and FVC after taking into account, respectively, baseline FEV1 and FVC. Linear regression analysis, performed by using 7-year follow-up lung function variables as dependent variables and changes in body composition variables as independent variables, showed that 1 cm SAD increase predicted a decrease in FEV1 and FVC of 31 and 46 ml, respectively, and 1 kg FFM decrease predicted a decrease in FVC of 38 ml. After subdividing our study population into four categories of change in FFM and SAD, patients with decreased FFM and increased SAD showed the highest probability of having a worsening in FEV1 and FVC. Conclusion: Increase in abdominal fat and FFM decline are significant predictors of lung function decline in the elderly. Old subjects developing both abdominal fat gain and FFM loss show the highest probability of developing worsening in lung function. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","Body composition; Body fat distribution; Elderly; Lung function","aged; article; body composition; body mass; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; elderly care; female; follow up; forced expiratory volume; human; lipid storage; longitudinal study; lung function; major clinical study; male; priority journal; spirometry; weight gain; Abdominal Fat; Absorptiometry, Photon; Aged; Aging; Alcohol Drinking; Anthropometry; Body Composition; Body Fat Distribution; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Lung; Male; Spirometry; Vital Capacity; Waist Circumference",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849154151

Most dietary copper passes through the liver where it can be used for protein and energy production or excreted through the biliary route. Because copper is a prooxidant, its intracellular handling is tightly managed. In Wilson disease, in which synthesis of ceruloplasmin and biliary excretion of copper are defective, copper accumulates in the liver and leads to progressive liver damage. The features of hepatic Wilson disease are highly variable. The spectrum of liver disease includes mild inflammation, fatty liver, an autoimmune disorder, and cirrhosis. Wilson disease thus resembles drug hepatotoxicity, and indeed it can be regarded as a prototypic example of endogenous hepatotoxicity. Biomarkers developed for detecting drug hepatotoxicity may be relevant to Wilson disease.

In storage organs of plants, the rate of oxidation of NAD-dependent substrates by mitochondria is relatively low. By stimulating the activity of NAD-dependent dehydrogenases, Melaphen stimulates energy metabolism in the cells and manifests adaptogenic activity by accelerating the germination of seeds.

This analysis is completed in the context of a Hydrogen Economy and competitive electricity markets. The simulation of the operation of a combined nuclear-wind-hydrogen system is discussed first, where the selling and buying of electricity, the selling of excess hydrogen and oxygen, and the selling of heat are optimized to maximize profit to the energy producer. The simulation is performed in two phases: in a pre-dispatch phase, the system model is optimized to obtain optimal hydrogen charge levels for the given operational horizons. In the second phase, a real-time dispatch is carried out on an hourly basis to optimize the operation of the system as to maximize profits, following the hydrogen storage levels of the pre-dispatch phase. Based on the operation planning and dispatch results, an economic evaluation is performed to determine the feasibility of the proposed scheme for investment purposes; this evaluation is based on calculations of modified internal rates of return and net present values for a realistic scenario.

The effects of various meal components on postprandial lipemia lead to the following question: do we need a standardized oral lipid tolerance test? A number of transporters, enzymes, receptors and hormones directly influence and act as ""gatekeepers"" of these processes. Each protein appears to have specific and individual functional roles in the overall process and selected developments in these areas will be reviewed. Within the intestinal cells, FABP2 (fatty acid-binding protein 2) and MTP (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein) are required for the formation of chylomicrons. Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1-L1) plays an important role in cholesterol absorption and provides a pharmacological target. Hormones such as GLP1 and GLP2 influence this absorption process. Within the periphery, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key gatekeeper of clearance. Of the massive amounts of fatty acids released by LPL, 36% escape peripheral adipose and muscle uptake and fatty acid overload can result in LPL product inhibition. Acylation stimulating protein (ASP) and insulin are two key hormones in maintaining efficient tissue uptake and re-esterification of fatty acids while TNFα negatively influences this process. In both ASP deficient (C3 KO) and C5L2 KO mice, postprandial lipemia increased with reduced adipose tissue storage. This is compensated by increased energy expenditure and muscle lipid oxidation. Clearance of hepatic remnants is controlled through many factors, including SR-B1 and ABCA1. Intestinal, peripheral and hepatic gatekeepers serve important and individual roles in regulating postprandial lipemia and provide potential targets for regulation. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Evolutionary mechanisms have rendered mammals capable of surviving scarcity of nutrients. The present abundance of food has led to an epidemic of obesity in the developed and in the developing world. Adipose tissue has long been considered an inactive reserve depot of fat but it appears to be an active tissue, directly and actively involved in the control of body weight and energy balance via the secretion of a large number of molecules with regulatory potential (adipokines), explaining the biological mechanisms of the relationship between an excess of body fat and metabolic disturbances, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. There is also a relationship between obesity and cancer. Sex steroids are involved in the sexually dimorphic pattern of fat distribution. Testosterone induces a visceral fat depot. Paradoxically, a decline in testosterone, such as that observed with aging, leads to an accumulation of fat in the visceral depot favorably responding to normalization of plasma testosterone. Treatment of obesity is disappointing. The present cornerstones, caloric restriction and exercise, are rarely maintained in the longer-term. Pharmacological treatment is modestly helpful. It is probably public education and the production of healthier food by the industry that might be successful. The latter might be spurred by the costs of obesity-related disease to the health care system. © 2008 WPMH GmbH.","Epidemic; Evolution; Obesity; Testosterone; Treatment","adipocytokine; metformin; sex hormone; testosterone; adulthood; aging; article; caloric restriction; cancer risk; cardiovascular risk; energy balance; epidemic; exercise; human; hypothalamus hypophysis system; lipid storage; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; priority journal; sex difference; testosterone blood level; weight control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50349097181

Energy consumption was determined using both energy data from the literature plus data from field-scale research. Energy consumption was compared between two manure application systems (the drag hose and the slurry wagon systems) and two application timing treatments (single vs. twice-annual manure application). The single annual application of liquid pig manure applied at 81.5 m3 ha-1 and transported 1.8 km from storage to field consumed 2180 MJ ha-1 with the drag hose system and 2185 MJ ha-1 with the slurry wagon system. The twice-annual manure application regime used 2726 and 2209 MJ ha-1 for the drag hose and slurry wagon systems, respectively. When energy use was calculated on the basis of MJ per kg of available N, liquid pig manure applied once annually with the slurry wagon system provided N at 17.76 MJ kg-1 of available N, which was 33% of the energy cost of N from anhydrous ammonia and 23% of the energy cost of N from urea. Manure transport distance could be increased to 8.4 km before the energy cost per kg of available N from pig manure was equivalent to anhydrous ammonia, and up to 12.3 km before the energy cost of manure N was equivalent to urea N. Despite the high energy cost to deliver liquid pig manure from storage to field, the much lower cost per kg of available N compared to inorganic fertilizer N highlights the opportunities that exist for improving the energy efficiency of industrial agriculture by replacing inorganic fertilizers with manure. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To survive in the global market, the manufacturing industry of today needs to be equipped with advanced technologies including IT as well as substantial infrastructure. Under this situation, we found that ""collaboration"" is the right answer for manufacturers to survive by strengthening relations between companies instead of competing against each other. For facilitating collaboration among Korean SMEs, we performed a pilot project from 2004, referred to as an e-Manufacturing project. Through this project, we applied IT into the conventional manufacturing industry by developing business models and collaboration systems. As a consequence of the project, more than 300 companies are currently using 7 different web-based collaboration systems and they are reducing delivery time and increasing sales/profit. Especially, the i-Manufacturing project newly started from 2007, which is a continued and enlarged project of the e-Manufacturing, covers wider innovation boundaries including manufacturing processes, systems, and corresponding infrastructures as well as collaboration systems. In this paper, we first introduce achievement from the e-Manufacturing project and then the strategies/plans of the i-Manufacturing project, which follows the balanced regional growth strategy of the Korean government.","Balanced regional growth; Collaboration; i-Manufacturing; Manufacturing innovation","Electric energy storage; Flow control; Planning; Project management; Strategic planning; Technology; Advanced technologies; Balanced regional growth; Business modeling; Collaboration; Collaboration systems; Conventional manufacturing; Customer demands; Delivery-time; E-Manufacturing; Global markets; Growth strategies; i-Manufacturing; Innovation strategies; International conferences; Korean government; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing innovation; Manufacturing processes; Pilot projects; Quality products; Smart Manufacturing; Web-based collaborations; Industrial engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50249143457

The chemical structures of the molecular layers were analyzed with X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Cyclic voltammetry on macroelectrodes and impedance spectroscopy on capacitor structures were performed in order to characterize the charge transfer between the redox molecules and the Silicon, showing the effect of the organic linker. Finally, to explain our results, an original electrical model of ferrocene/Si field effect devices is proposed. The model allows to give a theoretical confirmation of the influence of the linker over the redox energy. DFT calculations provide further explanations of the effect of the linker on redox energy.

The TIMES_PT optimisation model was used to derive MAC curves from a set of policy scenarios including one or more of the following policies: ban on nuclear power; ban on new coal power plants without carbon sequestration and storage; incentives to natural gas power plants; and a cap on biomass use. The different MAC shows the policies' effects in the potential for CO2 abatement. In 2020, in the most encompassing policy scenario, with all current and planned policies, is possible to abate only up to +35% of 1990 emissions at a cost below 23 € t/CO2. In the more flexible policy scenarios, it is possible to abate up to -10% of 1990 emissions below the same cost. The total energy system costs are 10-13% higher if all policies are implemented-76 to 101 B€-roughly the equivalent to 2.01-2.65% of the 2005 GDP. Thus, from a CO2 emission mitigation perspective, the existing policies introduce significant inefficiencies, possibly related to other policy goals. The ban on nuclear power is the instrument that has the most significant effect in MAC. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of 3 oils differing in fatty acid composition on postprandial energy expenditure and macronutrient oxidation in healthy normal-weight men. Using a randomized crossover design, 15 subjects consumed breakfast meals containing 60% of energy as fat. The principal source of fat was (a) olive oil rich in oleic acid (18:1n-9), (b) sunflower oil rich in linoleic acid (18:2n-6), or (c) flaxseed oil rich in linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Measurements of resting metabolic rate, thermic effect of food, and postprandial energy expenditure were conducted with indirect calorimetry that recorded O2 consumed and CO2 produced one-half hour before meal consumption and 6 hours after meal consumption. Fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates were calculated from nonprotein gaseous exchange. Olive oil feeding showed a significant overall increase in energy expenditure compared with flaxseed oil (P &lt; .0006) and a trend to increased energy expenditure compared with sunflower oil (P &lt; .06). None of the 3 treatments exhibited significant effects on fat or carbohydrate oxidation.

Using first-principles computational methods, we perform a systematic search for functional groups to be attached to saturated hydrocarbons for high-capacity storage of molecular hydrogen. When a saturated hydrocarbon such as propane is functionalized with OH, NH2, or SH, a transition metal atom may be strongly bound to each functional group. We find that hydrogen molecules are adsorbed on transition metal atoms with the binding energy suitable for reversible processes (adsorption and desorption) under practical hydrogen storage conditions. We also show that the functional groups may help reduce the tendency for transition metal clustering. The maximum gravimetric storage densities range from 8.7 wt% to 12.6 wt% depending on different materials. We explain the mechanism of multi-dihydrogen adsorption on a transition metal atom by generalizing the Kubas model. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A. Functional group; A.

In this paper, we therefore demonstrate the use of the wavelet-modified maximum average correlation height (WaveMACH) filter for automatic target recognition applications in both the visible and infrared (IR) spectral bands. As any input target appears different when imaged through two different sensors, i.e., a CCD or an IR camera, a WaveMACH filter synthesized using a CCD image shows no correlation with the image of the same target from an IR camera and vice-versa. Hence, separate filters are required to match the input targets from the two sensors. To avoid the synthesis and storage of separate filters, the images from CCD and IR camera are fused using Daubechies wavelet and then the rotation-invariant WaveMACH filter generated with the fused image. In all, 18 WaveMACH filters (each of 20° range) are required for in-plane rotation invariance in both the spectral bands for the full range of 0-360°. Computer simulation and experimental results implemented in hybrid digital-optical correlator architecture are shown for the proposed idea. The same filters have also been used to identify multiple targets in a scene. Performance measures like peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSR), peak correlation energy (PCE) and correlation peak intensity (CPI) have been calculated as metrics of goodness. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Three pneumatic side-chambers were placed at T-junction and flow-focusing channels to construct the controllable moving-wall structure. Compressed air was used to activate the moving-all structure. The deformation of the controllable moving-wall structure can physically change width of the microchannel. Therefore the flow velocity can be locally changed by applying compressed air pressure. Size of the internal droplets at the intersection of the T-junction channel was then fine-tuned. Then the internal droplets were focused into a narrow stream hydrodynamically and finally chopped into double emulsion droplets using a pair of pneumatic moving-wall structures downstream.

This paper describes the authors efforts in research and experimental activity to verify the feasibility of the adaptation of an existing turbine for ground based, power generation use to Very Light Airborne applications, primarily Very Light Rotorcrafts (VLR), UAV and Very Light Aircrafts (VLA). The selected starting point was an existing SOLAR T-62T-32 ground based, power generation gas turbine. The SOLAR T-62T-32 was originally used as prime mover for ground based, generator sets. It is of the single shaft design, single stage centrifugal compressor, reverse annular combustor, single stage radial in-flow turbine, so it is of very simple and rugged design even if particular care has to be paid to its assembly and tuning to achieve acceptable performances, efficiency and controllability in the new airborne environment. The team initial work involved CFD simulation of the compressor-diffuser assembly to identify critical performance parameters and subsequent rig (""Dyno"") testing to correlate analytical predictions with actual data to fine tune the analytical models and to establish a performance baseline to be used later on to verify and assess the possible improvements. Then, a complete review of all the external and internal mechanical parts was performed. The objective was to achieve an output shaft power of about 130 HP at S.L. ISA at 6000 RPM (corresponding to the striking speed of about 61,091 RPM at the turbine mainshaft!) but at lower weight and with increased reliability. The weight reduction was achieved by detail work on turbine inlet case, gear cases, gears and accessories substantiated by stress analysis, gear and bearing calculations, rotor dynamic studies and the definition of specific operational limitations to avoid exceedance of unacceptable stresses. In addition, a dedicated Electronic Engine Control (EEC) has been designed, manufactured and tested to allow the representative operation of the modified engine. Extensive bench testing (in excess of 300 running hours on the lead modified turbine) confirmed the consistent achievement of the above mentioned objectives and lead to the experimental installation of a modified turbine on a Aviotecnica RAVEN prototype (AUW about 450 Kg, two seats VLR) where it has been flight tested.

Human beings can also be exposed to heavy ions in space, since galactic cosmic rays are a mixed field consisting of not only high-energy protons and He ions, but also heavier ions including iron. Due to their high linear energy transfer (LET), heavy ions have peculiar track structures, characterized by a high level of energy deposition clustering. Furthermore, high-energy ions produce energetic secondary electrons ('delta rays') which can give rise to energy depositions several micrometres away from the core of the primary particle track. Also in view of hadron therapy and space radiation applications, it is therefore important to characterize heavy-ion tracks from a physical and biophysical point of view. In this framework, herein we will discuss the main physical features of heavy-ion track structure, as well as heavy-ion-induced DNA double-strand breaks, which are regarded as one of the most important initial radiobiological lesions and chromosome aberrations, which are correlated both with cell death and with cell conversion to malignancy. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.",,"Animal cell culture; Atoms; Cell death; Chromosomes; Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Deposition; DNA; Electrolysis; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Genes; Heavy ions; Helium; High energy physics; Ionizing radiation; Iron; Nuclear physics; Nucleic acids; Organic acids; Thickness measurement; Tumors; Bragg peaks; Carbon ions; Cell conversion; Chromosome aberrations; Delta rays; Double strand break (dsb); Energy depositions; Galactic cosmic ray (GCR); Hadron therapy; Heavy ion tracking; High-energy ions; High-energy protons; High-linear energy transfer (LET); Human beings; Physical features; Relative biological effectiveness (RBE); Secondary electron (SE); Space radiations; Track structures; Tumours; Ions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249099279

Of the many potential methods of active commuting, walking and cycling are the usual choices. Children and adolescents prefer cycling, but for adults issues of safety, cycle storage and company dress codes make walking the preferred option, particularly in North American cities, where urban design and weather conditions often do not favour cycling. Active transportation is more frequent in some European countries with dedicated cycle and pedestrian paths, but in most developed societies, active transportation has declined in recent years. Attempts to increase walking behaviour in the sedentary population have had only limited success to date. A weekly gross energy expenditure of at least 4 MJ is recommended to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. This can be achieved by walking 1.9 km in 22 minutes twice per day, 5 days per week, or by cycling at 16 km/h for 11 minutes twice per day, 5 days per week. When engaged in level walking, the intensity of effort may be adequate for cardiovascular benefit in older adults, but in fit young workers, it is necessary to either increase the pace or choose a hilly route in order to induce cardio-respiratory benefit; in contrast, cycling is likely to provide an adequate cardiovascular stimulus even for young adults. Empirical data to date have yielded mixed results: a reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality has been observed more frequently in cyclists than in walkers, and more frequently in women and older men than in young active commuters. More information is needed concerning the typical weekly dose of activity provided by active commuting, and the impact of such commuting on overall attitudes towards physical activity. It is also necessary to find better methods of involving the sedentary population, through both counselling and changes in urban design. © 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

These techniques have become increasingly useful for obtaining fine and local descriptions of material properties. As they can measure complete thermal and mechanical fields, they can be used to identify several parameters of constitutive equations during a single deformation process using specifically designed heterogeneous tests (Grédiac, Composites: Part A 35:751-761, 2004). In Geymonat and Pagano (Meccanica 38:535-545, 2003), surface strain fields obtained by digital image correlation were used to identify the distribution of elastic parameters and stress fields by minimizing a given energy functional. In this paper, the previous method is improved through a relevant choice for stress approximation, and then extended to a wider class of elastoplastic materials. Its reliability is then checked through applications on simulated data obtained under small perturbation and plane stress assumptions. In particular, the robustness of the method with respect to measurement noise is studied on the basis of numerical data. An experimental application to heterogeneous material identification is finally proposed. © Society for Experimental Mechanics 2007.","Elastoplasticity; Field measurement; Inverse problem","Deformation processing; Digital image correlation; Elastic parameters; Elasto-plastic behavior; Elasto-plastic materials; Energy functional; Experimental application; Experimental mechanics; Field measurement; Full-field measurements; Heterogeneous materials; Heterogeneous tests; Image processing techniques; Inverse problem; Mate rial properties; Measurement noises; Mechanical fields; Numerical data; Plane stresses; Simulated data; Small perturbations; Stress fields; Surface straining; Constitutive equations; Data processing; Differential equations; Digital image storage; Elastoplasticity; Identification (control systems); Image processing; Imaging systems; Imaging techniques; Inverse problems; Optical data processing; Speed; Strain rate; Stresses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49449084425

Because the life time of each sensor node affects the life time of whole sensor network so many researches about prolonging sensor life time have been done. Nonetheless, the most part of such researches have tended to center around the study on collecting information at the fixed position. Therefore if there are several mobile sinks in wireless sensor network, these researches aren 't suitable. Thus we propose a cluster-based routing protocol for Supporting Mobile Sinks in Sensor Network which provides reliable, scalable and efficient data delivery in a sensor network which includes several mobile sinks.

For resisting the perturbation from the load side or environment, the passivity theory can be employed to attenuate the external disturbance and to achieve system stability.

In particular, national and international government has developed incentives programs for installation by final customer small size photovoltaic, wind and CHP plants. In this context the concept of Micro-Grid (MG) arises. The term of MG is taken to mean a subset of power distribution systems that contains sufficient local energy sources to supply most or all of the local loads. Then, with the penetration of MG there are a wide variety of potential benefits for the customer: reduced price volatility, greater reliability and improved power quality. In this paper the attention is focused on the concept of reliability. On this subject the authors have proposed, in previous papers, opportune configuration schemes of a MG constituted by a PV plant, a Wind plant and an storage system. Then, the goal of this paper is to evaluate the reliability improvements of load supply against network congestions adopting the proposed MG configurations and taking into account the randomness of renewable sources (sun and wind) and of the power required by the load.

Two groups of female rats were fed a high-fat diet (42% as energy) for 8 weeks, one remaining sedentary (Sed) and the other being exercise trained (Tr) for this entire period. Rats were killed after 2 and 8 weeks of their respective treatment. The significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher levels in mesenteric and retroperitoneal fat pad weights, plasma leptin, NEFA and glucose observed with time in Sed high-fat-fed rats were significantly (P&lt;0.05) attenuated in Tr animals. Isoproterenol-stimulated (10-5-10-4 M) lipolysis in the mesenteric, but not in the retroperitoneal tissue, was significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower (about 57%) in Tr than in Sed rats after 8 weeks of high-fat feeding. The isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in the mesenteric tissue of 8-week Tr high-fat-fed rats was lowered to the level measured in 2-week fat-fed rats although mesenteric fat accumulation was still significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher in 8- than in 2-week Tr rats. Perilipin content (Western blot) was not affected by the exercise training programme. These results indicate that exercise training resulted in a reduction in the high-fat diet-induced elevated levels of lipolysis in the mesenteric tissue. This responseappears to be independent of the perilipin content. 2008.","Fat mass; Isoproterenol-induced lipolysis; Leptin; Non-esterified fatty acids; Perilipin","fatty acid; glucose; isoprenaline; leptin; perilipin; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; blood sampling; cell isolation; controlled study; exercise; feeding; female; in vitro study; lipid diet; lipid storage; lipolysis; mesentery; nonhuman; rat; retroperitoneal fat; stimulation; viscera; Western blotting; Adipocytes; Adrenergic beta-Agonists; Animals; Biological Markers; Body Composition; Cells, Cultured; Dietary Fats; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Glycerol; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Isoproterenol; Leptin; Lipolysis; Obesity; Phosphoproteins; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stimulation, Chemical; Animalia; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49649084028

However, when it can be established that the input registers to an FU are not changing values during a certain period, the outputs during this period can be directly read off the FU output pins without needing to store them in registers. When the life-times of such data are short, it may be possible to completely eliminate the register storage operation, thereby reducing power.

While in traditional fluorescence resonance energy transfer, the rate has a (distance) -6 dependence, we find that the distance dependence in this case is quite different. Our calculation of rate in the case of the two dyes, pyrene and nile blue, shows that the distance dependence is Yukawa type. We have also studied the effect of doping on energy transfer to graphene. Doping does not modify the rate for electronic excitation energy transfer significantly. However, in the case of vibrational transfer, the rate is found to be increased by an order of magnitude due to doping.

In solution, this transfer is induced by fluctuations in molecular conformation as well as in the surrounding solvent. We develop a joint electrostatic density functional theory map that allows us to connect the mixing of and thereby the relaxation between the amide I and amide II modes of the peptide building block N -methyl acetamide. This map enables us to extract a fluctuating vibrational Hamiltonian from molecular dynamics trajectories. The linear absorption spectrum, population transfer, and two-dimensional infrared spectra are then obtained from this Hamiltonian by numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation. We show that the amide I/amide II cross peaks in two-dimensional infrared spectra in principle allow one to follow the vibrational population transfer between these two modes. Our simulations of N -methyl acetamide in heavy water predict an efficient relaxation between the two modes with a time scale of 790 fs. This accounts for most of the relaxation of the amide I band in peptides, which has been observed to take place on a time scale of 450 fs in N -methyl acetamide. We therefore conclude that in polypeptides, energy transfer to the amide II mode offers the main relaxation channel for the amide I vibration. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Absorption; Absorption spectroscopy; Amides; Amines; Density functional theory; Dynamics; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Hamiltonians; Heavy water; Integration; Linear equations; Maps; Mixing; Molecular dynamics; Molecular vibrations; Numerical analysis; Offshore oil well production; Population statistics; Probability density function; Quantum chemistry; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectrum analysis; Two dimensional; Amide I; Building Blocks; Cross peaks; Dinger equation; Hamiltonian; Linear absorption spectrum; Molecular conformations; Molecular dynamics trajectories; N-methyl acetamide; Numerical integrations; Population transfer; Time scaling; Two-dimensional infrared; Vibrational eigenstates; Vibrational energy transfer; Vibrational Hamiltonian; Vibrational population; Infrared spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49349110042

The simulation of the operation of the combined nuclear-wind-hydrogen system is discussed first, where the selling and buying of electricity and the selling of excess hydrogen and oxygen is optimized to maximize profits. This simulation is done in two phases: In the pre-dispatch phase, the system operation is optimized according to stochastic wind and price forecasts to obtain optimal hydrogen charge levels for the operational horizon. In the second phase, a real-time dispatch is carried out on an hourly basis to optimize the operation of the system to maximize profits, and to follow the storage levels of the pre-dispatch phase. Based on the operation planning and dispatch results, an economic evaluation is performed to determine the feasibility of the proposed scheme for investment purposes. The results of these studies demonstrate that hydrogen for the sole purpose of storage of electricity is not economically feasible at the current state of hydrogen technology development, unless hydrogen is sold to the market for other purposes such as transportation, as in the case in a hydrogen economy, or in the case of limited electricity transmission capacities, i.e., transmission congestion. © 2008 IEEE.","Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage; Investment evaluation; Nuclear power; Optimization; Power generation planning; Wind power","Economics; Electric load forecasting; Electric power generation; Electric power plants; Energy storage; Finance; Hydrogen; Investments; Nonmetals; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Optimization; Oxygen; Power plants; Technological forecasting; Current state; Economic evaluation; Electricity transmission; Excess hydrogen; Hydrogen charging; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen systems; Hydrogen technologies; Investment evaluation; Novel methodology; Nuclear power; Operation planning; Power generation planning; Price forecasting; Real-time dispatch; Second phase; System operations; Transmission congestion; Two phases; Wind power; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49249127922

Ions are injected through the two deflectors on the injection side and off axis with respect to the conical mirrors which face each other. The first injection deflector, originally at zero voltage, is switched to its set value such that the ions after one turn follow stable trajectories of lengths of roughly 30 cm. This design reduces the number of electrodes necessary to guide the ion beam through the ring in stable orbits.

The proposed charge balance method is implemented with analog components and is cheaper and more effective than its digital counterparts since complex arithmetic and sampling delay is eliminated. The proposed controller will consistently cause the Buck converter to recover from an arbitrary load transient with the smallest possible voltage deviation in the shortest possible settling time. Since the controller is non-linear during transient conditions, it is not limited by bandwidth/switching frequency. Unlike conventional linear controllers, the dynamic response (voltage deviation, settling time) of the proposed controller can be accurately predicted using a set of equations. This greatly simplifies the design process of the output filter.

However, this structure processes the solar array power or the battery power to the load through two regulators during one orbit cycle, which reduces the energy transfer efficiency. The series-parallel structure for the RPPT system can improve the power conversion efficiency, but an additional regulator increases the cost, size and weight of the system. In this paper, a simplified series-parallel space power system that consists of two regulators is proposed. The proposed system achieves similar energy transfer efficiency with the series-parallel structure by adding one switch to the series structure, which reduces the cost, size and the weight. A single digital signal processor (DSP) is used to control all of the required functions, such as current sharing for the parallel module converter, load voltage regulation, solar array stabilizing, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and the system operation algorithm of the proposed system. The large signal stability analysis is provided to understand the four main modes of system operation. In order to compare the energy efficiency with a series structure, the simulations are performed and the results are analyzed. The proposed structure saves 11% energy compared to the series structure.

Power plants, as the demand for electric power has been growing dramatically, and storage of liquefied gasses in order to be less dependent on unstable prices and risks of supplies of oil. As LNG exploits the gassy side-product of oil exploration and is a less polluting fuel with lower CO2 and S emissions, it all contributes to a better control of global environment. Power plant applications involve high pressure and high temperature, where main focus is on high structural integrity for service at elevated temperature as well as increase of life cycle, using materials with higher creep strength. With the current energy demands in the world, a large number of new power plants are required in addition to maintenance and repair of existing units. Base materials involved, include traditional CrMo steels as well as enhanced grades like P23, P24, P911 and P92. For storage of liquefied gasses, cryogenic temperatures are applied where material focus is on structural integrity in combination with toughness at -196°C. LNG facilities make use of various materials for the conditions that they will be subject to, including concrete, aluminium, austenitic stainless steels and 9% nickel steel. For more than five decades, storage facilities for LNG are being built with 9% nickel steel. Although research has been carried out with matching welding consumables for the welding of these applications, at present still only nickel-base consumables have proved to meet the requirements such as mechanical properties.

Generally, DVR is realized by a voltage source inverter with dc storage device and a series injection transformer. Rating and design issues of an injection transformer are of much concern for the proper operation of the DVR. Voltage underrating of the transformer may lead to its saturation whereas overrating increases the cost and size of the DVR. The voltage applied to the primary winding of the transformer is a combination of several components of different frequencies. In view of above, rating and design issues are presented in this paper. A novel method is proposed to find the voltage rating of the transformer as a function of the fundamental frequency. Furthermore, to reduce the effects of current harmonics in the transformer, K-factor is used. A PSCAD model is used to validate the efficacy of the proposed design method to find the voltage rating, and overall performance of the DVR.

The last one protects the load against all types of line disturbances, but it is the most expensive and the one with the lowest efficiency. On the other hand, passive-standby and line-interactive UPSs have higher efficiency and lower cost, but they show an important drawback: a switching time from normal to stored-energy mode. As a consequence, there is a notch in the UPS output voltage during this switching time. In a previous paper, the authors proposed a method for filling these voltage notches with a sinusoidal waveform generated by a switch-mode converter. In this one, a simplified notch filler is proposed. It consists of two capacitors, one charged with positive voltage and the other with negative voltage. If the fault occurs in the positive period, the positive-charged capacitor is connected to the load. This connection is then modulated in order to obtain a sinusoidal waveform at the load. In the negative period, the other capacitor is used in the same way. © 2008 IEEE.","Filler; Notch; Sag; Simplified; Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)","Capacitance; Capacitors; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric inverters; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Fillers; Power supply circuits; Turbulent flow; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Uninterruptible power systems; Double conversion; Energy modes; Filler; Lower cost; Mode converters; Negative voltages; Notch; Output voltages; Positive voltage; Sag; Simplified; Sinusoidal waveform; Switching time; Uninterruptible power supplies; Uninterruptible power supply (UPS); Filling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49249103666

With a simple statistical analysis, it can be shown that this is not valid. To obtain a more appropriate probability density function (pdf) of the wind power forecast error, an indirect algorithm based on the Beta pdf is proposed. Measured one-year time series from two different wind farms are used to generate the forecast data. Three different forecast scenarios are simulated based on the persistence approach. This makes the results comparable to other forecast methods. It is found that the forecast error pdf has a variable kurtosis ranging from 3 (like the Gaussian) to over 10, and therefore it can be categorized as fat-tailed. A new approximation function for the parameters of the Beta pdf is proposed because results from former publications could not be confirmed. Besides, a linear approximation is developed to describe the relationship between the persistence forecast and the related mean measured power.

The method is based on the controlled charging/discharging of a capacitor to realize the desired voltage waveform. A capacitor that is connected across the load is charged/ discharged through an inductor by applying high-frequency pulses. The applied pulses could be of either positive or negative polarity, depending on the error signal in the controller. The controller senses the output voltage and current and operates to maintain zero-current switching at every turn-on while keeping the output voltage close to the reference waveform by a tracking-control algorithm, enforcing limits in maximum switching frequency and voltage ripples. This paper presents a direct method of implementing the pulsewidth modulation for the single-phase full-bridge inverter, using the CCC technique. A simple procedure to design such an inverter is also discussed. The proposed controller is simulated in a personal computer simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis. Supporting results from an experimental prototype confirm the usefulness of the proposed controller. The inverter may be used in uninterruptible power supply and many other applications. © 2008 IEEE.","Controlled capacitor charging (CCC); Inverters; Soft-switching techniques","Bridges; Capacitance; Capacitors; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electronics industry; Energy storage; Integrated circuits; Modulation; Personal computers; Power supply circuits; Pulse width modulation; Capacitor charging; Charging/discharging; Controlled capacitor charging (CCC); Direct method; Error signals; High-frequency pulses; Inverters; Negative polarity; Output voltages; Simulation programs; Sinusoidal voltages; Soft-switching techniques; Tracking controls; Uninterruptible power supplies; Voltage ripples; Voltage wave forms; Wave forms; Zero-current switching; Computer control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49249091501

One thyristor is triggered by a trigger circuit; the other two are autotriggered and require no external trigger circuit. The three thyristors could be synchronized automatically in sequence. During the closing process, the discharging of the energy storage capacitors via the thyristors is prevented. The discharging starts when all thyristors are closed, and the currents through each thyristor are simultaneous and identical.

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have increasingly been used for remotely monitoring tasks. Limited capabilities of sensor nodes in terms of communication, computation and storage, present challenges for protocols designed for WSNs. Due to the severe energy constraint of sensor nodes, among the major concerns is the problem of designing efficient energy-aware routing protocols. A large number of routing protocols has been proposed in the literature. They basically differ depending on the application and network architecture used in their design. Cluster-based routing protocols for large-scale WSNs have some advantages as compared to a flat network topology. Clustering results in a reduced number of messages that propagate through the network in order to accomplish a sensing task. It also offers an improved power control. In this paper, we present clustering energy-aware routing protocols for WSNs, highlight their features and present a comparison of the protocols' features. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Architectural design; Chlorine compounds; Clustering algorithms; Decoding; Electric network topology; Energy conservation; Flow of solids; Hybrid sensors; Laws and legislation; Network protocols; Network routing; Parallel algorithms; Parallel processing systems; Sensor networks; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cluster-based routing; Designing efficient; Energy constraints; Energy-aware routing; Flat networks; International symposium; Low costs; Low-power sensor nodes; Parallel architectures; Power controlled; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensors; Routing protocols",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49149104187

The power spectrum consists of three multipliers: a 1/fβ noise factor with β ∼ 1 reflecting a stochastic behavior of precipitation; a Lorentzian factor 1 / (fc2 + f2) damping high frequency runoff oscillations; and the sum of spectral modes of annual and intra-annual periodicity. This spectrum has two different power-law trends, separated by the crossover frequency fc, with the exponents β and β + 2 at low and high frequencies, respectively. The theoretical results are tested on four discharge time series (3580-6575 daily records) of the river Volga at Staritsa and three rivers of the Volga basin, catchment areas varied from 1850 to 21,100 km2. The time series are used to calculate empirical power spectra of river discharges and to construct the theoretical power spectra by fitting model parameters to the data. The calculations indicate that the spectral exponent β is approximately equal to 1 for three rivers and to 0.67 for one river. The crossover frequency fc corresponds to a period of 12 days for large catchment areas and ∼3 days for small one. The comparison shows that the model and empirical spectra by their spectral trends at low and high frequencies, crossover frequency, and positions of first several spectral modes are in satisfactory agreement. To isolate an effect of fluctuations, we consider a transformed runoff time series for one of the rivers, obtained by subtraction of the multiyear average daily hydrograph from the raw time series. The transformed time series interpreted as discharge fluctuations is used to calculate the fluctuation power spectrum. This spectrum has two different power-law trends with a spectral exponent of 0.6 at low frequencies and 2.7 at high frequencies. The difference is about 2 like for the power spectrum of raw time series, but the crossover frequency slightly moves to a value corresponding to a period of 15 days. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Sputtering deposition of Ni catalyst particles led to a uniform growth of CNTs on the carbon fiber surface through the tip-growth mechanism. Because sputtering deposition ensures little pore blockage (in comparison with wet-impregnation), the surface area decrease of the carbon fiber due to Ni loading was minimized. By using H2SO4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte, a capacitor cell assembled with the CNT-grafted fiber showed higher electron and electrolyte-ion conductivities relative to a cell assembled with the bare fiber. By increasing the discharging current density from 1 to 150 mA cm-2, the bare fiber exhibited a capacitance loss of 17% while the CNT-grafted fiber showed a mitigated capacitance loss of only 7%.

The adsorption of hydrogen was examined at a range of coverages, from low to full monolayer coverage. Several pathways for hydrogenation were investigated, and those that could lead to energetically favorable, stable structures of fully saturated nanotubes were identified. For these routes, the calculations indicate that the addition of hydrogen, apart from at the very onset, is exothermic and also becomes increasingly more favorable with increasing degree of coverage. Carbon nanotubes of sufficiently small diameter are shown to have the capacity to store a full monolayer of hydrogen effectively via chemisorption. In addition, kinetic barriers for the dissociative chemisorption of H2 and thermal equilibration of the system were considered. These were found to be quite large for admolecules on an otherwise-clean nanotube, but to drop substantially in the vicinity of preadsorbed hydrogen; that is, the adsorbed hydrogen acts as an autocatalyst for further hydrogenation. On the basis of these findings, the chemical reaction of hydrogen with carbon nanotubes is expected to become increasingly exothermic and also to proceed more rapidly at higher coverages. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Degree of coverage; First-principles density functional theory; Molecular hydrogen; Monolayer coverage; Adsorption; Carbon; Chemisorption; Density functional theory; Electron energy levels; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Nanocomposites; Nanopores; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Nanotubes; Nonmetals; Probability density function; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50649107451

A short (20-50ns) positive pulse switches the WOx film from low resistance state (LRS) to high resistance state (HRS), while a longer (200-500ns) positive pulse switches the film from HRS to LRS. Negative pulses, on the other hand, do not produce reversible resistivity changes.

Currently there is no database that can easily provide these capabilities for almost all RNA molecules with known secondary structures. Results: In this paper we describe RNA STRAND - the RNA secondary STRucture and statistical ANalysis Database, a curated database containing known secondary structures of any type and organism. Our new database provides a wide collection of known RNA secondary structures drawn from public databases, searchable and downloadable in a common format. Comprehensive statistical information on the secondary structures in our database is provided using the RNA Secondary Structure Analyser, a new tool we have developed to analyse RNA secondary structures. The information thus obtained is valuable for understanding to which extent and with which probability certain structural motifs can appear. We outline several ways in which the data provided in RNA STRAND can facilitate research on RNA structure, including the improvement of RNA energy models and evaluation of secondary structure prediction programs. In order to keep up-to-date with new RNA secondary structure experiments, we offer the necessary tools to add solved RNA secondary structures to our database and invite researchers to contribute to RNA STRAND.

Communication between nodes in these graphs requires storage space which influences throughput. We present an exact technique to chart the Pareto space of throughput and storage trade-offs, which can be used to determine the minimal buffer space needed to execute a graph under a given throughput constraint. The feasibility of the exact technique is demonstrated with experiments on a set of realistic DSP and multimedia applications. To increase scalability of the approach, a fast approximation technique is developed that guarantees both throughput and a, tight, bound on the maximal overestimation of buffer requirements. The approximation technique allows to trade off worst-case overestimation versus runtime. © 2008 IEEE.","Buffering; Cyclo-static dataflow; DSP; Multimedia applications; Optimization; Pareto analysis; Synchronous dataflow; Throughput; Trade-offs","Applications; Block codes; Buffer storage; Commerce; Graph theory; Polynomial approximation; Buffering; Cyclo-static dataflow; DSP; Multimedia applications; Optimization; Pareto analysis; Synchronous dataflow; Throughput; Trade-offs; Data flow analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51349095897

This paper proposes a hybrid valve switching and control strategy for a voltage-sourced converter (VSC) used for interfacing a WECS to the utility grid. The hybrid control of the VSC ensures continuous operation of the system in the presence of temporary single line to ground faults on the utility feeder without the need for a storage provision. The fast acting hybrid control also limits reactive fault current contribution by the converter, and therefore, avoids problems associated with overcurrent protection of the feeder. The hybrid valve switching and control of the VSC consists of: 1) sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) based valve switching and current-controlled voltage-source operation of the VSC during normal system operating conditions and 2) hysteresis space vector modulation (HSVM) based switching together with controlled current-source operation of the VSC during temporary fault conditions. The hybrid control of the VSC isolates the WECS from the grid side disturbances to ensure uninterrupted operation of the unit. Simulation studies of the grid-interactive WECS in PSCAD/EMTDC confirm the validity of the proposed hybrid control scheme. © 2008 IEEE.","Hybrid control; Induction generator; Self-excitation; Sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM); Space vector modulation; Thyristor rectifier; Voltage-sourced converter (VSC); Wind energy","Electric fault currents; Energy conversion; Feeding; Modulation; Overcurrent protection; Spatial variables control; Switching; Continuous operations; Control strategies; Current sources; Fault conditions; Fault current; Fault ride-through; Hybrid control; Hybrid control scheme; Induction generator; Operating conditions; Over currents; PSCAD/EMTDC; Self-excitation; Simulation studies; Single line-to-ground faults; Sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM); Sinusoidal pulse-width-modulation; Space vector modulation; Thyristor rectifier; Utility grids; Voltage sources; Voltage-sourced converter (VSC); Wind energy; Wind energy conversion system; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50649125557

While the UPy groups consequently serve as the ""hard phase"" or ""hard block"" in these TPEs, an amorphous polyester has been used as the ""soft phase"" or ""soft block"". The UPy unit has been flanked with either a sterically demanding isophorone spacer or a linear hexamethylene, where these spacers have been derived from isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) or hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), respectively. This difference on a molecular level leads to a homogeneous amorphous material in the IPDI case (polymer 1) and to a nanophase-separated material in the HDI case (polymer 2) as revealed by AFM and DSC experiments. Apart from this distinctive difference in morphology and nanoscopic organization, the macroscopic properties of both materials are also fundamentally different. In linear stress-strain and DMTA experiments, the homogeneous IPDI material 1 shows rubberlike behavior at room temperature, while the mechanical properties are strongly temperature dependent. The nanophase-separated HDI material 2 shows a combination of rubber and plastic behavior and displays a clear rubber plateau between 0 and 50° C with little temperature dependence.

Beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase 20 (GH20) family are involved in the removal of terminal β-glycosidacally linked N-acetylhexosamine residues. These enzymes, widely distributed in microorganisms, animals and plants, are involved in many important physiological and pathological processes, such as cell structural integrity, energy storage, pathogen defence, viral penetration, cellular signalling, fertilization, development of carcinomas, inflammatory events and lysosomal storage diseases. Nevertheless, only limited analyses of phylogenetic relationships between GH20 genes have been performed until now. Results. Careful phylogenetic analyses of 233 inferred protein sequences from eukaryotes and prokaryotes reveal a complex history for the GH20 family. In bacteria, multiple gene duplications and lineage specific gene loss (and/or horizontal gene transfer) are required to explain the observed taxonomic distribution. The last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes is likely to have possessed at least one GH20 family member. At least one gene duplication before the divergence of animals, plants and fungi as well as other lineage specific duplication events have given rise to multiple paralogous subfamilies in eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses also suggest that a second, divergent subfamily of GH20 family genes present in animals derive from an independent prokaryotic source. Our data suggest multiple convergent changes of functional roles of GH20 family members in eukaryotes. Conclusion. This study represents the first detailed evolutionary analysis of the glycosyl hydrolase GH20 family. Mapping of data concerning physiological function of GH20 family members onto the phylogenetic tree reveals that apparently convergent and highly lineage specific changes in substrate specificity have occurred in multiple GH20 subfamilies. © 2008 Intra et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"glycosidase; beta n acetylhexosaminidase; glycosidase; amino acid sequence; article; bacterium; enzyme specificity; eukaryote; fungus; gene duplication; gene loss; gene mapping; gene structure; genetic conservation; genetic variability; horizontal gene transfer; human; molecular evolution; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; plant; prokaryote; protein family; protein function; taxonomy; unindexed sequence; animal; chemistry; classification; enzyme specificity; eukaryotic cell; gene order; genetics; metabolism; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; prokaryotic cell; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Eukaryota; Fungi; Prokaryota; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases; Eukaryotic Cells; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Order; Glycoside Hydrolases; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Prokaryotic Cells; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, Protein; Substrate Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749102098

It was found that the Co content ratio in the binary oxide can be easily controlled by adjusting the composition of the plating solution. The deposited oxide showed a nanocrystalline characteristic and revealed a uniform distribution of the constituent elements, i.e., Mn, Co, and O. The experimental data also indicated that the incorporated Co effectively inhibited the irreversible anodic dissolution of the deposited oxide during cyclic voltammetric scans which were performed in aqueous KCl electrolyte; and therefore, it resulted in a great improvement in electrochemical stability of the oxide electrode. Moreover, an appropriate amount of Co oxide addition was confirmed to enhance the high rate charge-discharge capability of the binary oxide electrode.

This method was used to evaluate four alternative objective functions, to maximize: (a) volume harvested, (b) wood product C storage, (c) forest C storage, and (d) C storage in the forest and products, over 300 years for a 30,000 ha hypothetical forest in New Brunswick, Canada. Effects of three initial forest age-structures and a range of product substitution rates were tested. Results showed that in many cases, C storage in product pools (especially in landfills) plus on-site forest C was equivalent to forest C storage resulting from reduced harvest. In other words, accounting for only forest, and not products and landfill C, underestimates true forest contributions to C sequestration, and may result in spurious C maximization strategies. The scenario to maximize harvest resulted in mean harvest for years 1-200 of 3.16 m3 ha-1 yr-1 and total C sequestration of 0.126 t ha-1 yr-1, versus 0.98 m3 ha-1 yr-1 and 0.228 t ha-1 yr-1 for a scenario to maximize forest C. When maximizing total (forest + products) C, mean harvest and total C storage for years 1-200 was 173% and 5% higher, respectively, than when maximizing forest C; and 218% and 6% higher, respectively, when maximizing substitution benefits (0.25 t of avoided C emissions per m3 of lumber used) in addition to total C. Initial forest age-structure affected harvest in years 1-50 &lt; 34% among the four alternative management objective scenarios, and resulted in mean C sequestration rates of 0.31, 0.10, and -0.14 t ha-1 yr-1 when maximizing total C storage for young, even-aged, and old forests, respectively. Our results reinforce the importance of including products in forest-sector C budgets, and demonstrate how including product C in management can maximize forest contributions toward reduced atmospheric CO2 at operational scales. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, the distances between the donor and acceptor are 88.2 and 67.6 Å for Au and core- shell Au@ZnO nanoparticles, respectively, using the efficiency of surface energy transfer which follows a 1/d4 distance dependence between donor and acceptor.

Two SAMs were formed using two lengths of the alkyl chain (C10 and C16). The BODIPY fluorescent moiety used is known to form dimers which through donor-acceptor energy transfer results in red-shifted fluorescence. Fluorescence from the monomer and dimer were used to study the nature of the desorbed molecules during cyclic step changes in potential. The reductive desorption was observed to occur over a small potential window (0.15 V) signified by an increase in capacitance and in fluorescence. Oxidative readsorption was also observed through a decrease in capacitance and a lack of total removal of the fluorescent layer. Removal by oxidative desorption occurred at positive potentials over a broad potential range near the oxidation of the bare Au. The resulting fluorescence showed that the desorbed molecules remained near the electrode surface and were not dispersed over the 20 s waiting time. The rate of change of the fluorescence for oxidative desorption was much slower than the reductive desorption. Comparing monomer and dimer fluorescence intensities indicated that the dimer was formed on the Au surface and desorbed as a dimer, rather than forming from desorbed monomers near the electrode surface. The dimer fluorescence can only be observed through energy transfer from the excited monomer suggesting that the monomers and dimers must be in close proximity in aggregates near the electrode. The fluorescence yield for longer alkyl chain was always lower presumably due to its decreased solubility in the interfacial region resulting in a more efficient fluorescence quenching. The oxidative desorption process results in a significantly etched or roughened electrode surface suggesting the coupling of thiol oxidative removal and Au oxide formation which results in the removal of Au from the electrode. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Alkylation; Capacitance; Desorption; Dimers; Electrolysis; Electron energy levels; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Fluorescence; Fluorescence microscopy; Forming; Gold; Image analysis; Imaging techniques; Light emission; Metallizing; Microscopic examination; Missile bases; Monomers; Oligomers; Quenching; Adsorbed layers; Alkyl chains; Close proximity; Desorption processes; Donor acceptors; Electro-chemical method; Electrode surfaces; Fluorescence imaging; Fluorescence intensities; Fluorescence quenching; Fluorescence yields; In fluorescence; Interfacial regions; Oxide formation; Positive potentials; Potential ranging; Rate of change; Readsorption; Red-shifted fluorescence; Reductive desorption; Self-assembled monolayer; Step changes; Waiting-time; Luminescence; 4,4 difluoro 4 bora 3a,4a diaza s indacene; 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene; boron derivative; gold; thiol derivative; adsorption; alkylation; article; chemical structure; chemistry; fluorescence; oxidation reduction reaction; surface property; Adsorption; Alkylation; Boron Compounds; Fluorescence; Gold; Molecular Structure; Oxidation-Reduction; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49649089550

Fortunately, the current management strategies are able to deal with the surplus sulfur which are characterized by: relatively short-term storage; magnitude and duration of existing acid-gas injection schemes; and finally the capacity of newly developed sulfur consuming products to use large amounts of sulfur. Meanwhile, large solid sulfur blocks are being formed which are created by a staged pour of molten sulfur within aluminum forms which came from storing of sulfur that are in excess of marketable amounts. On the other hand, the acid gas have always been disposed by companies in Western Canada by injecting it into subterranean formations. However, this method also injects the hydrogen sulfide which is an energy-rich molecule.

High selective pressures therefore act on the functionality of the gut. Despite these evolutionary pressures, very little changes in general gut anatomy are observed between taxa. In invertebrates and vertebrates three sections can be distinguished: 1) fore-gut for food-uptake and primary digestion, 2) midgut for further digestion and absorption, 3) hindgut for resorption of water and ions. Within this conserved anatomy, adaptation occurs by changes in absorptive area, retention time or volume fir storage or fermentation. In species with low energy diets, or high energy demands the digestive tracts is larger for better absorption and longer retention. In animals with high energy diets, or low energy demands the digestive tract is smaller. This change in gut-size is not only observed within evolutionary context, but also as phenotypic plasticity. When in some species the intestinal tract is temporarily in disuse, the intestinal tract becomes smaller and enlarges again when feeding is resumed. Although adaptation and plasticity of the gut seems to occur frequently, there are indications that it is limited by phyhgenetic or ontogentic constraints. Despite these constraints it is shown that trophic plasticity may play a major role in speciation. Copyright © 2008 by New Century Health Publishers, LLC.

The main advantage of this approach is the capability to set banks in low power modes when they are not accessed, such that only the accessed bank is maintained in active mode. In this paper we investigate how this power management capability can be handled for real-time and multi-tasking applications. Based on the application scheduler, the objective is to find an efficient allocation of application's tasks to memory banks as well as the corresponding memory configuration that lessen the energy consumption.

This ""globesity"" also affects developing countries where under nutrition and stunting frequently coexist with overweight and obesity. One third of obese adults began to be so in the pediatric ages. There are two main types of prevention: general one representing greater actions from health authorities and the individual one carried out by the pediatrician and the patient at risk. Once the state of obesity is reached (relative body mass index, rBMI >121%) the longer lasting care becomes more complex and frequently unsuccessful. The treatment of obesity is aimed to care for the present and silent disorders and for preventing its further tracking to adulthood. Data sources: Identification of pediatric population at risk which is the one with an rBMI of 111%>120% plus other risk factors. Specific individual actions include reduction of food intake, increase of energy expenditure, involvement of parents, and the child-adolescent himself in the prevention. Therapy is based on some principles plus the important medical and emotional approach. Results: A Cochrane study based on only 10 appropriate studies showed a predominant poor efficacy of the undergone preventive action. Treatment guides are presented after our own experience with a group of 400 kids with an average follow-up of 7 years and other individual prevention studies. Conclusions: Involving motivated pediatricians with a minimum of time for visits and better follow-up in the frame of a general national preventive programme could be a rational outcome. Treatment of obesity should never be postponed whatever the clinical care is. © Springer 2008.","Obesity; Prevention; Relative body mass index; Treatment","adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; alkaloid derivative; amphetamine derivative; anorexigenic agent; cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist; central stimulant agent; conjugated linoleic acid; docosahexaenoic acid; herbaceous agent; icosapentaenoic acid; metformin; sucrose polyester; tetrahydrolipstatin; aerobic exercise; anorexia; anthropometric parameters; article; bariatric surgery; behavior therapy; body mass; child behavior; child health care; child parent relation; clinical effectiveness; comorbidity; diet therapy; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug safety; emotionality; energy expenditure; fatty liver; feces incontinence; feeding behavior; flatulence; follow up; food intake; gastric banding; genetic risk; glycemic index; human; hyperinsulinemia; hypertension; leisure; lifestyle; lipid storage; medical care; mental deficiency; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; nutritional health; obesity; patient safety; pediatrician; physical activity; physical disability; physical education; population research; preventive health service; psychosocial care; risk assessment; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; sleep disorder; steatorrhea; stomach bypass; tachycardia; thermodynamics; weight control; weight gain; weight reduction; xerostomia; Adolescent; Anti-Obesity Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Comorbidity; Fatty Liver; Female; Food Habits; Humans; Infant; Lactones; Male; Motor Activity; Obesity; Pediatrics; Physician's Role; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55649111348

They readily absorb hydrogen and as such they are of potential use for energy storage. This work presents a thorough electronic and magnetic structure study within these systems among which we select ScFe2 and its hydride ScFe2H2 which crystallize in the C14 (2H) hexagonal structure. The relevance of this study for solid state chemistry pertains to the complexity brought by the presence of two distinct crystal sites for Fe with different magnetic properties (ordered moments, hyperfine fields) and bonding with hydrogen whose insertion sites were to be defined. Such issues, not considered experimentally, are addressed here within the well-established quantum mechanical density functional theoretical framework (DFT) using both pseudo-potential calculations for geometry optimization and all-electrons investigations for full study of the electronic, chemical bonding and magnetic structure properties. From energy-volume quadratic curves providing the equation of state, the hydride is found more compressible at a higher equilibrium volume than the pristine intermetallic. This stresses the negative pressure brought by hydrogen. Cohesive energy studies show the stability of hydrogen within ScFe2. From electron localization function (ELF) plots the expected picture of a negatively charged hydrogen within an alloy lattice is obtained. The chemical bond of H within the A2B2 tetrahedron formed of Sc and one type of Fe is discussed. Magnetic moments and Fermi contact term HFC of the effective hyperfine field Heff are found within range of the average experimental values in both the alloy and its hydride. For ScFe2H2 a peculiar feature of the magnetic moment magnitude inversion and of HFC for the two iron sites is found to be connected with a change in magnetic characters of the two Fe sites, becoming strongly and weakly ferromagnetic, respectively, for the isolated iron and the H connected Fe. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Open-loop buck converter consists of output impedance whose value depends on the open-loop gain, such that feedback brings the open-loop impedance to a very low value. The module of the capacitor impedance is affected by a term dependent on the phase margin and the variations of this term are plotted versus the phase margin.

Consequently, the relationship between mechanical stiffness and athletic performance is of great interest to the sport and research communities. Unfortunately, these relationships are relatively unexplored by researchers. For example, there are no longitudinal studies that have investigated the effects of strength or power training on mechanical stiffness levels (calculated during human running). In addition to reviewing the available literature on the relationships between mechanical stiffness (calculated during human running) and functional performance, this review focuses its discussion on the various equipment and methods used to calculate leg-spring stiffness during human running. Furthermore, future implications are presented for practitioners and researchers based on both the limitations and the gaps in the literature reviewed. It is our hope that a better understanding of mechanical stiffness will aid in improving the methodological quality of research in this area and its subsequent effect on athletic performance.

Due to the parallel comparison feature where a large amount of transistors are active on each lookup, however, the power consumption of CAM is usually considerable. This paper presents a hybrid-type CAM design which aims to combine the performance advantage of the NOR-type CAM with the power efficiency of the NAND-type CAM. In our design, a CAM word is divided into two segments, and then all the CAM cells are decoupled from the match line. By minimizing both the match line capacitances and switching activities, our design can largely reduce the power consumption of CAM. The experimental results show that the hybrid-type CAM can reduce the search energy consumption by roughly 89% compared to the traditional NOR-type CAM. Because the hybrid-type CAM provides a fast pull-down path to speed up the lightweight match line discharge, the search performance of our design is even better than that of the traditional NOR-type CAM. © 2008 IEEE.","Content-addressable memory (CAM); Hybrid-type CAM; NAND-type CAM; NOR-type CAM","Cams; Electric power utilization; Energy policy; Cam design; Content-addressable memory; Content-addressable memory (CAM); Energy consumption; Hybrid-type CAM; Match-line; NAND-type CAM; NOR-type CAM; Performance efficiency; Power consumption; Power efficiencies; Search data; Search performance; Speed ups; Stored data; Switching activities; Associative storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349098543

In order to estimate optimal cost, given a per-pixel difference image as observed data, we define an energy function and solve the minimization problem by solving the iterative equation with the numerical method. We improve performance and increase the convergence rate by using several acceleration techniques such as the Gauss-Seidel method, the multiscale approach, and adaptive interpolation. The proposed method is computationally efficient since it does not use color segmentation or any global optimization techniques. For occlusion handling, which has not been performed effectively by any conventional cost aggregation approaches, we combine the occlusion problem with the proposed minimization scheme. Asymmetric information is used so that few additional computational loads are necessary. Experimental results show that performance is comparable to that of many state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method is in fact the most successful among all cost aggregation methods based on standard stereo test beds. © 2008 IEEE.","Cost aggregation; Multiscale approach; Occlusion handling; Stereo vision; Weighted least square","Costs; Curve fitting; Difference equations; Equipment testing; Global optimization; Optimization; Stereo vision; Acceleration techniques; Adaptive interpolations; Aggregation methods; Art methods; Asymmetric informations; Color segmentations; Computational loads; Computationally efficient; Convergence rates; Difference images; Energy functions; Global optimization techniques; Iterative equations; Minimization problems; Multiscale approach; Novel methods; Observed datums; Occlusion handling; Occlusion problems; Optimal costs; Stereo matching; Test beds; Weighted least square; Cost benefit analysis; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; photography; regression analysis; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Least-Squares Analysis; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photogrammetry; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349094922

A variational method, associated with an energy functional, is used to simultaneously identify elastic parameter and stress fields. The deformation energy rate distribution can then be determined on the basis of the stress and strain data. Secondly, infrared thermography provides thermal images which are used to separately estimate the thermoelastic source amplitude and mean dissipation per cycle distributions. The image processing uses a local form of the heat diffusion equation and a special set of approximation functions that take the frequency spectra of the sought sources into account. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Digital image correlation; Dissipation; Fatigue; Infrared thermography; Steel","Computer graphics; Digital image storage; Estimation; Image processing; Imaging systems; Imaging techniques; Iron; Linear equations; Optical data processing; Remote sensing; Steel; Thermography (imaging); Approximation functions; Balance (weighting); Deformation energies; Digital image correlation (DIC); Displacement fields; Energy functional; Frequency spectrum (FS); Heat diffusion equations; Infrared thermography (IT); Local energies; Quantitative imaging; Steel fatigue; Strain data; Strain rate (IGC:D7); Stress fields; Variational methods; Strain rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249123194

Also, the equivalent period and viscous damping for the equivalent linear systems which are used for representing the behavior of bare frames (the buildings without dampers) are derived from the concept of average storage energy and average dissipated energy, respectively.

Genetically encoded sensors based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer between fluorescent protein domains have important advantages over synthetic probes. We discovered that hexahistidine tags have a strong tendency to dimerize upon binding of Zn(II) in solution and we used this principle to develop a new protein-based sensor for Zn(II). Enhanced cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins were connected by long flexible peptide linkers and His-tags were incorporated at both termini of this fusion protein. The resulting sensor CLY9-2His allows the ratiometric fluorescent detection of Zn(II) in the nanomolar range. In addition, CLY9-2His is selective over the physiologically relevant metal ions Fe(II), Mn(II), Ca(II) and Mg(II). Our approach demonstrates the potential of using small peptides as metal-binding ligands in chelating fluorescent protein chimeras. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press.

In this work the production of an hydrogen-rich gas by air/steam and air gasification of olive oil waste was investigated. The study was carried out in a laboratory reactor at atmospheric pressure over a temperature range of 700 - 900 °C using a steam/biomass ratio of 1.2 w/w. The influence of the catalysts ZnCl2 and dolomite was also studied at 800 and 900 °C. The solid, energy and carbon yield (%), gas molar composition and high heating value of the gas (kJ NL- 1), were determined for all cases and the differences between the gasification process with and without steam were established. Also, this work studies the different equilibria taking place, their predominance in each process and how the variables considered affect the final gas hydrogen concentration. The results obtained suggest that the operating conditions were optimized at 900 °C in steam gasification (a hydrogen molar fraction of 0.70 was obtained at a residence time of 7 min).

CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased by 33% (to 380 ppm) since 1750 ad, whilst CH4 concentration has increased by 75% (to 1,750 ppb), and as the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 is 25 fold greater than CO2 it represents about 20% of the global warming effect. The purpose of this review is to: (a) address recent findings regarding biophysical factors governing production and consumption of CH 4, (b) identify the current level of knowledge regarding the main sources and sinks of CH4 in Australia, and (c) identify CH 4 mitigation options and their potential application in Australian ecosystems. Almost one-third of CH4 emissions are from natural sources such as wetlands and lake sediments, which is poorly documented in Australia. For Australia, the major anthropogenic sources of CH4 emissions include energy production from fossil fuels (∼24%), enteric fermentation in the guts of ruminant animals (∼59%), landfills, animal wastes and domestic sewage (∼15%), and biomass burning (∼5%), with minor contributions from manure management (1.7%), land use, land-use change and forestry (1.6%), and rice cultivation (0.2%). A significant sink exists for CH4 (∼6%) in aerobic soils, including agricultural and forestry soils, and potentially large areas of arid soils, however, due to limited information available in Australia, it is not accounted for in the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. CH4 emission rates from submerged soils vary greatly, but mean values ≤10 mg m-2 h-1 are common. Landfill sites may emit CH4 at one to three orders of magnitude greater than submerged soils. CH4 consumption rates in non-flooded, aerobic agricultural, pastoral and forest soils also vary greatly, but mean values are restricted to ≤100 μg m-2 h-1, and generally greatest in forest soils and least in agricultural soils, and decrease from temperate to tropical regions. Mitigation options for soil CH 4 production primarily relate to enhancing soil oxygen diffusion through water management, land use change, minimised compaction and soil fertility management. Improved management of animal manure could include biogas capture for energy production or arable composting as opposed to open stockpiling or pond storage. Balanced fertiliser use may increase soil CH 4 uptake, reduce soil N2O emissions whilst improving nutrient and water use efficiency, with a positive net greenhouse gas (CO 2-e) effect. Similarly, the conversion of agricultural land to pasture, and pastoral land to forestry should increase soil CH4 sink. Conservation of native forests and afforestation of degraded agricultural land would effectively mitigate CH4 emissions by maintaining and enhancing CH4 consumption in these soils, but also by reducing N2O emissions and increasing C sequestration. The overall impact of climate change on methanogenesis and methanotrophy is poorly understood in Australia, with a lack of data highlighting the need for long-term research and process understanding in this area. For policy addressing land-based greenhouse gas mitigation, all three major greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O) should be monitored simultaneously, combined with improved understanding at process-level. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agricultural soils; Desert soils; Forest soils; Methane emission; Methane oxidation; Savanna soils; Wetlands","agricultural land; agricultural soil; anthropogenic source; biophysics; carbon sequestration; climate change; composting; concentration (composition); desert soil; emission inventory; forest soil; global warming; greenhouse gas; human activity; magnitude; methane; methanogenesis; savanna; soil emission; soil fertility; water use efficiency; Australasia; Australia; Animalia; Bovidae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47349106407

The influence of reaction temperature, stirring rate, and mass ratio of paraffin wax to styrene on the properties of phase change materials microcapsules was studied. The reaction temperature had not a significant effect on the size of the microcapsules but an increase of molecular weight and a narrow molecular weight distribution of polystyrene shell were observed when reaction temperature was increased. An exponential relationship between the stirring rate and the mean particle diameter in number has been found. It was observed that paraffin is difficultly encapsulated when the paraffin/polymer mass ratio was higher than 2.00, as a consequence of a shortage of polymer that could not completely cover the amount of paraffin added. However, when a large proportion of monomer was employed, the polymer tended to polymerize inside the droplets during the microencapsulation process forming complex inner structures. The microcapsules obtained have an interesting energy storage capacity of 153.5 J/g that makes them suitable for different applications. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Microencapsulation; Paraffin; Polystyrene; Suspension-like polymerization","Addition reactions; Chemical reactions; Chemicals; Encapsulation; Energy storage; Materials properties; Molecular weight; Molecular weight distribution; Molecules; Monomers; Packaging; Paraffin waxes; Paraffins; Petroleum products; Pigments; Polymerization; Polymers; Rate constants; Reaction kinetics; Shells (structures); Size distribution; Styrene; Suspensions (components); Weighing; (e ,3e) process; (PL) properties; energy storage capacity; Inner structures; mass ratios; Mean particle diameters; microcapsules; Operation conditions; Phase changes; Reaction temperatures; Springer (CO); stirring rates; weight distributions; Phase change materials; monomer; paraffin; polymer; polystyrene; article; chemical structure; melting point; microcapsule; microencapsulation; molecular weight; particle size; phase transition; polymerization; priority journal; suspension like polymerization; temperature; thermoregulation; thermostability; Encapsulation; Microstructure; Molecular Weight Distribution; Paraffin Wax; Polymerization; Polystyrene; Stirring; Storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45849096031

Corticosteroids are an important component of the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with known significantly negative effects on bone and muscle. Creatine monohydrate (CrM) supplementation may be an adjunctive therapeutic strategy to attenuate some of these adverse effects. Procedure. Nine children with ALL in the maintenance phase of treatment on the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) protocol 2000-2001 were treated with CrM (0.1 g/kg/day) for two sequential periods of 16 weeks (16 weeks treat > 6 weeks wash-out > 16 weeks treat). A cohort of children (N = 50) who were receiving the same chemotherapy at the same time served as natural history controls. Measurements included height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD), whole body bone mineral content (WB-BMC), fat-free mass (FFM), and percent body fat (%BF) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results. Despite the long course of corticosteroid treatment for ALL, children showed significant increases in height, LS-BMD, WB-BMC and FFM over approximately 38 weeks (P < 0.05) during the study. There was an increase in BMI over time, but children taking CrM had a reduction, while the natural history group showed an increase in % BF (P < 0.05 for interaction). Conclusions. Children with ALL treated with corticosteroids as part of a maintenance protocol of chemotherapy showed an increase in % BF that was attenuated by CrM supplementation. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia; Body composition; Creatine monohydrate; Dietary supplement","corticosteroid; creatine; corticosteroid; creatine; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adolescent; article; body composition; body fat; body height; body mass; body weight; bone density; bone mineral; cancer chemotherapy; child; clinical article; clinical protocol; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; creatinine blood level; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; human; lipid storage; lumbar spine; maintenance therapy; male; measurement; priority journal; side effect; adipose tissue; diet supplementation; drug effect; lymphatic leukemia; metabolism; preschool child; retrospective study; Adipose Tissue; Adolescent; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Body Composition; Child; Child, Preschool; Creatine; Dietary Supplements; Female; Humans; Male; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Retrospective Studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45549086607

The goal of this article is to explore possible bottlenecks in applying both the EIA and SEA procedures on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) activities in the Netherlands, as experience is currently minimal or lacking. In this study we focus mainly on the institutional and procedural aspects of the screening and scoping phases of both procedures. This is achieved by reviewing EIA and SEA procedures for analogue projects for the three distinctive process steps of a CCS project, namely the power plant with capture, the transport and finally the underground storage of the CO2. Additionally, EIA and SEA or similar procedures on CCS in other countries are reviewed and the legal framework for the Dutch EIA and SEA is studied. This article shows a concise overview of the EIA and SEA procedure in the Netherlands and the relation between both procedures. Based on our findings we have constructed a conceptual taxonomy for the scope of both procedures for CCS in the Netherlands. This taxonomy conceptualizes the possible integration of assessing the environmental impacts for tiered levels of decision making. This integration might be needed for first CCS projects as decisions on the strategic (spatial planning) level are currently absent for CCS in the Netherlands. Perpendicular to such integration is the integration of linked activities in the CCS chain and their alternatives, into one procedure. We argue that it would be beneficial to combine the separate EIA procedures for CCS activities into one procedure or at least provide close linkage between them. This issue should be carefully considered by regulators, competent authorities and project initiators in an early stage to avoid delaying legal procedures in the future. For the same reason also early involvement of public, interested parties and the Netherlands Commission for the Environmental Impact Assessment in the scoping phase of the procedures is desired. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The room temperature emission spectra corresponding to 4F9/2 →6HJ (J = 7/2, 9/2, 11/2, 13/2 and 15/2) transitions of Dy3+ ions were measured. The fluorescence decay from 4F9/2 level have been measured by monitoring the intense 4F9/2 →6H13/2 transition. The lifetime of the decay is obtained by taking the first e-folding times of the decay curves and is found to decrease with increase in Dy3+ ions concentration due to concentration quenching. The decay curves are found to be perfectly single exponential for samples with low Dy3+ ion concentration. The non-exponential decay curves observed for higher concentrations are well fitted to the Inokuti-Hirayama model for S = 6, which indicates that the energy transfer between the donor and acceptor is of dipole-dipole nature.

Unfortunately, a radiant floor cooling system may cause condensation on the floor surface under hot and humid conditions during the cooling season. In addition, the radiant floor system does not respond quickly to internal load changes due to the thermal storage effect of the concrete mass, which is usually present in radiant floor cooling systems. This study proposes a radiant floor cooling system integrated with dehumidified ventilation, which cools and dehumidifies the outdoor air entering through the cooling coil in the ventilator by lowering the dew-point temperature to prevent condensation on the floor surface. Furthermore, outdoor reset control was used to modulate the temperature of chilled water supplied to the radiant floor, and indoor temperature feedback control was then used to respond to the internal load changes. To evaluate the performance of the radiant floor cooling system integrated with dehumidified ventilation, both a physical experiment in a laboratory setting and TRNSYS simulation for an apartment in Korea have been conducted. As a result, it was found that the proposed system was not only able to solve the problem of condensation on a floor surface but also to control the indoor thermal environment within the acceptable range of comfort. Furthermore, the proposed system improved the responsiveness to internal load changes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This behavior was characteristic of highly concentrated emulsions with a well-developed plateau region. Increase in both energy input and crayfish flour concentration yielded higher values of linear viscoelasticity functions and lower droplet size, which suggested an enhancement of the elastic network and an increase in emulsion stability.

The absorption and fluorescence spectra of all the three dyes reflect significant modifications upon interaction with the DNA. A comparative study of the dyes with respect to modification of fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy upon binding, effect of urea, iodide-induced fluorescence quenching, and CD measurements reveal that the dyes bind to the ctDNA principally in an intercalative fashion. The effect of ionic strength indicates that electrostatic attraction between the cationic dyes and ctDNA is also an important component of the dye-DNA interaction. Intrinsic and induced CD studies help to assess the structural effects of dyes binding to DNA and confirm the intercalative mode of binding as suggested by fluorescence and other studies. Finally it is proposed that dyes with bulkier substitutions are intercalated into the DNA to a lesser extent. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption; Anisotropy; Binding energy; Crystallography; Data storage equipment; Dichroism; DNA; Dyes; Flow interactions; Fluorescence; Genes; Ionic strength; Light emission; Nucleic acids; Optical properties; Organic acids; Quenching; Urea; Absorption and fluorescence spectra; Binding interactions; Calf thymus DNA; Cationic dyes; Cd measurements; Comparative studies; DNA interactions; Effect of ionic strength; Electrostatic attraction; Fluorescence anisotropy; Fluorescence quenching; Induced circular dichroism; Intercalative modes; Steady-state fluorescence; Structural effects; Luminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49349105052

On these systems we have applied five different QM levels of description of increasing accuracy (ZINDO, CIS, TD-DFT, CASSCF, and SAC-CI). In addition, we have tested the effects of a surrounding environment (either mimicking a solvent or a protein matrix) on excitation energies, transition dipoles, and electronic couplings through the polarizable continuum model (PCM) description. Overall, the results obtained suggest that the choice of the QM level of theory affects the electronic couplings much less than it affects excitation energies. We conclude that reasonable estimates can be obtained using moderate basis sets and inexpensive methods such as configuration interaction of single excitations or time-dependent density functional theory when appropriately coupled to realistic solvation models such as PCM. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Chromophores; Continuum mechanics; Couplings; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Excitation energy; Optical instruments; Optoelectronic devices; Probability density function; Pulse code modulation; American Institute of Physics (AIP); Basis sets; Comparative analysis; Comparative studies; Configuration interaction (CIS); Electro-optical; Electronic couplings; Excitation energy transfer (EET); Photosynthetic systems; Polarizable continuum model (PCM); Protein matrix; QM level; Quantum mechanical (QM) methods; Quantum-mechanical (QM); Single excitations; Solvation models; Surrounding environment; Time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT); Transition (Jel Classifications:E52 ,E41 ,E31); Transition dipole (TD); Transition energies; Density functional theory; bacteriochlorophyll; bacteriopheophytin; drug derivative; imide; naphthalene derivative; perylene; perylenediimide; pheophytin; article; chemistry; comparative study; electron; energy transfer; quantum theory; Bacteriochlorophylls; Electrons; Energy Transfer; Imides; Naphthalenes; Perylene; Pheophytins; Quantum Theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47949119798

This study examined the proportion of AGB in logs and residues at the harvest of radiata pine, cypress pine, blackbutt, spotted gum and messmate. Messmate and spotted gum had the highest variation in stem diameter and height. The average AGB ranged from 2000 to 3000 kg for the hardwoods and 220-1000 kg for the softwoods. Blackbutt had the overall lowest proportion of AGB recovered in commercial logs (45.5%) and radiata pine the highest (65%). The proportion of AGB in the bark of the hardwoods was significantly lower than in the softwoods. The proportion of the AGB in forest residues following harvest ranged from 30 to 55% depending on the species. The proportion of AGB recovered in high quality commercial logs ranged from 15% for spotted gum to 63% for radiata pine. The differences were due to the natural characteristics of the selected species and variations in regional market availability. The highest retention rates of AGB in high quality hardwood commercial logs were obtained for trees with DBH between 500 and 600 mm (messmate and blackbutt) and greater than 600 mm for spotted gum. The mean moisture content of the wood of the different species ranged from 35 to 50%. Messmate and radiata pine logs had the highest moisture content (48 and 50%, respectively). The C concentration of blackbutt, radiata pine and cypress pine was slightly higher than 50%. The softwoods had significantly higher C concentration than the hardwoods. The C concentration between positions (cross-section, sapwood and heartwood) also varied for the different species. The highest proportion of the above-ground C was in the debarked log for all species with the exception of blackbutt. The cellulose concentration of the wood ranged from 56 to 64% for hardwoods and 40-52% for the two softwoods. The lignin concentration of the wood ranged from 16 to 19% for the hardwoods and 25-35% for the two softwoods. The hardwood species could not be distinguished from one another based on the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin concentration, but within the softwood species, cypress pine and radiata pine formed separate clusters. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the QD:PSF composite films, the Förster radius for energy transfer is found to be 4-6 nm. In electroluminescent devices lacking an electron transport layer, the electroluminescence (EL) spectrum of the QD:PSF polymer composite is similar to the photoluminescence (PL), giving evidence for energy transfer from PSF to the QDs. The addition of an electron transport layer between the emitting layer and the cathode results in a significant change in the EL spectrum and a considerable improved device performance, providing almost pure monochromatic emission at 630 nm with a luminance efficiency of 0.32 cdA.

Heating is produced by a pulse of electric current flowing through the junction. For sufficiently long heating pulse (> 20 ns), a quasiequilibrium temperature profile is reached in the MTJ. In this stationary regime, a relationship between the temperature of the storage layer and the power of the pulse was established by using an Arrhenius-Ńel model of thermal relaxation. The introduction of thermal barriers between the junction tunnel barrier and the electrodes allows a significant reduction of the power required to achieve a given temperature rise of the storage layer. When the heating pulse duration is reduced from 1 s to 2 ns, the heating power required for setting the FAF storage bilayer increases by about 80%.

In the proposed topology, along with a linear regulator two switching capacitors are used to store and recycle the charge for better power efficiency. The linear regulator is used to reduce the amount of output voltage ripple that comes from the switching capacitors. The output ripple noise is further reduced by introducing a synthesized counter ripple through the linear regulator. With this noise reduction technique, for an acceptable output ripple noise, the switching capacitors are reduced to a value which can be implemented on chip. The proposed converter circuit is designed in 0.18μ process for 3.3Vto 1.25Vconversion.

A challenge is to attain such spatial organization among nanoscale systems. Interactions between nanoscale systems, e.g., conjugated polymers, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, and so on, are of interest for basic and applied reasons. However, typically the excited-state interactions and dynamics are examined in rather complex blends, such as cast films. A model system with complexity intermediate between a film and a supramolecular system would yield helpful insights into electronic energy and charge transfer. Here, we report a simple and versatile approach to achieving spatially defined organization of colloidal CdSe, CdSe/ZnS core/shell, or PbS nanocrystals (quantum dots) with poly(3-hexylthiophenes) (P3HTs) using micelles of poly(styrene-b-4- vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) as the main structural motif. We compare the characteristics of this system to those of natural light-harvesting complexes. Bulk heterojunction films (and related systems) are characterized by electronic interactions, and therefore dynamics of charge and energy transfer, at interfaces rather than between specific donor-acceptor molecules. Owing to structural disorder, such systems are inherently complex. Therefore, we expect that the spatially defined organization of the active components in the present system provides new opportunities for studying the complicated photophysics intrinsic to blends of nanoscale systems, such as bulk heterojunctions by establishing simplified and better controlled interfaces. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Cadmium compounds; Carbon nanotubes; Charge transfer; Colloids; Conjugated polymers; Dynamics; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Flow interactions; Harvesting; Heterojunctions; Ion exchange; Micelles; Nanostructured materials; Nanotechnology; Optical waveguides; Polymers; Quantum electronics; Real time systems; Semiconductor quantum dots; Styrene; 4 vinylpyridine (P4VP); Active components; American Chemical Society (ACS); Bulk heterojunction; Bulk-heterojunctions; Cast (undoped) films; CdSe/ZnS; Chemical systems; Complex blends; Core shells; Donor-acceptor molecules; Electronic energies; Electronic interactions; Excited states; Hierarchical organizations; Model systems; Nano scaling; Nano-scale systems; Natural light; New opportunities; PbS nanocrystals; Photophysics; Polymeric micelles; Quantum Dot (CO); Related systems; Spatial organizations; Structural disordering; Structural motifs; Supramolecular systems; Hierarchical systems; cadmium selenide; carbon nanotube; lead sulfide; nanocrystal; polymer; polystyrene; quantum dot; styrene derivative; thiophene derivative; zinc sulfide; article; chemical structure; colloid; composite material; energy transfer; film; light harvesting system; micelle; micellization; molecular dynamics; nanoanalysis; nanotechnology; scanning electron microscopy; transmission electron microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47749155279

Design/methodology/approach - The analyses are based on comparisons of electricity generation costs for nuclear and fossil-fuel technologies. These costs, expressed in present value terms, are estimated on the basis of life-cycle costs, employing detailed country-specific technological and economic data and assumptions. Findings - The analyses suggest that that the provision of carbon capture and storage is likely to result in a significant increase in the cost of electricity produced from fossil fuels (principally coal) in all countries represented in this paper. Such increase would completely erode the existing cost advantage enjoyed by fossil-fuel power (in relation to nuclear power) in some countries (Argentina, Bulgaria, China, and India) and considerably enhance the existing cost-advantage of nuclear power in other countries (Korea, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, and Russia). Originality/value - Notwithstanding these limitations, thefindings of this paper contribute appreciably to the emerging knowledge on this topic and provide useful foresight into the likely challenges of developing internationally acceptable policy prescriptions for mitigation CO2 emissions from the electricity sector. At a mundane, yet important, level, this paper establishes a platform on which further analyses could be built.","Carbon; Cost benefit anaysis; Electricity industry; Fossil fuels; Nuclear energy industry; Pollutant gases",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47049110876

FDLSM is then used as an offline substitute for the subsurface of the GCM ECHO-G. With a 600-m BBC and driven by ECHO-G future temperatures, the FDLSM subsurface absorbs 6.2 (7.5) times more heat than the ECHO-G soil model (10 m deep) under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A2 (B2) emission scenario.

This article aims at proposing a generic method for synthesizing an indirect heat exchange network and its associated thermal storage policy for targeting the external utility in a batch plant. Therein, a heat transfer medium (HTM), originally staying in a cold tank, is used to absorb surplus heat from hot process streams, and the HTM with elevated temperature is temporarily stored in a hot tank. The accumulated hot HTM is then utilized to heat subsequent cold process streams, and the cooled HTM recirculates back into its source cold tank. The limitation of heat interchange between time-dependent hot/cold process streams can be relaxed by applying the recirculated heat transfer medium to carry out indirect thermal storage. A superstructure is proposed and the mathematical programming approach is applied for investigating the indirect heat exchange policy. Not using any heuristics that are based on the concepts of pinch limitations, the proposed superstructure-based representation for synthesis of indirect heat exchange networks (HEN's) for batch processes is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Numerical examples are explored to demonstrate the applicability of proposed indirect HEN synthesis method for batch processes.

During the transfer of LPG from the source road tank car to the receiving fixed storage vessel, an accidental release of LPG gave rise to different final consequences ranging from a pool fire, to a fireball and to the catastrophic rupture of the tank with successive explosion of its contents. The sequence of events has been investigated by using some of the consequence calculation models most commonly adopted in risk analysis and accident investigation. On one hand, this allows to better understand the link between the various events of the accident. On the other hand, a comparison between the results of the calculations and the damages actually observed after the accident, allows to check the accuracy of the prediction models and to critically assess their validity. In particular, it was shown that the largest uncertainty is associated with the calculation of the energy involved in the physical expansion of the fluid (both liquid and vapor) after the catastrophic rupture of the tank. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It also attempts to gain an understanding of the interplay of the ductile behavior, temperature and strain rate effects, energy storage and cycling. The wires are in austenite condition at room temperature and above. The strain rates imposed during testing range from 0.2 to 180%/min (i.e., 0.06-54 mm/min) corresponding to a frequency of 2.77 × 10-4 to 0.25 Hz for strain amplitudes of 6%. The corresponding frequency for 8% strain amplitude is 2.08 × 10-4 to 0.18 Hz. It is shown that NiTi SMAs exhibit ductility at both low and high strain rates. This is also true for the cold worked and heat treated conditions both below Mf and above Af. During tensile testing the stress-induced martensite (SIM) plateau increases in length and translates upwards with increase in strain rate up to a certain value. Similarly, the onset of elastic yield stress also increases with strain rate. At high strain rates the SIM segment and elastically deformed SIM segment overlap. The SIM formation is not able to cope with the externally imposed higher strain rates. This is also the reason for the reduction of hysteresis loop at the high strain rates as observed in the cyclic tests. The dissipated strain energy density (Ed) increases with increasing strain rate up to a certain value beyond which the Ed decreases. It is clear that the mean point of the superelastic loop shifts to the right and upwards (higher stress and higher strain region) for cyclic testing with increase in strain rates.

The interfacial transition layer is not observed in this work. The oxide breakdown strengths are greater than 5 MV/cm and the capacitance-voltage hysteresis is negligible. Furthermore, the conduction mechanisms in positively and negatively biased regions are explored by the temperature responses of MOS capacitors. For the positively biased case, the conduction mechanism is shown to be dominated by Schottky emission with an effective barrier height of 1.10±0.12 eV. For the negatively biased case, the gate current is shown to be mainly due to the generation-recombination process in the depletion region.

The results show the originally 485 Å thick sputter-deposited film generally behaved similar to a bulk electrode in neutral Na2 SO4 solution. The anodic oxide, grown by applying 0.5 V potential steps, contained a significant amount of hydrogen in one form or another. The observed anodization ratio was somewhat higher than the literature value determined by coulometry, while the Pilling Bedworth ratio was in good agreement with published data. Oxide layer thickening, accelerated immediately after an anodic polarization was applied, persisted for many hours, suggesting the migration of ions continues for an extended time. The oxide cracked when the applied potential reached 1.5 V and its thickness reached ∼100 Å, causing loss of passivation. Surprisingly, the EIS behavior of the sample with cracked oxide could still be well represented by a single time-constant equivalent circuit consisting of a capacitor and a leakage resistor, albeit with much lower resistance. This indicates that the cracked and intact regions of the electrode behave essentially independent as parallel electrodes. The proposed modified equivalent circuit can explain a number of other unusual observations, including those seen under cathodic polarization. © 2008 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Absorption; Cathodic polarization; Electric currents; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrolysis; Energy storage; Equivalence classes; Health; Hydrogen; Metallizing; Passivation; Polarization; Sodium; Solutions; Sputtering; Steel analysis; Zirconium; Anodic oxides; Anodization; Applied (CO); Applied potentials; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS); Electrochemical Society (ECS); Hydrogen absorption; In-situ; Neutral aqueous solution; Neutron reflectometry (NR); One form; Oxide layers; parallel electrodes; potential steps; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46649085714

To support the logical deduction of the factors, diagnostic techniques like force-field analysis, situation-actor-process and learning-action-performance are used. Further, key managerial insights were obtained by developing an interpretive structural modeling (ISM) model for the set of factors, specific to Indian context. Findings - ISM delivers interrelationships among the factors which were utilized for deriving managerial insights. Further, these factors are classified into four categories, namely, autonomous, driver, dependent, and linkage to understand their relative impact on the implementation of IT in Indian SMEs. Practical implications - The advancement in IT presents opportunities for SMEs to harness the benefits of information and communication technologies in an affordable, simple way and to reach new customers and suppliers in global competition and at large to improve their supply chain competencies without a need for any major changes in business practices, manufacturing operations or production facilities.

Preliminary studies have reported that nonspecific inhibitors of Pgp affect synthesis and esterification of cholesterol, putatively by blocking trafficking of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum, and that relative increases in Pgp within a given cell type are associated with increased accumulation of cholesterol. Several key efflux proteins involved in the cholesterol metabolic pathway are transcriptionally regulated by the nuclear hormone liver X receptor (LXR). Therefore, to examine the interplay between P-glycoprotein and the cholesterol metabolic pathway, we utilized a high fat, normal cholesterol diet to upregulate LXRα without affecting dietary cholesterol. Our research has demonstrated that mice lacking in P-glycoprotein do not exhibit alterations in hepatic total cholesterol storage, circulating plasma total cholesterol levels, or total cholesterol concentration in the bile when compared to control animals on either a normal (25% calories from dietary fat) or high fat (45% calories from dietary fat) diet.

The study has been carried out both by steady state and time domain fluorescence measurement techniques at room temperature. It is found that the SA completely ionizes and exists as monoanion in PVA. It exhibits a large Stokes shifted blue emission (10 000 cm-1) due to ESIPT and shows a decay time of 6.85 ns. On the other hand, Tb3+ ion shows a very weak green emission and a decay time of ∼641 μs in PVA film.

Thermal ageing test was realized in furnace at 350 °C for 400 h and thermal shocks tests resulted from cycling the coating between 850 and 150 °C using oxyacetylene flame and compressed air-cooling. Alumina coating structures and phase content were characterized in parallel by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled to image analysis and stereological protocols and X-ray diffractometry (XRD).

Three MOFs have been considered: MOF-5, with unexposed metal sites, and HKUST-1 and CPO-27-Ni, with exposed Cu2+ and Ni 2+, respectively. The onset temperature of spectroscopic features associated with adsorbed H2 correlates with the adsorption enthalpy obtained by the VTIR method and with the shift experienced by the H-H stretching frequency. This relationship can be ascribed to the different nature and accessibility of the metal sites. On the basis of a pure energetic evaluation, it was observed that the best performance was shown by CPO-27-Ni that exhibits also an initial adsorption enthalpy of -13.5 kJ mol-1, the highest yet observed for a MOF. Unfortunately, upon comparison of the hydrogen amounts stored at high pressure, the hydrogen capacities in these conditions are mostly dependent on the surface area and total pore volume of the material. This means that if control of MOF surface area can benefit the total stored amounts, only the presence of a great number of strong adsorption sites can make the (P, T) storage conditions more economically favorable. These observations lead to the prediction that efficient H2 storage by physisorption can be obtained by increasing the surface density of strong adsorption sites. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Hydrogen; Metals; Nonmetals; Metal sites; Hydrogen storage; hydrogen; metal; metal complex; nickel; organic compound; adsorption; article; energy transfer; enthalpy; hydrogen bond; infrared spectrometry; porosity; pressure; surface property; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46049090198

Brown adipose tissue is specialized for heat production by non-shivering thermo genesis and metabolism of this fat doesn't produce ATP. Whereas the white adipose tissue serves as a major energy reservoir and stores triacylglycerols in periods of energy excess and mobilizes the same during energy deprived states. White adipocytes are the major secretory cells of adipose tissue, making it a key endocrine organ. Adipocytes secrete a number of hormones and diverse range of protein factors termed as adipokines, which are collectively involved in metabolic regulation and are linked to pathogenesis of obesity. Adiponectin is the most abundant protein produced by adipose tissue, and it plays a negative feedback role in fat storage. Adiponectin is an endogenous anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic factor that is protective against insulin resistance and macroangiopathy. It has been seen that low circulating serum adiponectin levels correlate strongly with increasing BMI, obesity and insulin resistance. Leptin was one of the earliest adipokines to be identified as the product of ob gene in mice. Primary target of leptin is the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and its systemic response is inhibition of food intake and an increase in overall energy expenditure. Apart from these hormones, adipocytes also secrete a number of cytokines and acute phase proteins, thus leading to increase in the circulating levels of inflammation related factors. This lead to emergence of the concept that obesity is a state of chronic mild inflammation and this inflammatory state plays a causal role in development of Type-2 Diabetes and metabolic syndrome in obese individuals.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959572633

Several accidents during processing, storage and transportation have been reported in Indian fireworks manufacturing units. In this paper, the analysis of 70 case histories of fatal accidents reported during 1994 - 2006 in Tamil Nadu, India is presented. The analysis showed that most of the fatal accidents in fireworks industry occurred in filling and mixing sections. Mechanical effects and chemical reactivity are found to be major contributors to accidents. Hot weather is one another major contributing factors. This showed that fireworks chemicals are susceptible to thermal stimuli. The analysis also brought to notice that processing of flash compositions and rocket mixtures are more hazardous than other pyrotechnic mixtures. For the first time, an intensive Job Safety Analysis (JSA) was carried out for various unit operations such as weighing, sieving, mixing, filling, fuse cutting, drying and finishing activity of fireworks manufacturing. The study explored the various possible hazards during manual processing and handling of fireworks mixtures. It was evaluated that during normal processing of fireworks the chemical mixture can be subjected to a frictional load and impact energy of 17.2 N and 19.6 J respectively. On comparing this value with the reported friction and impact sensitivity data, it could be found that the fireworks mixtures carry with them the risk of fire and explosion as a consequence of abnormal operations like excess force exertion, mishandling, dropping of utensils / tools, slip and fall.","Accident analysis; Fireworks; Frictional stimulus; Impact stimulus; Job safety analysis; Pyrotechnics","Accidents; Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Chemical reactivity; Explosions; Fault tree analysis; Forestry; Friction; Manufacture; Mixtures; Reliability; Security systems; Accident analysis; Fireworks; Frictional stimulus; Impact stimulus; Job safety analysis; Pyrotechnics; Hazardous materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62649087993

The water-soluble CMCD-capped ZnO:MgO nanocrystals emit strongly in the visible region (450 - 680 nm) on excitation by UV radiation and are stable over extended periods and over a range of pH values. The integrity of the cyclodextrin cavities is preserved on capping and retains their capability for complexation of hydrophobic species in aqueous solutions. Here we report the use of the water-soluble cyclodextrin-capped ZnO:MgO nanocrystals as energy donors for fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies. The organic dye Nile Red has been included within the anchored cyclodextrin cavities to form a noncovalent CMCD ZnO:MgO - Nile Red assembly in aqueous solution. Significant Nile Red fluorescence at 640 nm is observed on band gap excitation of the ZnO:MgO in the UV, indicating efficient resonance energy transfer (RET) from the nanocrystals to the included dye. The number of acceptor molecules interacting with a single donor in the CMCD ZnO: MgO - Nile Red assembly may be altered by controlling the filling up of the anchored cavities by Nile Red, leading to a variation in the efficiency of resonance energy transfer. The donor - acceptor distance was estimated from the efficiency measurements. The Nile Red emission following RET shows a pronounced thermochromic shift suggesting the possible use of the CMCD ZnO:MgO - Nile Red assembly as thermometers in aqueous solutions. © 2008 American Chemical Society.","Carboxymethyl β-cyclodextrin-capped; Nile Red; Resonance energy transfer; Trap-state emission; Water-soluble ZnO:MgO nanocrystals","Chlorine compounds; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Fluorescence; Light emission; Luminescence; Nanocrystalline alloys; Nanocrystals; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Reliability; Resonance; Reusability; Semiconducting zinc compounds; Solutions; Ultraviolet radiation; Zinc alloys; Acceptor molecules; Aqueous medium; Aqueous solutions; Band-gap excitation; Carboxy methyl; Core shells; Cyclo dextrin; Cyclodextrin cavities; Donor acceptors; Efficiency measurements; Energy donors; Fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Guest molecules; Hydrophobic species; Nile Red; Nile Red fluorescence; Organic dyes; P H values; Resonance energy transfer; Trap-state emission; UV radiation; Visible regions; Water-soluble ZnO:MgO nanocrystals; Zinc oxide; beta cyclodextrin; beta cyclodextrin derivative; magnesium oxide; nanomaterial; nile red; oxazine derivative; water; zinc oxide; article; chemistry; conformation; crystallization; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; macromolecule; materials testing; methodology; nanotechnology; particle size; surface property; ultrastructure; beta-Cyclodextrins; Crystallization; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Macromolecular Substances; Magnesium Oxide; Materials Testing; Molecular Conformation; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Oxazines; Particle Size; Surface Properties; Water; Zinc Oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49249128083

These variabilities mean that an innovative tool and framework are required to characterize modern memory devices running in embedded system architectures. We introduce an energy measurement and characterization platform for memory devices, and demonstrate an application to multilevel-cell (MLC) flash memories, in which we discover significant value-dependent programming energy variations. We introduce an energy-aware data compression method that minimizes the flash programming energy, rather than the size of the compressed data, which is formulated as an entropy coding with unequal bit-pattern costs. Deploying a probabilistic approach, we derive energy-optimal bit-pattern probabilities and expected values of the bit-pattern costs which are applicable to the large amounts of compressed data typically found in multimedia applications. Then we develop an energy-optimal prefix coding that uses integer linear programming, and construct a prefix-code table. From a consideration of Pareto-optimal energy consumption, we can make tradeoffs between data size and programming energy, such as a 41% energy savings for a 52% area overhead. © 2008 ACM.","Compression; Flash memory; MLC","Data storage equipment; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Flash memory; Integer programming; Integrated circuits; Linear programming; Linearization; Probability; Risk assessment; Terminology; Area overhead; Compression; Compression methods; Data size; Data values; Embedded system architectures; Energy characterization; Energy consumption; Energy measurements; Energy savings; Energy variations; Energy-aware; Entropy coding; Expected values; Flash programming energy; Integer Linear Programming; MLC; Multimedia applications; Pareto-optimal; Probabilistic approaches; Running-in; Data compression",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48849086567

Two types of filters with significantly different bandwidth and separation of two passbands are implemented and the measured results are very consistent with the theoretical predictions, sufficiently validating the proposed design methodology and filter configuration.

This solution takes advantage of power switch commutations to recharge periodically a storage capacitor, and then to create the necessary floating power supply, useful for many power electronic converters. It is a low cost solution that can be integrated, but it presents some disadvantages: the storage capacitor must be adjusted with respect to the ON state time duration, and a permanent ON state operation is forbidden. Moreover, with the existing solution, a low frequency operation is problematic, because a large storage capacitor would be required. The proposed work presents here an improvement of the solution, in order to a allow flexible or even permanent ON state time duration operation of a self powered metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor, using few additional elements. This solution exhibits unexpected and fairly good efficiency levels and presents a high ability for a simple implementation and monolithic integration. Added to these new features, smaller values for the storage capacitor can be used for this self powered driver power supply, allowing from very low up to high frequency operation and high duty cycle operation.

The proposed charge balance method is implemented with analog components and is cheaper and more effective than its digital counterparts since complex arithmetic and sampling delay is eliminated. The proposed controller will consistently cause the Buck converter to recover from an arbitrary load transient with the smallest possible voltage deviation in the shortest possible settling time. Since the controller is nonlinear during transient conditions, it is not limited by bandwidth/switching frequency. Unlike conventional linear controllers, the dynamic response (voltage deviation, settling time) of the proposed controller can be estimated using a set of equations.

The load regulation of the proposed converter can be achieved by controlling the ripple of the resonant voltage across the primary resonant capacitor with a bidirectional auxiliary circuit, while the main switches are operating at a fixed duty ratio and fixed switching frequency. Hence, the waveforms of the currents can be expected to be optimized from the view-point of conduction loss. Furthermore, the proposed converter has good zero-voltage switching (ZVS) capability, simple control circuits, no hign-voltage ringing problem of rectifier diodes, no dc offset of the magnetizing current and low-voltage stresses of power switches. Thus, the proposed converter shows higher efficiency than that of a half-bridge LLC resonant converter under light load condition. Although it shows the lower efficiency at heavy load, because of the increased power loss in auxiliary circuit, it still shows the high efficiency around 94%. In this paper, operational principles, features of the proposed converter, and analysis and design considerations are presented.

This may potentially lead to subsynchronous-resonance (SSR) issues. Although SSR is a well-understood phenomenon that can be mitigated with flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices, scant information is available on the SSR problem in a series-compensated wind farm. This paper reports the potential occurrence and mitigation of SSR caused by an induction-generator (IG) effect as well as torsional interactions, in a series-compensated wind farm. SSR suppression is achieved as an additional advantage of FACTS controllers which may already be installed in the power system for achieving other objectives. In this study, a wind farm employing a self-excited induction generator is connected to the grid through a series-compensated line. A static var compensator (SVC) with a simple voltage regulator is first employed at the IG terminal in addition to the fixed shunt capacitor for dynamic reactive power support. The same SVC is shown to effectively damp SSR when equipped with an SSR damping controller. Also, a thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) that is actually installed to increase the power transfer capability of the transmission line is also shown to damp subsynchronous oscillations when provided with closed-loop current control. While both FACTS controllers-the SVC and TCSC-can effectively mitigate SSR, the performance of TCSC is shown to be superior. Extensive simulations have been carried out using EMTDC/PSCAD to validate the performance of SVC and TCSC in damping SSR. © 2008 IEEE.","Flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS); Self-excited induction generator (SEIG); Series compensation; Static VAR compensator (SVC); Subsynchronous resonance (SSR); Thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC); Wind power systems","Asynchronous generators; Capacitance; Capacitors; Damping; Dielectric devices; Electric control equipment; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric network topology; Electric potential; Electric power factor; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Electric switchgear; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Farms; Induction motors; Lead; Power converters; Power electronics; Power transmission; Renewable energy resources; Resonance; Semiconductor relays; Voltage regulators; Wind power; Bulk power; Closed loops; Damping controllers; Electrical networks; EMTDC/PSCAD; Extensive simulations; FACTS controllers; Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS); Power systems; Power transfer capability; Rapid growth; Reactive power support; Self excited induction generator (SEIG); Shunt capacitors; Static Var compensator (SVC); Sub-Synchronous Resonance (SSR); Subsynchronous oscillation (SSO); Thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC); Torsional interactions; Transmission line (TL); Wind farms; Wind power systems; Linguistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47149099619

The developed Pareto optimization tool generates a Pareto frontier plot to visualize the design tradeoffs between the multiple objectives. The effectiveness of the tool is demonstrated through a design example that selects optimal values for the dc-bus capacitor and the control settings of a STATCOM. © 2008 IEEE.","Electromagnetic transient simulation; Optimization; Pareto optimality; Second-order sensitivity analysis; Selective harmonic elimination; Sensitivity analysis; STATCOM","Channel capacity; Computer simulation; Concurrency control; Control system analysis; Control theory; Damping; Electric currents; Electric power transmission; Electromagnetism; Energy storage; Military data processing; Nonlinear programming; Optimal systems; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Pareto principle; Power converters; Power electronics; Uncertainty analysis; Analysis methods; Bus capacitors; Control parameters; Control settings; Design trade offs; Electromagnetic transient simulation; Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS); Gradient-based; Harmonic elimination; Multiple design objectives; Multiple objectives; Non-linear optimizations; Optimal designs; Optimal solutions; Optimal values; Parameter uncertainties; Pareto frontiers; Pareto-optimization; Power networks; Pulse width (PW); Second order sensitivity; Simulation-based; Simulation-based design (SBD); STATCOM (static shunt compensator); Support tools; Switching angles; Voltage-source-converter (VSC); Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47149097832

The attractiveness of this approach, referred to here as a ""wind-hydrogen strategy"", is analysed using a cost-benefit approach to evaluate the final impact at the level of the end-consumer when this strategy is implemented. The analysis is conducted for four scenarios, based on different levels of: wind energy penetration in the electricity network area, hydrogen energy price, and environmental taxation on fuels. The effect of technological learning on the outcome is also analysed for the period up to 2050. The results of the analysis indicate that the relative value of the wind energy in the electricity market compared to the hydrogen market is a deciding factor in the attractiveness of the strategy; here the wind energy penetration in the network is a key consideration. Finally, in order to exploit learning effects from linking European wind and hydrogen sectors, action would need to be taken in the short term. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Balancing cost; Cost-benefit; Energy storage; Hydrogen; Renewable energy; Wind","Administrative data processing; Energy conversion; Finance; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Management information systems; Network management; Photoacoustic effect; Public key cryptography; Renewable energy resources; Taxation; Wind effects; Benefit assessments; common strategy; Electricity markets; Electricity networks; Environmental taxation; European; Hydrogen Energy; In order; International association; Learning effects; Management costs; Relative value; short term; Technological learning; Wind energy; Wind energy conversion (WEC); Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47049122443

For this, the degree of decomposition as well as the microbial activity and microbial composition of the resulting products after the active phase of composting and vermicomposting were analysed. None of the treatments significantly reduced the dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen contents relative to the control, and therefore more time may be required for stabilization. Nevertheless, the lowest values of microbial biomass and activity corresponded to the earthworm-worked substrates, in which fungal growth was also promoted; the combined treatment (composting + vermicomposting) was the most effective in terms of stabilizing the cattle manure. Moreover, earthworms promoted the retention of nitrogen and gradual release of P, as well as a reduction in electrical conductivity, thereby producing improved substrates for agricultural use. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In the healthy heart the ratio of glucose and LCFA oxidation is sensitively balanced and chronic alterations in this substrate mix are closely associated with cardiac dysfunction. While it has been accepted for several years that cardiac glucose uptake is mediated by facilitated transport, i.e. by means of the glucose transport proteins GLUT1 and GLUT4, only in the last few years it has become clear that proteins with high-affinity binding sites to LCFA, referred to as LCFA transporters, are responsible for bulk LCFA uptake. Similar to the GLUTs, the LCFA transporters CD36 and FABPpm can be recruited from an intracellular storage compartment to the sarcolemma to increase the rate of substrate uptake. Permanent relocation of LCFA transporters, mainly CD36, from intracellular stores to the sarcolemma is accompanied by accumulation of lipids and lipid metabolites in the heart. As a consequence, insulin signalling and glucose utilization are impaired, leading to decreased contractile activity of the heart. These observations underline the particular role and interplay of substrate carriers for glucose and LCFA in modulating cardiac metabolism, and the development of heart failure. The signalling and trafficking pathways and subcellular machinery regulating translocation of glucose and LCFA transporters are beginning to be unravelled. More knowledge on substrate transporter recycling, especially the similarities and differences between glucose and LCFA transporters, is expected to enable novel therapies aimed at changing the subcellular distribution of glucose and LCFA transporters, thereby manipulating the substrate preference of the diseased heart to help restore cardiac function. © The Author 2008.","Cardiac hypertrophy; Cardiomyocytes; CD36; Diabetic cardiomyopathy; GLUT4; Sarcolemmal transport","adenylate kinase; CD36 antigen; fatty acid binding protein; glucose; glucose transporter 1; glucose transporter 4; insulin; long chain fatty acid; protein kinase B; cardiomyopathy; cell membrane transport; diabetes mellitus; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid transport; glucose transport; heart hypertrophy; heart muscle contractility; heart muscle fiber membrane; human; nonhuman; priority journal; review; sarcolemma; signal transduction; transport kinetics; Animals; Biological Transport; Disease Models, Animal; Fatty Acid Transport Proteins; Glucose; Heart Diseases; Humans; Sarcolemma; Signal Transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46749141313

The principle of the interface is based on the use of a relaxation oscillator. A negative-feedback circuit controls the charge-transfer speed to prevent the overload of the input amplifier for large input signals which thus enables a wide dynamic range of capacitor values. Moreover, it has been shown that the use of negative feedback can also result in much better noise performance. However, for the interface to function properly, there is a serious limitation for the value of a specific parasitic capacitance. Therefore, a method which extends the acceptable range of this parasitic capacitance is proposed. A novel method of linearity measurement which takes the influence of PCB parasitic capacitances into account, is also presented. The circuit has been designed and implemented in 0.7 μm standard CMOS technology. The supply voltage is 5 V and the measured value for the supply current is about 1.4 mA. Experimental results show that for the capacitor range of 1 pF to 300 pF, application of negative feedback yields a linearity of about 50 × 10 -6 (14 bits) with a 16-bit resolution for a measurement time of 100 ms.

Most obese patients are unable to sustain appreciable weight loss; the body has a natural tendency to return to its previous weight. Although bariatric surgery is effective, it is not without risk. Until better treatments for obesity are available, management remains focused on lifestyle changes, drug therapy, and treating the metabolic complications of obesity. The main cause of metabolic dysfunction in obesity is visceral fat. Fat deposition in and around organs, skeletal muscle, and other tissues is thought to occur when subcutaneous adipose tissue stores are full. Creation of additional adipose-tissue stores is prevented by the mature adipocytes, which inhibit the differentiation of preadipocytes in a negative feedback loop. This inhibition is mediated, in part, by the renin-angiotensin system. Indeed, angiotensin II blockade has been shown to promote adipogenesis in vitro. Clinical studies are currently underway to investigate whether the angiotensin-II-receptor blocker telmisartan can stimulate adipogenesis, with the aim of diverting intramuscular fat back into adipose tissue and thereby restoring insulin sensitivity. If this effect can be demonstrated in humans, this type of agent might become the treatment of choice for obese or overweight people at risk of type 2 diabetes.",,"angiotensin; angiotensin II; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antiobesity agent; cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist; ghrelin; hydrochlorothiazide plus telmisartan; hydrochlorothiazide plus valsartan; insulin; lipid; placebo; renin; rimonabant; serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor; sibutramine; telmisartan; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; bariatric surgery; biliopancreatic bypass; caloric restriction; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cell differentiation; cell maturation; clinical trial; conference paper; diabetes mellitus; drug choice; drug dose comparison; drug megadose; dyslipidemia; energy expenditure; environmental factor; food intake; gastric banding; heredity; human; hypertension; in vitro study; inhibition kinetics; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intraabdominal fat; lifestyle modification; lipid storage; metabolic syndrome X; negative feedback; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pathogenesis; patient counseling; physical activity; priority journal; proadipocyte; risk assessment; skeletal muscle; social aspect; stomach bypass; subcutaneous tissue; treatment outcome; waist hip ratio; weight reduction; Adipogenesis; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers; Bariatric Surgery; Benzimidazoles; Benzoates; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome X; Obesity; Risk Factors; Weight Loss",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46649093194

The generation and exploitation of new knowledge, both tacit and explicit, through the process of socialization, articulation, combination and internalization (see Nonaka and Takeuchi, The Knowledge-Creating Company) is essential to enable innovation of processes and products of ""local"" firms. Our recent Foresight exercises in the metal working and machinery district of Lecco and in the silk district of Como show that Foresight can play an important role in creating and exploiting new knowledge, and that different methodologies can be more or less effective to this aim. Critical technology list and interactive workshops, with the participation of entrepreneurs of SMEs and technologists, are more suited to foster the transfer of technologies that have overcome the initial stage of the life cycle and that have been already applied in other sectors. However, when radical innovations are needed in order to face the challenges posed by global competition, other methodologies, as Scenarios, are more appropriate. Even if these approaches are complex and time and resource consuming, they may be very effective in actively involving the most relevant private and public stakeholders of a district, and in making them to envisage the long term future of the economic, social, and cultural structure of their district. In this way Foresight drives the small entrepreneurs, the district stakeholders and the medium and large size firms to play the critical roles of Nonaka and Takeuchi's ""frontline employees"", ""senior managers"" and ""middle managers"" in their ""knowledge creating company"": the first ones grasp what the district is; the second ones build the vision of what it ought to be; the third ones, serve as a bridge between the future and the present. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Among of the devices, the superlattice-base device exhibits a highest collector current, a highest current gain and a lowest base-emitter turn-on voltage attributed to the increased charge storage of minority carriers in the InGaAs/GaAs superlattice-base region by tunneling behavior. The relatively low turn-on voltage can reduce the operating voltage and collector-emitter offset voltage for low power consumption in circuit applications. However, as to the quantum-well base device, the electrons injecting into the InGaAs well are blocked by the p+-GaAs bulk base and it causes a great quantity of electron storage within the small energy-gap n-type GaAs emitter layer, which significantly increases the base recombination current as well as degrades the collector current and current gain. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Massonnet, (Applicant), Satellite, method and a fleet of satellites for observing a celestial body, Patent 0509-1112, 2006. [1]; D. Massonnet, (Déposant), Satellite, procédé et flotte de satellites d'observation d'un corps céleste, Priorité 04-04327, 2004. [2]]. The concept can be applied to any wavelength (radar, visible and infrared) in passive or active mode (for the latter the suspended part also includes a transmitter). The concept is characterized by its simplicity and performances. We illustrate it in the optical domain by describing a constellation composed of 10-15 kg nanosatellites without propulsion and an attitude control passively obtained by gravity gradient. The elementary satellite does not include a computer nor any storage for energy or data. All satellites transmit their data using the same frequency band, gathered on the ground by stations within the visibility circle. The system works by saturation: with 100 satellites (total constellation mass of 1500 kg) each with 20-km swath width and capable of a resolution on the order of the metre, the probability to reach any point on the equator in less than 24 h is 53%. At the latitude of Paris, the probability reaches 68%. With 200 similar satellites, these probabilities are 78% and 90%, respectively. Without propulsion and taking into account the possible roll of the suspended part, the position of the acquired imagery is precisely known only after reception. This leads to new architectures for the ground segment: orders are placed within an archive very frequently updated. In addition, several satellites may be simultaneously visible from a given station, which should ideally have several antennas. Among other features, the system is extremely robust (very simple satellites in great number) and in practice invulnerable. The uplink is drastically reduced: the satellites turn on as soon as they are sufficiently illuminated by the sun; the reflector is easily made wide enough to achieve metre resolution from low altitude, whereas the length of the ""suspending rods"" allows a large focal length that in turn forgives length errors. Without propulsion the choice of orbital altitude is limited to less than 600 km or more than 2000 km in order to observe space debris regulations. In folded position, the satellite is essentially no more bulky than its reflector that has the solar array fixed on the non-reflecting side. Even a small launcher is capable of injecting a few tens of these satellites into orbit. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept exploits a lightweight film made of shape memory material directly interacting with sunlight. A temperature variation cycle in the film is created by inducing periodic variation of the tether sun aspect angle. As the film length diminishes due to the increased temperature, the mechanical energy of the system increases and can be used to charge an energy storage device. A preliminary assessment of the system efficiency and power density is conducted. It is seen that in spite of the relatively low efficiency-for present shape memory alloys-of the phase transformation the system can benefit from a very high ratio between collecting surface and overall mass, which could make it an interesting alternative to photovoltaic systems for space power plans in the future. Current limitations appear to be in the design of an efficient power conversion and incident light modulation system. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, it allows the comparison among systems and offers enough and reliable information to consumers and manufacturers. In most developing countries, an official national standard for SDWHS is not available, therefore it is necessary to adopt an international test procedure in which the cost and time of implementation is very important. In this work, a simple and inexpensive test method to determine the thermal behavior of SDWHS is proposed. Even though these procedure tests do not have an official standard structure they permit, by comparing different solar systems under identical solar, ambient, and initial conditions, the experimental determination of: (a) the maximum available volume of water for solar heating; (b) water temperature increment and available thermal energy at the end of the day; (c) temperature profiles (stratification) and the average temperature in the storage tank after it is homogenized; (d) the average global thermal efficiency; (e) water temperature decrement and energy lost overnight; and (f) the relationship between hot water volume and solar collector area as function of the average heating temperature. An additional proposed test permits to know the heat losses caused by the reverse flow in the collector loop. These tests will be carried out independently of the configuration between the solar collector and the storage tank, the way the fluid circulates and the type of thermal exchange. The results of this procedure test can be very useful, firstly, for the local solar manufacturers' equipment in order to design and optimize its products comparing their systems against a reference system under identical test conditions and secondly, by the consumers in order to select the most suitable system. The resulting experimental data for a particular thermosiphon system is presented and discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The fuel cell system (FCS), based on a 20 kW PEM stack, was integrated into the power train comprising DC-DC converter, Pb batteries as energy storage systems and asynchronous electric drive of 30 kW. As reference vehicle a minibus for public transportation in historical centres was adopted. A preliminary experimental analysis was conducted on the FCS connected to a resistive load through a DC-DC converter, in order to verify the stack dynamic performance varying its power acceleration from 0.5 kW s-1 to about 4 kW s-1. The experiments on the power train were conducted on a test bench able to simulate the vehicle parameters and road characteristics on specific driving cycles, in particular the European R40 cycle was adopted as reference. The ""soft hybrid"" configuration, which permitted the utilization of a minimum size energy storage system and implied the use of FCS mainly in dynamic operation, was compared with the ""hard hybrid"" solution, characterized by FCS operation at limited power in stationary conditions. Different control strategies of power flows between fuel cells, electric energy storage system and electric drive were adopted in order to verify the two above hybrid approaches during the vehicle mission, in terms of efficiencies of individual components and of the overall power train. The FCS was able to support the dynamic requirements typical of R40 cycle, but an increase of air flow rate during the fastest acceleration phases was necessary, with only a slight reduction of FCS efficiency. The FCS efficiency resulted comprised between 45 and 48%, while the overall power train efficiency reached 30% in conditions of constant stack power during the driving cycle. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

High temperature solar receivers are in the development stage hopefully leading to the use of solarized gas turbines or of solar combined cycles. These systems are analyzed and taken as a reference standard. Binary alkali-metal steam cycles are shown to be intrinsically more efficient than combined cycles owing to their fully condensing nature. Even at top temperatures of about 600 °C typical for steam cycles the binary cycle allows, in principle, a significant efficiency gain (49.5% against 43% of a steam cycle). However, the binary high temperature systems are investigated featuring either a direct vaporization of the metal within the receiver or a liquid receiver cooling loop with the working fluid vaporized in a proper heat exchanger. With reference to the second option, the computed efficiency is 56% at a top cooling loop temperature of 1000 °C (the same efficiency is attained in a direct vaporization loop at 720 °C). A 60% thermal efficiency is within the potential of the technology. The above figures can be compared with a combined cycle efficiency of 50% at 1200 °C turbine inlet temperature. Available alkali metals are reviewed for the use of working fluid: potassium being the best known fluid but rubidium (or cesium) offering, in perspective, a better overall performance. Material problems connected with the containment of alkali metals at high temperature are reviewed. Experimental evidence suggests that up to 800-850 °C stainless steel is an adequate material, while for higher temperatures, up to 1200 °C, refractory metals should be used. With reference to heat storage the availability of appropriate high temperature substances either as liquids or as melting solids, storing energy as sensible or as latent heat respectively, is discussed. Finally the critical issue of metal vapour turbine design is considered. The results of a number of computations are presented giving the basic geometrical data of some potassium, rubidium and cesium expanders. Rotor diameters tend to be comparatively large. With reference to a 50 MW overall plant output the maximum tip diameter is 3.9 m for a potassium and 2.8 m for a rubidium turbine. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

HIPEF and heat treated tomato juices showed higher lycopene and lower vitamin C levels than the untreated juice. However, no significant changes in the total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity were observed between treated and fresh juices just after processing. Lycopene, vitamin C and antioxidant capacity of both treated and untreated juices decreased exponentially during storage following a first order kinetics (R2 = 0.763-0.987), whereas tomato juices maintained their initial phenolic content. HIPEF-treated tomato juice maintained higher lycopene and vitamin C content than the thermally treated juices during the storage time. Hence, the application of HIPEF may be appropriate to achieve nutritious and fresh like tomato juice.

When wind power is added to an electrical grid consisting of thermal and hydropower plants, it increases system variability and results in a need for additional peak-load, gas-fired generators. Our empirical application using load data for Alberta's electrical grid shows that costs of wind-generated electricity vary from $37 per MWh to $68/MWh, and depend primarily on the wind profiles of installed turbines. Costs of reducing CO2 emissions are estimated to be $41-$56 per t CO2. When pumped hydro storage is introduced in the system or the capacity of the water reservoirs is enhanced, the hydropower facility could provide most of the peak load requirements obviating the need to build large peak-load gas generators. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Commonly, athletes are diagnosed as iron deficient, however, contrasting evidence exists as to the severity of deficiency and the effect on performance. Iron losses can result from a host of mechanisms during exercise such as hemolysis, hematuria, sweating and gastrointestinal bleeding. Additionally, recent research investigating the anemia of inflammation during states of chronic disease has allowed us to draw some comparisons between unhealthy populations and athletes. The acute-phase response is a well-recognised reaction to both exercise and disease. Elevated cytokine levels from such a response have been shown to increase the liver production of the hormone Hepcidin. Hepcidin up-regulation has a negative impact on the iron transport and absorption channels within the body, and may explain a potential new mechanism behind iron deficiency in athletes. This review will attempt to explore the current literature that exits in this new area of iron metabolism and exercise. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Athlete; Hepcidin; Interleukin-6; Iron deficiency","acute phase protein; cytokine; hepcidin; hormone; acute phase response; anemia; athlete; chronic disease; disease severity; exercise; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; hematuria; hemolysis; hormonal regulation; hormone action; hormone synthesis; human; inflammation; iron absorption; iron deficiency; iron depletion; iron metabolism; iron storage; iron transport; physical performance; priority journal; protein blood level; review; sweating; training; upregulation; Anemia, Iron-Deficiency; Animals; Cytokines; Hormones; Humans; Inflammation; Sports; Sports Medicine",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43149103390

With a very high theoretical capacity (4200 mAh g-1) at low voltage, silicon is presented as a very interesting potential candidate as negative electrode for lithium-ion microbatteries. For the first time, the electrochemical lithium alloying/de-alloying process is proven to occur, respectively, at 0.15 V/0.45 V vs. Li+/Li with Si nanowires (SiNWs, 200-300 nm in diameter) synthesized by chemical vapour deposition. This new three-dimensional architecture material is well suited to accommodate the expected large volume expansion due to the reversible formation of Li-Si alloys. At present, stable capacity over ten to twenty cycles is demonstrated. The storage capacity is shown to increase with the growth temperature by a factor 3 as the temperature varies from 525 to 575 °C.

Analytical solutions for finding the interface locations at various time steps are obtained. Transient interface positions and complete phase change time is predicted by two models for solidification and by three models for melting. To validate the analytical results, experiments are carried out to find the transient positions of the front. The agreement was found to be good for model with conduction and heat generation in solidification process, but in melting the model with conduction, convection and heat generation gives a better prediction. Validated analytical model is extended to study the phase change behavior and heat transfer characteristics inside PCM. Presence of heat generation increases the total solidification time of the cylinder, though it accelerates melting. Total solidification time depends on Stefan number and heat generation parameter β, whereas complete melting time depends on equivalent thermal conductivity. This paper also analyzes the behavior of three paraffins, 60% n-tetradecane + 40% n-hexadecane, n-tetradecane, and n-pentadecane.

Given the high capital costs, low-penetration wind-diesel systems have been typically found not to be economic. High-penetration wind-diesel systems have the benefit of increased economies of scale, and displacing significant amounts of diesel fuel, but have the disadvantage of not being able to capture all of the electricity that is generated when the wind turbines operate at rated capacity. Two representative models of typical remote Canadian communities were created using HOMER, an NREL micro-power simulator to model how a generic energy storage system could help improve the economics of a high-penetration wind-diesel system. Key variables that affect the optimum system are average annual wind speed, cost of diesel fuel, installed cost of storage and a storage systems overall efficiency. At an avoided cost of diesel fuel of 0.30 $Cdn/kWh and current installed costs, wind generators are suitable in remote Canadian communities only when an average annual wind speed of at least 6.0 m/s is present. Wind energy storage systems become viable to consider when average annual wind speeds approach 7.0 m/s, if the installed cost of the storage system is less than 1000 $Cdn/kW and it is capable of achieving at least a 75% overall energy conversion efficiency. In such cases, energy storage system can enable an additional 50% of electricity from wind turbines to be delivered. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However these approximations can lead to less than optimal operating conditions and hence reduce considerably the performances of the PV system. This paper proposes a new approach to determine the maximum power point (MPP) based on measurements of the open-circuit voltage of the PV modules, and a nonlinear expression for the optimal operating voltage is developed based on this open-circuit voltage. The approach is thus a combination of the nonlinear and perturbation and observation (P&O) methods. The experimental results show that the approach improves clearly the tracking efficiency of the maximum power available at the output of the PV modules. The new method reduces the oscillations around the MPP, and increases the average efficiency of the MPPT obtained. The new MPPT method will deliver more power to any generic load or energy storage media. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Coupled hydro-geological-thermal simulation of the storage system is essential to provide an optimized configuration of boreholes and operation schedule for the thermal storage system on the site. This paper presents numerical investigations and thermohydraulic evaluation of open borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) system operating under cyclic flow regime. A three-dimensional numerical model for groundwater flow and heat transport is used to determine the annual variation of recovery temperature from the borehole thermal energy storage. The model includes the effects of convection and conduction heat transfer, heat loss to the adjacent confining strata, and hydraulic anisotropy. The operation scenario consists of cyclic injection and recovery after holding interval and four periods per year to simulate the seasonal temperature conditions. For different parameters of the system, performances were compared in terms of extraction temperature. The calculated water temperature at the producing pipe remains relatively constant within a certain range through the year. Heat loss, injection/production rate, and geometrical configuration of boreholes and aquifer used in the model are shown to impact the predicted temperature profiles at each stage and the recovery water temperature. However, injection temperature and hydraulic anisotropy have a less significant effect on the performance of BTES systems. Absolute permeability does not affect the temperature, but is inversely proportional to the injection pressure.","Borehole thermal energy storage (BTES); Cyclic flow regime; Modeling; Thermal energy storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46749113949

Our approach has been to assemble extended solids from bent flexible arenedicarboxylate linkers that offer totally new topologies with helical channels. A new family of Rare-earth Polymeric Framework (RPF-4) has been obtained and its structure solved. The framework is formed by a Lanthanide (Ln) matrix, with the Ln atoms well separated in two directions. The crystals are highly stable in air and the decomposition temperature is above 350°C. Under UV excitation, the linker presents a bluish-white emission peaking around 450 nm. The emission corresponding to the different crystals either present an emission similar to the linker, slightly modified depending on R, or an intense emission due to Ln localized crystal field transitions. In the second case, an energy transfer from the linker to the Ln ions, which relax radiatively with a very efficient emission, seems to occur. The observed emission properties and crystal stability are of interest for applications as light emitting materials. The peculiarities of the structure may avoid the concentration quenching of the luminescence since Ln ions form well separated chains along a-axis with interchain distances around 12.5 Å.","MOF; OLED; Photoluminescence; Raman; Structure","Charged particles; Crystallography; Crystals; Electrolysis; Electrons; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Farm buildings; Light; Light emission; Materials properties; Metals; Photonics; Pigments; Quenching; Rare earth elements; Solids; block approach; Concentration quenching; Crystal field (CF) transitions; Crystal stability; decomposition temperatures; Efficient emission; Emission properties; Emitting materials; Helical channels; Intense emission; Interchain distances; Lanthanide(III); Light emitting materials; Organic optoelectronics; Rare earths; Synthesis (of chiral ionic liquids); UV excitations; White emissions; Powders",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45749098979

However, the quantitative limitation of active site has been poorly discussed until today. In this experiment, nitric acid (2 M and 14 M) was introduced at 90 °C over different periods of time to oxidate the well-aligned multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), which were synthesized directly using carbon cloth (CC) as the substance. Quinoidal functional groups on active CNTs, such as -COOH and -OH, were found to be the result of chemical reaction. Pt catalyst, which was extracted from H2PtCl6 · 6H2O, was deposited onto the carbon nanotubes using electroless plating in chloroplatinic acid solution. The extent of Pt adsorption was measured and was substantially larger than the as-prepared CNTs. It was found that the state of quantitative limitation existed in both 2 M and 14 M systems. A model was also developed to illustrate the limitation in the active site due to the chemical oxidation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The haze formation of inorganic sources is promoted for growing defect size by the exposure energy in time. The other is organics that are prevalent Fab and storage environment.

However, the scale down of CMOS technology allows the integration of other functions. In this paper, we proposed a CMOS ROIC involving a pixel-level analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for 320 × 240 microbolometer FPAs. Such integration would improve the performance of a ROIC at the reduced system cost and power consumption. The noise performance of a microbolometer is improved by using the pixelwise readout structure because integration time can be increased up to 1ms. A Pixel circuit is consisted of a background skimming circuit, a differential amplifier, an integration capacitor and a 10-bit DRAM. First, the microbolometer current is integrated for 1ms after the skimming current correction. The differential amplifier operates as an op-Amp and the integration capacitor makes negative feedback loop between an output and a negative input of the op-Amp. And then, the integrated signal voltage is converted to digital signals using a modified single slope ADC in a pixel when the differential amplifier operates as a comparator and the 10-bit DRAM stores values of a counter. This readout circuit is designed and fabricated using a standard 0.35μm 2-poly 4-metal CMOS technology.","Microbolometer; Pixel-level ADC; Pixelwise; Readout integrated circuit; Uncooled infrared detector","Bandpass amplifiers; Bolometers; Capacitance; Capacitors; CMOS integrated circuits; Computer networks; Control theory; Dielectric devices; Differential amplifiers; Digital arithmetic; Dynamic random access storage; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric potential; Electronics industry; Energy storage; Feedback; Focal plane arrays; Focusing; Imaging techniques; Infrared radiation; Integrated circuits; Integration; Microelectronics; Microfluidics; Multicarrier modulation; Multitasking; Networks (circuits); Standards; Technology; (min ,max ,+) functions; Analog to digital converter (ADC); CMOS technologies; digital signals; Focal plane arrays (FPAs); Infrared technologies; Integration time (IT); Micro(uncooled) bolometer; Negative feedback loop; noise performances; Pixel circuits; Pixel level ADC; Power consumption (CE); Read Out Integrated Circuit (ROIC); Read out integrated circuits (ROIC); Read-out circuit; scale down; signal voltage; Pixels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45549087727

One critical problem in sensor networks is how to make the effective use of the vast amount of data by providing sensor and sink nodes with efficient data storing and retrieving, respectively. Several data-centric storage techniques had been proposed to exploit data storing and retrieving, but all of them failed to effectively deal with hotspot storage due to irregular sensor deployments or data distribution. In this paper, we propose effective hotspot storage management schemes to solve the hotspot storage problem. Our schemes include the cover-up and multi-threshold mechanisms. The cover-up mechanism can adjust to another storage node dynamically when a storage node is full, while the multi-threshold mechanism can spread the data into several storage nodes for load balancing of the sensor nodes. Simulations have shown that our hotspot storage management schemes can reduce the energy consumption, increase the quality of data, and avoid the hotspot storage in the presence of a vast number of data in wireless sensor networks. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we apply in situ neutron diffraction to show that - in contrast to previous reports[5,6] - hydrogen (deuterium) occupies the small cages of the clathrate hydrate only to 30% (at 274 K and 90.5 bar). Such a D2 load is equivalent to 0.27 wt. % of stored H2. In addition, we show that a surplus of D2O results in the forma tion of additional D2O ice lh instead of in the production of substoichiometric clathrate that is stabilized by loaded hydrogen (as was reported in ref. [6]). Structure-refinement studies show that [D8]THF is dynamically disordered, while it fills each of the large cages of [D 8]THF·17D2O stoichiometrically. Our results show that the clathrate hydrate takes up hydrogen rapidly at pressures between 60 and 90 bar (at about 270 K). At temperatures above ≈220 K the H-storage characteristics of the clathrate hydrate have similarities with those of surface-adsorption materials, such as nanoporous zeolites and metal-organic frameworks,[7,8] but at lower temperatures, the adsorption rates slow down because of reduced D2 diffusion between the small cages. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

The aim of this study was to determine whether OE treatment affects the energy metabolism of pregnant rats and eventually, of their pups; i.e. changes in normal growth patterns and the onset of obesity after weaning. Methods: Pregnant Wistar rats were treated with daily intragastric gavages of OE in 0.2 ml sunflower oil from days 11 to 21 of pregnancy (i.e. 10 nmol oleoyl-estrone/g/day). Control animals received only the vehicle. Plasma and hormone metabolites were determined together with variations in cellularity of adipose tissue. Results: Treatment decreased food intake and lowered weight gain during late pregnancy, mainly because of reduced adipose tissue accumulation in different sites. OE-treated pregnant rats' metabolic pattern after delivery was similar to that of controls. Neonates from OE-treated rats weighed the same as those from controls. They also maintained the same growth rate up to weaning, but pups from OE-treated rats slowed their growth rate afterwards, despite only limited differences in metabolite concentrations. Conclusion: The OE influences on pup growth can be partially buffered by maternal lipid mobilization during the second half of pregnancy. This maternal metabolic ""imprinting"" may condition the eventual accumulation of adipose tissue after weaning, and its effects can affect the regulation of body weight up to adulthood. © 2008 García-Peláez et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"3 hydroxybutyric acid; adiponectin; cholesterol; estrone derivative; estrone oleate; fatty acid; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; leptin; protein; sunflower oil; triacylglycerol; urea; antiobesity agent; drug derivative; estrone; estrone oleate; oleic acid; oleoyl-estrone; adipose tissue; animal experiment; article; breeding; controlled study; energy metabolism; female; fetus; food intake; growth rate; hormone blood level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; metabolite; newborn; nonhuman; obesity; pup (rodent); rat; third trimester pregnancy; weaning; weight gain; Wistar rat; adipose tissue; age; animal; body composition; drug effect; eating; histology; male; metabolism; obesity; organ size; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; Animalia; Helianthus; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus; Adipose Tissue; Age Factors; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Body Composition; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Estrone; Female; Male; Obesity; Oleic Acids; Organ Size; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Weaning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47749106885

We have shown that an efficiency of the selective fieldionization detector, which is less than 1, leads to the mixing up of the spectra of the resonant energy transfer registered for various numbers of detected Rydberg atoms. This may impede the possible observations of dipole blockade or coherent two-atom interaction required to perform basic quantum gates. The formulae are presented, which help to estimate an actual mean Rydberg atom number in an excitation volume per one exciting laser pulse at a given detection efficiency. We have also found that a measurement of relationship of the amplitudes of resonances observed in the one- and two-atom signals provides a straightforward determination of the absolute detection efficiency and actual mean Rydberg atom number. This novel method is advantageous as it is independent of the specific experimental conditions. We also performed a testing experiment on the resonant energy transfers in a small excitation volume of the velocity selected Na atomic beam. The observed one- and two-atom resonances were analyzed and compared with the theoretical predictions. A good agreement between experiment and theory in the width and amplitudes of the resonances has confirmed the validity of simple approximations used in the developed theoretical model.","Quantum computers; Resonant energy transfer; Rydberg atoms","Atomic beams; Atomic physics; Atomic spectroscopy; Cable stayed bridges; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Experiments; Laser beams; Laser excitation; Microfluidics; Mixing; Numerical methods; Particle beams; Pulsed laser applications; Pulsed laser deposition; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Resonance; Rydberg states; Sodium; Theorem proving; (e ,2e) theory; Absolute detection efficiencies; atom interaction; Detection efficiencies; Experimental conditions; Novel methods; Quantum gate (QG); Quantum informatics; Quantum information processing (QIP); Resonant energy; Resonant energy transfer (RET); Rydberg atoms; SPECTRA (CO); Atoms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149128016

We developed a multiplexed assay system of proteases and their inhibition by measuring the energy transfer between quantum dots (QDs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on a glass slide. In this system, while the photoluminescence (PL) of donor QDs immobilized on a surface was quenched due to the presence of AuNPs (energy acceptor) in close proximity, the protease activity caused modulation in the efficiency of the energy transfer between the acceptor and donor, thus enabling the protease assay. In comparison to the QD-dye system, the conjugate of the QD-AuNP gave rise to higher energy transfer efficiency, resulting in quantitative assay of proteases with more sensitivity. When matrix metalloproteinase, caspase, and thrombin were tested, a multiplexed assay was successfully achieved since the AuNP could be used as a common energy acceptor in conjunction with QDs having different colors.

Ultraviolet light irradiation to the nanocrystalline titania aerogel (anatase) produced significant photocurrents, and the maximum incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) attained 37.1%. From cyclic voltammetry, the vanadium oxide gel was shown capacitive for charge storage, associated with the shcherbinaite structure and V4+/V5+ redox pair. Photopotential responses revealed that coupled TiO2/V2O5 composites not only were photo-chargeable but also exhibited a greater discharging capacity than the TiO2 or V2O5 alone. The discharging capacity was remarkably reduced in the presence of dissolved oxygen. Results demonstrate that in the hybrid TiO2/V2O5 system the V2O5 serves to accumulate photoelectrons generated by the illuminated TiO2 during the photo-charging process.

The existing Change Management module of the PDM system is modified for seamless data exchange, i.e. sending the Engineering Change Order (ECO) data to the CAE supporting system and receiving the CAE result data back. The bi-directional data transfers between the PDM system and the CAE supporting system is made possible by adaptors based on the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).

However, these capacitors have relatively low tuning range (50%) and are subjected to highly sensitive and nonlinear capacitance-voltage (C-V) responses. In this paper novel designs are developed which have C-V responses with high linearity and tunability and low sensitivity. The designs use the flexibility of the moving plates. The plate is segmented to provide a controllable flexibility. Segments are connected together at end nodes by torsional springs. Under each node there is a step which limits the vertical movement of that node. An optimization program finds the best set of step heights that provides the highest linearity. Two numerical examples of three-segmented- and six-segmented-plate capacitors verify that the segmentation of moving plate can considerably improve the linearity without decreasing the conventional tunability. A two-segmented-plate capacitor is then designed for standard processes which cannot fabricate steps of different heights. The new design uses a flexible step (spring) under middle node. The simulation of a capacitor with flexible middle step, designed for PoIyMUMPs process, demonstrates a C-V response with high tunability and linearity and low sensitivity.

The irresistible trend to build taller and taller buildings to leverage increasing land cost turns elevator from a tool of convenience to a necessity of life. This dependence of elevator further requires its continuous function in spite of power failure caused by a variety of reasons. Reliable and effective elevator power backup system becomes an urgent need today. In this work, advanced electric power backup technologies, including battery, ultracapacitor and hydrogen fuel cells, are examined. To design a functional elevator backup power system, and to assess the feasibility of a battery -ultracapacitor - fuel cell hybrid elevator backup power system with superior performance, the modeling and simulation of an elevator and its backup power system are carried out. Based on its resemblance to an electric vehicle traveling vertically, the elevator, its power need and performance are modeled using the MatLab/Simulink based hybrid vehicle design and analysis tool, ADvanced Vehicle SimulatOR (ADVISOR). The modeling and simulation provide guidelines for selecting and sizing energy storage and conversion devices. More importantly, the quantitative analysis allows complex battery - ultracapacitor fuel cell hybrid backup power system to be optimized to reach the best potential of each components for a given elevator usage cycle. To explore the feasibility of wide commercial applications of this technology, the initial cost, maintain costs and reliability of the battery - ultracapacitor - fuel cell hybrid elevator backup power system are also discussed.

The passive heating potential of Trombe wall for a honey storage building was estimated using TRNSYS building simulation software. This honey storage building is located at Gwalior (latitude: 26°14′N) in India. During winter months, the room air temperature of building falls below the required temperature range of 18-27 °C which is suitable for honey storage. So, the room air temperature range is maintained in the building using a 2.3 kW capacity electrical oil filled radiator (or room air heater) which accounts for the major energy consumption of the building on an annual basis. On account of which there are significant CO2 emissions into the atmosphere from the honey storage building. Hence, this case study was conducted to recommend the passive heating concept to the stakeholders of the building so as to conserve the energy requirement for room air heating. The investigation showed that the room air temperature can be easily maintained in the range suitable for honey storage using a vented Trombe wall. The experimental work was carried out for the existing building on a typical clear day of harsh winter month of January to validate the results of TRNSYS model of the present building. The statistical error analysis showed a good agreement between model and experimental results. This investigation concludes that there is potential of energy conservation up to 3312 kWh/year and associated reduction in CO2 emissions (∼33 tonne/year) using a Trombe wall. Also, the retrofitting of building is economically viable as the simple payback period is only about 7 months. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However using batteries raises the problems of limited lifespan and recycling process, leading to the research of other energy sources for mobile electronics. Recent work on Synchronized Switch Harvesting (SSH) shows a significant improvement of energy harvesting from vibrations compared to standard techniques. Nevertheless, harvesting energy from vibrations necessitates that the electromechanical structure has to be driven by mechanical solicitations, which generally have a limited amount of energy. Therefore, for the design of efficient and truly applicable self-powered devices, combining several sources for energy harvesting would be greatly beneficial. Thermal energy is rarely considered due to the difficulty of getting efficient devices. However, the potential of such a source is one of the most important. This paper deals with energy harvesting using either piezoelectric or pyroelectric effect. Theoretical and experimental validations of thermal energy harvesting are presented and discussed. Standard thermodynamic cycles may be adapted in order to improve conversion effectiveness.

The assessment of evaporative cooling availability and utilization is done for five representative climatic cities, including Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Lanzhou and Urumqi in China, and the energy saving potential of the proposed air-conditioning system is analyzed by using a well validated building simulation code. The results indicate that the new system offers energy saving potential up to 80% under northwestern Chinese climate and up to 10% under southeastern Chinese climate. The optimal design method of the slurry storage tank is also proposed based on the slurry cooling storage behaviors and cooling demand variations of the ceiling panels. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

BE-SONOS employs a multilayer O1/N1/O2/N2/O3 stack, where O1/N1/O2 serves as a bandgap-engineered tunneling barrier that provides an efficient hole-tunneling erase but eliminates the direct-tunneling leakage. BE-SONOS can overcome the fundamental limitation of the conventional SONOS, for which fast erase speed and good data retention cannot be simultaneously achieved. In this paper, a comprehensive understanding of BE-SONOS reliability is reported, including the processing effects of the critical ONO barrier (O1/N1/O2), the trapping layer (N2), and the top blocking oxide (O3). Moreover, the capability of dielectric scaling is also evaluated. Lower P/E voltages, good P/E cycling endurance, and data retention are maintained when N2 and O3 are further scaled to 60 Å. The results in this paper provide design and processing guidelines for optimizing the performance and reliability of BE-SONOS Flash memory devices. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Band gaps; Cycling endurances; Data retentions; Dielectric scaling; Fundamental limitations; Good datum; Multi layers; Processing effects; Processing methods; Reliability properties; Scaling capabilities; SONOS flash memories; Tunneling barriers; Tunneling leakages; Data storage equipment; Energy gap; Ozone water treatment; Processing; Reliability; Flash memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64249144984

Two families of 1-W light-emitting diodes (LEDs) from different manufacturers were submitted to distinct stress conditions: high temperature storage without bias and high dc current test. During aging, degradation mechanisms like light output decay and electrical property worsening were detected. In particular, the degradation in light efficiency induced by thermal storage was found to follow an exponential law, and the activation energy of the process was extrapolated. Aged devices exhibited a modification of the package epoxy color from white to brown. The instability of the package contributes to the overall degradation in terms of optical and spectral properties. In addition, an increase in thermal resistance was detected on one family of LEDs. This increase induces higher junction temperature levels during operative conditions. In order to correlate the degradation mechanisms and kinetics found during thermal stress, a high dc current stress was performed. Results from this comparative analysis showed similar behavior, implying that the degradation process of dc current aged devices is thermal activated due to high temperatures reached by the junction during stress. Finally, the different effects of the stress on two families of LEDs were taken into account in order to identify the impact of aging on device structure. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Accelerated life tests; Comparative analysis; DC current stress; DC currents; Degradation mechanisms; Degradation process; Device structures; Different effects; Electrical properties; Exponential laws; High brightness; High temperature storages; High temperatures; Higher junction temperatures; Light efficiencies; Light emitting diode leds; Light outputs; Spectral properties; Stress conditions; Thermal resistances; Thermal storages; Activation energy; Degradation; Diodes; Electric batteries; Electric properties; Heat storage; Light emission; Testing; Light emitting diodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64249142675

It is not only a local consumable commodity but also is exported to other countries. In addition to the medicinal value the betel leaves also have a good nutritional value. The essential oil of the betel leaves has high market value, which is used in the production of perfume, medicine, talc, beverages, food additives and mouthwash. Moreover, the betel vine cultivation, being labour intensive, provides employment throughout the year for cultivation, harvesting, grading, packing and marketing operations. The movement of the betel leaves starts from the growers' field to the consumer point through different ways. The green leaves are directly sold to the local pan vendors in local markets or to retailers that takes about 2 to 5 days to reach to the consumers. Betel leaves being high in moisture content is highly perishable in nature. So many a times the farmers have to bear the loss as they have to sell the products at throwaway price. Maintenance of the freshness of the green leaves for a few more days at the farmers' level would be a great help to them. The present study is an effort to increase the shelf life of the fresh betel leaves using low cost methods, which a producer can afford. Storage experiments for betel leaves were carried out using wet cloth wrapping, polyethylene pouches and ventilated polyethylene packaging. All these types of packages were stored in room temperature as well as in zero energy cool chamber. The stored leaves were subjected to physical examination (rotten leaves), sensory evaluation (freshness and taste) and biochemical estimation (moisture content, chlorophyll content, total soluble solids, ascorbic acid and pH) at an interval of three days. The environmental conditions that prevailed in the zero cool chamber was measured and compared to those of ambient conditions. The temperature remained less by 3 to 5°C and the relative humidity was higher by 8 to 10 % than the ambient conditions during the storage period. The overall analysis of the quality characteristics of the stored betel leaves showed that the zero energy cool chamber performed better than ambient conditions in respect of storage of fresh betel leaves. The betel leaves could be stored in zero energy cool chamber with acceptable qualities 2 to 5 days more than the leaves stored under ambient conditions, depending on packaging system. Among various packaging systems, the traditional package gave best results under ambient conditions, where as much difference could not be noticed among packages stored in the zero energy cool chamber.",,"Agriculture; Atmospheric humidity; Beverages; Chlorophyll; Conductive plastics; Essential oils; Ketones; Moisture control; Moisture determination; Organic acids; Packaging machines; Porphyrins; Silicate minerals; Thermoplastics; Ambient conditions; Ascorbic acids; Chlorophyll contents; Environmental conditions; Essential oil; Labour intensives; Local markets; Low cost methods; Market values; Marketing operations; Moisture contents; Nutritional values; Packaging systems; Quality characteristics; Relative humidities; Room temperatures; Sensory evaluations; Shelf lives; Storage periods; Total soluble solids; Zero energy cool chambers; Quality control; Piper betel; Piper betle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62749109758

Partial crystallization results in an hardening effect in both viscoplasticity (i.e. increase of the viscosity for a given strain rate) and viscoelasticity (i.e. decrease of the loss modulus and increase of the storage modulus) indicating a decrease in atomic mobility. The shapes of both the viscosity / strain rate curves and of the DMA curves are merely the same whatever the investigated crystal amount.

Co-firing biomass and coal has potential for the development of biomass-to-energy capacity with significant economic, environmental, and social benefits. However, co-firing is not straightforward, and some questions need to be addressed due to the differences in chemical compositions and physical properties of biomass and coal. This paper highlights key issues related to co-firing, including reactor types, feeding, hydrodynamics, ash sintering, fouling, and corrosion, based on previous studies, as well as calculations and analysis. Direct co-firing is the most common option for biomass and coal co-firing currently, mostly due to relatively low investment needed to turn existing coal power plants into co-firing plants. For direct co-firing, the physical characteristics and chemical compositions of the fuel entering the combustors or gasifiers are critical to an optimum operation. Any biomass mixed with coal needs to have acceptable physical properties. More research is needed on co-firing biomass and coal, including work on: preparation, handling, storage, and feeding of biomass feedstocks (e.g. drying, torrefaction, pelletization); co-firing mechanisms; hydrodynamic analysis of co-firing combustors and gasifiers; boiler/gasifier capacity, slagging, fouling, corrosion, efficiency, reliability, fuel flexibility; lower emissions and gas cleaning; catalyst poisoning; investment and operating costs. © 2008 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.","Biomass; Co-feeding; Co-firing; Coal; Fluidized bed","Air cleaners; Biological materials; Biomass; Catalyst poisoning; Chemical plants; Chemical properties; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal handling; Coal industry; Coal research; Coal storage; Cobalt; Cobalt compounds; Combustion; Combustors; Corrosion; Cost benefit analysis; Dewatering; Electric power plants; Feeding; Feedstocks; Fluid dynamics; Fluidization; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized beds; Fouling; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Gas fuel analysis; Gas fuel storage; Gas generators; Hydrodynamics; Investments; Leakage (fluid); Operating costs; Pelletizing; Power plants; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Renewable energy resources; Sintering; Biomass feedstocks; Chemical compositions; Co-feeding; Co-firing; Economic; Energy capacities; Environmental; Firing mechanisms; Firing plants; Fuel flexibilities; Gas cleanings; Gasifiers; Hydrodynamic analyses; Investment costs; Low heating values; Optimum operations; Physical characteristics; Social benefits; Coal gas",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49349113924

Nanomaterials are of particular interest as they combine the properties of two or more different materials with the possibility of possessing novel mechanical, electronic or chemical behaviour. Understanding and tuning such effects could lead to hybrid devices based on these nanocomposites with improved optical properties. We have prepared polymer nanocomposites of well-defined compositions and studied the optical properties of powders and their thin films. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy on nanocomposite powders and spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements on thin films was used to study the effect of interfacial morphology, interparticle spacing and finite size effects on optical properties of nanocomposites. Systematic shift in the imaginary part of the dielectric function can be seen with variation in size and fraction of the gold nanoparticle. The thickness of the film also plays a significant role in the tunability of the optical spectra. © Indian Academy of Sciences.","Metal nanocomposites; Optical properties; Polymer nanocomposites","Absorption; Absorption spectroscopy; Chemical properties; Crystals; Direct energy conversion; Gold; Light emitting diodes; Liquid phase epitaxy; Materials properties; Mechanical properties; Molecular beam epitaxy; Nanocomposites; Optical communication; Optical data storage; Optical filters; Optical materials; Optical properties; Optical sensors; Polymer films; Polymers; Powders; Semiconducting cadmium telluride; Solar energy; Spectroscopic ellipsometry; Thick films; Thin films; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Area of Interest; Chemical-; Dielectric functions; Finite-size effects; Gold nano particles; Hybrid devices; Imaginary parts; Inter-particle spacing; Interfacial morphologies; Metal nanocomposites; Nano-materials; Nanocomposite powders; Optical data; Optical spectrum; Polymer nanocomposites; Potential applications; Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements; Thickness of the film; Tun ability; UV-vis absorption spectroscopy; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48449106960

Markers of carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism in the skeletal muscle and heart were examined to evaluate the mechanism. On a high-fat diet, compared with wild-type mice, C3 KO mice have increased energy expenditure, decreased RQ, lower ex vivo glucose oxidation (-39%, P = 0.018), and higher ex vivo fatty acid oxidation (+68%, P = 0.019). They have lower muscle glycogen content (-25%, P < 0.05) and lower activities for the glycolytic enzymes glycogen phosphorylase (-31%, P = 0.005), hexokinase (-43%, P = 0.007), phosphofructokinase (-51%, P < 0.0001), and GAPDH (-15%, P = 0.04). Analysis of mitochondrial enzyme activities revealed that hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase was higher (+25%, P = 0.004) in C3 KO mice. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of muscle revealed significantly higher fatty acid transporter CD36 (+40%, P = 0.006) and cytochrome c (a marker of mitochondrial content; +69%, P = 0.034) levels in C3 KO mice, whereas the activity of AMP kinase was lower (-48%, P = 0.003). Overall, these results demonstrate a shift in the metabolic potential of skeletal muscle toward increased fatty acid utilization. Whether this is 1) a consequence of decreased adipose tissue storage with repartitioning toward muscle or 2) a direct result of the absence of ASP interaction with the receptor C5L2 in muscle remains to be determined. However, these in vivo data suggest that ASP inhibition could be a potentially viable approach in correcting muscle metabolic dysfunction in obesity.

Our aim was to state whether such weight gain limitation could occur in non-obese, non-diabetic rats and to extend these observations to other amine oxidase inhibitors. Prolonged treatment of non-obese rats with a high dose of S (900 μmol kg-1 day-1) reduced body weight gain and limited white adipose tissue enlargement. When chronically administered at a threefold lower dose, S also inhibited SSAO activity but not fat depot enlargement, suggesting that effects other than SSAO inhibition were involved in adipose tissue growth retardation. However, combined treatment of this lower dose of S with pargyline inhibited SSAO, MAO, energy intake, weight gain and fat deposition. Adipocytes from treated rats exhibited unchanged insulin responsiveness but impaired antilipolytic responses to amine oxidase substrates. Phenelzine clearly inhibited both MAO and SSAO when tested on adipocytes. Obese rats receiving phenelzine i.p. at 17 μmol kg-1 day-1 for 3 weeks, exhibited blunted MAO and SSAO activities in any tested tissue, diminished body weight gain and reduced intra-abdominal adipose tissue. Their adipocytes were less responsive to lipogenesis activation by tyramine or benzylamine. These observations suggest that SSAO inhibition is not sufficient to impair fat deposition. However, combined MAO and SSAO inhibition limits adiposity in non-obese as well as in obese rats. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The combination of the two perovskite structured stoichiometric compositions (i.e., isovalent Sr modified PLZT and BaTiO indicated that tetragonality enhanced further due to BaTiO concentration in PLSZT lattice. The BaTiO in PLSZT ceramics were homogeneously distributed within the two perovskite structured solid solutions. The dielectric characterization indicated that enhanced while and decreased with increasing BT additions into PLSZT perovskite. The maximum = 2986 and = 21468 were found in 0.55PLSZT-0.45BT ceramic system. The piezoelectric properties were influenced by both BaTiO and Sr modified PLZT perovskite. The influence of BT modified PLSZT ceramics showed significant variations that has been discussed. The piezoelectric properties remarkably enhanced with maximum ( and pC/N) values in the 0.55PLSZT-0.45BT composition and thus, could be a promising candidate among this series for possible capacitor, sensor and actuator applications. © 2008 EDP Sciences.",,"Addition reactions; Building materials; Chemical analysis; Electric currents; Energy storage; Lithography; Optical design; Oxide minerals; Perovskite; Piezoelectricity; Solid solutions; Solid state reactions; Ceramic compositions; ceramic systems; Concentration (composition); Dielectric and piezoelectric properties; Dielectric characterization; Homogeneously distributed; Lattice (CO); Phase formations; Piezoelectric properties; Solid-state reaction methods; Stoichiometric compositions; Tetragonality; Ceramic materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46749108515

Fat mass is an energy depot but also an endocrine organ. A deregulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) might produce obesity. Stress exaggerates diet-induced obesity. After stress, SNS fibers release neuropeptide Y (NPY) which directly increases visceral fat mass producing a metabolic syndrome (MbS)-like phenotype. Adrenergic receptors are the main regulators of lipolysis. In severe obesity, we demonstrated that the adrenergic receptor subtypes are differentially expressed in different fat depots. Liver and visceral fat share a common sympathetic pathway, which might explain the low-grade inflammation which simultaneously occurs in liver and fat of the obese with MbS. The neuroendocrine melanocortinergic system and gastric ghrelin are also greatly deregulated in obesity. A specific mutation in the type 4 melanocortin receptor induces early obesity onset, hyperphagia and insulin-resistance. Nonetheless, it was recently discovered that a mutation in the prohormone convertase 1/3 simultaneously produces severe gastrointestinal dysfunctions and obesity.","Adrenergic receptors; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity; Prohormone convertase 1/3; Sympathetic nervous system; Type 4 melanocortin receptor","adrenergic receptor; ghrelin; melanocortin; melanocortin 4 receptor; neuropeptide Y; proprotein convertase 1; receptor subtype; adipose tissue; adrenergic system; digestive system function disorder; food intake; gastrointestinal tract; gene mutation; human; hyperphagia; insulin resistance; intraabdominal fat; lipid storage; lipolysis; metabolic syndrome X; neuroendocrine system; neurotransmitter release; obesity; phenotype; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; review; stress; Adipose Tissue; Eating; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome X; Neurosecretory Systems; Obesity; Proprotein Convertase 1; Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4; Receptors, Adrenergic; Sympathetic Nervous System",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46449127410

In the present study, using an analytical approach, we extend our previous results to low-energy discrete breathers as well as to smaller proteins. We confirm and further scrutinize the striking site selectiveness of energy localization in the presence of spatial disorder. In particular, we find that, as a sheer consequence of disorder, a non-zero energy gap for exciting a DB at a given site either exists or not. Remarkably, in the former case, the gaps arise as a result of the impossibility of exciting small-amplitude modes in the first place. In contrast, in the latter case, a small subset of linear edge modes acts as accumulation points, whereby DBs can be continued to arbitrary small energies, while unavoidably approaching one of such normal modes. In particular, the case of the edge mode seems peculiar, its dispersion relation being simple and little system dependent. Concerning the structure-dynamics relationship, we find that the regions of protein structures where DBs form easily (zero or small gaps) are unfailingly the most highly connected ones, also characterized by weak local clustering. Remarkably, a systematic analysis on a large database of enzyme structures reveals that amino-acid residues involved in catalysis tend to be located in such regions. This finding reinforces the idea that localized modes of nonlinear origin may play an important biological role, e.g., by providing a ready channel for energy storage and/or contributing to lower energy barriers of chemical reactions. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"amino acid; protein; analytic method; article; catalysis; chemical reaction; energy; model; priority journal; protein structure; simulation; chemistry; computer simulation; protein conformation; thermodynamics; Computer Simulation; Protein Conformation; Proteins; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46449101584

Hot plasma of the micropinches emits a soft x-ray radiation and beams of accelerated electrons moving toward the anode. It is found that these phenomena occur just when both amplitude of the discharge current and energy of the initiating laser pulse lie in the specified ranges of values. The position of the micropinch within the interelectrode gap and also the intensity of the x-ray radiation and beams of the accelerated electrons emitted from the micropinch are variable over a wide range of values through changes in energy of the laser pulse and/or amplitude of the discharge current.

In this paper, we report a new microfluidic device which can actively fine-tune the size of single- and double-emulsion droplets in liquids by utilizing controllable movingwall structures. Moreover, various sizes of external and internal droplets for double emulsions are also successfully formed by using this device. Three pneumatic side chambers are placed at a T-junction and flow-focusing channels to construct the controllable moving-wall structures. When compressed air is applied to the pneumatic side chambers, the controllable moving-wall structures are activated, thus physically changing the width of the microchannels. The size of the internal droplets at the intersection of the T-junction channel is then fine-tuned due to the increase in the shear force. Then, the internal droplets are focused into a narrow stream hydrodynamically and finally chopped into double-emulsion droplets using another pair of moving-wall structures downstream. For single emulsions, oil-in-water droplets can be actively fine-tuned from 50.07 to 21.80 μm under applied air pressures from 10 to 25 psi with a variation of less than 3.53%. For a water-in-oil single emulsion, droplets range from 50.32 to 14.76 μm with a variation of less than 4.62% under the same applied air pressures. For double emulsions, the sizes of the external and internal droplets can be fine-tuned with external/internal droplet diameter ratios ranging from 1.69 to 2.75. The development of this microfluidic device is promising for a variety of applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food industries. © 2008 IEEE.","Double emulsion; Flow focusing; Microdroplet; Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS); Microfluidics; Moving wall; T-junction","Atmospheric pressure; Biochemical engineering; Canning; Cold storage; Compressed air; Drop formation; Drops; Emulsification; Emulsions; Energy storage; Fluidic devices; Fluidics; Food preservation; Industrial applications; Law enforcement; Microfluidics; Nanofluidics; Pneumatics; Pressure; Pressure vessels; Walls (structural partitions); air pressures; Applied (CO); Double emulsions; droplet diameters; droplet formation; Emulsion droplets; Food industries; Micro scales; Micro-fluidic devices; Oil in water (O/W); Shear force (SF); T junctions; wall structures; Water in oil (W/O); Fluid mechanics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45449120076

Conduction cooling system has more effective, compact structure than cryogen. In general, two stage GM cryocoolers are used for conduction cooling of HTS SMES system. First stages of cryocoolers are used for the cooling of current leads and radiation shields, and second stages of cryocoolers for HTS coil. The cryocooler has a limited cooling capacity. So radiation shields are used to minimize the heat leak to the HTS coil. For the effective conduction cooling of the HTS SMES system, the temperature difference between the cryocooler and HTS coil should be minimized.

The impedance parameter allows the construction of a time domain equivalent circuit to be used for the simulation of the overall SMES system. The numerical model is based on a volume integral formulation where the unknown is the total current density J, expressed as the sum of its solenoidal and non-solenoidal components. This separation allows to avoid the ill-conditioning of the relevant stiffness matrix at low frequencies, being essential for developing a numerical model accurately working where the SMES resonances are located.

This rise in ion temperature should be attributed to the joint action of the electron-ion energy transfer (which changes slightly during the CERC formation) and an enhancement of the ion confinement. This improvement must be related to the increase in the positive electric field in the core region. In this paper, we confirm this hypothesis by estimating the ion collisional transport in TJ-II under the physical conditions established before and after the transition to CERC. We calculate a large number of ion orbits in the guiding-centre approximation considering the collisions with a background plasma composed of electrons and ions.

Although it is clear that in vivo insulin resistance is a key abnormality associated with an atherogenic, prothrombotic, and inflammatory profile which has been named by some the ""metabolic syndrome"" or by others ""syndrome X"" or ""insulin resistance syndrome"", it is more and more recognized that the most prevalent form of this constellation of metabolic abnormalities linked to insulin resistance is found in patients with abdominal obesity, especially with an excess of intra-abdominal or visceral adipose tissue. We have previously proposed that visceral obesity may represent a clinical intermediate phenotype reflecting the relative inability of subcutaneous adipose tissue to act as a protective metabolic sink for the clearance and storage of the extra energy derived from dietary triglycerides, leading to ectopic fat deposition in visceral adipose depots, skeletal muscle, liver, heart, etc. Thus, visceral obesity may partly be a marker of a dysmetabolic state and partly a cause of the metabolic syndrome. Although waist circumference is a better marker of abdominal fat accumulation than the body mass index, an elevated waistline alone is not sufficient to diagnose visceral obesity and we have proposed that an elevated fasting triglyceride concentration could represent, when waist circumference is increased, a simple clinical marker of excess visceral/ectopic fat. Finally, a clinical diagnosis of visceral obesity, insulin resistance, or of the metabolic syndrome is not sufficient to assess global risk of cardiovascular disease. To achieve this goal, physicians should first pay attention to the classical risk factors while also considering the additional risk resulting from the presence of abdominal obesity and the metabolic syndrome, such global risk being defined as cardiometabolic risk. © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.","Global cardiometabolic risk; Insulin resistance; Metabolic syndrome; Visceral obesity; Waist circumference","triacylglycerol; abdominal obesity; atherogenesis; body mass; cardiovascular risk; clinical assessment; heart; human; hypertriglyceridemia; inflammation; insulin resistance; intraabdominal fat; lipid storage; liver; metabolic syndrome X; pathophysiology; phenotype; priority journal; review; risk assessment; screening test; skeletal muscle; subcutaneous fat; thrombosis; waist circumference; weight reduction; blood; cardiovascular disease; intraabdominal fat; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; obesity; physiology; risk factor; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Metabolic Syndrome X; Obesity; Risk Factors; Triglycerides",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44849093847

Due to the geometrical complexity of this component and the exhaustive computational resources necessary for the study, it was essential to identify a symmetrical module on which to focus. The results of this simulation, in terms of non-dimensional head losses as a function of the Reynolds number, will be presented and discussed. The FEM analysis was carried out with Comsol Multiphysics© software. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","MCFC current collector; MCFC FEM analysis; MCFC fluid-dynamic","Computational complexity; Electric energy storage; Electrochemical cells; Finite element method; Gas dynamics; Reynolds number; Cathodic gas distributions; Current collectors; Electrical energy; Electrochemical reactions; Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44749086550

In the present work, two carbon fibres, carbonised at 973 and 1273 K, have been chemically activated with KOH and NaOH, in order to obtain materials with optimised characteristics for hydrogen storage application. Highly microporous activated carbon fibres were obtained from both precursors, especially from the fibre carbonised at the lower carbonisation temperature, remarking its importance on its subsequent activation process. As activation agent, KOH is more effective for developing the narrow microporosity, and higher yields are obtained. H2 adsorption isotherms were measured at 298 K for pressures up to 20 MPa, and at 77 K up to 4 MPa. The maximum excess adsorption of hydrogen reached 1 wt% at 298 K and 3.8 wt% at 77 K. The total volumetric storage capacity is of 17 g/l at 298 K, and 32 g/l at 77 K. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Activated carbon fibres; Carbonisation temperature; Chemical activation; Hydrogen adsorption","Activated carbon; Adsorption isotherms; Carbonization; Hydrogen storage; Physisorption; Porous materials; Activated carbon fibres; Carbonization temperature; Hydrogen adsorption; Carbon fibers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44749085599

The noble metal catalysts could be used for a reversible hydrogen storage system. Five percent Pt/SiO2 catalyst was highly active in TCH dehydrogenation without stirring, due to an easier diffusion of organic molecules to the small catalyst particles during dehydrogenation. In view of a long-term stability in TPh hydrogenation and TCH dehydrogenation, a catalyst with relatively low Pt content on the oxidized graphite coal (Sibunit-ox) was the most promising for a hydrogen storage system because Pt agglomeration on the support was found to be much less than Pd agglomeration in the Pd/Sibunit-ox catalyst. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Hydrogen storage system; Hydrogenation/dehydrogenation; Noble metal catalyst","Carbon; Catalyst activity; Dehydrogenation; Hydrogenation; Noble metal catalyst; Terphenyl (TPh); Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649179855

The first synchrotron light sources were built around storage rings in which a large number of relativistic electrons produce ""synchrotron radiation"" when their trajectory is subjected to a magnetic field, either in bending magnets or in specific insertion devices (undulators), made of an alternating series of magnets, allowing the number of curvatures to be increased and the radiation to be reinforced. These ""synchrotron radiation"" storage rings are now used worldwide (there are more than thirty), and they simultaneously distribute their radiation to several tens of users around the storage ring. The most effective installations in term of brilliance are the so-called 3rd generation synchrotron radiation light sources. The radiation produced presents pulse durations of the order of a few tens of ps, at a high rate (of the order of MHz); it is tuneable over a large range, depending on the magnetic field and the electron beam energy and its polarisation is adjustable (in the VUV-soft-X range). Generally, a very precise spectral selection is made by the users with a monochromator. The single pass linear accelerators can produce very short electron bunches (∼ 100   femtosecond). The beam of very high electronic density is sent into successive undulator modules, reinforcing the radiation's longitudinal coherence, produced according to a Free Electron Laser (FEL) scheme by the interaction between the electron bunch and a light wave. The very high peak brilliance justifies their designation as 4th generation sources. The number of users is smaller because an electron pulse produces a radiation burst towards only one beamline. Energy Recovery Linacs (ERL) let the beam pass several times in the accelerator structures either to recover the energy or to accelerate the electrons during several turns, and thus provide subpicosecond beams for a greater number of users. A state-of-the-art of X sources using conventional (and not laser plasma based) accelerators is given here, underlying the performance already reached or forecast and the essential challenges.

Three states are considered: (a) cured rims with residual stress prior to press-fitting; (b) a stationary press-fitted rotor; (c) a rotor at maximum rotational speed. Two methods of press-fitting rims are presented. One method has each rim machined with tapered inner and outer rim surfaces. The other method uses a guiding rim to expand the outer rim and guide the inner rim into the expanded outer rim. An optimized multi-rim rotor, composed of one glass/Ep rim and one graphite/Ep rim, is scaled to have energy storage capability of 5 kWh, and is successfully manufactured by machining tapered rims and hydraulic pressing. © SAGE Publications 2008.","Computational simulation; Filament winding; Flywheel rotor; Residual stresses","Architectural design; Curing; Drying; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Flywheels; Molecular beam epitaxy; Presses (machine tools); Process design; Process engineering; Stresses; Wheels; (abiotic and biotic) stress; centrifugal forces; Composite flywheels; Curing processes; Flywheel rotors; High speeds; Hydraulic pressing; Overall performance; Pre-compression; rim thickness; Rotational speeds; Sage Publications (CO); Specific energy density; storage capabilities; Rotors (windings)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649105780

Nevertheless, the demands on optimization software have increased dramatically since then. To give an example, methods looking for Fareto-optimal points rather than for a single solution only have been introduced by several groups.

The mean annual incoming short wave radiation (435±32.8 W m-2) was partitioned into 29% sensible heat, 35% latent heat, 4% ground heat, 7% physical storage energy and 10% photosynthetic storage energy. The mean budget closing energy flux (68.96±24.6 W m-2) or, budget error was 15.8% of incoming short wave radiation. In Varimax factor analysis, budget closing energy flux showed high loading in association with leaf chlorophyll of different mangrove species, indicating its major role for reflectivity of the surface for short wave. There was significant seasonality in CO2 exchange with net primary productivity of 14.1 μmol m-2 s-1. The mean methane emission was found higher (7.29 μg m-2 s-1) during the daytime than that of night time (1.37 μg m-2 s-1) with maximum methane emission rates of 36.1 and 21.1 μg m-2 s-1 in December and January, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis between storage energy [ΔHs(P)] and fluxes of CO2, CH4, H (sensible heat), HL (latent heat of evaporation), ΔR (budget closer energy) showed that the combined explained variability for CO2 flux, evapotranspiration and budget closer energy (39%) was less than that of CH4 and sensible heat flux (46%). The extent of warming effect by CH4 and sensible heat flux was predominant over the resultant cooling effect due to the processes such as photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and albedo. The mangrove forest with two trademarks of low albedo and high surface roughness was poorly coupled to the environment. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

When illite was given in particulate and powdered forms, the germination rate of lettuce seeds improved remarkably up to 93% and 133%, respectively. Contrary to the developmental effects, the growth rate of lettuce treated with particulate illite improved slightly by 23%; powdered illite had no significant effects on lettuce growth rate. Thus, illite primarily affects seed germination rather than the growth of lettuce. To examine illite-induced proteins related to lettuce growth, differentially expressed proteins in lettuce leaves were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) followed by Mascot search.

Therefore, time-variable behavior of product-cooling load is necessary for the efficient design and operation of a refrigeration system. A well-designed refrigeration system not only avoids wastage of electrical energy but also restricts the moisture loss within permissible limit. In the present study, a total of 15 combinations, with three cooling rates and five loading patterns, were investigated and corresponding product-cooling loads were predicted. The effect of cooling rates was studied on moisture loss as well. It was found that although the high cooling rate gave low moisture loss, it required a high capacity refrigeration system, which might not be justifiable over the reduced moisture loss during the long-term storage period. Loading rate of the product also had a similar effect on refrigeration load as that of cooling rate. A cooling rate corresponding to half cooling time of 6.72 days (cool-down time = 30 days) in combination with linearly decreasing product loading rate of 30 days duration gave the minimum refrigeration load with affordable increased moisture loss, which could be adopted in commercial potato cold storage. © 2008, Blackwell Publishing.",,"Cooling systems; Food products; Moisture determination; Refrigeration; Transient analysis; Electrical energy; Moisture loss; Product-cooling loads; Transient cooling; Cold storage; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43649108967

This new equation of state is based on Statistical Association Fluid Theory and Mean Spherical Approximation Theory and proposes to take into account the respective association by hydrogen bonding and dipolar interactions. The aim of this work was to add these dipolar interactions in addition of cubic and association contributions that were not ever done since typical CPA EOS only take account association by hydrogen bonding. This first paper is focused on the pure water and pure hydrogen sulfide. For pure H2S, the parameters, such as dipole moment and size of the molecule, are fitted to experimental data along the saturation curve. The accuracy of the model, both for saturation pressure and liquid density, is much better as compared to previous cubic EOS. For pure H2O system, the parameters are fitted along the saturation line of water. The accuracy is excellent along this coexistence curve for both saturation pressure and volumes of liquid and vapor. Parameters such as the energy of hydrogen bonding, dipolar moment and size of molecules are compatible with experimental data. In the temperature range of 25-400 °C and pressure range of 1-10,000 bar, the model predict satisfactorily the molar volume.

In an attempt to better understand the large-scale effects of pollution and other stressors like climate change on the health status of Mytilus edulis, mussels were collected during the first two weeks of June 2005 at three sites (one pristine and two affected by pollution) located in each of the regions of the Canadian West Coast, the St. Lawrence estuary, the Atlantic East Coast and the northwestern coast of France, covering a total distance of some 11 000 km. The mussels were analyzed for morphologic integrity (condition factor), gametogenic activity (gonado-somatic and gonad maturation index, vitellogenin(Vtg)-like proteins), energy status (temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport activity and gonad lipid stores), defense mechanisms (glutathione S-transferase, metallothioneins, cytochrome P4503A activity and xanthine oxidoreductase-XOR), and tissue damage (lipid peroxidation-LPO and DNA strand breaks). The results showed that data from the reference sites in each region were usually not normally distributed, with discriminant factors reaching the number of regions (i.e. four), except for the biomarkers gonadal lipids, XOR and LPO in digestive gland. The integrated responses of the biomarkers revealed that biomarkers of stress were significantly more pronounced in mussels from the Seine estuary, suggesting that the impacts of pollution are more generalized in this area. Mussels from the Seine estuary and the Atlantic East Coast (Halifax Harbor) responded more strongly for Vtg-like proteins, but was not related to gonad maturation and gonado-somatic indexes, suggesting the presence of environmental estrogens. Moreover, these mussels displayed reduced DNA repair activity and increased LPO. Factorial analyses revealed that energy status, cytochrome P4503A activity and Vtg-like proteins were the most important biomarkers. Adaptation to warmer temperatures was reflected at the energy status levels, mussels from both the polluted and warmer sites displaying increased ratios of mitochondrial activity to lipid stores. Regional observations of biomarkers of energy status, gametogenesis and pollutant-related effects were influenced by nutrition, oxygen availability (eutrophication), and thermal history.

The control strategy is based on regulation of the dc bus capacitor energy and, consequently, voltage regulation. The proposed control algorithm does not use a commutation algorithm when the operating mode changes with the load power variation and, thus, avoids chattering effects. Using the flatness based control method, the fuel cell dynamic and its delivered power is perfectly controlled, and the fuel cell can operate in a safe condition. In the hybrid system, the supercapacitor functions during transient energy delivery or during energy recovery situations. To validate the proposed method, the control algorithms are executed in dSPACE hardware, while analogical current loops regulators are employed in the experimental environment. The experimental results prove the validity of the proposed approach. © 2007.","Energy storage; Flatness; Fuel cell; Hybrid system; Supercapacitor","Electric commutation; Electric currents; Energy storage; Power control; Flatness; Hybrid systems; Power sources; Supercapacitors; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42749090117

The immobilized enzymes were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption measurements and 27Al MAS-NMR spectroscopy. The XRD patterns showed that all enzymes were intercalated into the clay inter-layer space. The entire protein backbone was situated at the periphery of the clay matrix. Intercalation occurred through the side chains of the amino acid residues. A decrease in surface area and pore volume upon immobilization supported this observation. The extent of intercalation was greater for the covalently bound systems. NMR data showed that tetrahedral Al species were involved during enzyme adsorption whereas octahedral Al was involved during covalent binding. The immobilized enzymes demonstrated enhanced storage stability. While the free enzymes lost all activity within a period of 10 days, the immobilized forms retained appreciable activity even after 30 days of storage. Reusability also improved upon immobilization.

Thus, the growth of this decentralized production means greater network load stability problems and requires energy storage, generally using lead batteries, as a potential solution. However, lead batteries cannot withstand high cycling rates, nor can they store large amounts of energy in a small volume. That is why other types of storage technologies are being developed and implemented. This has led to the emergence of storage as a crucial element in the management of energy from renewable sources, allowing energy to be released into the grid during peak hours when it is more valuable. The work described in this paper highlights the need to store energy in order to strengthen power networks and maintain load levels. There are various types of storage methods, some of which are already in use, while others are still in development. We have taken a look at the main characteristics of the different electricity storage techniques and their field of application (permanent or portable, long- or short-term storage, maximum power required, etc.).

The performances being dependent on instantaneous weather condition, photovoltaic sources are usually equipped with an auxiliary energy storage device. There are applications where the opportunity to couple the photovoltaic source with ultracapacitor can be taken into account. The aim of the paper is to study the performances of a hybrid system constituted by photovoltaic and ultracapacitor sources. In particular, the paper deals with the study of the ultracapacitor rate design for photovoltaic systems feeding pulsing loads. The results of the study, which can also be referred to temporary unfavourable weather conditions, have been validated by experimental data. In the final part of the paper, some considerations on economical implications about the dimensioning of a photovoltaic-ultracapacitor systems are drawn. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In order to reduce CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, it is essential to develop carbon capture and storage technologies that lead to zero emissions fossil fuels power plants. Absorption by chemical solvents combined with CO2 long-term storage appears to offer interesting and commercial applicable CO2 capture technology. However, the high regeneration energy requirements make necessary a process optimization in large-scale power plants. Although actual CO2 capture cost remains around 55 €/ton CO2, the target is to maintain this cost below 25 €/ton CO2. This paper proposes different possibilities to overcome the energy requirements by means of amine scrubbing integration into a commercial power plant, and presents a technical and economical analysis of the performance of these approaches. Although some schemes show small efficiency penalties, it becomes essential to calculate specific cost per ton CO2, the main aim is to chose the proper configuration to implement large-scale cost-effective schemes that leads to CO2 capture demonstration projects. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Shirai et al.[4] studied optical characteristics of crystalline silicon nanoparticles. In addition, silicon nanoparticles can be applied for energy devices such as 2nd generation battery. In this paper, we investigated the generation of Si nanoparticles using pulse plasma technology. An inductively-coupled plasma chamber with RF power (13.56 MHz) was designed for this study. DC-bias was applied between the substrate and grounded grid installed above the substrate to increase the particle collection efficiency and to avoid film formation on the substrate, Moreover, in order to control the structure of silicon nanoparticle, we implemented heater inside the substrate. Experiments were performed with various pulse periods to generate nanoparticles with various sizes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to measure the shape, structure and size of nanoparticles. TEM images showed that the generated nanoparticles have spherical shape with highly monodisperse size distribution. The structure is originally amorphous but we could change its structure to crystal by annealing. We employed a widely used plasma technology, so we except that it can be easily applied to industry with small modification.

The additional stability is gained without losing a significant amount of gas storage density as happens in the case of structure II (sII) methane clathrate. Our previous work has showed that the selection of a specific large molecule guest substance (LMGS) as the sH hydrate former is critical in obtaining the optimum conditions for crystallization kinetics, hydrate stability, and methane content. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to provide further insight regarding the dependence of methane occupancy on the type of the LMGS and pressure. Moreover, the preference of methane molecules to occupy the small (512) or medium (43 56 63) cages and the minimum cage occupancy required to maintain sH clathrate mechanical stability are examined. We found that thermodynamically, methane occupancy depends on pressure but not on the nature of the LMGS. The experimentally observed differences in methane occupancy for different LMGS may be attributed to the differences in crystallization kinetics and/or the nonequilibrium conditions during the formation. It is also predicted that full methane occupancies in both small and medium clathrate cages are preferred at higher pressures but these cages are not fully occupied at lower pressures. It was found that both small and medium cages are equally favored for occupancy by methane guests and at the same methane content, the system suffers a free energy penalty if only one type of cage is occupied. The simulations confirm the instability of the hydrate when the small and medium cages are empty. Hydrate decomposition was observed when less than 40% of the small and medium cages are occupied. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Computer simulation; Crystallization kinetics; Free energy; Methane; Molecular dynamics; Molecular structure; Clathrate hydrates; Gas storage density; Large molecule guest substance (LMGS); Nonequilibrium conditions; Gas hydrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349092033

Regression analysis of the observed versus simulated total ecosystem C stocks indicates the model's predictions accounted for 81.1% of the variation in the observed biomass data and for 63.2% of the variation in total ecosystem C data; however, the simultaneous F-test for bias was significant. Discrepancy between the observed and simulated total ecosystem C data was primarily caused by differences in dead organic matter C pool estimates, with the model consistently predicting higher soil C throughout stand development. Changes to model parameters were not warranted however, as the field data measured only a portion of the mineral soil profile represented in the model. Clear-cut and partial-cut harvesting scenarios for red spruce stands were simulated to examine the impacts of clear-cut and partial-cut harvesting on C stocks. Total ecosystem C increased in the partial-cut stand throughout the 240-year simulation from 308.9 to 327.3 Mg C ha-1, while it decreased in the clear-cut stand to 305.8 Mg C ha-1. Enhanced C sequestration in the partial-cut stand was a consequence of the residual standing biomass providing a continuous source of litterfall and reducing decomposition rates of the forest floor. Choice of harvest system clearly affects forest ecosystem C stocks, but also affects the amount of C removed from forests to meet society's needs. Over the period of the simulation, partial cutting provided 115.6 Mg C ha-1 of merchantable timber, while clear-cutting provided 132.4 Mg C ha-1. Strategies aimed at using forest management to mitigate atmospheric C increases need to assess both the direct impacts on the forest ecosystem and the indirect impacts through product and energy substitution associated with the use and storage of harvested biomass. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach From a contingency theory perspective, a survey of 107 Canadian manufacturers was used to collect data that were analyzed through correlation analysis. Findings Results indicate that the ideal e-business profiles vary in the relation to the firms' strategic orientation, whether it is of the defender, analyzer or prospector type. E-business alignment has positive performance outcomes for manufacturing SMEs in terms of growth, productivity and financial performance. Research limitations/implications The nature of the sample impose care in generalizing the results of the study. These results also allow us to emphasise the nature rather than the investment value of the SMEs' information technology investment, given that certain forms of e-business would be more appropriate for certain firms, depending upon their strategic orientation. Practical implications For SME owner-managers that require greater manufacturing flexibility, increased systems integration, products and services of better quality, and higher levels of product and process innovation, the results of this study allow us to prone an examination of their firm's level of e-business assimilation, this being done in conjunction with their strategic intent. Originality/value This is one of the first studies to have used a rigorous conceptualisation and measure of alignment to confirm the theoretical validity and empirical usefulness of this notion and of the strategic contingency approach for research on e-business, and to compare this approach with the universalistic approach founded upon “best practices”. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Business performance; Canada; Electronic commerce; Small to medium-sized enterprises","Alignment; Computer networks; Electric energy storage; Finance; Industrial economics; Industrial engineering; Industry; Information technology; Investments; Manufacture; Multitasking; Planning; Precipitation (meteorology); Publishing; Strategic planning; Technology; Best practices (BP); Business strategies; Contingency theory; Correlation analysis; Design/methodology/approach; E business; Financial performances; Manufacturing flexibility; Practical implications; Process Innovation (PI); Products and services; Small and medium sized enterprise (SME); Strategic alignment; Strategic intent; Strategic orientation; Systems integrations; Technology investments; Electronic commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44849105485

There is not yet a clear answer on the question whether the current obesity epidemic is a consequence of gluttony or sloth. Review studies do not show a reduction of physical activity over the years, and food intake is difficult to measure in daily life conditions. Food intake can only be derived from self-report, where under-reporting of food intake and selective underreporting of fat intake are major issues. Fat intake might be an important factor in the increase of body weight. Many studies suggest the capacity of the body to oxidize dietary fat is a major risk factor for a positive energy balance. Additionally, there is evidence that most of the fat consumed is stored before oxidation. Obesity prone subjects might be characterized by a higher storage of dietary fat. The only way to increase the oxidation of dietary fat, other than consuming more dietary fat, is to increase energy expenditure by an increase of physical activity. Indeed, there are indications that physical activity is an important determinant of fat oxidation. Based on the evidence presented, it is concluded that the obesity epidemic is mainly due to a high dietary intake, especially as fat, and that physical activity can be a tool to modulate the effect of fat intake on body fat. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Box 616, 6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands","Research of the past decade has increased our understanding of the role adipose tissue plays in health and disease. Adipose tissue is now recognized as a highly active metabolic and endocrine organ. Adipocytes are of importance in buffering the daily influx of dietary fat and exert autocrine, paracrine and/or endocrine effects by secreting a variety of adipokines. The normal function of adipose tissue is disturbed in obesity, and there is accumulating evidence to suggest that adipose tissue dysfunction plays a prominent role in the development and/or progression of insulin resistance. Obese individuals often have enlarged adipocytes with a reduced buffering capacity for lipid storage, thereby exposing other tissues to an excessive influx of lipids, leading to ectopic fat deposition and insulin resistance in situations where energy intake exceeds energy expenditure. In addition, adipose tissue blood flow is decreased in obesity. This impairment may affect lipid handling in adipose tissue and, thereby, further contribute to excessive fat storage in non-adipose tissues. On the other hand, adipose tissue hypoperfusion may induce hypoxia in this tissue. Adipose tissue hypoxia may result in disturbances in adipokine secretion and increased macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue, events that are frequently observed in obesity. In this review, it is discussed how enlarged adipocytes, an impaired blood flow through adipose tissue, adipose tissue hypoxia, adipose tissue inflammation and macrophage infiltration are interrelated and may induce insulin resistance. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It can occur in foods and food ingredients at low levels as a result of processing, migration from packaging materials during storage and domestic cooking. A sensitive method for determination of 3-MCPD in foodstuffs using programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) with large-volume injection (LVI) gas chromatography (GC) with tandem mass spectrometry detection (MS/MS) has been developed and optimized. The optimization of the injection and detection parameters was carried out using statistical experimental design. A Plackett-Burman design was used to estimate the influence of resonance excitation voltage (REV), isolation time (IT), excitation time (ET), ion source temperature (IST), and electron energy (EE) on the analytical response in the ion trap mass spectrometer (ITMS). Only REV was found to have a statically significant effect. On the other hand, a central composite design was used to optimize the settings of injection temperature (Tinlet), vaporization temperature (Tvap), vaporization time (tvap) and flow (Flow). The optimized method has an instrumental limit of detection (signal-to-noise ratio 3:1) of 0.044 ng mL-1. From Valencian, Spain, supermarkets 94 samples of foods were surveyed for 3-MCPD. Using the optimized method levels higher than the limit established for soy sauce by the European Union were found in some samples. The estimated daily intake of 3-MCPD throughout the investigated foodstuffs for adults and children was found about 0.005 and 0.01%, respectively, of the established provisional tolerable daily intake. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Structural properties characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed typical polycrystalline structure with primary anatase phase along with elongated pyramid-like grains lying on the film surface and densely packed columnar structure from cross-sectional profile. The XRD preferential peak of (2 1 1) and the Raman peak intensity at ∼640 cm-1 dramatically increased without noticeable broadening and shift as the deposition time was prolonged beyond 2 h. This implies that more perfectly crystalline structure, less internal stress, and comparatively larger grains were obtained by this technique. The Ti2p3/2 and O1s XPS peaks shifted toward higher binding energy suggest that the local chemical state was influenced by the prolonged deposition duration in the film, which resulted in red shift of absorption threshold into visible-light region. Under ultra-violet (UV) and visible-light illumination, the visible-light enabling film exhibited the best photocatalytic activity on MB degradation with the rate-constant of about 0.231 h-1. Hydrophilic conversion rate was estimated to be 8.14 × 10-3 deg-1 min-1 and long-term UV-induced hydrophilicity of ∼10° in the dark storage up to 72 h was observed. In addition to its inherent characteristics of the layered TiO2/ITO structure on hole/electron separation, all these could be attributed to more perfectly formed crystalline structure, densely packed columnar crystals and the surface roughness along with its enlarged surface area. © 2008.","Hydrophilicity; Titanium oxide/tin indium oxide (TiO2/ITO) films; Visible-light","Catalyst activity; Hydrophilicity; Photocatalysts; Surface roughness; Tin compounds; Titanium compounds; Columnar crystals; Hole/electron separation; Titanium oxide/tin indium oxide (TiO2/ITO) films; Visible light; Oxide films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42749087485

Absorption follows sigmoidal-shaped trends, whose slope points out a dependence of hydriding rate on the milling conditions. The amorphous powders display a linear correlation between the reciprocal of the semi transformation period and the milling intensity. This suggests that the process is ruled by the total mechanical energy delivered to the powder, and the same mechanochemical energy is necessary to activate the absorption. The decrease of the mechanochemical yield with the milling intensity was related to the different thermal stability of the hydrogenated specimens.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a key role in the RAS by converting angiotensin I to the bioactive peptide angiotensin II (Ang II). In the present study, the effect of targeting the RAS in body energy homeostasis and glucose tolerance was determined in homozygous mice in which the gene for ACE had been deleted (ACE-/-) and compared with wild-type littermates. Compared with wild-type littermates, ACE-/- mice had lower body weight and a lower proportion of body fat, especially in the abdomen. ACE-/- mice had greater fed-state total energy expenditure (TEE) and resting energy expenditure (REE) than wild-type littermates. There were pronounced increases in gene expression of enzymes related to lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation (lipoprotein lipase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase, long-chain acetyl CoA dehydrogenase) in the liver of ACE-/- mice and also lower plasma leptin. In contrast, no differences were detected in daily food intake, activity, fed-state plasma lipids, or proportion of fat excreted in fecal matter. In conclusion, the reduction in ACE activity is associated with a decreased accumulation of body fat, especially in abdominal fat depots. The decreased body fat in ACE-/- mice is independent of food intake and appears to be due to a high energy expenditure related to increased metabolism of fatty acids in the liver, with the additional effect of increased glucose tolerance. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","ACE knockout mice; Fatty acid metabolism; Glucose tolerance; Obesity","carnitine palmitoyltransferase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; leptin; lipoprotein lipase; long chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; glucose; hormone; animal experiment; article; body composition; body weight; calorimetry; controlled study; energy balance; energy expenditure; enzyme activity; fat content; fatty acid oxidation; female; food intake; gene deletion; gene expression; glucose tolerance; glucose tolerance test; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipolysis; locomotion; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; adipose tissue; animal; biological model; blood; chemistry; drinking; energy metabolism; enzymology; feces; feeding behavior; gene expression regulation; genetics; histology; liver; metabolism; motor activity; organ size; Mus; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Composition; Body Weight; Calorimetry; Drinking; Energy Metabolism; Feces; Feeding Behavior; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucose; Glucose Tolerance Test; Hormones; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Mice; Models, Biological; Motor Activity; Organ Size; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Physical Conditioning, Animal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349141660

The specified ultimate vacuum in 10-10 mbar range was achieved. This vacuum deteriorates with the injection of electron beam into the storage ring mainly due to photon induced desorption (PID). Initially, the PID yield may be as high as 10-1 molecules/photon and the resultant dynamic pressure rise may be very high. However, the PID yield decreases with beam cleaning, provided by beam dose accumulation. For Indus-2, initially 550 MeV electron beam was injected and by now more than 5.8 A.Hr beam dose has been accumulated. The maximum beam current stored was 72.81 mA at 550 MeV. Once the beam energy was ramped up to 2.4 GeV also, but regular ramping was restricted to 2 GeV. The maximum current was 51 mA at 2 GeV. Since the Indus-2 has eight unit cells, any one-unit cell is a representative of entire storage ring. This paper shows the dynamic pressure rise behaviour of one of them. The pressure rise per mA of beam current has been measured and compared at different stages of beam dose accumulation. Variation in the values of PID yield with beam dose has also been studied. The specific dynamic pressure rise calculations were done for both the GDC cleaned as well as non-GDC cleaned dipole chambers. For non-GDC cleaned chambers these values were larger by more than one order of magnitude. This paper discusses the details of dynamic pressure rise behaviour of Indus-2 in its initial stages of commissioning. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149474129

Surface properties are extremely important in this case. i.e., surface finish should be maintained without any blisters and micro cracks, after baking. In order to evaluate these factors, one sample was prepared (SS pipe plated with copper) and tested with simulated conditions in UHV environment.

Besides, fast transient response time is also achieved because phase margin equals to 60 degree is always maintained by the MQ and AZC techniques.

However, it has one main drawback of requiring an erase before updating the contents. Furthermore, flash memory can only be erased limited number of times. To overcome limitations, flash memory needs a software layer called flash translation layer (FTL). The basic function of FTL is to translate the logical address from the file system like file allocation table (FAT) to the physical address in flash memory. In this paper, a new FTL algorithm called an efficient and advanced spacemanagement technique (EAST) is proposed. EAST improves the performance by optimizing the number of log blocks, by applying the state transition, and by using reallocation blocks.

Although this technology can be applied to both concentrating technologies, parabolic through and central receiver sys tems (CRSs), CRS technology can take advantages from its higher concentration, allowing to work at higher temperatures and therefore with a reduction in the size and cost of the storage system. The receiver system is the ""door"" for which the energy passes from the field collector to the thermal-electric cycle; it represents, therefore, the core of the CRS and its performance directly affects plant production. Starting from the published lessons from SOLAR TWO receiver technology, the validation of an improved receiver for molten salt technology was assumed as part of the SOLAR TRES solar thermal power commercial plant development. Main challenges for the new receiver were to increase its allowable peak flux up to 1 MW/m2 in order to maximize the thermal efficiency of the CRS solar power plant, and to improve its safe life without limiting the incident fluxes that the field of heliostats is able to deliver with an optimized pointing strategy. Several advanced features in geometric and thermodynamic aspects and in its material selection have been implemented on the receiver. With the results of a sensitivity analysis carried out with an own code developed by SENER (SENREC), a prototype receiver panel was designed, fabricated, and installed in a proper test bed at the PSA. Test validation on this panel was carried out in 2007. The initial test results show a very good behavior of the prototype receiver, which allows to anticipate that the objectives of its design can be fulfilled. SENER and CIEMAT have joined forces to face up the challenge of sizing and designing a new molten salt receiver of high thermal efficiency, able to operate at high fluxes without compromising its durability (at least 25 years). Main challenges for the new receiver design were to optimize the receiver dimensions and receiver tube sizes and material selection to surpass the operating conditions in the new plants with respect to SOLAR TWO.

The combination of this concept and the choice of molten salts as the heat transfer fluid, in both the receiver and heat storage, enables solar collection to be decoupled from electricity generation better than water/steam systems, yielding high capacity factors with solar-only or low hybridization ratios. These advantages, along with the benefits of Spanish legislation on solar energy, moved SENER to promote the 17 MWe Solar TRES plant. It will be the first commercial CRS plant with molten-salt storage and will help consolidate this technology for future higher-capacity plants. This paper describes the basic concept developed in this demonstration project, reviewing the experience accumulated in the previous Solar TWO project, and present design innovations, as a consequence of the development work performed by SENER and CIEMAT and of the technical conditions imposed by Spanish legislation on solar thermal power generation.

Box 14155-4777, Tehran, Iran","A feasibility study of using solar liquid-desiccant air conditioner (LDAC) developed in Queensland has been undertaken. The system uses high effectiveness cross-flow polymer plate heat exchanger (PPHE), as the absorber unit. Outside air is dehumidified by strong liquid desiccant and indirectly cooled within the PPHE. The warm dry air is, subsequently, cooled and humidified through a direct evaporative cooler and supplied to the conditioned space. The weak desiccant solution from the absorber unit is concentrated in a scavenger air regenerator using hot water from flat plate solar collectors. The prototype of the absorber unit of the liquid-desiccant system has been tested under the summer conditions of Brisbane, using lithium chloride as the absorbent solution. The results of the experiments indicate that they are in good agreement with a previously developed model for the absorber unit. The tests further reveal that the unit has a satisfactory performance in controlling the air temperature and relative humidity when installed on a commercial site of 120 m2 area in Brisbane. A commercialization strategy has been proposed in this study for a solar operated LDAC in Queensland and compared with the conventional direct expansion (DX) system. Based on the computer modeling results obtained from the system simulation for a building in Cairns, North Queensland, the operating costs of the LDAC are significantly lower than its conventional DX counterpart. This study further reveals that using the solar operated LDAC with a storage system will result in considerable savings in operating costs when compared with the equivalent gas-fired system. A simple payback of five years was determined for the solar componentsin this study.

The main issues of these vehicles are the energy management system and the overall fuel economy. An overview of the existing solutions with respect to their overall efficiency is reported in the paper. On the bases of the literature results, the more efficient powertrain scheme has been selected. The present investigation aims at identifying the best control strategy to power a vehicle with both fuel cell and battery to reduce fuel consumption. The optimization of the control strategy is achieved by using a genetic algorithm. To model the powertrain behavior an on purpose made simulation program has been developed and implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK. In particular, the fuel cell model is based on the theory of Amphlen et al. (1995, ""Performance Modeling of the Ballard Mark IV Solid Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell. II. Empirical Model Development,"" J. Electrochem. Soc., 142(1)) whereas the battery model also accounts for the charge/discharge efficiency. The analyzed powertrain is equipped with an energy recovery system. During acceleration, power is demanded to the storage system, while during deceleration the battery is recharged. All the tested control strategies assume charge sustaining operation for the battery and that the fuel cell system has to work around its maximum efficiency. All the tested strategies have been validated on four driving cycles.

Since this species does not accumulate fat, hoarded food is the sole source of energy used during hibernation and inactive periods. Because hoards can be very large, they offer chipmunks the possibility of forgoing aboveground foraging when seeds or nuts are not abundant on the forest floor. Here, we present evidence that at least 82 chipmunks in two different populations interrupted aboveground activity for 9-11 months when mast was not available. A large hoard of American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) nuts established during the preceding year appeared to allow these chipmunks to cease foraging for almost a full year when food availability was particularly low. This extended period of inactivity is among the longest reported for a hibernating mammal, and demonstrates complex interactions between past, current, and future resource availability in shaping the seasonal activity patterns of food-storing hibernators. © 2008 NRC.",,"activity pattern; caching; deciduous tree; food storage; hibernation; masting; resource availability; rodent; seasonal variation; Fagus; Fagus grandifolia; Mammalia; Tamias striatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44449168550

The TL studies on polycrystalline sample of this phosphor show a double peak structure with maxima centered at 89 °C and a shoulder at around 133 °C when excited with UV radiation. Maximum TL intensity is observed at Pr concentration of 0.25 mol%. The UV exposure time is varied in a wide range from 10 s to 24 h and practically no shift in Tm is observed. Tm-Tstop and E-Tstop methods suggest that there are eight trapping levels operative in this phosphor with energy values varying between 0.5 and 1.0 eV. These values are used as input for CGCD procedure and trapping parameters are evaluated. The glow curve is found to be composed from linear superposition of eight peaks. The figure of merit (FOM) during fitting procedures is found to be around 1.6%. Higher fading rates are observed for peak centered on 89 °C while the peak at 133 °C is found to show 30% fading after 6 days of storage time. Decay studies carried out on the present phosphor reveal a multi-exponential contribution. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In order to design new hydrogen storage materials with the larger capacity, we need to investigate the change of hydrogen adsorption according to the change of the aromatic linkers. We calculated the electronic structure of full framework of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) using density functional theory calculations, and analyzed the interactions of hydrogen molecules with the aromatic organic linkers, and zinc-oxo clusters. The comparison of binding energies and pairing energies showed that more hydrogen molecules could be adsorbed on the organic linker with a larger surface area, and this adsorption was stable. The simulation results also indicate that the steeper slope at the initial stage of adsorption in the MOFs can be related to the larger binding energy between metal cluster sites and hydrogen molecules. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition each node checks all received requests. This approach reduces the latency of cache to cache transfer misses at the expense of increasing power. In this paper we show that a large portion of interconnect/cache transactions are redundant as many snoop requests miss in the remote nodes. We exploit this inefficiency and introduce power optimization techniques for chip multiprocessors. Our optimizations rely on the observation that in a snoopy-based shared memory system the data supplier can be predicted with high accuracy. Our optimizations reduce power by eliminating unnecessary activity at both the requester and the supplier end of snoop requests. We reduce power as we (a) avoid broadcasting snoop requests to all processors and (b) avoid tag lookup for all nodes and for all requests arriving. In particular, we use supplier locality and introduce the following two optimizations. First, and at the requester end, we introduce speculative selective request (SSR) to reduce power dissipation in the binary tree interconnect. In SSR, we send the request only to the node more likely to have the missing data. We reduce power as we limit access only to the interconnect components between the requestor and the supplier node. Second, and at the supplier end, we propose speculative tag lookup (STL) to reduce power dissipation in data caches. We filter those accesses more likely to miss in the L1 cache. Using shared memory applications, we show that by limiting snoop requests to the speculated nodes we reduce interconnect power by 25% in a four-way multiprocessor. Moreover, we show that speculative tag lookup reduces power in tag arrays by 14.1% in a four-way multiprocessor. Both optimizations come with negligible performance loss and hardware overhead. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in UCP-3 might result in a reduced function or expression of UCP-3 and therefore lead to an increased capacity to store energy as fat. Design: We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional single-center study among 400 Dutch men between 40 and 80 years. Methods: Seven SNPs in the UCP-3 gene were genotyped by means of an allele-specific real-time TaqMan PCR. Linear regression analyses were performed to examine the independent effects of these SNPs on obesity phenotypes. Results: We found a significant association between homozygosity for the minor allele of rs647126, rs1685356, and rs2075577 and an increase in body mass index (BMI; P=0.033, P=0.016, and P=0.019 respectively). Heterozygosity for rs1685354 was associated with a significant decrease in visceral fat mass (P = 0.030). Conclusions: Our results suggest that genetic variations in the UCP-3 gene are associated with an increase in BMI. A plausible mechanism by which these SNPs lead to an increase in BMI is that due to these SNPs, the UCP-3 activity might be decreased. As a result, uncoupling activity may also decrease, which will lead to an increase in body weight and BMI. © 2008 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.",,"adenosine triphosphate; uncoupling protein 3; adult; aerobic metabolism; aged; allele; anthropometric parameters; article; body fat distribution; body mass; body weight; enzyme activity; gene expression; gene function; genetic association; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; heterozygosity; homozygosity; human; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; molecular mechanics; nucleic acid synthesis; obesity; pathophysiology; phenotype; population research; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; single nucleotide polymorphism; thermogenesis; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Humans; Ion Channels; Male; Middle Aged; Mitochondrial Proteins; Netherlands; Obesity; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43149118987

The geometry consists of a positive DC voltage wire to cylinder electrostatic precipitator with a porous cathode. The end of the device is closed, which enables all the treated gas to pass through the filtering cathode. Owing to its very small storage surface, the cathode acts like a simple agglomerator. We demonstrate that this agglomerator is sufficiently effective for the re-entrained particles not to be measurable with an electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI), which means that they are both very few in number and largely micronic. The system can function with very short residence times, comparable with the charging times of the treated particles. Energy densities of about 1 J/l are used to achieve a number reduction exceeding 90% on the submicron fraction of particles. It seems that the nature of the cathode has very little influence on particle number decrease. Owing to its compactness, this process displays good potential for the treatment of diesel particles. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To obtain a predictive model of polymer radio-oxidation during several centuries, the first step consists to elaborate the elementary degradation mechanisms. Thus, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and gas mass spectrometry were carried out to identify radicals, chemical modifications, and gases to reach the radio-oxidative mechanism at doses inferior than 1000 kGy. Degradation mainly occurs at urethane bonds and in polyether soft segments that produces stable oxidative products as formates, alcohols, carboxylic acids and H 2, CO2 and CO gases.

Clinical trials have shown that CB1 receptor blockers are able to reduce not only food intake but also abdominal adiposity and its metabolic sequelae. Accordingly, CB1 receptors, and tissue concentrations of endocannabinoids sufficient to activate them, are present in all brain and peripheral organs involved in the control of energy balance, including the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, pancreas, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. At the central level, the endocannabinoid system seems to play a dual role in the regulation of food intake by hedonic and homeostatic energy regulation. At the peripheral level, the endocannabinoid system seems to behave as a system that reduces energy expenditure and directs energy balance towards energy storage into fat. The emerging role of the endocannabinoid system in energy balance at both central and peripheral levels will be discussed in this review. © 2008 The Authors.

The phonon dispersions are determined within the density functional framework and are used to calculate the free energy of MgH2 within the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA) at each cell volume and temperature T. Using the free energies the thermal equation of state (EOS) is derived at several temperatures. From the thermal EOS structural parameters such as the equilibrium cell volume (V0) and elastic properties, namely, bulk modulus (K0) and its pressure derivative (K0′) are computed. The free energies are also used to calculate various thermodynamical properties within QHA. These include internal energy E, entropy S, specific heat capacity at constant pressure CP, thermal pressure Pthermal(V, T) and volume thermal expansion ΔV/V (%). The good agreement of calculated values of S and CP with experimental data exhibits that QHA can be used as a tool for calculating the thermodynamical properties of MgH2 over a wide temperature range. Pthermal(V,T) increases strongly with T at all the volumes but it is a slowly varying function of volume for T = 298-500 K. According to Karki [B.B. Karki, Am. Miner. 85 (2000) 1447] such volume based variations can be neglected and so it is possible to estimate the thermal EOS only with the knowledge of the measured Pthermal(V, T) versus temperature at ambient pressure and isothermal compression data at ambient temperature. Temperature dependence of ΔV/V(%) shows that V0 increased with increase in temperature. However, the percentage decrease in K0 superseded this percentage increase in V0 even at temperatures moderately higher than 298 K. Therefore, we suggest application of temperature (T &gt; 298 K) as an approach to enhance the hydrogen storage capacity of MgH2 because of its better compressibility at these temperatures. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A simulator of the collector field produced by the last author has been available to and used as a test-bed for control strategies. Up to now, however, there is not a model for the whole plant. Such model is needed for hierarchical control schemes also proposed by the authors. In this paper a model of the thermal storage tank is derived using the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation technique to adjust the parameters of a serial grey-box model structure. The benefits of the proposed approach are discussed in the context of the intended use, requiring a model capable of simulating the behavior of the storage tank with low computational load and low error over medium to large horizons. The model is tested against real data in a variety of situations showing its performance in terms of simulation error in the temperature profile and in the usable energy stored in the tank. The results obtained demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (enzyme therapy) leads to a decrease in resting energy expenditure, but its influence on weight and risk of development of type II diabetes is unknown. We studied the BMI, prevalence of overweight, insulin resistance and type II diabetes in untreated and enzyme therapy treated Gaucher patients before and after several years of follow-up and compared this to data on healthy subjects from literature. We established that in untreated Gaucher patients the prevalence of overweight is lower than in the general population. Long-term treatment with enzyme therapy induces a larger than average weight gain leading to a similar prevalence of overweight in enzyme therapy treated patients and the general population. The prevalence of type II diabetes increases significantly during treatment with enzyme therapy, resulting in a comparable prevalence of type II diabetes in enzyme therapy treated patients and the general population. © 2007.","Enzyme replacement therapy; Insulin resistance; Overweight; Type I Gaucher disease; Type II diabetes mellitus","enzyme; adult; article; body mass; controlled study; enzyme replacement; follow up; Gaucher disease; human; insulin resistance; long term care; major clinical study; medical literature; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; population; prevalence; priority journal; weight gain; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Gaucher Disease; Glucosylceramidase; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Middle Aged; Overweight; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41949110081

In contrast with Mb, however, its heme is hexacoordinated (6c). It is expressed in the nervous system and has been the subject of numerous investigations in the last years, but its function is still unclear. The proposed roles include oxygen transport, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, hypoxia protection, and redox state sensing. All proposed functions require distal histidine dissociation from the heme to yield a reactive iron. With the aim of understanding the 6c to 5c transition, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations for ferrous Ngb in the 6c, 5c, and oxy states. We also computed free energy profiles associated with the transition employing an advanced sampling technique. Finally, we studied the effect of the redox state of CysCD7 and CysD5, which are known to form a disulfide bridge. Our results show that protein oxidation promotes a stabilization of the pentacoordinated species, thus favoring the protein to adopt the more reactive state and supporting the existence of a molecular mechanism whereby O2 would be released under hypoxic conditions, thereby suggesting an O2 storage function for Ngb. Taken together, our results provide structural information not available experimentally which may shed light on the protein proposed functions, particularly as a redox sensor. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Globin; Heme protein; Hexacoordination; Molecular dynamics; Neuroglobin","cysteine; disulfide; heme; hemoprotein; histidine; iron; myoglobin; neuroglobin; oxygen; protein; reactive oxygen metabolite; article; comparative study; detoxification; hypoxia; kinetics; molecular biology; molecular dynamics; molecular stability; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidation reduction state; oxygen transport; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein structure; sampling; sensor; Animals; Computer Simulation; Crystallography, X-Ray; Globins; Heme; Histidine; Humans; Ligands; Mice; Models, Molecular; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149121750

The weight of the fish and the type of the extender affected the nutritional quality of the patties. Cooking lowered the crude protein but increased the total lipid, total soluble sugars, and gross energy contents of the patties. Cooking yield increased with an increase in the weight of the fish. Similarly, the use of corn flour as the extender resulted in a higher cooking yield and higher fat retention capacity than boiled potato. The type of extender had no effect on the water-holding capacity of the patties. The weight of the fish and the extender had no significant effect on appearance, colour, flavour, taste, and the overall acceptability of the product.

The abundance of OH in forsterite was determined using polarized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results show that OH solubility in forsterite increases with temperature only at 2.5 GPa. At 6 and 9 GPa, the OH solubility reaches a maximum at temperatures of 1175 to 1250 °C, depending on pressure, and then decreases at higher temperatures. Such behaviour is explained by the change of water activity in the fluid due to dissolution of silicate component. Using OH concentrations measured on subsolidus samples we determined the thermodynamic parameters of OH incorporation in forsterite, such as change in internal energy and entropy. We find almost constant ΔE of 37.1 ± 6.7 kJ/mol and ΔS of 82.8 ± 6.8 J/mol/K. These parameters together with a ΔVsolids of 10.6 cm3/mol are used to calculate the fugacity of the real fluid (i.e. water + silicates) and compare it to the fugacity of pure water. Our results imply that estimates of water storage capacity at mantle depths greater than 80 km and above ~ 1250 °C should be substantially reduced compared to models that assume that water is a pure fluid. © 2008.","olivine; solubility; storage capacity; water activity","Forsterite; Water storage capacity; Dissolution; Pressure effects; Silicates; Solubility; Thermal effects; Thermodynamics; Olivine; entropy; experimental mineralogy; forsterite; FTIR spectroscopy; fugacity; high pressure; high temperature; hydroxide; P-T conditions; solubility; water storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41449092259

Since Sudlow's pioneering works on the ligand-binding sites, a major effort of the biophysical/ biochemical research has been directed to characterize the structural, functional, and dynamical properties of this protein. Structural studies on HSA have revealed distinct temperature-induced folded states. Despite knowing about the ligand-binding properties and residues important for the binding, less is understood about the temperature-dependent molecular recognition of the protein. Here, we have prepared thermally induced unfolded states of the protein and characterized those by circular dichroism (CD) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) techniques. The change in the globular structure of the protein as a consequence of thermal unfolding has also been characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. We have used two fluorescent ligands (4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(p-dimethylaminostyryl) 4H-pyran) (DCM; hydrophobic; neutral) and Nile blue (NB; cationic) of different natures to characterize the ligand-binding properties of the protein in the native and thermally unfolded states. The possible binding sites of the ligands have been characterized by competitive binding with other drug molecules having definite binding sites in HSA. Picosecond-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies along with steady-state and polarization-gated spectroscopies on the ligands in the protein reveal the dynamics of the binding sites at various temperatures. From the FRET studies, an attempt has been made to characterize the simultaneous binding of the two ligands in various temperature-dependent folded states of HSA. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding energy; Biochemistry; Body fluids; Cadmium compounds; Cardiovascular system; Chemotherapy; Dichroism; Differential thermal analysis; Drug delivery; Drug dosage; Dyes; Dynamic light scattering; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Ligands; Molecular biology; Molecular recognition; Molecules; Optical properties; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; (p ,p ,t) measurements; American Chemical Society (ACS); Biochemical research; Circular dichroism (DC); Circulatory systems; Competitive binding (CB); Dicyanomethylene; Differential-thermal analysis (DTA); Drug molecules; Dynamic light scattering (DLC); Dynamical properties; Folded states; Globular structures; Human Serum Albumin (HSA); Ligand binding; ligand binding sites; Nile blue; pico seconds; Resonance-energy transfer (RET); Soluble proteins; Structural studies; temperature dependent; Temperature-induced; Binding sites; ligand; serum albumin; solvent; article; chemical structure; chemistry; circular dichroism; human; metabolism; protein folding; protein quaternary structure; spectrofluorometry; temperature; thermodynamics; time; Circular Dichroism; Humans; Ligands; Models, Molecular; Protein Folding; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Serum Albumin; Solvents; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Temperature; Thermodynamics; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45549084946

Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 and Zr69.5Cu12Al7.5Ni11 compositions were studied. The process began with a milling induction period, during which neither gaseous uptake nor structural modifications were observed, then, according to an s-shaped kinetics, sorption reached the maximum rate, approaching finally the asymptotic value of 1.5 H/M wt.%. Specific kinetic features were depending on the starting materials. As a result of the absorption, the amorphous alloys of both the compositions promoted the segregation of crystalline δ-ZrH1.66 phase, which was paralleled by the formation of an amorphous hydride of depleted Zr composition, with relative abundance of the two hydrides 45:55. The different thermodynamic stabilities of the two hydrides were evidenced by calorimetric analyses. While desorption started below 400 K in the metastable one, conversely the crystalline δ-ZrH1.66 decomposed only above 1070 °C. Faster absorption kinetics and different structural reconstruction path characterised the hydrogenation of the Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 nanocrystalline alloy. Starting from a mixture of two nanosized fcc phases, with similar (Cu, Al, Ni)Zr2 composition, a single fcc H-(CuAlNi)Zr2 phase was formed, which reversibly desorbed H2, restoring the two initial phases. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

On some general properties of trophic networks. Ecol. Model. 99, 7-17] is developed and used for investigating dynamic regimes of carbon cycle functioning in a typical boreal transitional bog ecosystem. Ecosystems are often represented by static ""storage-flow"" diagrams reflecting their structure and matter or energy transfer between components at fixed time moments. Using the data of such diagrams aggregated in ecological field studies one can construct a dynamic model of the ecosystem to predict its future behaviour and to estimate a response to external perturbations-natural and human. Stability of both current equilibrium and possible alternative steady states and more complicated attractors are studied under two types of parameter perturbation: CO2 atmospheric concentration increase initiated by greenhouse effect, and change in the rate of carbon output from dead organic matter and litter which depends on the water table level and possible peat excavation. Calculation of bifurcation curves gives areas in the parameter space where stable functioning of carbon cycle is provided. Steady states can be interpreted as raised bog, meadow, forest and fen. CO2 concentration increase leads the current state of transitional bog to loose stability with appearance of oscillatory dynamics and further evolution to the chaotic attractor. The model is rich by chaotic solutions serving as transition regimes between regular steady and periodic attractors. Another chaotic regime is formed from forest equilibrium and exists in the same area of phase space where current equilibrium is stable. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The distribution of RuO2 NPs on CNT surfaces deduced from N-induced defect sites is the key point in controlling the capacitive characteristics of CNT-RuO2 nanocomposites (NCs).

Three supercells, namely, 2 x 2 x 2, 3 x 1 x 1 and 5 x 1 x 1 are used for generating configurations with varying amounts (fractions x = 0.0625, 0.1, and 0.167) of impurities. The analyses of band structure and density of states (DOS) show that, when a Mg atom is replaced by Al, the band gap vanishes as the extra electron occupies the conduction band minimum. In the case of Si-substitution, additional states are generated within the band gap of pure MgH2 - significantly reducing the gap in the process. The reduced band gaps cause the Mg-H bond to become more susceptible to dissociation. For all the fractions, the calculated reaction energies for the stepwise removal of H2 molecules from Al- and Si-substituted MgH 2 are much lower than for H2 removal from pure MgH 2. The reduced stability is also reflected in the comparatively smaller heats of formation (ΔHf) of the substituted MgH 2 systems. Si causes greater destabilization of MgH2 than Al for each x. For fractions x = 0.167 of Al, x = 0.1, 0.167 of Si (FCC) and x = 0.0625, 0.1 of Si (diamond), ΔHf is much less than that of MgH2 substituted by a fraction x = 0.2 of Ti (Y. Song, Z. X. Guo, R. Yang, Mat. Sc. &amp; Eng. A 2004, 365, 73). Hence, we suggest the use of Al or Si instead of Ti as an agent for decreasing the dehydrogenation reaction and energy, consequently, the dehydrogenation temperature of MgH2, thereby improving its potential as a hydrogen storage material. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

The computational cost of producing the two-body density matrix is proportional to O (M3 k2 + M2 k4). The method is based on the assumption that different elements of the two-body density matrix can be calculated during different steps of a sweep. Hence, it is desirable that the wave function at the convergence does not change during a sweep. We discuss the theoretical structure of the wave function ansatz used in DMRG, concluding that during the one-site DMRG procedure, the energy and the wave function are converging monotonically at every step of the sweep. Thus, the one-site algorithm provides an opportunity to obtain the two-body density matrix free from the N -representability problem. We explain the problem of local minima that may be encountered in the DMRG calculations. We discuss theoretically why and when the one- and two-site DMRG procedures may get stuck in a metastable solution, and we list practical solutions helping the minimization to avoid the local minima. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Algorithms; Computational methods; Convergence of numerical methods; Cost accounting; Problem solving; Requirements engineering; Storage allocation (computer); Wave functions; Density matrix renormalization; Two body density matrice; Matrix algebra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149181748

Cyan FPs (CFPs), widely used in multicolor imaging or as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor to yellow FPs (YFPs), were considerably less optimal than other FPs because of some relatively poor photophysical properties. We recently initiated an effort to create improved or alternate versions of CFPs. To address the limitations of CFPs, an alternative known as monomeric teal FP1 (mTFP1) was engineered from the naturally tetrameric Clavularia CFP, by screening either rationally designed or random libraries of variants. mTFP1 has proven to be a particularly useful new member of the FP 'toolbox' by facilitating multicolor live cell imaging.

Recently, accurate measurements of spectral properties for the series of chromophores in different media allowed the authors to estimate the positions of the bands with a high accuracy and to challenge theoreticians by stating that the measured S0-S1 transition wavelengths may be used as new benchmark values for the theory. The novel computational approaches based on the multiconfigurational quasidegenerate perturbation theory present the practical means how to adapt the high level methodology for calculations of accurate excitation energies in large biological chromophores. The theory is illustrated for a series of model compounds for which experimental data are available: the retinal molecule in the protonated Sniff-base form, the chromophores from the Green Fluorescent Protein family including the kindling protein asFP595, and the chromophore from the BLUF domain containing photoreceptor proteins.","Biological chromophores; Molecular modeling; Optical spectra; QM/MM; Quantum chemistry","Computational methods; Gases; Optical image storage; Accurate measurements; Biological chromophores; gas phase; high accuracy; Modeling spectra; optical imaging; Optical spectrum; Small animals; Spectral properties; Whole body (WB); Chromophores",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149169067

Two models for the pores have been considered: (i) The inner walls of (7,7) carbon nanotubes and (ii) the highly curved inner surface of nanotubes capped on one end. The effect of Li doping is investigated in all cases. The hydrogen physisorption energies increase due to the concavity effect inside the clean nanotubes and on the bottom of the capped nanotubes. Li doping also enhances the physisorption energies. The sum of those two effects leads to an increase by a factor of almost 3 with respect to the physisorption in the outer wall of undoped nanotubes and in flat graphene. Application of a quantum-thermodynamical model to clean cylindrical pores of diameter 9.5 Å, the diameter of the (7,7) tube, indicates that cylindrical pores of this size can store enough hydrogen to reach the volumetric and gravimetric goals of the Department of Energy at 77 K and low pressures, although not at 300 K. The results are useful to explain the experiments on porous carbons. Optimizations of the pore size, concavity, and doping appear as promising alternatives for achieving the goals at room temperature. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Density functional theory; Doping (additives); Hydrogen storage; Lithium compounds; Mathematical models; Physisorption; Thermodynamics; Concavity; Physisorption energies; Nanopores",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149126967

They consist of 2 or more rigid domains joined by a flexible linker. Understanding the conformational space of fusion proteins conferred by the flexible linkers is important to predicting its behavior. In this paper, we introduce a modeling tool called FPMOD (Fusion Protein MODeller) which samples the conformational space of fusion proteins by treating all domains as rigid bodies and rotating each of them around their flexible linkers. As a demonstration, FPMOD was used to predict the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency of three different fusion protein biosensors. The simulation results of the FRET efficiency prediction were consistent with the in vito experimental data, which verified that FPMOD is a valid tool to predicting the behavior of fusion proteins.","Computational modeling; Fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Green fluorescent protein; Imaging; Protein biosensors","Biomolecules; Biosensors; Biotechnology; Chemicals; Detectors; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fluorescence; Forecasting; Fusion reactions; Imaging techniques; Nuclear physics; Optical image storage; Proteins; Space probes; Technology; Conformational spaces; Diverse applications; Experimental data; Flexible linkers; Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRETS); Fusion proteins; Modeling tools; optical imaging; Rigid body (RB); Rigid domains; simulation results; Small animals; Whole body (WB); Data fusion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149088896

We use grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation for modeling of CF4 encapsulation at 300 K and pressures up to 2 bar. We find that the amount of adsorbed CF4 strongly depends on the pore size in nanotubes; at 1 bar the most efficient nanotubes for volumetric storage have size R = 0.68 nm.This size corresponds to the (10,10) armchair nanotubes produced nowadays in large quantities. For mass storage (i.e., weight %) the most efficient nanotubes have size R = 1.02 nm corresponding to (15,15) armchair nanotubes. They are better adsorbents than currently used activated carbons and zeolites, reaching ≈2.4 mol kg -1 of CF4, whereas, the best activated carbon Carbosieve G molecular sieve can adsorb 1.7 mol kg-1 of CF4 at 300 K and 1 bar. We demonstrate that the high enthalpy of adsorption cannot be used as an only measure of storage efficiency. The optimal balance between the binding energy (i.e., enthalpy of adsorption) and space available for the accommodation of molecules (i.e., presence of inaccessible pore volume) is a key for encapsulation of van der Walls molecules.

We anticipate that use of reservoir engineering to accelerate dissolution can reduce the risks of CO2 storage by reducing the duration over which buoyant free-phase CO2 is present underground.

In all these polymers, at higher acceptor concentrations, direct energy transfer from acriflavine to rhodamine-6G followed the Förster theory, which is indicated by the agreement in the values of the observed critical transfer distance with that calculated from spectral overlap. On the other hand, at low acceptor concentrations, the excitation energy migration influences the kinetics, resulting in a significantly higher value of the observed critical transfer distance, which is explained on the basis of Loring et al. (Loring, R. F.; Anderson, H. C.; Fayer, M. D. J. Chem. Phys. 1984, 80, 5731-5744) and Huber (Huber, D. L. Phys. Rev. B: Condens. Matter Mater. Phys. 1979, 20 2307-2314) theories. It was observed that the spectral overlap for donor-donor transport (excitation migration) and donor-acceptor transfer (energy transfer) and thereby other energy transfer parameters were influenced by the microenvironment of the polymers. The efficiency of energy transfer (η) was the highest in PMMA and the lowest in PVA. Further, the study of acceptor dynamics under energy transfer showed that the rise time of the acceptor also depends on the nature of the polymer microenvironment. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemicals; Electric excitation; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Excitation energy; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Photoresists; Polymers; Semiconducting gallium compounds; (e ,2e) theory; Acceptor concentrations; American Chemical Society (ACS); Anderson; Cellulose acetate (CA); Direct energy transfer (DET); Donor acceptor (D A); Energy migration (EM); Energy transfer parameters; Excitation energy transfer (EET); Excitation migration; Micro environments; Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA); Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOL); Rhodamine 6G (R6G); Rise time; Room-temperature (RT); Spectral overlaps; Time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy; Bioconversion; fluorescent dye; polymer; polyvinyl alcohol; rhodamine; rhodamine 6G; article; chemical structure; chemistry; energy transfer; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; physical chemistry; Chemistry, Physical; Energy Transfer; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Fluorescent Dyes; Molecular Structure; Polymers; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Rhodamines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46149100670

From total energy calculations, we show that-in contrast to the other boranates and alanates-hydrogen desorption directly to the elements is likely and is at least competitive with desorption to the elemental hydride (BeH2). The formation enthalpy of Be (BH4) 2 is only -0.14 eV/ H2 (at T=0 K). This low value can be rationalized by the participation of all atoms in the covalent bonding, which is in contrast to the ionic bonding observed in other boranates.

Box 1, Petten, 1755 ZG, Netherlands","Hydrogen, generated from renewable sources, is likely to play a major role in the future energy supply. The storage and transport of hydrogen can take place in its free form (H2), or chemically bound, e.g. as methane. However, the storage and transport of hydrogen in its free form is more complex, and probably would require more energy than the storage and transport of hydrogen in chemical form. An additional important advantage of the indirect use of hydrogen as energy carrier is, that in the future renewable energy supply, parts of the existing large-scale energy infrastructure could still be used. Production of Substitute Natural Gas (SNG) by biomass hydrogasification has been assessed as a process for chemical storage of hydrogen. Thermodynamic analysis has shown the feasibility of this process. The product gas of the process has a Wobbe-index, a mole percentage methane, and a calorific value quite comparable to the quality of the Dutch natural gas. With a hydrogen content below 10 mol%, the produced SNG can be transported through the existing gas net without any additional adjustment. The integrated system has an energetic efficiency of 81% (LHV). In the long term, the required hydrogen for this process can be produced by water electrolysis, with electricity from renewable sources. In the short term, hydrogen may be obtained from hydrogen-rich gases available as by-product from industrial processes. Results of thermodynamic analysis of the process and experimental work, application potentials of the process in The Netherlands, and plans for future development are presented. © 2001 by Blackwell Science Ltd.

The structural characterization of Ag-CHT nanobioconjugates was done using steady-state UV-vis absorption/ photoluminescence spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. By use of the spherical jellium model, the emission energy of CHT-conjugated Ag NCs was correlated with the number of atoms in the cluster and was found to be almost consistent with the experimental result. To establish the conformational changes of the enzyme before and after the conjugation of Ag NCs, circular dichroism studies were performed. The functional integrity of the enzyme conjugated to Ag NCs was investigated by monitoring the enzymatic activity of Ag-CHT conjugates by using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and compared with the unbound enzyme under similar experimental conditions. To confirm the conjugation of Ag NCs to CHT, we carried out the Förster resonance energy transfer studies using a fluorescent probe, 4-nitrophenyl anthranilate, known to bind at the enzymatic active site of CHT, as the donor and Ag-NC-bound CHT as the acceptor.

PCMs have been widely used in latent heat thermal storage systems for heat pumps, agricultural greenhouse, solar cooker, solar water heating systems, solar air heating systems, waste heat recovery system and spacecraft thermal control applications. There are large numbers of PCMs that melt and solidify at a wide range of temperatures, making them attractive in a number of applications.

By the NARMAX approach, causations within engine parameters can be modeled. The relationship between injection pressure and fuel rate and the variation from fuel rate to engine speed are both detected to understand the novel hydraulically actuated electronic unit injection (HEUI) system and its effects on engine performance. The dynamics of the two causations are first investigated in time domain to estimate the non-linear models which will be validated from model predicted output, correlation tests and cross-validation tests. The frequency domain analysis is then studied by mapping the discrete-time NARMAX models into generalized frequency response functions (GFRFs) responsible for the non-linear coupling between the various input spectral components and the energy transfer mechanisms in the system. Through the above steps, the interpretation of the higher-order GFRFs has been comprehensively studied and the non-linear effects have also been related to the physical models of the systems.","Dynamic behavior; GFRFs; NARMAX","Composite structures; Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Dynamics; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Engines; Frequency domain analysis; Machine design; Mathematical models; Mechanisms; Models; Photomapping; Testing; Time domain analysis; Transfer functions; Correlation tests; Cross-validation tests; Discrete-time; Dynamic behavior; Engine dynamics; Engine parameters; Engine performances; Engine speeds; Fuel rates; Generalized frequency response functions; GFRFs; Higher-order; Injection pressures; NARMAX; NARMAX models; Non-linear couplings; Non-linear effects; Non-linear modeling; Nonlinear autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs; Physical modelling; Spectral components; Time domain OCT; Transfer mechanisms; Turbo-charged diesel engine; Frequency response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349119373

One important aspect of this research deals with optimization of inertial fusion targets design. Here, the role of a thin heavy metal layer as a protector against preliminary heating of compressed thermonuclear fuel by thermal X-ray radiation can be mentioned as one particular topic to be properly understood. In this paper, the results of our studies of such a thin layer influence on the laser-produced energy deposition in the flyer foils as well as on the hydrodynamic motion of the foils as a hole will be reported. A 0.4 m thick gold layer was located between an aluminum layer of 6 m thickness and mylar layer with thickness of 2.5 m, used here as an ablator. For comparison, the flyer target without the gold layer but of the same area density was employed. Two different target constructions were used: (1) with a 2mm gap separating the foil and the massive targets for measuring the foil velocity and (2) with gaps of 50, 100 and 200 m for laser energy transfer efficiency measurements. Targets were irradiated by laser beam energies of 100J in the case of the first harmonic, and by laser beam energies 120J in the case of the third one using the Prague Asterix Laser System iodine laser. The interaction spot radius of 200 m and the laser pulse duration of 250ps were employed in these experiments. A three-frame interferometric and shadowgraphic system was set-up as to measure velocities of the rear side of the foils and to determine electron density distributions at different stages of plasma evolution. Volumes of craters produced by collisions of accelerated foils with a massive aluminum block were used as an indicator of the laser energy transfer efficiency into the foils of both types. These experiments have shown that the presence of the thin gold layer causes a decrease of the flyer velocity by a factor of 1.2 for both the harmonics. However, in the case of the first harmonic, the energy transfer into the flyer with the gold layer is higher (compared with the flyers without the gold layer) only for the targets with smaller gaps. In the case of the third harmonic, about 10% decrease in the amount of energy transferred into the foil with the gold layer was observed.","Crater; Energy transfer; Flyer target; Interferometric system; Iodine laser; Shock wave","Alumina; Aluminum; Chemical lasers; Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Experiments; Fluid dynamics; Fluid mechanics; Fusion reactions; Gold; Harmonic analysis; Heating; Heavy metals; Iodine; Laser beams; Laser fusion; Laser pulses; Lasers; Light metals; Metals; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear physics; Soldered joints; Targets; Ablator; Aluminum block; Applied physics; Area density; Beam energies; Crater; Electron density distributions; Energy depositions; First harmonic; Flyer target; Flyer velocity; Gold layers; Hydrodynamic motions; Inertial fusion targets; Interferometric system; Iodine laser; Iodine lasers; Laser energies; Laser-pulse durations; Metal layers; Multi layering; Plasma evolution; Prague asterix laser system; Rear side; Shock wave; Shock waves; Spot radius; Thick gold layer; Thin layering; Third harmonics; X-ray radiations; Pulsed laser applications",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49449099961

It employs the concept of architecture and circuit co-design. For achieving an energy-efficient TCAM architecture, the hierarchy search-line scheme and butterfly match-line scheme are proposed. The hierarchy search-line scheme realizes more power reduction by decreasing not only switching activities but also capacitance on search lines. The butterfly match-line scheme connects each pipelined stage in a butterfly style which significantly decreases both search time and power consumption. Moreover, the match-lines are also implemented by a noise-tolerant XOR-based conditional keeper to reduce not only search time but power consumption. Furthermore, in order to reduce increasing leakage power with advanced technologies, the proposed TCAM design employs a super cut-off power gating technique and multi-mode data-retention power gating technique to reduce leakage currents. These two techniques can reduce cell leakage power significantly in standby mode. In addition to the super cut-off power gating technique, it also decreases leakage currents in searching operations without reducing search time and destroying noise margin. An energy-efficient 256×144 TCAM array is designed in 65nm Berkeley Predictive Technology Model (BPTM), and the simulation results show the leakage power reduction is 70.7% and the energy metric of the TCAM macro is 0.047 fJ/bit/search.","Hierarchy search-line; Leakage power; Memory; Power gating; TCAM","Associative storage; CMOS integrated circuits; Conservation; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Evaporative cooling systems; Logic gates; Microprocessor chips; Networks (circuits); Static random access storage; Advanced technologies; Berkeley predictive technology model (BPT); Cell leakage; Co designs; Cut-off; Data-retention; Energy efficient; High speeds; Leakage power; Leakage power reduction; Low powers; Macro design; Match-line scheme; Multi modes; Noise margin (NM); Noise-Tolerant; Power consumption (CE); Power gating; Power reductions; Search line (SL); Search time; Simulation results; Standby modes; Switching activities; TCAM architecture; Ternary content addressable memory (TCAM); Leakage currents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249110313

Assuming the formation of inclusion complexes of 1:1 stoichiometry, these properties were modeled and provided the stability constants of CD/NA inclusion complexes and the corresponding property change. The binding of NA with the smallest sized α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) generates more stable complexes accompanied by the lower volume and the heat capacity changes. These results are in agreement with earlier proposed binding mode according to which deep insertion of NA into α-CD takes place and it is governed by the hydrophobic-hydrophilic forces.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of dietary myristic acid, which represents 9% to 12% of fatty acids in milk fat, on the storage of α-linolenic acid and its conversion to highly unsaturated (n-3) fatty acid derivatives. Five isocaloric diets were designed, containing equal amounts of α-linolenic acid (1.3% of dietary fatty acids, i.e. 0.3% of dietary energy) and linoleic acid (7.0% of fatty acids, i.e. 1.5% of energy). Myristic acid was supplied from traces to high levels (0%, 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% of fatty acids, i.e. 0% to 6.6% of energy). To keep the intake of total fat and other saturated fatty acids constant, substitution was made with decreasing levels of oleic acid (76.1% to 35.5% of fatty acids, i.e. 16.7% to 7.8% of energy) that is considered to be neutral in lipid metabolism. After 8 weeks, results on physiological parameters showed that total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol did not differ in the diets containing 0%, 5% and 10% myristic acid, but were significantly higher in the diet containing 30% myristic acid. In all the tissues, a significant increasing effect of the substitution of oleic acid for myristic acid was shown on the level of both α-linolenic and linoleic acids. Compared with the rats fed the diet containing no myristic acid, docosahexaenoic acid significantly increased in the brain and red blood cells of the rats fed the diet with 30% myristic acid and in the plasma of the rats fed the diet with 20% myristic acid. Arachidonic acid also increased in the brain of the rats fed the diet with 30% myristic acid. By measuring Δ6-desaturase activity, we found a significant increase in the liver of the rats fed the diet containing 10% of myristic acid but no effect at higher levels of myristic acid. These results suggest that an increase in dietary myristic acid may contribute in increasing significantly the tissue storage of α-linolenic acid and the overall bioavailability of (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids in the brain, red blood cells and plasma, and that mechanisms other than the single Δ6-desaturase activity are involved in this effect. © 2008 The Animal Consortium.","Δ6-desaturase; (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism; Dietary myristic acid; Rat","Animalia; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41849109128

Two experimental lines of rainbow trout, selected for a lean (L) or fat (F) muscle, were fed with diets containing either 10 or 23% lipids from the first feeding, up to 6 mo. At the end of the feeding trial, trout were distinguished by very different muscle fat content (from 4.2 to 10% wet weight), and line X diet interactions were observed for parameters related to fat storage. We analyzed the activity and gene expression of key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (fatty acid synthase, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 isoforms, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α) and glycolysis (hexokinase 1 and pyruvate kinase) as well as energy production (isocitrate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and cytochrome oxidase) in the liver and the white muscle of rainbow trout. The lipid-rich diet repressed the activity of the lipogenic enzymes and stimulated enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis in liver but had little effect on muscle enzymes assessed in this study. Regarding the selection effect, enzyme activity and expression suggest that compared with the L line, the F line presented reduced hepatic fatty acid oxidation as well as reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacities and enhanced glucose utilization in both liver and muscle. Very few line X diet interactions were found, suggesting that the two factors (i.e., dietary energy content and selection) used in this study to modify muscle lipid content exerted some additive but mostly independent effects on these metabolic actors.

It is therefore essential that a maintenance scheduling optimizer can incorporate the options of shortening the maintenance duration and/or deferring maintenance tasks in the search for practical maintenance schedules. In this article, an improved ant colony optimization-power plant maintenance scheduling optimization (ACO-PPMSO) formulation that considers such options in the optimization process is introduced. As a result, both the optimum commencement time and the optimum outage duration are determined for each of the maintenance tasks that need to be scheduled. In addition, a local search strategy is presented in this article to boost the robustness of the algorithm. When tested on a five-station hydropower system problem, the improved formulation is shown to be capable of allowing shortening of maintenance duration in the event of expected demand shortfalls. In addition, the new local search strategy is also shown to have significantly improved the optimization ability of the ACO-PPMSO algorithm.","Ant colony optimization; Heuristics; Local search; Power plant maintenance scheduling","Algorithms; Energy storage; Heuristic methods; Maintenance; Optimization; Scheduling; Ant colony optimization; Local search; Power plant maintenance scheduling; Hydroelectric power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549102911

However, some applications at least, could actually benefit from stability being strongly dependent on a suitable environment variable, in such a way that enhanced stability or decreased stability could be realized as required. In therapeutic applications, for instance, a long shelf-life under storage conditions may be convenient, but a sufficiently fast degradation of the protein after it has performed the planned molecular task in vivo may avoid side effects and toxicity. Undesirable effects associated to high stability are also likely to occur in food-industry applications. Clearly, one fundamental factor involved here is the kinetic stability of the protein, which relates to the time-scale of the irreversible denaturation processes and which is determined to some significant extent by the free-energy barrier for unfolding (the barrier that ""separates"" the native state from the highly-susceptible-to-irreversible-alterations nonnative states). With an appropriate experimental model, we show that strong environment-dependencies of the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities can be achieved using robust protein engineering. We use sequence-alignment analysis and simple computational electrostatics to design stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, the latter introducing interactions between like charges which are screened out at high salt. Our design procedures lead naturally to mutating regions which are mostly unstructured in the transition state for unfolding. As a result, the large salt effect on the thermodynamic stability of our consensus plus charge-reversal variant translates into dramatic changes in the time-scale associated to the unfolding barrier: from the order of years at high salt to the order of days at low salt. Certainly, large changes in salt concentration are not expected to occur in biological systems in vivo. Hence, proteins with strong salt-dependencies of the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities are more likely to be of use in those cases in which high-stability is required only under storage conditions. A plausible scenario is that inclusion of high salt in liquid formulations will contribute to a long protein shelf-life, while the lower salt concentration under the conditions of the application will help prevent the side effects associated with high-stability which may potentially arise in some therapeutic and food-industry applications. From a more general viewpoint, this work shows that consensus engineering and electrostatic engineering can be readily combined and clarifies relevant aspects of the relation between thermodynamic stability and kinetic stability in proteins. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Free-energy barriers; Kinetic stability; Protein stability; Salt effects","sodium chloride; amino acid sequence; article; biology; concentration (parameters); drug industry; electricity; environmental factor; experimental model; food industry; kinetics; liquid; mutation; priority journal; protein engineering; protein folding; protein interaction; protein stability; sequence alignment; shelf life; storage; surface charge; thermodynamics; Kinetics; Protein Denaturation; Protein Engineering; Proteins; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549116348

Geological media suitable for CO2 storage through various physical and chemical trapping mechanisms must have the necessary capacity and injectivity, and must confine the CO2 and impede its lateral migration and/or vertical leakage to other strata, shallow potable groundwater, soils and/or atmosphere. Such geological media are mainly oil and gas reservoirs and deep saline aquifers that are found in sedimentary basins. Storage of gases, including CO2, in these media has been demonstrated on a commercial scale by enhanced oil recovery operations, natural gas storage and acid gas disposal. Some of the risks associated with CO2 capture and geological storage are similar to, and comparable with, any other industrial activity for which extensive safety and regulatory frameworks are in place. Specific risks associated with CO2 storage relate to the operational (injection) phase and to the post-operational phase, of which the risks of most concern are those posed by the potential for acute or chronic CO2 leakage from the storage site. Notwithstanding the global climate effect of CO2 returning to the atmosphere, the local risks to health and safety, environment and equity need to be properly assessed and managed. Currently there are very few operations in the world where CO2 is injected and stored in the ground, mostly if not exclusively as a by-product of an operation driven by other considerations than climate change, such as oil production or regulatory requirements regarding H2S. These operations show that there are no major technological barriers to CO2 geological storage, and that challenges and barriers lie elsewhere. A major challenge in the implementation of CO2 geological storage is the high cost of CO2 capture, particularly for dilute streams like those from power plants and industrial combustion processes. There are concerns that public opinion and public's acceptance or rejection of this technology will likely affect the large-scale implementation of CO2 geological storage. The current paucity of policy, legislation and a proper regulatory framework in most jurisdictions is presently the most significant barrier. The resolution of these challenges will affect the economics and financial risk of CO2 geological storage and will accelerate or delay the deployment of this technology for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

It has been demonstrated that for the development of a latent heat storage system (LHTS) in a building fabric, the choice of the PCM plays an important role in addition to heat transfer mechanism in the PCM. Increasing the thermal storage capacity of a building can enhance human comfort by decreasing the frequency of internal air temperature swings, so that the indoor air temperature is closer to the desired temperature for a longer period of time. This paper attempts to study the thermal performance of an inorganic eutectic PCM based thermal storage system for thermal management in a residential building. The system has been analyzed by theoretical and experimental investigation. Experiments are also conducted by circulating water through the tubes kept inside the PCM panel to test its suitability for the summer months. In order to achieve the optimum design for the selected location, several simulation runs are made for the average ambient conditions for all the months in a year and for the various other parameters of interest. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The set is modelled as a plant controlled by the converter duty cycle. In addition to allow setting the plant operating point at any point of its characteristic curve (two interesting points are maximum efficiency and maximum power points), this approach also allows the connection of the fuel cell to other energy generation and storage devices, given that, as they all usually share a single DC bus, a thorough control of the interconnected devices is required. First, the state and transfer function models of the fuel cell and the converter are obtained. Then, both models are related in order to achieve the fuel cell+DC/DC converter set (plant) model.

If the lifetime of the atomic excitation is much longer than the pulse duration, the pulse shape is nicely reproduced at the output of a thick sample for pulses with smooth envelopes. Pulses with sharp edges are fairly reproduced at the output. Each abrupt change of the pulse amplitude is followed by transients, which are delayed together with the pulse.

One possible solution to overcome this problem is to use a data compression technique where an image is viewed as a matrix and then the operations are performed on the matrix. Image compression is achieved by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique on the image matrix. The advantage of using the SVD is the property of energy compaction and its ability to adapt to the local statistical variations of an image. Further, the SVD can be performed on any arbitrary, square, reversible and non reversible matrix of m × n size. In this paper, SVD is utilized to compress and reduce the storage space of an image. In addition, the paper investigates the effect of rank in SVD decomposition to measure the quality in terms of MSE and PSNR. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Computer applications; Digital image storage; Image quality; Singular value decomposition; Energy compaction; Image matrix; Non reversible matrix; Statistical variations; Image compression",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149152373

In this study, we have investigated the circuit optimization strategy for vibration-based piezoelectric energy scavenging systems that supply the electric power to wireless sensors and electronics for ubiquitous sensor networks. In this paper, we assert that not only the mechanical to electrical energy conversion efficiency, but also the speed of energy storage is important in designing and evaluation of energy scavenging system, since the energy scavenging system with higher speed of energy storage has faster start up response to the mechanical input and can supply required power more frequently. Particularly in case of piezoelectric micropower generator, we show that the low reverse leakage current characteristic rather than the low forward voltage drop of the rectifying diodes is much more beneficial to improve conversion efficiency and that the storage capacitor should be as small as possible to reduce the time to store required amount of energy. Experimental and PSPICE results show that, when ultra-low leakage current diodes are adopted for a bridge rectifier, the mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency is doubled or more in some cases, and the charging speed is increased by 20%, compared to the circuit that adopts Schottky diodes. It is also found that, compared to the circuit with larger storage capacitor, the circuit with smaller storage capacitor requires shorter time to store the same amount of energy and can drive voltage regulator more frequently. This study suggests that low reverse leakage diode and small storage capacitor should be used to build efficient high performance piezoelectric energy scavenging systems for ubiquitous sensor networks.","Energy scavenging; High energy conversion efficiency; Microwatt level power; Piezoelectric effect; PVDF; Ultralow leakage diode; Vibration; Wireless sensors","Conversion efficiency; MEMS; Piezoelectricity; Scavenging; Sensors; Voltage control; Energy scavenging; High energy conversion efficiency; Microwatt level power; Ultralow leakage diode; Wireless sensors; Electric power utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149150156

Nano-scale physical and chemical interactions govern the packing of self-assembled amphiphilic molecules, resulting in thermodynamically stable phases of defined geometries. Possible phases include micellar, hexagonal, cubic, lamellar and sponge phases. The internal nano-structure of the amphiphile self assembly materials play an important role in the properties of these systems and their application. To date small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) has been the most common technique used to characterise their structure. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) offers a possible alternative technique as it is sensitive to both the internal cavities and the intermolecular forces and in combination with SAXS, may provide more detailed structural information such as trends with composition and temperature variations. The phase behaviour of a bulk phytantriol sample, consisting of 33 % w/w water was explored using PALS, and it was found that PALS was sensitive to phase transitions from bicontinuous cubic (Pn3m) to reversed hexagonal (H2) to reversed micellar (L2) phases. These boundaries agreed well with SAXS data. Trends observed for the PALS parameters τ3 and I3 as a function of temperature largely supports the concept that the ortho-positronium is annihilating in the organic regions of the self-assembled structure. However, further investigation is required. We have also developed an innovative data analysis technique to analyse PALS spectra for pore information, with the aim of minimising operator bias and error, which leads to better quantitative comparison of PALS results between laboratories.","Amphiphile; Phase transition; Phytantriol; Positron","Amphiphiles; Drug delivery; Energy storage; Self assembled monolayers; Thermodynamic stability; X ray scattering; Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS); Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS); Temperature variations; Positron annihilation spectroscopy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149130378

The relevant ingredients involved in the Förster rate for RET, namely electronic coupling, spectral overlap, and screening effects, are accounted for in a quantitative manner. Electronic couplings are obtained from time-dependent density functional theory calculations, and the effect of the PMMA environment is included both on the transition densities and on their interaction through the IEFPCM model. We find that the presence of the terphenyl bridge induces a slight delocalization of the PDI and TDI transition densities over the bridge originating in a 56% increase in the coupling and in the breakdown of the dipole-dipole approximation. The spectral overlap is determined on the basis of a detailed simulation of the homogeneously broadened donor emission and acceptor absorption line shapes determined by fitting the single molecule spectra measured at 1.2 K. The corresponding distribution of spectral overlap throughout the ensemble is then estimated by assuming an uncorrelated inhomogeneous line broadening for the donor and acceptor. Combining the calculated electronic couplings and spectral overlaps sampled from Monte Carlo realizations of the energetic disorder, we obtain a mean RET time (∼8 ps) and a distribution in reasonable agreement with experiment. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption; Bridges; Couplings; Curve fitting; Emission spectroscopy; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Experiments; Interchanges; Probability density function; Absorption lines; American Chemical Society (ACS); Breakdown (BD); Delocalization; Dipole dipole; Donor acceptor (D A); Donor and acceptor; Electronic couplings; Electronic energy transfer (EET); Inhomogeneous line; Low temperature (LTR); Monte Carlo (MC); Perylene diimide; Reasonable agreement; Screening effects; Single molecule (SM); SPECTRA (CO); Spectral overlaps; Terphenyl; Terrylene; Time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT); Transition (Jel Classifications:E52 ,E41 ,E31); Uncorrelated; Density functional theory; article; chemical model; chemical structure; electron; energy transfer; temperature; Electrons; Energy Transfer; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549128242

At 77 K 1′ behaves as a molecular sieve, selectively adsorbing H 2 over N2, possibly due to size-exclusion reasons. At variance, although CO2 molecules are slightly larger than the pore size, they are readily incorporated by 1′ at temperatures as high as 433 K. Variable-temperature X-ray powder diffraction (TXRPD) studies, in the temperature range 303-473 K, show that dehydration is reversible and has almost negligible effects on the network. At variance, the uptake of CO2 occurs through a transient phase and channels expansion. While the gas storage capacity of 1′ is not very high-H2, 0.56 wt % and 0.010 kg H2/L at 90 K and 900 Torr, and CO2, 7.6 wt % at 273 K and 900 Torr - the guest molecules achieve very high densities, comparable to that of the liquid for H2 (0.023 vs 0.021 molecules Å-3) and to that of the solid for CO2 (0.014 vs 0.022 molecules Å-3). In addition, we have also studied the effect of the perturbation exerted by the guest molecules on its magnetic properties. The results show that while dehydration of 1 has negligible effect on its spin-canted antiferromagnetic behavior, CO2 incorporation in the pores is responsible for an increment of the transition temperature at which the weak ferromagnetic ordering takes place from 22 to 29 K. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Ultramicroporous coordination polymer; Void volume; Zeolitic gismondine (GIS); Activation energy; Coordination reactions; Dehydration; Magnetic properties; Polymers; Superconducting transition temperature; X ray powder diffraction; Copper compounds; 5 fluoropyrimidin 2 olate; carbon dioxide; copper; ferromagnetic material; polymer; unclassified drug; article; chemical modification; dehydration; powder diffraction; transition temperature; X ray diffraction; Adsorption; Carbon Dioxide; Copper; Hydrogen; Magnetics; Models, Molecular; Nitrogen; Organometallic Compounds; Porosity; Powder Diffraction; Pyrimidines; Surface Properties; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149143099

Surface analysis and characterization of the plasma-treated PET films is performed using contact angle measurements, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The polymer films, modified with the DBD at medium and atmospheric pressure, show a significant decrease in water contact angle due to the incorporation of oxygen-containing groups, such as C-O and O-C=O. Results also show that the surface treatment is uniform at micron scales, despite the fact that the discharge consists of a series of microdischarges. It is shown that at low energy densities (&lt; ± 200 mJ/cm2), plasma treatment at medium pressure is more energy-efficient in incorporating oxygen functionalities than plasma treatment at atmospheric pressure. This effect could be induced by the larger diameter of the microdischarges at medium pressure than at atmospheric pressure (factor 3.92) and/or by the lower quenching of atomic oxygen in three-body collisions at medium pressure. The ageing behaviour of the plasma-treated PET films during storage in air is also studied in this paper. XPS results reveal that during the ageing process the induced oxygen-containing groups re-orientate into the bulk of the material.

Without a suitable diffusion barrier, various kinds of Al-Cu intermetallic compounds were formed, even after annealing at 200°C for 30 min. Sheet resistance measurements, X-ray diffractometry, and cross-sectional view transmission electron microscopy analysis combined with energy-dispersive spectroscopy consistently showed that the insertion of a 10-nm-thick IPVD- TiNx or IPVD- TaNx layer between the two layers retarded the interdiffusion of Al and Cu during the annealing at 400 or 450°C, respectively, for 30 min in a high vacuum (<5× 10-5 Torr). Noticeably, ALD- WNx prepared using a sequential supply of B2 H6, WF6, and NH3, could effectively prevent the interdiffusion of Al and Cu and the formation of Al-Cu intermetallic compounds up to an annealing temperature of 550°C for 30 min. © 2008 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Aluminum; Copper; Diffusion barriers; Physical vapor deposition; X ray diffraction analysis; Ionized physical vapor deposition (IPVD); Transition metal nitride thin films; Data storage equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40849086399

Objective: The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of adding a resistance training program (RT) to a restrictive diet (RD) on liver lipid accumulation and abdominal fat depots in ovariectomized (Ovx) rats. Methods: One group of sham-operated and three groups of Ovx rats were compared. Five weeks after surgery, Ovx rats were either submitted to an ∼25% RD with or without RT for 3 or 8 weeks, while a third group of Ovx rats were fed ad libitum and remained sedentary. The RT program consisted of climbing a 6 m vertical metal grill five times a week with an increasing load up to 75% of body weight attached to the tail. The number of repetitions increased from two to four sets of 10 repetitions. Results: Ovariectomy resulted in significantly higher (P < 0.01) body weight, energy intake, intra-abdominal fat depots, plasma leptin levels (P < 0.05), and liver triacylglycerol concentrations. All of these responses were (P < 0.01) reduced in Ovx rats following the RD with the exception of liver lipid infiltration. The addition of RT to the RD treatment synergistically reduced abdominal fat deposition and plasma-free fatty acid levels. Moreover, liver lipid infiltration was completely prevented by the addition of the RT program. Muscle mass relative to body weight was significantly increased in Ovx-RD-RT compared to all other groups. Conclusion: It is concluded that RT is an asset to minimize the deleterious effects of ovarian hormone withdrawal on liver lipid accumulation and abdominal fat accumulation in Ovx rats. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

These high-voltage spinel compounds were prepared by the mechanochemical process, and the synthetic condition was optimized for the best electrochemical performance. It is believed that the high homogeneity of the mixture prepared by mechanical activation helps the synthesis of the phase-pure LiNi0.5-xMn1.5-yMx+yO4 compound. The doping with the transition metal can enhance the electrochemical properties of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 because the large bonding energy between the transition metal and the oxygen prevents the doped spinel from being oxygen-deficient during the high temperature synthesis process, leading to the structural and chemical stability in LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. The XRD patterns for the doped materials exhibited no impurity phase such as LizNi1-zO commonly found in original LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 probably due to this structural stability of the doped materials. In addition, it is inferred that the improved cyclic performance is mainly attributed to the reduction of the Jahn-Teller distortion by substituting some portion of the high spin Mn3+ ions with other transition metal and less Mn dissolution of the doped spinel into the electrolyte, which effectively reduces the increase of impedance during the electrochemical cycling. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The properties of the S-N bond, which are central to the physiological role of RSNOs in the storage and transport of nitric oxide, are highlighted. Following corrections for quadruple excitations, core-valence correlation and relativistic effects, the CCSD(T) method extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit yielded values of 1.85 Å and 29.2 kcal mol-1 for the S-N bond length and the dissociation energy for homolysis of the S-N bond, respectively, in the energetically most stable trans-conformer of HSNO. The properties of the S-N bond strongly depend on the basis-set size and the inclusion of triple, and, to a lesser extent, quadruple excitations in the coupled cluster expansion. CCSD calculations systematically underestimate the S-N equilibrium distance and S-N bond dissociation energy by 0.05-0.07 Å and 6-7 kcal mol-1, respectively. The significant differences between the CCSD(T) and CCSD descriptions of HSNO, the high values of the coupled cluster T1 (0.027) and D1 (0.076) diagnostics, as well as the instability of the reference restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) wavefunction indicate that the electronic structure of the SNO group possesses multireference character.

The equations that define the problem lead to a non-convex non-linear programming problem with a high number of continuous and discrete variables. Consequently, the resolution of the problem based on combinatorial methods is rather hard. The required heuristics, introduced to assure the feasibility of the constraints, are analyzed, along with a brief description of the proposed genetic algorithm (GA). The GA is used to compute the optimal on/off status of thermal units and the fitness function is obtained by solving a quadratic programming problem by means of a standard non-linear Interior Point (IP) method. The results from real-world cases based on the Spanish power system are reported, which show the good performance of the proposed algorithm, taking into account the complexity and dimensionality of the problem.

Reaction of the electrochemically derived o-quinone on the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 6-mercaptopurine (MPU) on a Au electrode gives a redox-active 4-(6-mercapto-purin-9-yl)benzene-1,2-diol (MPBD) self-assembly under optimized conditions. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance technique has been employed to follow the functionalization of the electrode in real time. Electrochemically derived o-quinone reacts at the N(9) position of the self-assembled MPU in neutral pH. Raman spectral measurement confirms the reaction of o-quinone on MPU self-assembly. MPBD shows a well-defined reversible redox response, characteristic of a surface-confined redox mediator at 0.21 V in neutral pH. The anodic peak potential (E pa) of MPBD shifts by -60 mV while changing the solution pH by 1 unit, indicating that the redox reaction involves two electrons and two protons. The surface coverage (Γ) of MPBD was 7.2 ± 0.3 x 10 -12 mol/cm2. The apparent heterogeneous rate constant (ksapp) for MPBD was 268 ± 6 s-1. MPBD efficiently mediates the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and ascorbate (AA).

The authors explore, the opportunities for energy storage for the integration of large-scale wind power into a future lay-out of the Dutch generation system, for which minimum-load problems are foreseen with high wind power penetrations. A central unit commitment and economic despatch model is extended with models for three large-scale energy storage technologies: pumped hydro accumulation storage (PAC), underground PAC and compressed air energy storage. Furthermore, an alternative solution is investigated, comprising the installation of heat boilers at selected combined heat and power locations (CHP) in order to increase the operational flexibility of these units. Results are shown for different wind power penetrations and scenarios. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the operation cost savings from energy storage increase with the amount of wind power installed. Taking into account the large investment costs, energy storage units are however unlikely to have a profitable exploitation. The installation of heat boilers at CHP locations is found to be more efficient and a promising solution for the integration of large-scale wind power in the Netherlands. A notable result is that for the Dutch system, the use of energy storage increases the system's overall CO2 emission levels because energy storage allows storing power from cheap coal plants for substitution of expensive gas during peak. Even though often proposed as a solution for wind power integration, energy storage in fact partly annuls CO2 emission savings by wind power. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2008.",,"Compressed air; Economic analysis; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Power generation; Combined heat and power locations; Compressed air energy storage; Pumped hydro accumulation storage; Wind power penetrations; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40249106119

Experimental results show the possibility of using the converter with input vibrations across a wideband frequency spectrum, improving the effectiveness of the overall energy conversion over the case of a single converter.

In this temperature range, solar thermal systems have a great scope of application. However, the challenge lies in the integration of a periodic, dilute and variable solar input into a wide variety of industrial processes. Issues in the integration are selection of collectors, working fluid and sizing of components. Application specific configurations are required to be adopted and designed. Analysis presented in this paper lays an emphasis on the component sizing. The same is done by developing a design procedure for a specific configuration. The specific configuration consists of concentrating collectors, pressurized hot water storage and a load heat exchanger. The design procedure follows a methodology called design space approach. In the design space approach a mathematical model is built for generation of the design space. In the generation of the design space, design variables of concern are collector area, storage volume, solar fraction, storage mass flow rate and heat exchanger size. Design space comprises of constant solar fraction curves traced on a collector area versus storage volume diagram. Results of the design variables study demonstrate that a higher maximum storage mass flow rates and a larger heat exchanger size are desired while limiting storage temperature should be as low as possible. An economic optimization is carried out to design the overall system. In economic optimization, total annualized cost of the overall system has been minimized. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through an illustrative example. It has been shown that 23% reduction in the total system cost may be achieved as compared to the existing design. The proposed design tool offers flexibility to the designer in choosing a system configuration on the basis of desired performance and economy. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study examines the ground-based signatures of the magnetosphere-ionosphere disturbances during the recovery phase of the very intense storm on 7-8 November 2004. The recovery phase took place under steady and slightly negative (∼-5 nT) values of the IMF B z. We compare this event with previously documented storm recovery phases occurring under positive IMF Bz and accompanied by morning Pc5 geomagnetic pulsations. During the period studied in this article the strongest pulsation activity was recorded in the evening and midnight sectors of the Earth. We analyze observations from the Scandinavian multipoint ground-based instrumentation: (1) geomagnetic variations and pulsations, (2) auroras in visual wavelengths, and (3) energetic particle precipitation (riometer data). We show that several enhancements in electrojet, auroral, and energetic precipitation activity were recorded at auroral latitudes. The activations lasted 0.5-2 hours, and the associated negative magnetic field deviations were often more than 1000 nT. Only one of these activations shows typical substorm behavior (poleward expansion and geostationary particle injection). We demonstrate remarkably good correlation between the magnetic variations and cosmic noise absorption variations (in pulsations and slower variations) as well as between the optical auroras and cosmic noise absorption (Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies riometer system) both in time and in space. Thus the auroral precipitation revealed a very coherent behavior over a wide energy range (∼1-40 keV) during the analyzed period. The images acquired by the network of MIRACLE all-sky cameras show that the auroral distribution exhibited double oval configuration during our event. Double oval is often observed during so-called Steady Magnetospheric Convection (SMC) episodes. Furthermore, multiple auroral streamers were recorded, implying probable occurrence of bursty bulk flows (BBFs) in the magnetotail. The absence of recurrent geostationary injections, the wide oval configuration, and BBF signatures lead us to suggest that the intermediate period between the two November 2004 superstorms can be attributed to a SMC period. Mapping the motion of ionospheric signatures to the magnetotail with the Tsyganenko 96 models suggests BBF earthward speeds of ∼600-800 km/s. We suppose that the main drivers for the above described recurrent and intensive ionospheric phenomena are energy input from the solar wind due to slightly negative values of IMF Bz as well as huge energy storage in the magnetotail due to the previous storm main phase.

Such systems provide a significant increase of electric energy production in the peak hours; the charge of the cool thermal storage is performed instead during the night time. The inlet air cooling system also allows the plant to reduce power output dependence on ambient conditions. A 127 MW combined cycle power plant operating in the Italian scenario is the object of this investigation. Two different technologies for cool thermal storage have been considered: ice harvester and stratified chilled water. To evaluate the performance of the combined cycle under different operating conditions, inlet cooling systems have been simulated with an in-house developed computational code. An economical analysis has been then performed. Different plant location sites have been considered, with the purpose to weigh up the influence of climatic conditions. Finally, a parametric analysis has been carried out in order to investigate how a variation of the thermal storage size affects the combined cycle performances and the investment profitability. It was found that both cool thermal storage technologies considered perform similarly in terms of gross extra production of energy. Despite this, the ice harvester shows higher parasitic load due to chillers consumptions. Warmer climates of the plant site resulted in a greater increase in the amount of operational hours than power output augmentation; investment profitability is different as well. Results of parametric analysis showed how important the size of inlet cooling storage may be for economical results.

The fuel chars were obtained by pyrolysis in a fixed-bed reactor at a temperature of 1373 K for 30 min. The gasification tests were carried out by thermogravimetric analysis (TG) at different temperatures and steam concentrations. The reactivity study was conducted in the kinetically controlled regime and three representative gas-solid models, volumetric model (VM), grain model (GM) and random pore model (RPM), were applied in order to describe the reactive behaviour of the chars during steam gasification. The kinetic parameters of these models were derived and the ability of the models to predict conversion and char reactivity during gasification was assessed. The best model for describing the behaviour of the samples was the RPM. The effect of the partial pressure of steam in gasification was studied, and the reaction order with respect to steam was determined. The reactivity of the chars was compared by means of a reactivity index. Biomass exhibited a higher reactivity than coals and petcoke.

Its apparent metabolisable energy and its influence on broiler performance varies between wheat samples. Reasons for that variability can be classified as intrinsic (variety, chemical composition) and extrinsic factors (growing conditions, storage, etc.), both of which affect nutrient digestibility and availability. However, these factors are not always considered when formulating the diets for broiler chickens. Moreover, research through the years has questioned the relation between wheat AME and animal performance. This review aims to describe factors that influence the observed variability in wheat nutritive value for broiler chickens by considering origin (variety, growing conditions and post-harvest storage), chemical composition of the grain (carbohydrates and protein) and the broiler chicken. © World's Poultry Science Association 2008.","Broiler; Composition; Growing conditions; Storage; Variety; Wheat","Animalia; Gallus gallus; Triticum aestivum",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43449114225

Some studies have pointed to a role of UCP3 in the regulation of whole body energy homeostasis, diet induced obesity, and regulation of lipids as metabolic substrates. The C/C genotype of a polymorphism in the UCP3 promoter (-55C→T) is associated with an increased expression of UCP3 mRNA in muscle. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of -55CT polymorphism of UCP3 gene on adipocytokines response and weight loss secondary to a hypocaloric diet in obese patients. A population of 107 obese (body mass index &gt;30) nondiabetic outpatients was analyzed in a prospective way. Before and after three months of a hypocaloric diet, an indirect calorimetry, tetrapolar electrical bioimpedance, blood pressure, a serial assessment of nutritional intake with 3-day written food records, and biochemical analysis were performed. The lifestyle modification program consisted of a hypocaloric diet (1520 kcal, 52% of carbohydrates, 25% of lipids and 23% of proteins). The exercise program consisted of aerobic exercise for at least 3 times per week (60 minutes each). The mean age was 49.5 ± 34.5 years and the mean BMI 34.5 ± 4.8, with 27 males (25.3%) and 80 females (74.7%). Ninety patients (25 males/65 females) (83.6%) had the genotype 55CC (wild group) and 17 patients (2 male/15 females) (16.4%) 55CT (mutant group). The percentage of responders (weight loss) was similar in both groups (wild group: 84.7% vs. mutant group: 81.8%). BMI, weight, fat mass, systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio decreased in the wild group and RMR and VO2 were increased. In the mutant group, BMI and weight decreased. Leptin and IL-6 levels have a significant decrease in the wild group (9.6%: p &lt; 0.05)and (30.5%: p &lt; 0.05), respectively.

It is assumed that plasma of Ne-like argon is the active medium of the X-ray laser and an electric discharge occurs inside a 150-mm-long ceramic capillary 3-4 mm in diameter. In previous experiments on the SIGNAL accelerator, the main initial conditions for generation of laser X rays were determined and X rays at a wavelength of 46.9 nm were obtained. The pulsed capacitive-energy storage unit is built in the form of a flat capacitor filled with deionized water. It has been revealed that deionized water as the dielectric filling the flat capacitor is not broken down in a 10-mm-wide gap at a pulsed voltage &lt;130 kV and a charging-pulse duration of ∼300 ns. In this case, the parameters of the pulsed capacitive-energy storage correspond to those required for generation of laser X rays: a current amplitude in the load of 50 ± 1 kA and a period of the current in the load of 196 ± 2 ns.

This paper presents a zero-voltage switching (ZVS) three-port bidirectional dc-dc converter. A simple and effective duty ratio control method is proposed to extend the ZVS operating range when input voltages vary widely. Soft-switching conditions over the full operating range are achievable by adjusting the duty ratio of the voltage applied to the transformer winding in response to the dc voltage variations at the port. Keeping the volt-second product (half-cycle voltage-time integral) equal for all the windings leads to ZVS conditions over the entire operating range. A detailed analysis is provided for both the two-port and the three-port converters. Furthermore, for the three-port converter a dual-PI-loop based control strategy is proposed to achieve constant output voltage, power flow management, and soft-switching. The three-port converter is implemented and tested for a fuel cell and supercapacitor system. © 2008 IEEE.","Bidirectional converters; Fuel cells; Multiport converters; Soft-switching; Supercapacitors; Three-port converters","Capacitors; Fuel cells; Power transformers; Transformer windings; Two term control systems; Zero voltage switching; Bidirectional converters; Multiport converters; Power flow management; Supercapacitor system; DC-DC converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549124596

The control, which takes into account the slow dynamics of a fuel cell (FC) in order to avoid fuel (hydrogen and air) starvation problems, is obviously simpler than state machines used for hybrid source control. The control strategy lies in using an FC for supplying energy to battery and load at the dc bus. The structure is an FC current, battery current, and battery state-of-charge (SOC) cascade control. To validate the proposed principle, a hardware system is realized by analogical circuits for the FC current loop and numerical calculation (dSPACE) for the battery current and SOC loops. Experimental results with small-scale devices (a 500 W PEM FC and 33 Ah, 48 V lead-acid battery bank) illustrate the excellent control scheme during motor drive cycles. © 2008 IEEE.","Batteries; Cascade control; Converters; Current control; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Fuel cells (FCs)","Analog circuits; Cascade control systems; Electric current control; Electric vehicles; Power converters; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Hybrid source control; Slow dynamics; State-of-charge; Distributed power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40849118572

To investigate the mechanisms underlying such thrifty metabolism for catch-up fat, we tested whether during refeeding after caloric restriction rats exhibiting catch-up fat driven by suppressed thermogenesis have diminished skeletal muscle phosphatidylinositol-3- kinase (PI3K) activity or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling - two pathways required for hormone-induced thermogenesis in ex vivo muscle preparations. The results show that during isocaloric refeeding with a low-fat diet, at time points when body fat, circulating free fatty acids, and intramyocellular lipids in refed animals do not exceed those of controls, muscle insulin receptor substrate 1-associated PI3K activity (basal and in vivo insulin-stimulated) is lower than that in controls. Isocaloric refeeding with a high-fat diet, which exacerbates the suppression of thermogenesis, results in further reductions in muscle PI3K activity and in impaired AMPK phosphorylation (basal and in vivo leptin-stimulated). It is proposed that reduced skeletal muscle PI3K/AMPK signaling and suppressed thermogenesis are interdependent. Defective PI3K or AMPK signaling will reduce the rate of substrate cycling between de novo lipogenesis and lipid oxidation, leading to suppressed thermogenesis, which accelerates body fat recovery and furthermore sensitizes skeletal muscle to dietary fat-induced impairments in PI3K/AMPK signaling. © FASEB.","Catch-up growth; Diabetes; Obesity; Thermogenesis; Weight cycling","fatty acid; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; insulin receptor; lipid; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; animal cell; animal experiment; article; body fat; caloric restriction; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipogenesis; low fat diet; male; metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; protein function; rat; refeeding; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; thermogenesis; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Caloric Restriction; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Insulin; Leptin; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Multienzyme Complexes; Muscle, Skeletal; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; RNA, Messenger; Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase; Thermogenesis; Animalia; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40449137038

Box 2, 1755 ZG Petten, Netherlands","The paper describes the analysis of the potential effects of releases from compressed gaseous hydrogen systems on commercial vehicles in urban and tunnel environments using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Comparative releases from compressed natural gas systems are also included in the analysis. This study is restricted to typical non-articulated single deck city buses. Hydrogen releases are considered from storage systems with nominal working pressures of 20, 35 and 70 MPa, and a comparative natural gas release (20 MPa). The cases investigated are based on the assumptions that either fire causes a release via a thermally activated pressure relief device(s) (PRD) and that the released gas vents without immediately igniting, or that a PRD fails. Various release strategies were taken into account. For each configuration some worst-case scenarios are considered. By far the most critical case investigated in the urban environment, is a rapid release of the entire hydrogen or natural gas storage system such as the simultaneous opening of all PRDs. If ignition occurs, the effects could be expected to be similar to the 1983 Stockholm hydrogen accident [Venetsanos, A. G., Huld, T., Adams, P., & Bartzis, J. G. (2003). Source, dispersion and combustion modelling of an accidental release of hydrogen in an urban environment. Journal of Hazardous Materials, A105, 1-25]. In the cases where the hydrogen release is restricted, for example, by venting through a single PRD, the effects are relatively minor and localised close to the area of the flammable cloud. With increasing hydrogen storage pressure, the maximum energy available in a flammable cloud after a release increases, as do the predicted overpressures resulting from combustion. Even in the relatively confined environment considered, the effects on the combustion regime are closer to what would be expected in a more open environment, i.e. a slow deflagration should be expected. Among the cases studied the most severe one was a rapid release of the entire hydrogen (40 kg) or natural gas (168 kg) storage system within the confines of a tunnel. In this case there was minimal difference between a release from a 20 MPa natural gas system or a 20 MPa hydrogen system, however, a similar release from a 35 MPa hydrogen system was significantly more severe and particularly in terms of predicted overpressures. The present study has also highlighted that the ignition point significantly affects the combustion regime in confined environments. The results have indicated that critical cases in tunnels may tend towards a fast deflagration, or where there are turbulence generating features, e.g. multiple obstacles, there is the possibility that the combustion regime could progress to a detonation. When comparing the urban and tunnel environments, a similar release of hydrogen is significantly more severe in a tunnel, and the energy available in the flammable cloud is greater and remains for a longer period in tunnels. When comparing hydrogen and natural gas releases, for the cases and environments investigated and within the limits of the assumptions, it appears that hydrogen requires different mitigation measures in order that the potential effects are similar to those of natural gas in case of an accident. With respect to a PRD opening strategy, hydrogen storage systems should be designed to avoid simultaneous opening of all PRD, and that for the consequences of the released energy to be mitigated, either the number of PRDs opening should be limited or their vents to atmosphere should be restricted (the latter point would require validation by a comprehensive risk assessment). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The prediction of the consequences of a major accident release of hydrogen into the atmosphere or the contamination of high-pressure hydrogen storage facilities by air entrainment requires a good knowledge of the explosion parameters of hydrogen-air mixtures. The present paper reviews and comments on the current knowledge of dynamic parameters of hydrogen detonation for hazard assessment. The major problem that remains to be resolved involves the understanding of the effect of turbulence on the cellular detonation structure, the propagation of high-speed deflagrations and the transition from deflagration to detonations. It is recommended that future research should be aimed towards experiments that permit the quantitative understanding of the mechanisms of high-speed turbulent combustion rather towards large-scale tests in complex geometries where minimal quantitative information of fundamental significance could be extracted. In spite of its wide flammability and sensitivity to ignition and detonation initiation, it is felt that hydrogen can be produced, stored and handled safely with the appropriate considerations in the design of the hydrogen facilities. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper deals with the experimental results and an economic analysis of a new fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) based solar PTC with an embedded electronic controlled tracking system designed and developed for hot water generation in a restaurant in Madurai, India. The new collector performance has been tested according to ASHRAE Standard 93 (1986). The performance of a new PTC hot water generation system with a well mixed hot water storage tank is investigated by a series of extensive tests over ten months period. The average maximum storage tank water temperature observed was 74.91 °C, when no energy is withdrawn from the tank to the load during the collection period. The total cost of the new economic FRP based solar PTC for hot water generation with an embedded electronic controlled tracking system is Rs. 25000 (US$ 573) only. In the present work, life cycle savings (LCS) method is employed for a detailed economic analysis of the PTC system. A computer program is used as a tool for the economic analysis.

This paper covers the economic analysis of one of the most promising hydrogen production methods-using wind energy for producing hydrogen through electrolysis of seawater-with a concentration on the Indian transport sector. The analysis provides insights about several questions such as the advantages of offshore plants over coastal installations, economics of large wind-machine clusters, and comparison of cost of producing hydrogen with competing gasoline. Robustness of results has been checked by developing several scenarios such as fast/slow learning rates for wind systems for determining future trends. Results of this analysis show that use of hydrogen for transportation is not likely to be attractive before 2012, and that too with considerable learning in wind, electrolyzer and hydrogen storage technology. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated whether ligand availability for PPARγ is rate limiting in fat mass generation and substrate metabolism. Twenty healthy men (20-8211;29 years) were randomly assigned to receive the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone (RSG) (8 mg/d) (n 10) or a placebo (n 10) during a stay of 7d in a respiration chamber. Food intake was ad libitum, resulting in positive energy balances of 32-MJ (placebo) and 44-7MJ (RSG). Fat cell size and expression of PPARγ, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2), adipsin, adiponectin and fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF) were determined in subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsies. The total amount of fat stored and the amount of TAG per fat cell were not different between groups. For the entire group, fat cell size was decreased after overeating (P=0.02) FIAF mRNA levels were decreased after overeating in the RSG group (P=0.01), with a trend towards a decrease in the placebo group. Unexpectedly, RSG treatment did not influence the expression levels of PPARγ and of the PPARγ responsive genes aP2, adiponectin and adipsin. In addition, RSG resulted in a larger increase in plasma TAG during overeating than placebo treatment. These results suggest that in healthy, non-obese males the PPARγ ligand RSG influences TAG metabolism, independent of its PPARγ transcriptional activity in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. © 2008 The Authors.","Adipose tissue; Fat cell size; Gene expression; Ligand; Man","adiponectin; adipsin; fatty acid binding protein; glucose; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; placebo; rosiglitazone; triacylglycerol; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; antidiabetic agent; ligand; messenger RNA; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; rosiglitazone; triacylglycerol; abdominal fat; adipose tissue cell; adult; anthropometry; article; body composition; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dietary intake; double blind procedure; drug mechanism; energy balance; enzyme activity; food intake; gene expression; gene expression regulation; gene function; glucose blood level; human; human experiment; human tissue; lipid blood level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; male; normal human; obesity; protein expression; protein function; protein targeting; randomized controlled trial; subcutaneous fat; transcription regulation; adipocyte; caloric intake; cell size; cytology; drug effect; energy metabolism; genetic transcription; genetics; hyperphagia; metabolism; physiology; subcutaneous fat; Adipocytes; Adult; Anthropometry; Blood Glucose; Cell Size; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Hyperphagia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Ligands; Male; PPAR gamma; RNA, Messenger; Subcutaneous Fat; Thiazolidinediones; Transcription, Genetic; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949187891

Little information is available about the lipid content of deep-sea corals, as well as ratios of main lipid classes. In this study, lipid percentages of 81 deep-sea specimens were measured and the presence of six major classes, including sterols (STEROLS), free fatty acids (FFA), triacylglycerols (TG), monoalkyldiacyl glycerol (MADAG), wax (WAX), and sterol esters (SE), was assessed. Deep-sea corals had fewer lipids than their shallow water counterparts. Decision-tree analysis revealed a link between coral groups and total lipid percentages, showing that species within the same group were characterized by similar lipid amounts. Depth did not seem to impact the total lipid percentages, suggesting that deep-sea corals adapt to the differential access to food by changing the proportion of lipid classes while maintaining equivalent lipid levels. In deep-sea species, similar to their shallow water counterparts, energy seems to be stored as neutral lipids (wax esters and triacylglycerols), with the notable difference that a high proportion of MADAG is present. These compounds are less rich in energy than TG. Depth trends were found for FFA, TG and SE with an increase in percentages after 800 m suggesting a potential need for storage due to decreased food availability. A subsequent decrease after 1,100 m was observed for FFA and TG but a more detailed investigation is warranted as the number of specimens acquired from these depths was less than 20. It is nonetheless a surprising result as increased storage is expected when food sources are sparse. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Deep-sea corals; Lipids; Storage lipids; Structural lipids","coral; decision analysis; deep-sea organism; food availability; lipid; Canada; Newfoundland and Labrador; North America; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38649114988

The WDHS presented in this article consists of a wind turbine generator (WTG), a diesel engine (DE), a synchronous machine (SM), the consumer load, a battery-based energy storage system (BESS), a discrete dump load (DL) and a distributed control system (DCS). The DE can be engaged (DO and WD modes)/disengaged (WO mode) from the SM by means of a clutch. The DCS consists of a sensor node, which measures the SM and DE speeds, calculates the reference active power PREF necessary to balance the active power in the WDHS and communicates this PREF value with a message to the BESS and DL actuator nodes. In the WO mode, the power sources are the WTG and the BESS (temporary) and if there is an active power shortfall, the DCS, to prevent a frequency collapse, must order to start the DE, wait until the DE reaches the SM speed and lock the clutch, changing to the WD mode. With the clutch locked, the combined actuation of the DE+BESS will raise the system frequency to the rated value. This WO to WD transition is simulated in this article showing graphs for frequency, voltage and active powers for the elements of the system. These graphs are compared with the ones obtained if the BESS does not actuate in WD mode. The comparison results show that with the BESS actuation in WD mode the settling time is reduced a 50%, the over and under shooting in the system frequency are eliminated and the system voltage variations are reduced a 40%. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Among different lineages, stem cells are able to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts. As secreted proteins could regulate the balance between both lineages, we aimed at characterizing the secretome of human multipotent adipose-derived stem cell (hMADS) at an early step of commitment to adipocytes and osteoblasts. Results: A proteomic approach, using mono-dimensional electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry, allowed us to identify a total of 73 proteins at day 0 and day 3 of adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation. Analysis of identified proteins showed that 52 % corresponded to classical secreted proteins characterized by a signal peptide, that 37 % previously described in the extracellular compartment were devoid of signal peptide and that 11 % neither exhibited a signal peptide nor had been previously described extracellularly. These proteins were classified into 8 clusters according to their function. Quantitative analysis has been performed for 8 candidates: PAI-1, PEDF, BIGH3, PTX3, SPARC, ENO1, GRP78 and MMP2. Among them, PAI-1 was detected at day 0 and day 3 of osteoblast differentiation but never in adipocyte secretome. Furthermore we showed that PAI-1 mRNA was down-regulated in the bone of ovariectomized mice. Conclusion: Given its regulation during the early events of hMADS cell differentiation and its status in ovariectomized mice, PAI-1 could play a role in the adipocyte/osteoblast balance and thus in bone diseases such as osteoporosis. © 2008 Chiellini et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"alpha enolase; gelatinase A; glucose regulated protein 78; matrix protein; osteonectin; pentraxin 3; pigment epithelium derived factor; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; signal peptide; transforming growth factor beta induced protein ig h3 precursor; unclassified drug; plasminogen; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; proteome; adipocyte; adipose tissue; amino acid sequence; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bone; cell differentiation; cell lineage; cluster analysis; controlled study; down regulation; electrophoresis; extracellular matrix; human; human cell; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; multipotent stem cell; nonhuman; osteoblast; ovariectomy; protein analysis; protein function; protein secretion; proteomics; quantitative analysis; regulatory mechanism; tandem mass spectrometry; adipocyte; animal; C57BL mouse; cell culture; female; male; metabolism; osteoblast; physiology; secretion; time; validation study; Mus; Adipocytes; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Female; Humans; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Osteoblasts; Ovariectomy; Plasminogen; Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1; Proteome; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549097235

We investigate what are the effects of this phenomenon on the mechanics of running. We hypothesized that the deficit in force would result in a lower push, causing reduced amplitude of the vertical oscillation, with smaller elastic energy storage and increased step frequency. To test this hypothesis, we measured the mechanical energy of the centre of mass of the body during running in old and young subjects. The amplitude of the oscillation is indeed reduced in the old subjects, resulting in an approximately 20% smaller elastic recovery and a greater step frequency (3.7 versus 2.8Hz, p=1.9×10-5, at 15-17kmh-1). Interestingly, the greater step frequency is due to a lower aerial time, and not to a greater natural frequency of the system, which is similar in old and young subjects (3.6 versus 3.4Hz, p=0.2). Moreover, we find that in the old subjects, the step frequency is always similar to the natural frequency, even at the highest speeds. This is at variance with young subjects who adopt a step frequency lower than the natural frequency at high speeds, to contain the aerobic energy expenditure. Finally, the external work to maintain the motion of the centre of mass is reduced in the old subjects (0.9 versus 1.2Jkg-1m-1, p=5.1×10-6) due to the lower work done against gravity, but the higher step frequency involves a greater internal work to reset the limbs at each step. The net result is that the total work increases with speed more steeply in the old subjects than in young subjects. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Age; Elasticity; Locomotion; Muscle; Running; Work","age; elasticity; hypothesis testing; locomotion; muscle; aged; amplitude modulation; article; body mass; controlled study; elasticity; energy; female; frequency analysis; gravity; human; human experiment; male; motion; muscle force; normal human; oscillation; priority journal; running; senescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37849049371

In addition to leptin's best known role as regulator of energy homeostasis, several studies indicate that leptin plays a pivotal role in immune and inflammatory response. Because of its dual nature as a hormone and cytokine, leptin can be nowadays considered the link between neuroendocrine and immune system. The increase in leptin production that occurs during infections and inflammatory processes strongly suggests that this adipokine is a part of the cytokines network which governs inflammatory/immune response and host defence mechanisms. Indeed, leptin plays a relevant role in inflammatory processes involving either innate or adaptive immune responses. Several studies have implicated leptin in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory conditions such as encephalomyelitis, type I diabetes, bowel inflammation and also articular degenerative diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Although the mechanisms by which leptin exerts its action as modulator of inflammatory/immune response are likely to be more complex than predicted and far to be completely depicted, there is a general consensus about its pivotal role as pro-inflammatory and immune-modulating agent. Here, we review the most recent advances on leptin biology with a particular attention to its adipokine facet, even though its role as metabolic hormone will be also addressed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

One commercial organo-montmorillonite (denoted as 30B) and one maleated polyolefin elastomer (denoted as POEMA) served as the reinforcing filler and toughener, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results confirmed the nano-scaled dispersion of 30B in the composites. The presence of POEMA slightly depreciated the dispersibility of 30B. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results indicated that the addition of 30B accelerated the crystallization of PA 6,6, whereas the simultaneous additions of 30B and POEMA led to a reverse effect. Complex melting behaviors, mainly associated with the ""recrystallization/reorganization"" of PA 6,6 crystals upon heating, were observed for neat PA 6,6 and the nanocomposites. The presence of exfoliated/intercalated 30B hampered the ""recrystallization/reorganization"" of PA 6,6 crystals. The thermal stability enhancement of PA 6,6 after the addition of 30B and/or POEMA was confirmed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The rigidity, including storage modulus, Young's modulus and flexural modulus, of PA 6,6 increased after adding 30B. However, these properties declined after the further incorporation of POEMA.

Indeed, Si3N4 is a ""high-k"" dielectric and can replace SiO2 in Si-ncs memories, increasing their performances. On the other hand, Si-ncs embedded in Si3N4 antireflection layer of solar cells can be used as luminescent converters to enhance photovoltaic conversion in the blue region of the spectrum. Controlling Si-ncs characteristics (density, size, surface passivation, etc.) is necessary to the optimisation of both electrical and optical properties of the layers. In this work, we synthesized SiNx:H 50 nm thick layers by ECR-PECVD using NH3 and SiH4 gases. Si-ncs are obtained thanks to a Si atom excess in the matrix, controlled by the gas flow ratio. The samples were annealed under Ar flow, first in a RTA furnace at 1000 °C during 1 min for particles nucleation, and then in a classic furnace, from 700 °C to 1100 °C, in order to investigate the Si nanostructure evolution. We studied the structural characteristics of Si-ncs population by energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM). The layers composition was determined by Rutherford back scattering spectroscopy (RBS) and elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA). Their optical properties were studied by photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL).

Self-irradiation by α-decays, due to the actinide loading, could affect the good intrinsic performances of this material. The evaluation of irradiation effects on the chemical durability of the ceramic is a crucial issue. Radiation effects were simulated by external ion beam irradiations. Under high-energy ion irradiation, amorphization was achieved above a critical threshold for electronic energy loss (Se = 5 MeV μm-1). Thermal annealing enables to fully recover the initial crystalline structure after heating for 15 h above 973 K. Amorphization appears thus completely reversible. The activation energy of annealing is equal to 2.8 eV. Ion beam induced amorphization and recrystallization by thermal annealing were found to be isotropic processes.

India had 4,635 ""large dams"" as per ICOLD definition. Only technical criteria such as height and storage volume are used for this classification. Large dam projects increasingly face opposition from the environmental lobby from around the world for their negative social and environmental impacts, while their role in development was largely ignored. There are three issues being investigated in this paper. First: the role of water in human development and economic growth, and the role of large storages. Second: what should be the best criterion for classifying dams in a way that they truly reflect the engineering, social and environmental challenges posed by dams? Three: what new objectives and criteria, and variables need to be incorporated in the cost-benefit analysis of dams so as to make it comprehensive? The authors have derived a new index called sustainable water use index (SWUI) from the composite water poverty index (WPI) developed by C. Sullivan (2002), to assess the water situation of a country. It includes four of the five sub-indices of WPI, to capture attributes such as access to and use of water, water environment and institutional capacities in water sector, each having equal weightage. The SWUI was calculated for 145 countries using data from Laurence et al. (2003). Analyses suggest that improving the water situation can drive its economic growth, through the human development route. It is further argued that building large storages would be crucial for improving the water situation of a country on a sustainable basis. The analysis based on data of 13,631 large dams across the world shows that the height of the dam does not have any bearing on the volume of water stored, a strong indicator of the safety hazard posed by dams. Further analysis using data of 9,878 large dams shows that the height has no bearing on the area of land submerged, again an indicator of the negative social and environmental effects. The regression using data on 156 large dams across India shows that normative relationship exists between the area of submergence and numbers of people displaced by dams. Therefore, a combination of criteria such as height, storage volume and the area under submergence needs to be considered for assessing the negative social and environmental consequences of dams. Further analysis shows that the available estimates of dam displacement could be ""gross over-estimates"" in the order of magnitude of eight. By illustrating the significant positive impact of large reservoir project on stabilizing national food prices, contributing clean energy, improving recharge to groundwater in semi arid and arid regions, and ensuring social security, the authors argue that economic viability of these projects should be assessed in relation these positive externalities they create. The authors estimate the benefit due to lower food prices attributed to large dams in India as Rs. 42.90 billion annually. At the same time, the negative externality effects of large dams should be built in the cost of dam projects to increase the accountability on the part of water development agencies in less developed countries, towards the communities, which are adversely affected by large dams. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Cost-benefit analysis; Dam height; Displacement; Environmental impacts; Human development index; International commission on large dams; Large dams; Sustainable water use index","Arid regions; Bearings (structural); Biochemical oxygen demand; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Dams; Data storage equipment; Environmental impact; Groundwater; Hydraulic structures; Hydrogeology; Safety engineering; Storage (materials); Turbulent flow; Water analysis; Water conservation; Water supply; Dam height; Displacement; Human development index; International commission on large dams; Large dams; Sustainable water use index; Cost benefit analysis; cost-benefit analysis; dam construction; developing world; economic growth; environmental impact; hydrological response; sustainability; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55549148395

We observed that the plastic deformation is homogeneous at large length scales and it is affine at scales larger than around the half of the entanglement distance. Moreover at length scales about the monomer size, the structure of the stretched glassy polymer chains remains nearly isotropic but appears also slightly distorted by the plastic deformation. These distortions at the molecular scale are probably the mode of storage of internal energy for stretched glassy polymer. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Molecular scale; Polymer glass; Monomers; Neutron scattering; Plastic deformation; Plastic flow; Polymethyl methacrylates; Glass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39749174367

The UGCV needs many types of capabilities to achieve satisfactory performance. This paper focuses on the modeling and control of the power system of the UGCV, and proposes the fuel cell hybrid system (FCHS) for the power system of the UGCV. The fuel cell hybrid system has many advantages in stealth drive and the system efficiency. In addition, the FCHS is much quieter than the engine generator and generates much less heat. The benefits of the FCHS are advantageous for use in Army operations, which require 'silent watch' capability and the ability to operate without showing up on an enemy's radar screen. The FCHS has a fuel cell and uses an energy storage system (ESS) as a power source. The ESS (e.g., batteries or ultracapacitors) helps the fuel cell supply power to the electric drive system and also recovers energy during deceleration. The ESS makes it possible to improve the efficiency and dynamic characteristic of the power system. In this paper, the FCHS is composed of different combinations of component models. The component sizes are chosen to satisfy performance requirements. In order to determine the power distribution between the fuel cell and the ESS, a power management strategy based on the required power and the SOC (state of charge) of the ESS is proposed. Batteries and ultracapacitor, components of the ESS, have different characteristics. Accordingly, varying the combination of ESS components can change the performance of the power system. The performance of the FCHS with respect to different combinations of ESS is analyzed using simulated results. © 2008 KSAE.","Component sizing; ESS (Energy Storage System); Fuel cell hybrid system; Performance analysis","Component sizing; Dynamic characteristics; Energy storage systems; Fuel cell hybrid systems; Fuel cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV); Performance analysis; Performance requirements; Power management strategies; Capacitors; Electric drives; Energy storage; Hybrid systems; Hybrid vehicles; Land vehicle propulsion; Military vehicles; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953147976

LCFAs are also essential for many other cellular functions, such as transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in lipid metabolism, modulation of intracellular signalling pathways, and as substrates for membrane constituents. When LCFA uptake exceeds the capacity for their cardiac utilization, the intracellular lipids accumulate and are thought to contribute to contractile dysfunction, arrhythmias, cardiac myocyte apoptosis and congestive heart failure. Moreover, increased cardiac myocyte triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol and ceramide depots are cardinal features associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. In recent years considerable evidence has accumulated to suggest that, the rate of entry of long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) into the cardiac myocyte is a key factor contributing to a) regulating cardiac LCFA metabolism and b) lipotoxicity in the obese and diabetic heart. In the present review we i) examine the evidence indicating that LCFA transport into the heart involves a protein-mediated mechanism, ii) discuss the proteins involved in this process, including FAT/CD36, FABPpm and FATP1, iii) discuss the mechanisms involved in regulating LCFA transport by some, of these proteins (including signaling pathways), as well as iv) the possible interactions of these proteins in regulating LCFA transport into the heart.

However, this intermediate capacitor voltage still varies largely against the change of line voltage. This paper proposes a S2PFC converter which is constructed in a way such that the amount of energy to and from the intermediate storage capacitor can be varied when the line voltage is changed, hence narrowed the range of intermediate capacitor voltage fluctuation. This is achieved by an auxiliary bidirectional switch, which operates at zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) condition. A dual-loop voltage mode control is proposed for the converter to achieve power factor correction, output voltage regulation, and intermediate capacitor voltage control simultaneously. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.","AC/DC converter; Power factor correction; Single-stage","Capacitance; Capacitors; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Capacitor voltages; Intermediate storage; Power factor corrected (PFC); Power factor correction (PFC) converters; Single stage; Energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46749118411

The TSD currents in the temperature range 20°-250°C (in certain cases up to 300°C) were obtained as functions of polarizing field (Ep; 20-350 kV/cm), polarizing temperature (Tp; 60°-180°C), poling time (tp; 0.5-2 h), sample thickness (d; 25-120 μm), heating rate (h; 2°-6°C/min), and storage time (ts; 0-552 h). The current maxima in the TSDC spectra reveal the presence of two major relaxation processes termed as β- (around 130°C) and α- (around 190°C), associated with dipolar relaxation and space-charge relaxation processes, respectively. However, in certain cases, we observe merging of β- and α-relaxation processes to become the αβ-relaxation process (140°-180°C). The observed dependence of the peak temperature T m on polarizing temperature and poling time indicates a continuous distribution of relaxations. The high Ep/Tp samples also show a relaxation (p) around 260°C associated with charge injection phenomenon. The low temperature region of TSDC spectra (30°-70°C) shows the presence of a weak relaxation (β′), considered as a satellite of the main dipolar relaxation process.

In a first step, the dual analytical approach based on lumped and distributed parameter models is detailed: The partial differential equations deduced from mass/energy conservation laws and inertial dynamics are reduced to ordinary differential equations using spatial discretization and then combined with semiempirical actuator models to form the overall air system model. In a second step, a classical approach is followed to obtain a local linearization of the model. A validation of both nonlinear and linearized versions is performed by computational fluid dynamics simulations and experiments on a dedicated air system test bench. Thanks to dynamic analysis (pole/zero map), operating point impact and model order reduction are investigated. Finally, the multiinput multioutput state-space model - which balances model fidelity with model simplicity - can be coupled with reformer stack, and thermal models to understand the system complexity and to develop model-based control methodologies.

This algorithm is parameterizable for a chosen metric, such as speed, space, or energy. Bank switching is a technique that increases the code and data memory in microcontrollers without extending the address buses. Given a program in which variables have been assigned to data banks, we present a novel optimization technique that minimizes the overhead of bank switching through cost-effective placement of bank selection instructions. The placement is controlled by a number of different objectives, such as runtime, low power, small code size or a combination of these parameters. We have formulated the minimal placement of bank selection instructions as a discrete optimization problem that is mapped to a partitioned boolean quadratic programming (PBQP) problem. We implemented the optimization as part of a PIC Microchip backend and evaluated the approach for several optimization objectives. Our benchmark suite comprises programs from MiBench and DSPStone plus a microcontroller real-time kernel and drivers for microcontroller hardware devices. Our optimization achieved a reduction in program memory space of between 2.7 and 18.2, and an overall improvement with respect to instruction cycles between 5.0 and 28.8. Our optimization achieved the minimal solution for all benchmark programs. We investigated the scalability of our approach toward the requirements of future generations of microcontrollers. This study was conducted as a worst-case analysis on the entire MiBench suite. Our results show that our optimization (1) scales well to larger numbers of memory banks, (2) scales well to the larger problem sizes that will become feasible with future microcontrollers, and (3) achieves minimal placement for more than 72 of all functions from MiBench. © 2008 ACM.","Bank selection; Partitioned boolean quadratic programming; Partitioned memory architectures","Algorithms; Cache memory; Cost effectiveness; Microcontrollers; Optimization; Quadratic programming; Bank selections; Data memory; Partitioned memory architectures; Storage allocation (computer)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549141804

We propose to replace the on-chip instruction cache with a scratchpad memory (SPM) and a small minicache. Serializing the address translation with the actual memory access enables the memory system to access either only the SPM or the minicache. Independent of the SPM size and based solely on profiling information, a postpass optimizer classifies the code of an application binary into a pageable and a cacheable code region. The latter is placed at a fixed location in the external memory and cached by the minicache. The former, the pageable code region, is copied on demand to the SPM before execution. Both the pageable code region and the SPM are logically divided into pages the size of an MMU memory page. Using the MMU's pagefault exception mechanism, a runtime scratchpad memory manager (SPMM) tracks page accesses and copies frequently executed code pages to the SPM before they get executed. In order to minimize the number of page transfers from the external memory to the SPM, good code placement techniques become more important with increasing sizes of the MMU pages. We discuss code-grouping techniques and provide an analysis of the effect of the MMU's page size on execution time, energy consumption, and external memory accesses. We show that by using the data cache as a victim buffer for the SPM, significant energy savings are possible. We evaluate our SPM allocation strategy with fifteen applications, including H.264, MP3, MPEG-4, and PGP. The proposed memory system requires 8 less die are compared to a fully-cached configuration. On average, we achieve a 31 improvement in runtime performance and a 35 reduction in energy consumption with an MMU page size of 256 bytes. © 2008 ACM.","Code placement; Compilers; Heterogeneous memory; Paging; Portable systems; Postpass optimization; Scratchpad; Victim cache; Virtual memory","Memory management unit (MMU); Portable systems; Scratchpad memory (SPM); Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Optimization; Storage allocation (computer); Portable equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549129383

In this Account, we discuss the nanoscaling laws of magnetic nanoparticles including metals, metal ferrites, and metal alloys, while focusing on their size, shape, and composition effects. Their fundamental magnetic properties such as blocking temperature (Tb), spin life time (τ), coercivity (Hc), and susceptibility (χ) are strongly influenced by the nanoscaling laws, and as a result, these scaling relationships can be leveraged to control magnetism from the ferromagnetic to the superparamagnetic regimes. At the same time, they can be used in order to tune magnetic values including Hc, χ, and remanence (Mr). For example, life time of magnetic spin is directly related to the magnetic anisotropy energy (KuV) and also the size and volume of nanoparticles. The blocking temperature (Tb) changes from room temperature to 10 K as the size of cobalt nanoparticles is reduced from 13 to 2 nm. Similarly, Hc is highly susceptible to the anisotropy of nanoparticles, while saturation magnetization is directly related to the canting effects of the disordered surface magnetic spins and follows a linear relationship upon plotting of ms1/3 vs r-1. Therefore, the nanoscaling laws of magnetic nanoparticles are important not only for understanding the behavior of existing materials but also for developing novel nanomaterials with superior properties. Since magnetic nanoparticles can be easily conjugated with biologically important constituents such as DNA, peptides, and antibodies, it is possible to construct versatile nano-bio hybrid partides, which simultaneously possess magnetic and biological functions for biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics. As demonstrated in this Account, nanoscaling laws for magnetic components are found to be critical to the design of optimized magnetic characteristics of hybrid nanoparticles and their enhanced applicability in the biomedical sciences including their utilizations as contrast enhancement agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ferromagnetic components for nano-bio hybrid structures, and translational vectors for magnetophoretic sensing of biological species. In particular, systematic modulation of saturation magnetization of nanoparticle probes is important to maximize MR contrast effects and magnetic separation of biological targets. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"DNA; magnesium; nanoparticle; animal; article; biomedical engineering; chemistry; genetic procedures; magnetism; ultrastructure; Animals; Biomedical Engineering; Biosensing Techniques; DNA; Magnesium; Magnetics; Nanoparticles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549114921

There are consistent evidences that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in NASH whatever its origin. Mitochondria are the key controller of fatty acids removal and this is part of an intensive gene program that modifies hepatocytes to counteract the excessive fat storage. Mitochondrial dysfunction participates at different levels in NASH pathogenesis since it impairs fatty liver homeostasis and induces overproduction of ROS that in turn trigger lipid peroxidation, cytokines release and cell death. In this review we briefly recall the role of mitochondria in fat metabolism and energy homeostasis and focus on the role of mitochondrial impairment and uncoupling proteins in the pathophysiology of NASH progression. We suggest that mitochondrial respiratory chain, UCP2 and redox balance cooperate in a common pathway that permits to set down the mitochondrial redox pressure, limits the risk of oxidative damage, and allows the maximal rate of fat removal. When the environmental conditions change and high energy supply occurs, hepatocytes are unable to replace their ATP store and steatosis progress to NASH and cirrhosis.

The adipose tissue, a target of thyroid hormones, is the main place for energy storage and acts as a regulator of energy balance, sending signals to keep metabolic control. Adipogenesis is a complex process that involves proliferation of preadipocytes and its differentiation into mature adipocytes. This process is regulated by several transcription factors (CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins [C/EBPs], peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors [PPARs]) that act coordinately, activating adipocyte-specific genes that will provide the adipocytic phenotype. Thyroid hormones regulate many of those genes, markers of differentiation of adipocytes, those involved in lipogenesis, lipolysis, and thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue (BAT). Triiodothyronine (T3) actions are achieved either directly through specific thyroid response elements (TREs), by regulating other key genes as PPARs, or through specific isoforms of the nuclear T3 receptors. The availability of T3 is regulated through the deiodinases D3, D2, and D1. D3 is activated by serum and mitogens during proliferation of preadipocytes, while D2 is linked to the differentiation program of adipocytes, through the C/EBPs that govern its functionality, providing the T3 required for thermogenesis and lipogenesis.

Furthermore, the first discharge capacity of the ball-milled NdMg12 + 200 wt % Ni composite was very close to that of the ball-milled PrMg12 + 200 wt % Ni composite. However, the high rate dischargeability of the former was not as good as that of the latter. Further analysis by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique reveals a larger reaction resistance in the ball-milled NdMg12 + 200 wt % Ni composite, probably due to the formation of Nd oxide or Nd (OH)3 film on the surface of alloy. Larger reaction resistance resulted in the lower high rate dischargeability of this sample.

In this work, we showed that NTH2, a paralog of NTH1, encodes a functional trehalase that is implicated in trehalose mobilization. Yeast is also endowed with an acid trehalase encoded by ATH1 and an H+/trehalose transporter encoded by AGT1, which can together sustain assimilation of exogenous trehalose. We showed that a tps1 mutant defective in the TPS catalytic subunit cultivated on trehalose, or on a dual source of carbon made of galactose and trehalose, accumulated high levels of intracellular trehalose by its Agt1p-mediated transport. The accumulated disaccharide was mobilized as soon as cells entered the stationary phase by a process requiring a coupling between its export and immediate extracellular hydrolysis by Ath1p. Compared to what is seen for classical growth conditions on glucose, this mobilization was rather unique, since it took place prior to that of glycogen, which was postponed until the late stationary phase. However, when the Ath1p-dependent mobilization of trehalose identified in this study was impaired, glycogen was mobilized earlier and faster, indicating a fine-tuning control in carbon storage management during periods of carbon and energy restriction.

Chick fledging (departure to sea) occurred 5 d after completion of the molt. It was preceded by a 16 d fasting period and by a 7-fold increase in locomotor activity. From the measurement of the plasma concentration of metabolites and of glucagon and insulin, pre-fledging king penguin chicks were found to adapt to fasting in a classical way, i.e. by sparing body protein and mobilizing fat stores. At fledging, chicks were in phase II of fasting and their departure to sea was not stimulated by reaching critical energy depletion (phase III), in contrast to that which has been reported in breeding-fasting adults. The plasma level of corticosterone remained unchanged throughout the whole pre-fledging period, providing no support for a role of this stress-hormone in the facilitation of fledging. Thus, king penguin fledglings did not appear to be environmentally or nutritionally stressed. The plasma levels of thyroid hormones were elevated during the pre-fledging molt, in accordance with their key role in molt control in adult penguins. These levels declined by the time of the molt end, the plasma level of T4 thereafter being directly related to the time left before fledging. These results do not support the view that chronically elevated levels of thyroid hormones are required for the energy-demanding transition between being ashore and in cold water, but they suggest that the maintenance of high T4 levels may delay fledging. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Frontal chromatography analysis was performed to evaluate the column properties, i.e., determination of the stationary phase binding capacity and the dissociation constant of the target-immobilized aptamer complex. It was found that such covalent immobilization was able to maintain the aptamer binding properties at a convenient level for an efficient enantioseparation.

Energy consumption is one of the major factors which bar the adoption of hard disk in mobile environment. Heat dissipation of large scale storage system also calls for an energy-aware scheduling technique to further increase the storage density. The basic idea in this work is to properly determine the I/O burst size so that device can be in standby mode between consecutive I/O bursts and that it can satisfy the soft real-time requirement. We develop an elaborate model which incorporates the energy consumption characteristics, overhead of mode transition in determining the appropriate I/O burst size and the respective disk operating schedule. Efficacy of energy-aware disk scheduling algorithm greatly relies on not only disk scheduling algorithm itself but also various operating system and device firmware related concerns. It is crucial that the various operating system level and device level features need to be properly addressed within disk scheduling framework. Our energy-aware disk scheduling algorithm successfully addresses a number of outstanding issues. First, we examine the effect of OS and hard disk firmware level prefetch policy and incorporate its effect in our disk scheduling framework. Second, our energy aware scheduling framework can allocate a certain fraction of disk bandwidth to handle sporadically arriving non real-time I/O's. Third, we examine the relationship between lock granularity of the buffer management and energy consumption. We develop a prototype software with energy-aware scheduling algorithm. In our experiment, proposed algorithm can reduce the energy consumption to one fourth if we use energy-aware disk scheduling algorithm. However, energy-aware disk scheduling algorithm increases buffer requirement significantly, e.g., from 4 to 140 KByte. We carefully argue that the buffer overhead is still justifiable given the cost of DRAM chip and importance of energy management in modern mobile devices. The result of our work not only provides the energy efficient scheduling algorithm but also provides an important guideline in capacity planning of future energy efficient mobile devices. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Disk scheduling; Energy management; Mobile device; Multimedia; Soft real-time","Bandwidth; Energy utilization; Input output programs; Mobile devices; Real time systems; Software prototyping; Energy aware disk scheduling; Storage density; Scheduling algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849097870

In order to study such reactions, it is therefore necessary to study the role of ATP in vivo. This study presents an in vivo, targeted perturbation of the ATP flux in aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which was accomplished by transiently (20 min) changing the extracellular undissociated benzoic acid concentration via the pH of the culture. The performed pH shifts resulted in, within about 20 s, a 40% decrease (pH upshift) or a 23% increase (pH downshift) of the calculated ATP consumption rate while the specific glucose uptake rate did not change because of the glucose-limited condition. The pH upshift resulted in a strong decrease in the glycolytic and TCA cycle fluxes; carbon and energy balances indicated an increased flux toward storage carbohydrates. As expected, the pH downshift leads to the opposite effects. Overall, consistent responses were observed in the metabolic fluxes, the off gas concentrations of O2 and CO2 and intracellular metabolite concentrations, except for the concentrations of adenosine nucleotides which unexpectedly only showed minor dynamics. This demonstrates that our knowledge of the regulation of the ATP level, the storage metabolism, and central carbon metabolism of yeast is still incomplete. The new dynamic metabolite datasets obtained in this study will prove of great value in developing kinetic models. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ATP; Benzoic acid; Targetted perturbation; Yeast","Acids; Adenosinetriphosphate; Carbohydrates; Glucose; Metabolism; Reaction kinetics; Adenosine nucleotides; Benzoic acids; Dynamic metabolites; Metabolic fluxes; Yeast; adenosine triphosphate; benzoic acid; carbohydrate; carbon dioxide; oxygen; adenosine triphosphate; benzoic acid derivative; carbon; article; carbon balance; chemostat; energy balance; glucose transport; in vivo study; kinetics; nonhuman; pH; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; aerobic metabolism; fermentation; metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; systems biology; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Adenosine Triphosphate; Aerobiosis; Benzoates; Carbon; Fermentation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Systems Biology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38449090607

It is characterized by lipid accumulation in the liver and is associated with all aspects - and may even be an initiating factor - of the metabolic syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent findings from human studies on dietary effects on hepatic lipid accumulation. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies did not give consistent results. From intervention studies there is evidence to support a role for weight loss. Some studies have also suggested that decreasing total fat intake and increasing the intake of fish oils may be beneficial in the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. SUMMARY: Only a few studies have focused on dietary effects on hepatic lipid accumulation. So far, there is only evidence to support a role for weight loss. Decreasing total fat intake and increasing the intake of fish oils may also be beneficial, but these conclusions are based on a limited number of studies, which sometimes lacked a proper control group. Also, other nutrients have not been studied in detail. Therefore, there is an urgent need for evidence-based dietary guidelines to prevent or even to treat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Dietary fat; Dietary fatty acids; Energy intake; Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease","alpha tocopherol; fish oil; body mass; caloric intake; diet; fat intake; human; intervention study; lipid storage; macronutrient; metabolic syndrome X; nonalcoholic fatty liver; prevalence; priority journal; protein intake; review; weight reduction; Clinical Trials as Topic; Dietary Fats; Fatty Liver; Fish Oils; Humans; Vitamin E; Weight Loss",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38149127292

It performs this function to secure energy supply and prevent lipotoxicity. Adipose tissue is essential for maintaining a healthy glucose and lipid homeostasis and failure results in disease. This review discusses causes of adipose tissue failure and four categories of bioactive food components that may help to prevent this. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on recent findings, it is argued that initial adipose failure following long-term excess energy intake may be the result of reduced mitochondrial capacity associated with altered mitochondrial reactive oxygen species signaling and adipose tissue hypoxia. Current data suggest that different classes of bioactive food components, including vitamin B3, retinoids, fatty acids and polyphenols, may have the potential to modulate mitochondrial function and consequently prevent adipose dysfunction in obesity.

The main objective of the present study is to find the optimum size of system, able to fulfill the energy requirements of a given load distribution, for three sites located at Corsica island and to analyze the impact of different parameters on the system size. The methodology used provides a useful and simple approach for sizing and analyzing an HPWS. In the proposed stand-alone system, a new concept such as the supply of wind power via a uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is introduced and therefore the energy produced by the wind generator can be sent directly to the load. In this context, an optimization sizing model is developed. It consists of three submodels; system components submodels, technical submodel based on the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and the economical submodel based on the levelized cost of energy (LCE). Applying the developed model, a set of configurations meeting the desired LPSP are obtained. The configuration with the lowest LCE gives the optimal one. Analyzing the optimal system configurations used to satisfy the requirements of typical residential home (3 kWh/day), a significant reduction in system size is observed as the available renewable potential increases leading to a considerable decrease in LCE (case of Cape corse site). The 2 days storage capacity is found to be the best for the optimal configuration with the lowest LCE. On the other hand, for low energy requirements, the LCE is found relatively high and decreases sharply with the increase in load. However, for low LPSP values, the LCE is found to rise sharply for a little increase in LPSP. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Female broilers were fed a control or a TFA-containing diet. The difference between the diets was that a part of cis 18:1 in the control diet was replaced by the TFA. Body composition, energy balance and the fatty acid composition were examined. Over the time-period studied (15 days), the body fat content and the protein content did not differ significantly between the TFA-fed group and the control. In energy balance studies, total energy intake, energy loss in excreta, energy expenditure and energy storage did not differ between the treatments. Compared to the control diet, the TFA diet resulted in significantly higher amounts of 14:0 and 18:1n-7 and lower amounts of 18:1n-9 and 20:4n-6 in the body. In conclusion, the data suggest that feeding TFA for 15 days to female broilers had no effect on energy retention, energy expenditure and energy loss in excreta or in body composition in terms of fat and protein. Only the fatty acid composition in the body was affected by the treatment with TFA. In addition, 50% of ingested TFA was incorporated into the body fat.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects on body weight and fat depots of dairy calcium (12 g/kg diet) in wild-type mice under ad libitum high-fat (43%) and normal-fat (12%) diets and to gain comprehension on the underlying mechanism of dairy calcium effects. Our results show that calcium intake decreases body weight and body fat depot gain under high-fat diet and accelerates weight loss under normal-fat diet, without differences in food intake. No differences in gene or protein expression of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue or UCP2 in white adipose tissue were found that could be related with calcium feeding, suggesting that calcium intake contributed to modulate body weight in wild-type mice by a mechanism that is not associated with activation of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. UCP3 protein but not gene expression increased in muscle due to calcium feeding. In white adipose tissue there were effects of calcium intake decreasing the expression of proteins related to calcium signalling, in particular of stanniocalcin 2. CaSR levels could play a role in decreasing cytosolic calcium in adipocytes and, therefore, contribute to the diminution of fat accretion. Results support the anti-obesity effect of dietary calcium in male mice and indicate that, at least at the time-point studied, activation of thermogenesis is not involved. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) has been investigated as an accurate method for the determination of the potential at which nickel hydroxide formulations evolve oxygen. Oxygen evolution from a variety of nickel hydroxide substrate electrodes in KOH was studied in situ by SECM. The SECM probe tip, positioned just above the substrate surface, was used to detect the oxygen evolved while cyclic voltammetry was also performed on the substrate, thus separating the detection of oxygen evolution from the nickel hydroxide oxidation process. A range of supporting substrates were investigated: conducting glass (indium tin oxide), glassy carbon, and nickel metal, with either nickel hydroxide formulations pasted or microparticles abrasively attached onto the support. Graphite, as a conductive additive to Ni (OH)2 paste formulations, gave more positive oxygen-evolution overpotentials than similar formulations containing filamentous nickel as the conductive additive. Unmilled nickel hydroxide samples outperformed milled samples; higher rates of oxygen evolution and lower capacities were obtained from the milled nickel hydroxide samples as determined by SECM and high-rate charge/discharge cycling measurements. © 2008 The Electrochemical Society.",,"Electric discharges; Electrodes; Energy storage; Nickel compounds; Oxidation; Scanning electron microscopy; Discharge cycling; Glassy carbon; Nickel hydroxide electrode; Oxygen evolution; Oxygen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349102144

Solar cells provide direct current (DC) electricity at low voltages. Before this energy can be used in buildings, it needs to be converted to alternating current (AC). However, many AC-powered household appliances work internally on DC. This implies the need for a transformer within the appliance, in order to convert the AC current of 230V to (low voltage) DC current. Using photovoltaics (PV) this method involves two energy conversions with inherent energy losses. It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that introducing aDC (low-voltage) grid can mitigate these losses. The feasibility of this idea has been studied by ECN (Energy Centre the Netherlands), by comparing a grid-connected house with a stand-alone PV-powered house provided solely with DC electricity. The conclusion was that introducing a DC grid would not lead to a significant reduction of energy losses. The present study reveals that further analysis of the energy losses requires the inclusion of different conditions and circumstances. The main obstacles to energy loss reduction appeared to be that not every household appliance is suited for DC-low voltage electricity and that the use of a normal distribution system for low-voltage currents involves significant losses during current transport. The focus of this research is to find a solution for these problems and develop a concept with these solutions for a DC low-voltage system that does reduce energy losses. The main points of interest studied are: alternative ways of transporting DC low-voltage electricity in a single family house with minimal energy losses to devise the most efficient spatial lay-out and furnishing of a house to minimize the distance between generation and end-use of DC electricity to use a hybrid system consisting of an AC and DC grid connected to the various household appliances, depending on their suitability for either form to set out an adequate scale for DC power storage and generation. The result is a conceptual design of a house incorporating these points of interest. The design will be based on zero-energy houses, now being planned for a neighbourhood in the city of Zoetermeer, the Netherlands. The design aims at mitigating energy-losses in the house and neighbourhood without loss of comfort for the inhabitants. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Concept; Electricity; Expectation; House; Voltage",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889452396

The Gash interception model was able to reproduce cumulative interception at the sites accurately, provided an appropriate value of canopy storage capacity (S) was used, 2.0-3.6 mm. These values are significantly higher than S values generally reported in other rainforest studies (∼1 mm) and the reason may be that Australian rainforests contain many epiphytes and mosses, which can trap significant quantities of water within the canopy. There is also some evidence of a seasonal variation in S and wet canopy evaporation rate (E), both being lower in the dry season than the wet season. However, although the rainfall rate (R), S and E all affect the seasonal value of interception, the changes in these three parameters tend to compensate and so the biggest factor affecting seasonal variations in interception is the number of small storms. The consequence of this is that it is still possible to get good estimates of seasonal and annual interception using R, S and E values that are fixed for the entire year. Values of E fell in the range 0.35-0.81 mm h-1, which are 1.4-9 times the concurrent rates estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation. This implies that either our rainforests received very large amounts of advected energy during rain storms, or the Penman-Monteith E values are too low. Some advection of energy to our sites is quite feasible given their proximity to the ocean and generally well exposed locations. However, most of the above discrepancy is probably due to underestimation of the Penman-Monteith values of E, because of errors in the estimation of the above canopy relative humidity, due to the use of weather data adjacent to rather than above the forests and inherent difficulties of measuring the very high humidity's that occur during rainfall. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Gas hydrates offer a relatively high gas storage capacity and mild temperature and pressure conditions for formation. Simulations based on the van der Waals-Platteeuw model and molecular dynamics (MD) are employed in this study to relate the methane gas content/occupancy in different hydrate systems with the hydrate stability conditions including temperature, pressure, and secondary clathrate stabilizing guests. Methane is chosen as a model system for natural gas. It was found that the addition of about 1% propane suffices to increase the structure II (sII) methane hydrate stability without excessively compromising methane storage capacity in hydrate. When tetrahydrofuran (THF) is used as the stabilizing agent in sII hydrate at concentration between 1% and 3%, a reasonably high methane content in hydrate can be maintained (∼85-100, v/v) without dealing with pressures more than 5 MPa and close to room temperature. The free energy calculations from MD suggest that the methane storage capacity may be increased when methane molecules are placed inside the large cage of structure H (sH) hydrate. However, methane storage in pure methane sH clathrates with multiple methane occupancies are only of theoretical interest as the required pressure is about 0.5 GPa or higher. It has also been demonstrated that methane may replace tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME) as the large guest species in the large cage. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Livestock manures contain large amounts of plant nutrients and organic matter (OM). Structural changes to livestock production and ample supply of cheap chemical fertilisers have decreased the interest and possibilities of farmers in using manure for the fertilisation of crops and grasslands and maintenance of soil fertility. As a result, many livestock producers dispose of manure as cheaply as possible causing serious pollution of soil, water and atmosphere. In addition, livestock production systems contribute to climate change by emission of the GHG carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Careful recycling of livestock manures to fertilise crops and grasslands and improve soil fertility is considered the most suitable and cost-effective option for environmentally friendly disposal. Manure management legislation in The Netherlands is described to explain the principles. These include complete collection of faeces and urine of confined livestock, adaptation of the period and rate of manure application to the N and P requirements of crops, and use of manure collection, storage and application techniques aiming at low ammonia (NH3) losses. Effects of sustainable manure management on GHG emissions are described. Optimising the period, rate and technique of manure application to crops and grassland causes effective utilisation of manure N and reduces direct and indirect losses of N 2O. In addition, effective recycling of manure nutrients and OM allows a reduction in the use of chemical fertilisers and fossil energy and contributes to the maintenance or improvement of the carbon content of agricultural ecosystems. The relatively high costs of sustainable manure management stimulate farmers to optimise feed conversion and minimise manure production per unit of product by good livestock feeding and management practices. High feed conversion efficiency reduces CH4 emission by enteric fermentation and may reduce feed imports and related GHG emissions. In addition, it is shown that livestock categories differ widely in feed conversion efficiency and N and P excretion per unit of product. Finally, anaerobic digestion of livestock slurries provides a valuable energy source and reduces CH4 emission of stored slurry and, possibly, N2O emission after field application of the slurry. © CSIRO 2008.","CH4; CO2; Livestock production; Manure management legislation; N; N2O","anoxic conditions; fermentation; grassland; greenhouse gas; legislation; management practice; methane; optimization; soil fertility; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; Western Europe",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37649016449

Two data sets of measurements of surface heat fluxes taken in the spring and autumn were tested with emphasis on the short-term (h) closure of the surface energy budget. The analysis shows that correction of the wind speed measurement sonic anemometer error at large angles of attack has influence on the energy budget closure; an important contribution also comes from heat storage between the soil flux sensor and the ground surface, not only for the amplitude but also for the relative phases of the measured fluxes. An analysis of the time series stationarity did not show appreciable effects on the energy budget. Instead, it appeared to be sensitive to the length of the averaging period for the coordinate rotation system. The use of a 'long term coordinate system', together with spectral analysis indicated that the usual 30-min averaging time is too short to include the entire contribution of the turbulent heat fluxes and that a 2-h averaging period is more suitable if larger scale motion effects are to be included. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The highest capacitance was obtained with the CAG- 3 wt % MWNT because this sample displayed the highest content of oxygen, and the highest ultramicropore volume that can accommodate electrolyte ions (O H- in KOH and S O4 2- in H2 S O4). The capacitance of these materials when subjected to several thousands of galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments revealed that the samples showed a fairly stable behavior in KOH electrolyte, whereas in H2 S O4 electrolyte only the composite containing the highest amount of MWNTs (i.e., 12 wt %) was stable. The other samples displayed a dramatic enhancement in the capacitance during the first few thousands of cycles and then dropped to very low values.

Latent heat storage in a phase change material (PCM) is very attractive because of its high-energy storage density and its isothermal behavior during the phase change process. Thermal storage plays a major role in building energy conservation, which is greatly assisted by the incorporation of latent heat storage in building products. Increasing the thermal storage capacity of a building can enhance human comfort by decreasing the frequency of internal air temperature swings so that the indoor air temperature is closer to the desired temperature for a longer period of time. However, it is impossible to select a phase change material to suit all the weather condition in a given location. The PCM that reduces the internal air temperature swing during the winter season is not suitable for the summer season as the PCM remains in the liquid state at all the times during these months and hence the system cannot exploit the latent heat effect. This paper attempts to study the thermal performance of an inorganic eutectic PCM based thermal storage system for thermal management in a residential building. The system has been analyzed by theoretical and experimental investigation. A double layer PCM concept is studied in detail to achieve year round thermal management in a passive manner. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The thermo-fluid dynamics of the hydraulic components, including plunger cavity, internal injector pipes and nozzle, was modeled with the solenoid-circuit electromagnetics and the mechanics of rocker arm and follower subsystem. Onedimensional flow equations in conservation form were used to simulate wave propagation phenomena through the injector high-pressure drilled passages. To calculate the temperature variations due to the compressibility of the liquid fuel, the energy equation was used in addition to mass conservation and momentum balance equations. Furthermore, in order to determine the value of the electromagnetic force acting on the spill-valve, the application of a practical procedure was made using easily available experimental current and voltage data. An advanced mechanical model of the rocker arm and follower subsystem was developed, taking the mechanical drive deformability into account. It was capable of accurately simulating the effects of the pressure wave dynamics on the plunger kinematics as well as on the Hertzian contact forces at the plunger-follower and cam-rocker-arm interfaces. The numerical code was validated at different working conditions through the comparison of predicted results and experimental data in terms of pressure in the plunger cavity, injected flow-rate, needle-and spill-valve lift time-histories. The developed EUI model was then applied for better understanding the cause and effect relationships in the analysis of system transients. Furthermore, a parametric study was carried out to assess the effects of important geometrical and mechanical system parameters on EUI operation.

Many existing studies intend to evaluate the net non renewable energy and GHG savings associated to the various biofuel production pathways. However, there is no consensus on the results of those studies. The main explanations of variations among the results are the following: energy consumption and GHG emissions of the reference fossil pathway, data used for the representation of farming processes and biofuel production processes, accounting for carbon storage in agricultural soils, reference use of the land, choice of an allocation method in case of coproduction. There is a strong drive in the European Union for a certification on the sustainability of biofuel pathways. Germany, The Netherlands, The United Kingdom and France have started to work on reference framework for the evaluation of biofuel pathways, in particular (but not only) from the GHG emissions point of view. This study intends to detail a WTW assessment for first generation biofuels in the French context. A detailed description of today French agriculture and biofuel production is made in order to give reference data for the WTW analysis. Based on the existing biofuel pathways and their possible evolution, this study then evaluates the potential GHG savings according to the French objectives of biofuel use: 5.75% in 2008 and 7% in 2010. The sensitivity of the results to regional factors (mainly in the farming processes) is then calculated in order to evaluate the possible variations. Effect of land use change is not taken into account in that study.

These materials power billions of portable electronic devices in today's society. However, large-scale, high-capacity storage devices capable of powering hybrid electric vehicles (HEV?s) or their plug-in versions (PHEV's) have much more demanding requirements with respect to safety, cost, and the power they must deliver. Recently, nanostructured solid state materials, which are comprised of two more compositional or structural phases, have been found to show exciting possibilities to meet these criteria. Such concepts are exploited where the intimate mix of components at the nanoscale enhances reversibility, and capacity-essential for new cathode materials that function on the basis of intergrowth structures; and poorly conductive materials where limitations to electron or ion transport must be overcome by judicious design of nanostructured composites. Moreover, by definition, the interphase between the electrode and electrolyte forms a complex nanostructure that must be tailored to optimize transport properties.

This paper is focused on the design and development of a modified PV system, consisting of a normal PV panel coupled with a Phase Change Material (PCM). PCMs are ""latent"" energy storage materials, using chemical bonds to store and release heat. The system is based on the idea that decreasing the operating temperature of the panel causes an increase in its energy conversion efficiency. A theoretical analysis of the system was accomplished by using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS, a partial differential equations (PDEs) solver. By using this software, the thermal behaviour of the PV-PCM system was simulated, thus allowing a better identification of the suitable thermo-physical parameters for the optimization of the panel efficiency. The numerical simulations accomplished showed that a PCM with a melting temperature between 28°C and 32°C in a typical summer day in Sicily induces a significant variation in the energy conversion efficiency. The experimental set-up realized to validate these results is also described in the paper, but the experimental tests have still not been run. Furthermore, the exploitation of this simple technology could permit to reduce CO2 emissions because the increasing of the energy conversion efficiency means more energy production and consequently less emission of greenhouse gases to produce energy by fossil fuel or normal PV panel.","Energy conversion efficiency; Heat storage; Phase change material; PV","Carbon dioxide; Chemical bonds; Conversion efficiency; Energy conversion; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Partial differential equations; Phase change materials; Design and Development; Energy productions; Energy storage materials; Experimental setup; Experimental test; Heat storage systems; Hot climate; Multi-physics; New devices; Operating temperature; Phase Change Material (PCM); Phase changing materials; Photovoltaic panels; PV; PV panel; PV system; SIMPLE technology; Thermal behaviours; Thermo-physical parameters; Photovoltaic cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067736104

Without compression, digitized raw video data requires too much bandwidth and storage. Usually, the higher the compression ratio we want, the more complex the video coding algorithms that we have to apply. To realize complex video encoding or decoding, we need powerful VLSI circuits to do the computations in real-time. The Advanced Video Coding (AVC; also known as ITU-T H.264 and MPEG-4 Part 10) standard was developed by the Joint Video Team (JVT), which consists of members of both the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and the ISO/IEC Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). AVC significantly outperforms previous video coding standards. Its high compression performance comes at a very high cost of computing and memory access. Furthermore, due to the complex, sequential, and highly data-dependent characteristics of the essential algorithms in AVC, both pipelining and parallel processing techniques are difficult to be directly employed. The hardware utilization and throughput are also decreased because of the inherent block/macroblock/frame-level reconstruction loops. In addition to the complexity issue, another big headache is the power consumption, especially for mobile applications. Allocating powerful hardware resources for realtime computing is the basic requirement. At the same time, we also have to consider the power optimization. For battery-powered appliances, the energy is limited, and no one can accept a product that needs to be charged frequently. An integrated circuit (IC) consuming too much power will also cause the heat dissipation and stability problem. In this chapter, three hardwired H.264/AVC encoder/decoder design cases are presented. The first design is an HDTV720p 30 frames/s AVC encoder.1,2 From the discussions of this design, we can see how hardware resources are efficiently allocated to fulfill the computing requirement. The second case is the design of a low-power and poweraware AVC encoder.3 Here, the target specification of video resolution is smaller, and the design puts more emphasis on power issues. Low-power techniques are discussed, and the power-awareness concept is realized in this power-scalable architecture. In the third reference design, the architecture of a hybrid task-pipelining AVC decoder4,5 is described. The major design issue is to arrange decoding functions into proper pipelining schedules, and to reduce the external and internal memory bandwidth. Before detailed discussions of the three design cases, a brief introduction and analysis of the H.264/AVC algorithm is given in section 8.1. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","AVC; Compression; H.264; Hardwired architecture; Low power; MPEG; Video codec; Video coding",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056418986

Most individuals match cumulative energy intake to energy expenditure with great precision whenmeasured within a period including several meals.1 Such an active process-energy homeostasis-allows stability in the amount of body energy stored as fat. The hypothalamus was first identified more than 50 years ago as “central” in the energy homeostatic process. Brain lesion and stimulation studies, published some six decades ago described the hypothalamus as a major center controlling food intake and body weight, with the ventromedial nucleus (VMH) as a “satiety centre,” and the lateral hypothalamic nucleus (LHA) as a “hunger centre.”2 However, central regulation of satiety requires that the brain integrates energy content of the body. Hence, the brain is connected to peripheral body weight sensor systems. Nutrients, hormones, and neuromediators are regulators of food intake directly triggering the brain. However, such messages must originate from cells, which are aware of the energy stores. Since 1995, the most studied related mechanism has been the leptin system.3 This hormone, produced by the adipose tissue, is considered as a “lipostat” since it is produced proportionally to the fat mass and has a remarkable capacity to reduce food intake. Therefore, the adipose tissue is no longer considered as a fat storage organ but refers to the brain of the energy stores by themeanof hormones such as leptin. Similar to the reasoning that fat mass is the most obvious tissue informing the brain about the energy stores, the gastrointestinal tract (GI) is the most obvious organ to inform the brain of energy intake by a mechanism called “energystat.” Therefore, the GI secretes sufficient peptide-hormones able to control food intake and energy homeostasis. Consequently, an impaired regulation of the lipostat and energystat will prevent the brain from the messages required for the regulation of energy homeostasis andwill lead tometabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, or cachexia. Wewill review themajor regulators of satiety and glucose homeostasis (Figure 11.1); afterward, we will focus on the peripheral gut hormones-brain axis and its relevance to appetite control. © 2008 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056060245

However, the equilibrium hydrogen pressure for decomposition of nanocrystalline MgH2 was found to be somewhat lower than for conventional magnesium hydride. Moreover, the essential difference in equilibrium hydrogen pressure for absorption and for desorption of hydrogen by nanocrystalline magnesium was reported by many authors. This difference called “hysteresis” is a common phenomenon for hydrides, but it is not observed for magnesium powders with an ordinary particle size (more than 1 µm). The aim of the present work was to elucidate why the hysteresis arises in magnesium-hydrogen system with decreasing the particles size. It is shown, that the “hysteresis” observed in nanocrystalline magnesium is a seeming phenomenon, which is due to a hindered nucleation during hydriding at pressures closed to equilibrium. The pressures measured for desorption represent the real equilibrium. The plateau pressure of Mg + H2 ↔ MgH2 equilibrium is lower for nanocrystalline magnesium than that for conventional magnesium. This result is explained in terms of smaller surface energy of magnesium hydride in comparison with magnesium. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","Gas-solid reactions; Hydrogen storage; Hysteresis; Nanocrystalline magnesium",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044444830

This facility is a large flashlamp pumped laser (1.8-MJ optical output). The Pulsed Power Conditioning System of LMJ is based on a modular design of 480 modules (400-MJ energy capacitor bank). A new capacitor bank module (CBM) for the LMJ Power Conditioning System has been developed by the Institute of High Current Electronics (IHCE, Tomsk) in collaboration with International Technologies for High Pulsed Power (France). Two such modules were produced and tested in IHCE. The main parts of the CBM are the following: high-voltage power supplies, command control system, air conditioning system, capacitor block, and cables delivering the energy to a load. The parameters of the module are the following: total rated capacitance of 2900 (+4%) μF, charging voltage up to 24 kV, peak current amplitude of 240 kA, peak stored energy up to 864 kJ, pulsewidth at 10% of peak power of 360 μs, dimensions of 2.3 × 1.5 × 2.5 m3, and weight of ~2500 kg. In nominal regime (24-kV charging voltage, 40-m length cables), the energy delivered to flashlamps in each channel is 74 kJ (86% efficiency). No failures were observed in more than 1000 test shots, and all parameters of the CBM are well within the requirements.

LAI, defined as one-half the total green leaf area per unit of ground surface area, drives the within and the below canopy microclimate, determines canopy water interception, radiation extinction, and water and carbon gas exchange. Therefore, accurate LAI is a key parameter in all models describing the exchange of fluxes of energy, mass (e.g., water and CO2), and momentum between the surface and the planetary boundary layer. Unfortunately, LAI is very difficult to quantify accurately due to its spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. The long-term objectives of this study are 1) to improve LAI estimation accuracy with considerations of scale, heterogeneity (spatial, vertical, and temporal), and land cover type, 2) to develop a better approach to LAI parameterization for models in hydrology, climatology, and ecosystem, and 3) to investigate the effects of land cover and land use changes on LAI dynamics, which can cause massive hydrological change. In this paper, we aim to 1) characterize the spatial scale of LAI and normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI) in a Canadian prairie using a wavelet approach based on field measured LAI and reflectance data, and 2) to simulate the temporal dynamics of LAI variation intra-annually with both ground measured LAI and satellite derived NDVI values. The study area is in St. Denis Wildlife Reserve Area, 40km east of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Results indicated that the spatial variation of LAI and NDVI is maximized at 22.5 meters and with several small scale variations (4.5m, 12m, and 18m). The temporal LAI dynamics indicated that the native prairie greens up in May and senescent in September, and the maximum growing season is in July for the Canadian prairie.","Leaf area index; Remote sensing; Variability; Wavelet","Boundary layers; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Dynamics; Land use; Vegetation; Leaf Area Index; Normalized differences; Planetary boundary layers; Saskatchewan , Canada; Spatial and temporal variability; Spatial heterogeneity; Variability; Wavelet; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006794676

Magnetic and ferroelectric materials are time-honoured research subjects which have led to new discoveries, both scientific and technological. Multiferroic compounds are the source of magnetoelectric (ME) effects that are strong enough to induce magnetic or electric phase transitions, thus exerting ME phase control. The giant response can be generated by the presence of exceptionally large magnetic and/or electric fields in matter, which are the result of the long-range ordering. In this sense the ME effect in multiferroics is 'large' if the ME contribution corresponding to the free energy of the system is large. Due to their interesting physical, chemical, and mechanical properties, these materials have been used to realize a vast number of devices ranging from giant devices like electrical transformers to tiny devices like sensors, used in integrated circuits or as storage devices. Furthermore, these materials are likely to offer new kinds of devices and functionality, because of their size-dependent physical and chemical properties, which have motivated a lot of current research activity in the area of ferroelectric and magnetic materials. In particular, advances in atomic and nanoscale growth and characterization techniques have led to the production of modern ferroelectromagnetic materials that reveal a range of fascinating phenomena. These phenomena derived from the fact that electrons have spin as well as charge, giving an extra level of complexity to the physics, and an extra degree of freedom in device design. Magnetoelectric coupling between electric and magnetic order parameters has been theoretically predicted, and there is intense interest in its implementation in device architectures taking advantage of these properties. Multiferroics may be in the form of single-phase, exhibit mulitferroicity generally at low temperatures and in a composite form as a product property of a composite phase consisting of a magnetostrictive and a piezoelectric material. Hence, the search continues for new single-phase and composite multiferroic materials that exhibit high ordering temperatures, high coupling constant, low dielectric loss and low leakage current. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.","antiferromagnetics; Composite materials; Magnetoacoustic effects; Transition-metal compounds",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006225993

However, developing new routes for making nano-based materials is a challenging area for solid-state materials chemists. This book does just that by describing a novel method for preparing them. The authors have developed a novel low-temperature, self-propagating synthetic route to nano-oxides by the solution combustion and combustible precursor processes. This method provides the desired composition, structure, and properties for many types of technologically useful nanocrystalline oxide materials like alumina, ceria, iron oxides, titania, yttria, and zirconia, among others. The book is particularly instructive in bringing readers one step closer to the exploration of nanomaterials. Students of nanoscience can acquaint themselves with the actual production and evaluation of nanopowders by this route, while academic researchers and industrial scientists will find answers to a host of questions on nano-oxides. The book also provides an impetus for scientists in industrial research to evaluate and explore new ways to scale up the production of nanomaterials, offering helpful suggestions for further research. © 2008 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Both countries' responses are compared to a similar carbon price schedule (US$10/tCO2e in 2013 rising exponentially to $100 by 2050) using a hybrid technologically explicit and behaviourally realistic model with macroeconomic feedbacks (CIMS). Then additional measures are imposed based on the national circumstances of each country; for Canada we simulate a 50% reduction by 2050, and stabilization for China. The scale of the challenge in all cases requires that every available option be vigorously pursued, including energy efficiency, fuel switching, carbon capture and storage, and accelerated development of renewables; to compensate, there are significant co-reductions of local air pollutants such as SOx and NOx. Finally, the abatement cost schedules of China and Canada are compared, and implications considered for carbon permit flows if the cost schedule of the rest of the developed world is assumed to be similar to that of Canada. We found that the developed world and China could collectively reduce emissions by 50% in 2050 at a price of $175/tCO2e, with permits flowing from the developed countries to China; while abatement costs are lower in China up to $75/t, at higher prices reductions are less costly in the developed world. Our results indicate that a global low-carbon society is feasible, on condition that policy makers are willing and able to impose long-term, credible policy packages with carbon pricing policy as the core element, coupled with supplementary regulations to address market failures. © 2008 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Canada; Carbon trading; China; Development; Endogenous technical change; Hybrid model; Low-carbon society; Public policy; Scenario modelling; Stabilization pathways",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954172582

Only decades later was the extraordinarily dynamic role of AT recognized, revealing its participation in a broad range of physiological processes, including reproduction, apoptosis, inflammation, angiogenesis, blood pressure, atherogenesis, coagulation, fibrinolysis, immunity and vascular homeostasis with either direct or indirect implications in the regulation of proliferation. The functional pleiotropism of AT relies on its ability to synthesize and, in some cases, secrete a large number of enzymes, hormones, growth factors, cytokines, complement factors, and matrix and membrane proteins, collectively termed adipokines. At the same time, white AT expresses receptors for most of these factors, warranting a wide cross-talk at both local and systemic levels in response to metabolic changes or other external stimuli. In this chapter, mounting evidence on the specific characteristics of AT from different depots is outlined in relation to fat distribution and comorbidity development. The current knowledge in this field is reviewed with a broad perspective ranging from classification, structure, and distribution to the key functional roles of AT with a particular focus on the role of adipokines and their involvement in the metabolic disorders accompanying obesity. © 2008 Humana Press, a part of Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Adipocytes; Adipokines; Comorbidities; Cytokines; Energy homeostasis; Fat distribution; Glucose and lipid metabolism; Obesity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934434968

These cause symptoms because of the build up of precursors, the absence of the final product, an excess of toxic intermediaries, or a combination of these mechanisms. Many are fatal in childhood, but some are compatible with adult life and pregnancy. These disorders may be encountered by an obstetric anesthesiologist (either because of their prevalence or, for some rare conditions, because modern management confers an improved chance of fertility). Some examples of these disorders can be found in Table 13.1. Malignant hyperthermia, plasma pseudocholinesterase deficiency, and inherited hematological, endocrine, connective tissue, or bone disorders are discussed elsewhere. In all these rare disorders, a basic tenet of management is to refer to a specialist in the relevant field of medicine, to coordinate a multidisciplinary team approach and to make a thorough and early antenatal assessment, with documentation of a plan of management. Glycogen storage diseases: Glucose metabolism plays a fundamental role in supplying energy for most cellular metabolic processes. Glycogen, the storage form of glucose, is composed of a branched polymer of glucose residues and can be found in muscle and liver. Defects in glycogen metabolism typically cause accumulation of glycogen in the tissues. Historically, the glycogen storage diseases have been classified numerically according to the specific enzyme defect. Since the main manifestations are either primarily related to liver or muscle, it may be more useful to categorize them according to the primary organ involved. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928854277

The browning reaction followed a zero order kinetic model. Its maximum activity was at pH 6.0. This activity was completely inhibited at a pH below 3.0 regardless of temperature; however, in alkaline conditions, pH inhibition depended on temperature and was observed at values above 9.0 and 11.0 at 8 C and 25 C, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters of substrate oxidation depended on pH within the range in which activity was observed. The reaction occurred according to an isokinetic system because pH affected the enzymatic reaction rate but not the energy required to carry out the reaction. In the alkaline pH region, browning was due to a combination of enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions which occurred in parallel. These results correlated well with the browning behavior observed in intentionally bruised fruits at different temperatures and in different storage solutions. The use of a low temperature (≈8 C) was very effective for preventing browning regardless of the cover solution used.","Browning; Bruise; Harvest; Olive (manzanilla cultivar)","Engineers; Fruits; Glycosylation; Harvesting; Nutrition; Temperature; Alkaline conditions; Browning; Bruise; Olive (manzanilla cultivar); Polyphenol oxidase; Substrate oxidation; Thermodynamic parameter; Zero order kinetics; Alkalinity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924419152

World population will continue to grow, and to feed people should be, for the next years, the main objective, keeping the variety and specificity of foods around the world. Food processes are complex combinations of operations, with flows of materials and fluids, with objectives of minimal consumption of water, energy and with zero pollution. Process has to respect the stability of bioactive compounds with an appropriate formulation, preventing undesirable interactions between components, in relation with operating conditions, controlled until storage (packaging, atmosphere). Quality, nutritional aspects represent more and more consumer wishes. Hygienic design has become an integrated disciplin, food safety being a matter of the whole food supply chain from product design to consumer and disposal. The objectives of processing are to preserve, to initiate or to stop chemical and biochemical reactions, to design structure and properties, to stabilise products. Process control with on-line monitoring of physical and biochemical parameters (T, P, ρ, pH, total solids...), permits shorter product runs, and optimization of the variation of parameters along process. The process is in the plant but also at home, at the farm, in food services, at different scales, with different equipments.

Combined heat, cooling and power (CHCP) systems are interesting for the supply of different energy services in urban districts and in big buildings, particularly in warm areas such as the Mediterranean countries. These systems utilize a fuel's energy better, because the cogenerated heat can be used for heating in winter as well as for cooling in summer with an absorption refrigerator. Furthermore, the use of thermal energy storage (TES) provides an additional advantage, which is the coverage of variable thermal demands while the production system operates continuously at nominal conditions. Thus, energy supply systems integrating the technologies of cogeneration, absorption refrigeration and thermal storage can provide substantial benefits from economic, energetic and environmental viewpoints. In this paper an optimization model is developed, using mixed integer lineal programming (MILP), to determine the preliminary design of CHCP systems with thermal storage as well as optimum operation for the different plant components on an hour-by-hour basis throughout the year. The objective function to be minimized is the total annual cost. The optimization model is applied to design a system providing energy services for a set of buildings constituted by 5 000 apartments located in the city of Zaragoza (Spain). The design methodology also takes into account the legal constraints imposed on cogeneration systems in Spain.","CHCP; Cogeneration; Energy systems; MILP; Optimization","Absorption cooling; Absorption refrigeration; Cogeneration plants; Design; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Heat storage; Integer programming; Optimization; Absorption refrigerators; CHCP; Cogeneration; Energy supply system; Energy systems; Mediterranean countries; MILP; Optimization modeling; Cooling systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924326178

The main products of the analyzed factory are cheese from sheep's milk, mozzarella and ricotta, starting from milk coming from outside, which is internally pasteurized and processed. The overall yearly treated amount of milk is stabilized over the last six years at about 5.3 million liters of sheep's milk and 2.3 million liters of cow's milk. The temperature levels of thermal processes involved in the production range from 60 to 95 °C. The analysis of heat consumption during the working days (3-4 per week) reveals that it is mainly concentrated during night and early morning hours, thus suggesting the utilization of a heat storage. The proposed plant is integrated in parallel with the current heating system, essentially made of steam boilers fuelled with gasoil. The heat storage system is a boiler with pressurized saturated water (7 bars). The main analyzed variables are the collector type, total area of collectors and size of storage system. The plant is simulated with a built in code, which is able to provide the yearly fuel and costs savings. The results, under optimized conditions, show the very attractive 65% potential of primary energy saving and the presence of an economically optimizing size of the storage vessel.","Dairy; Heat consumption; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Storage","Boilers; Dairies; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Engines; Environmental impact; Heat storage; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Analysis and evaluation; Generation systems; Heat consumption; Heat storage systems; Optimized conditions; Primary energy savings; Production process; Solar thermal plants; Dairy products",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924311100

The hydrogen PEM fuel cells were selected to provide a new generation of conventional submarines with an Air Independent Propulsion system (AIP) enabling therefore unattainable durations for submerged operations together with exceptional acoustic performance. The submerged range and endurance of submarines equipped with AIP fuel cell systems is essentially determined by the amount of energy carried on-board in the form of hydrogen and oxygen. Storage of oxygen in liquid form is the optimal solution. Regarding to the hydrogen, in medium to long term, two alternative methods may become practicable, hydrogen storage in carbon-nanofibres CNF or in metallic hydrides for example, and storage of liquid fuels as methanol and generation of the hydrogen required on-board. Nevertheless, to avoid hydrogen storage would be advisable. The objective of this study is to perform an exergetic analysis of two possibilities of using PEM fuel cells in submarines: hydrogen/oxygen PEM fuel cells fed with hydrogen generated by reforming of methanol, and Direct Methanol Fuel Cells directly fed with liquid methanol. To do this, exergy losses and exergetic efficiencies are calculated for both configurations at selected optimal operation points. Equal molar rate of methanol is assumed in both systems. In order to simplify the models used, the commonly used assumptions in steady state fuel cell models are adopted: all parameters are time-independent, all gases are ideal gases, kinetic and potential exergy of reactants and products is neglected. The waste heat of the cell was not recovered in either case.","Exergy; Fuel cells; Submarines","Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC); Environmental impact; Exergy; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas fuel purification; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Liquids; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Oxygen; Propulsion; Ship propulsion; Submarines; Waste heat; Acoustic performance; Air-independent propulsion systems; Conventional submarines; Exergetic analysis; Exergetic efficiency; Naval applications; Optimal operation point; Time independents; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924300090

The production of intense high energy photon beams requires Insertion Devices (ID) with high magnetic field and large number of periods. To cover the 20-50 keV range, an in vacuum wiggler has been preferred to a superconducting wiggler. This choice results from a compromise between photon flux, investment and running cost. Deep studies have been performed to find the optimum magnetic field and period producing the maximum flux in the dedicated spectral range (20-50 keV). The wiggler is composed of 38 periods of 50 mm producing 2.1 T at a 5.5 mm minimum gap. To minimize the high magnetic forces acting between the magnet arrays (10 tons), a compensation system has been designed. It consists of two series of 40 amagnetic springs reducing the forces down to 1 ton over the whole range of the magnetic gap variation.

However, rainwater tanks do not appear to be considered a serious water supply option by many government agencies. The major concern about rainwater tanks for drought response is the yield they would provide during drought conditions. The results presented in this paper challenge the widely held assumption that rainwater tanks cannot provide a reliable supply during drought. Rainwater tank modelling undertaken during a severe drought from 1998 to 2006 in the water supply catchment showed that rainwater tanks on single dwellings increase water supply storage levels by at least 15%, raising storages from less than 40% to above 60%. Rainwater tanks can also provide similar securities of supply as a desalination scheme that was run as a drought relief measure and not as a constant base load. Furthermore, the real cost per kilolitre of desalination is challenged by investigating the assumption that once a desalination plant is built, it will be running constantly. However, cost, climate change and energy management suggest that the desalination plant be used only when required. Depending on the operating model of the desalination plant, the levelised cost can vary from $1.55 to $6.80 /kL. This compares with rainwater tanks, which have a levelised cost of $2.20 to $4.20 /kL. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2008.",,"Catchments; Climate change; Desalination; Drought; Tanks (containers); Base-loads; Desalination plant; Drought conditions; Drought response; Government agencies; Operating models; Real costs; Storage level; Water supply; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; desalination; drought resistance; hydrological modeling; rainwater; storage tank; water management; water supply; Australasia; Australia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864555511

Magnesium material, characterized by light weight and low cost of production, can reversibly store about 7.7 wt% hydrogen. However, further research is needed since Mg has a high operation temperature and slow absorption kinetics that prevent the use in practical applications. For these reasons a detailed study of the interface between Mg and MgH2 is needed. Further insights are gained by characterizing the Mg-MgH2 system from both the experimental and the numerical point of view. The study of the MgH 2-Mg phase transformation in powder samples has been performed to gain detailed metallographic information. A method for studying this phase transformation by cross sectional samples scanning electron microscopy observation of partially transformed material has been developed. This method exploits the peculiar features of this system where the MgH2 phase is insulating and the Mg is a metallic conducting phase. This difference can induce a contrast between the two phases owing to the different secondary emission yield. Further insights are gained by characterizing Mg-MgH2 interfaces by means of accurate first-principle molecular dynamics simulations based on the density-functional theory. Extensive electronic structure calculations are used to characterize the equilibrium properties and the behavior of the surfaces in terms of total energy considerations and atomic diffusion. © 2009 Materials Research Society.",,"Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Hydrogen storage; Metallography; Molecular dynamics; Phase transitions; Scanning electron microscopy; Secondary emission; Cross-sectional sample; Electronic structure calculations; Equilibrium properties; First-principle molecular dynamics; Hydrogen storage media; Numerical characterization; Operation temperature; Secondary emission yield; Magnesium compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950467018

The attention given to this issue is due not only to the increasing threat of terrorism but to the nuclear power renaissance as well.

The principal risks of the nuclear power are associated with the enrichment (separation) of uranium isotopes, long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel, plutonium and/or uranium recovery from SNF, storage of recovered fissile materials. The degree of proliferation resistance results in particular from a combination of technical design features, operational modalities, institutional arrangements, and safeguards measures.

Several solar thermal collectors as flat plate, Integrated Collector Storage (ICS), Compound Parabolic Concentrating (CPC), linear Fresnel lens type and vacuum tube collectors developed for domestic use, with minor changes in their design and operation, can be suitable for disinfecting water. From laboratory scale experiments with an ICS collector, a minimum time period of three hours was observed for an effective disinfection treatment at 65°C. For solar collectors operating in higher temperatures, similar disinfection results can be achieved in a shorter time. Alternative systems as the flat plate collectors with booster reflectors that achieve increased thermal output and the combination of ICS solar collectors with Fresnel lenses are also suggested, where the drainage water can be preheated through the absorbers of the placed Fresnel lenses on the greenhouse roof.","Fresnel lenses; ICS systems; Solar water heating; Water treatment",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449121696

Solar radiation incident on the solar thermal collectors, air temperature above the heated cultivated surface, growing media temperature, water temperature inside the storage tank were measured and recorded continuously by a system composed of data logger and sensors. Results of the experiment showed that the use of the solar thermal collectors must be integrated with auxiliary heat sources, such as burners or heat pumps.

This research aims to design a greenhouse concept with minimal use of fossil energy and independent of nearby greenhouses. The concept is called the zero-fossil-energy-greenhouse. This paper presents a theoretical design study and analysis to assess the viability of a zero-fossil-energy- greenhouse concept. The greenhouse was designed for Dutch circumstances and relies on available state-of-art technologies. Nine concepts were generated and evaluated by a panel of experts. Although, none of the concepts was unanimously selected, one of the concepts received on-average highest votes. It uses an aquifer for long term heat and cold storage. Geothermal heat and a heat pump connected to the warm pit of the aquifer are used to heat of the greenhouse. Electricity need is covered by green-electricity. Cooling and dehumidification of the greenhouse is realised by a heat pump combined with the cold aquifer pit. This concept was more thoroughly evaluated in a simulation study that assessed design consistency and evaluated greenhouse performance in view of design requirements. From the simulations it was concluded that a combination of geothermal heat and a heat pump/aquifer can cover the heat demand of the greenhouse with help of heat buffers, but a fully closed greenhouse concept is not manageable in the summer season. With given technology the chosen concept was not able to cool and dehumidify greenhouse air to target temperature and humidity. A semi closed greenhouse solves this problem.","Aquifer; Closed greenhouse; Geothermal heat; Heat pump; Methodical design",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449101611

Pests and diseases find their way through the openings; carbon dioxide fertilisation becomes inefficient and the inescapable coupling of heat and vapour release results often in sub-optimal conditions for either temperature or humidity. The present trend, therefore, is to reduce ventilation as much as possible, also in Mediterranean conditions. This relies obviously on improved means for diminishing the heat load and proper use of cooling equipment. Especially the latter can combine the benefits of cooling the greenhouse air with serious energy conservation. However, opposite to the clear benefits there are also serious investments associated with active cooling of greenhouse. Therefore, there is a growing demand for some computational tool that enables quantitive comparisons between the vast number of alternatives with respect to the different components of (semi) closed greenhouse systems. The benefits in terms of improved production (quality, ornamental value and quantity) are quite difficult to quantify, due to the complexity of the biological processes involved. On the energy side of the balance, however, since the physics of greenhouses, climate controllers and horticultural hardware can be described very well, it is quite possible to develop such a tool for predicting the energy consumption of a (semi) closed greenhouse for a wide range of horticultural and outside climate conditions. This paper gives an outline of such a tool and discusses some results. Just as an illustration, a number of quantitative effects are shown of changing the fraction of closed greenhouse surface in a 1 hectare enterprise that consists of closed and non-closed compartments. This analysis is made for both a Dutch climate situation and a Mediterranean weather data set.","Climate management; Cooling; Energy consumption; Heat pumps; Heat storage; Sustainable energy",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449096111

As energy-intensive consumers, greenhouses are directly implicated. That's why it's important to develop the concept of ""sustainable greenhouses"" in France, using renewable energy. In this case, the method which retains the attention is the concept of reversible climatisation through Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES). This technique is already in application in other European countries, especially in the Netherlands, but has never been tested in France. The objective of the research project led by the Ctifl and the BRGM (French Geological Survey) is to determine which parameters are necessary to evaluate the pre-feasibility of this technique on an agricultural site. First, a thermal dimensioning of a typical greenhouse was carried out for two climatic contexts in France (North-West, and South-East). It allows the power which is necessary to maintain temperature setpoints in summer and in winter to be determined. These elements also allow the determination of the temperatures and of the volumes of water that have to be alternatively pumped and injected into the aquifer (in the cold and the hot wells). The second part of the project consists in studying the aquifer thermal energy storage through sets of numerical simulations. The model used is a finite differences model developed by BRGM, which can treat both water flow and heat transfers. A sensibility analysis is carried out on several sets of parameters, which depend either on exploitation conditions (pumping and injection discharge, distance between wells, etc.), or on aquifer conditions (geometry, thermal and hydraulic characteristics, etc.).","Aquifer; Energy storage; Greenhouse",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449087095

The technical concept consists of a heat pump, underground (aquifer) seasonal energy storage as well as daytime storage, air treatment units with heat exchangers, and air distribution ducts. Savings of up to 30% in fossil fuel and production increases by up to 20%, mainly because of the continuously high CO2 concentration, have been reported. Economic feasibility of this innovative greenhouse highly depends on the yield increase that can be obtained. In this simulation study the effects of greenhouse climate on tomato yield in a closed greenhouse are presented. The explanatory model INTKAM was used, which has several submodels e.g. for light interception, leaf photosynthesis and biomass partitioning. The closed greenhouse offers possibilities for combinations of light, temperature, air humidity and CO2 concentration that are impossible in a conventional greenhouse. At high CO2 concentration and high light intensity, leaf photosynthesis shows a more narrow optimum for temperature than at high CO 2 and moderate light intensity. However, the response of crop photosynthesis to temperature has a much broader optimum than that of leaf photosynthesis. Besides photosynthesis, temperature also influences aspects like partitioning, leaf area development and fruit development. Yield potential reduces at temperatures above 26°C, with fruit set being one of the first processes that is negatively influenced by supra-optimal temperatures. Based on actual climatic conditions in a conventional and a closed greenhouse (same crop management) measured during two years, INTKAM predicts an increase in yield by about 17%. Hence, in a closed greenhouse a higher stem density can be maintained for obtaining the same average fruit weight (size) as in a conventional greenhouse. In 2005 actual yield increase was similar to the simulated one (16%), but in 2004 only a 9% higher yield was realized, at least partly because of botrytis infection in the closed greenhouse.","Closed greenhouse; Crop model; High CO2; Temperature; Tomato","Botrytis; Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350063053

Currently, many of the crops for potential energy purposes are food crops (wheat, barley, corn, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower, grain sorghum, sugar beet) and their production may be used as biofuel source (bioethanol and biodiesel) since their crop management aspects are well known and consequently they are immediately applicable.

Crops for food, however, often have negative energetic indices and environmental impacts (carbon sequestration, Life Cycle Assessment), consequent to their low productivity.

One of the key problems associated with kind of energy generation is the residual waste formed after a fuel cycle (spent nuclear fuel). The thermal treatment received in the reactor and there composition renders these materials very difficult to characterize and thus exhaustive studies are required to obtain knowledge that will help to build a complete, reliable and very safety underground facility. In this way, the option known as the Deep Geological Repository (DGR) is under development by each country taking part in the nuclear energy industry. The unique pathway for the migration to the biosphere of the radionuclide, actinide and lanthanides content in the spent fuel pellet (UO2) after the closing of the deep geological repository is by a water transport phenomena. It is a fundamental question to know how much time they will spend on their trip and the first step is the rate of liberation of these radionuclides from the spent fuel pellet. In this way the matrix dissolution rate of the spent fuel pellet, which is not dependent on the specific surface area after normalization by the initial value is a key parameter to begin the performance assessment for any deep geological repository. The specific surface value is, following the Matrix Alteration Model (MAM) sensitivity analysis, one of the most important parameters controlling the radionuclides liberation. In this way, several measurements were carried out to obtain values in different conditions for different sieves of UO2 powder treated as fresh fuel. First of all, the specific surface area was measured with a multi-point isothermal procedure with N2 and Kr for both. The values obtained are presented in order to obtain a general law for the rate of evolution with the particle size. These data are part of a bigger project about the complete description of the spent fuel analogues, which are very useful for obtaining new dissolution rates for spent nuclear fuel under repository simulated conditions. © 2008 Materials Research Society.",,"Actinides; Dissolution; Geological repositories; Geology; Nuclear energy; Nuclear industry; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Pelletizing; Plant shutdowns; Radioisotopes; Residual fuels; Sensitivity analysis; Specific surface area; Spent fuels; Technology transfer; Uranium dioxide; Deep geological repository; Dissolution process; Matrix alteration model; Matrix dissolutions; Nuclear energy industries; Performance assessment; Spent nuclear fuels; Water transport phenomenon; Radioactive waste storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649238667

However, this parameter is hard to calculate due to many unknown variables such as variations in operational conditions and steam saturation along the horizontal wellbores, heat return rates, and losses to the vertical section above the target formation. This paper proposes a new technique to estimate cooling time and formation thermal diffusivity by using thermal transient analysis (TTA) along the horizontal wellbore under a steam heating process. A novel concept of a heating ring is also introduced to measure the heat storage in the heated bitumen at the time of testing. Heating ring can be considered analogous to a drainage area in a conventional pressure transient analysis. The proposed cooling time and formation thermal diffusivity calculated along the horizontal wellbore can be used to assess the effectiveness of the conduction heating. Cooling time in this paper is defined as the theoretical time required to cool the heated formation to the initial formation temperature. A longer cooling time indicates a higher net heat gain in the formation while the calculated thermal diffusivity is used to predict wellbore conditions and the type of fluid saturation along the horizontal wellbore. Thus, a combination of cooling time and formation thermal diffusivity can be employed to assess the effectiveness of heat injection during various steam heating processes. By knowing the effectiveness of each heating scenario, the process can be selected and optimized not only to save heat energy and steam consumption but also to enhance bitumen recovery.

This converter functions as a ""buck"" converter while the battery is recharged or as a ""boost"" converter when the battery supplies the load. The aim of this configuration is to reduce the bulky and heavy of the batteries banc. The new system (inverter, dc/dc converter and battery) has to work then in one of the following two modes according to the availability of the electric system: as an active filter and battery charger if the grid is available or as an AUPS. © 2008 IEEE.","Active filter; Non-active current/power; UPS","Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Industrial electronics; Power supply circuits; Uninterruptible power systems; Active power filters; Auxiliary sources; Battery chargers; Battery supplies; Bi-directional converters; Dc/dc converters; Electric energies; Electric systems; Electrical systems; New systems; Non-active current/power; Power supplies; Re-configurable; Storage elements; Uninterruptible power supplies; UPS; Active filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63149127984

Therefore, developing and implementing effective water resource management and conservation strategies is vital. Generally speaking, most individuals (particularly senior citizens) prefer to use warm water when washing their hands or taking a bath. When hot water is left standing in the hot water pipe (i.e. the faucet is turned off), it will gradually cool. Consequently, when the faucet is first turned on, the water is generally allowed to run until it becomes sufficiently hot. Meanwhile, the original cooler water is simply drained away. Clearly, this approach is wasteful of both time and water. Therefore, this paper develops a green storage tank to perform a thermo-controlled water supply function. The tank is positioned between the hot water supply and the faucet and its operation is controlled by an electro-thermal thin-film heater and a thermo-controlled valve. When the faucet is turned on, the cooler water in the hot water pipe is directed into the tank. Once this water enters the tank, it is mixed with hot water stored inside until it acquires the desired temperature. The warmed water is then supplied to the faucet. When the water flowing through the hot pipe to the tank is already sufficiently warm for use, the thermo-controlled water supply function is automatically overridden, and the warm water is delivered directly to the faucet. The proposed green storage tank not only provides effective water and energy resource savings, but also provides a more convenient operation. © 2008 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Green product; Product design; Smart product; Thermo-controlled water supply","Cooling systems; Energy resources; Integrated control; Intelligent materials; Natural resources management; Product design; Storage (materials); Tanks (containers); Water; Water conservation; Water management; Water pipelines; Water piping systems; Water supply; Controlled waters; Design and Development; Green products; Hot-water supply; Smart products; Thermal thin films; Water and energies; Waterresource management; Water resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62449313508

The electrochemical reactions induce conformational movements of the chains, generation or destruction of free volume and interchange of ions and solvent with the electrolyte giving a gel that reacts, swells or shrinks. Electric pulses acting on reactive gels constituted by polymers, solvent and ions are the closest artificial material to those that constitute actuating biological organs. The electrochemical reaction is kinetically controlled by the conformational movements or by the counterions diffusion through the gel: it works under electrochemical quasi-equilibrium and defines, at any intermediate oxidation state, equilibrium potentials. Any variable (mechanical, chemical, optical, magnetic..) acting on the equilibrium will induce changes on the working potential of any device, driven by a constant current, based on this reaction: actuating-sensing devices based on the electrochemical properties are expected. The activation energy of the reaction can be obtained from the oxidation of metal coated electrodes. This energy includes two terms: the constant chemical activation energy and the conformational energy related to the packed structure of the polymeric conformations. This conformational energy is the basic magnitude for both actuating and sensing properties, opening the way for their quantification. Information can be stored in continuous conformational energetic levels being read by anodic oxidation. © 2008 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Actuator-sensor; Artificial muscle; Conformational energy; Memory storage","Actuators; Anodic oxidation; Biological materials; Biological organs; Chemical activation; Coated wire electrodes; Conducting polymers; Conductive films; Conformations; Electroactive polymer actuators; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Intelligent materials; Ions; Mechanical actuators; Metal coatings; Muscle; Oxidation; Reaction intermediates; Actuator sensors; Artificial muscle; Conformational energies; Electrochemical reactions; Equilibrium potentials; Kinetically controlled; Memory storage; Polymeric conformation; Activation energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62449173016

Patients and Methods: Sixty obese children, 6 to 14 years old, underwent hepatic MRI and abdominal ultrasonography. Biochemistry determinations included serum aminotransferases, lipid profile, glucose, and insulin. Anthropometry included body mass index, total and trunk fat, and fat-free mass obtained by dual-energy radiographic absorptiometry. Hepatic steatosis, judged as hepatic fat fraction by MRI, was ≥9%. Results: By MRI, 14 (23%) children had hepatic steatosis; of those, 5 had a fat fraction of 9% to 18%, and 9 had a fat fraction >18%. At univariate analysis, fat fraction was positively associated with being male, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyltransferase, body mass index z score, insulin, systolic pressure, and total and trunk fat mass. Hepatic steatosis was independently associated with alanine aminotransferase (P<0.01). Overall, liver echogenicity on ultrasonography correlated well with fat fraction by MRI (correlation coefficient 0.527, P<0.0001). Among the 27 children with increased liver echogenicity, 13 (48%) had hepatic fat fraction ≥9%, and 89% of children with echogenicity graded 2 or 3 had fat fraction >18%. All of the children (n=9) with fat fraction ≥18% had increased liver echogenicity, and in 8 of them it was graded 2 or 3, but the MRI fat fraction ranged greatly (28%-45%). Conclusions: In obese children, nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis may be associated with the metabolic syndrome. Ultrasonography may be valuable in identifying high hepatic fat accumulation, but its ability to identify lower fat accumulation in the liver is scanty compared with MRI.

Key factors for clinical cell transplantation to progress is to prevent hepatocyte damage, loss of viability and cell functionality, factors that depend on the nature of the tissue used for isolation to a large extent. The main sources of tissue for hepatocyte isolation are marginal livers that are unsuitable for transplantation, and segments from reduced cadaveric grafts. Hepatocellular transplantation requires infusing human hepatocytes in suspension over a period of minutes to hours. The beneficial effect of hypothermic preservation of hepatocytes in infusion medium has been reported, but how critical issues towards the success of cell transplantation, such as the composition of infusion medium and duration of hepatocyte storage will affect hepatocyte quality for clinical cell infusion has not been systematically investigated. Infusion media composition is phosphate-buffered saline containing anticoagulants and human serum albumin. The supplementation of infusion media with glucose or N-acety1-cystein, or with both components at the same time, has been investigated. After isolation, hepatocytes were suspended in each infusion medium and a sample at the 0 time point was harvested for cell viability and functional assessment. Thereafter, cells were incubated in different infusion media agitated on a rocker platform to simulate the clinical infusion technique. The time course of hepatocyte viability, funtionality (drug-metabolizing enzymes, ureogenic capability, ATP, glycogen, and GSH levels), apoptosis (caspase-3 activation), and attachment and monolayer formation were analyzed. The optimal preservation of cell viability, attaching capacity, and functionality, particularly GSH and glycogen levels, as well as drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes, was found in infusion media supplemented with 2 mM N-acety1-cystein and 15 mM glucose.

A look-forward model is developed by coupling an experimentally identified and verified mean value engine model together with longitudinal vehicle dynamic. This model consists of sub-models for power split planetary gear set, permanent magnet synchronous motor/ generator with the local controllers, and energy storage system. An energy management strategy has been defined to control the complete model in all vehicle operation modes: pure electric, hybrid, power boost, regenerative braking and engine on/off transient mode. The energy management strategy has been implemented to optimise engine operating conditions. A fuzzy-logic auto-driver model is used to compare the performance of a simulated hybrid vehicle with that of a conventional powertrain in the ECE driving cycle. The simulation results indicate a 40% improvement in fuel economy by converting the conventional vehicle into a series-parallel hybrid vehicle. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.","Control strategy; Dynamic modelling; Hybrid electric vehicle; Look-forward; Series-parallel","Dynamic models; Energy management; Engines; Fuel economy; Fuzzy logic; MATLAB; Permanent magnets; Regenerative braking; Control strategies; Energy management strategies; Energy storage systems; Engine operating conditions; Look-forward; Mean value engine modeling; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor; Series-parallel; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149313867

Nuclear grade natural Uranium (U) metal ingots are produced regularly in UED, BARC following MTR route for fuelling research reactors in BARC. This is a bomb type reaction and is represented by UF 4 + 2Mg = U + 2MgF2- (ΔH298o - 83.5 Kcal/gm mole) Small excess of magnesium is required to achieve maximum yield. This thermite type reduction is carried out in a closed reaction vessel, popularly known as MTR reactor, lined with magnesium fluoride powder. MTR reactors arc made of boiler quality steel. Use of MgF2, a reaction by-product, as lining material completely eliminates the chance of foreign element contamination. This lining of MgF2 not only prevents direct contact of the molten metal and slag with the reaction vessel but also acts as an insulating material immediately after firing and holds the hot molten mass for longer period, thereby facilitating adequate metal-slag separation. This is a batch process and stoichiometric quantity of UF4 and Mg chips are blended and charged inside the lined reactor. Once the charging is over, the surface is covered with fine MgF2 powder and sealed by fixing a lid. This sealed reactor is then heated inside an electric furnace at a predefined heating schedule for the reduction to take place. The initiation of reaction is called 'Firing"". MTR reaction mechanism is a complex one. A large number of side reactions as well as parallel reactions also occur during the conversion of UF4 to U. This reaction is exothermic and final temperature of the molten product mass i.e. U and MgF2 goes up to around 1600-1700°C. U settles down at bottom due to large density difference with slag. Good separation is very important for the better yield. Interface of U metal and slag is rich in U content because freshly reduced U metal droplets, which do not get chance to coalesce with the bulk of the metal due to the formation of firm crust at the interface of metal and slag end up getting accumulated at the interface. This interface is removed before subsequent vacuum induction melting and fuel fabrication. This cut interface, which contains entrained metal that could not coalesce with parent metal, some amount of parent metal and quite a good amount of MgF2, is called the 'slag disc'. It is desirable to recover U locked-up in these slag discs as the recovery of U will not only augment current U inventory but also will reduce the burden of radioactive material storage. To recover this U, experiments were conducted using co-melting in MTR operation along with charge by utilizing the heat generated during exothermic MTR .reaction. Experiments have been also conducted to find the optimum weight of the slag disc and its location inside the reactor along with charge to maximize the U recovery. Results obtained are encouraging, as it has been observed that purity of finished product doesn't get affected. This method has advantage over other alternative methods, as it is simple, cost effective, and doesn't demand additional process step, setup and energy.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049125821

It partly depends on the rapid ontogenesis of fat stores that are virtually null at hatching but then develop considerably (X40) within a month to constitute both an isolative layer against cold and an energy store to fuel thermogenic and growth processes. The present study was aimed at identifying by RT-PCR the major transcriptional events that chronologically underlie the morphological transformation of adipocyte precursors into mature adipocytes from hatching to 30 days of age. The peak expression of GATA binding protein 3, a marker of preadipocytes, at day 7 posthatch indicates a key proliferation step, possibly in relation to the expression of C/EBPα (C/EBPα). High plasma total 3,5,3′-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) levels and high levels of growth hormone receptor transcripts at hatching suggested that growth hormone and T3 play early activating roles to favor proliferation of preadipocyte precursors. Differentiation and growth of preadipocytes may occur around day 15 in connection with increased abundance of transcripts encoding IGF-1, proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and C/EBPβ, gradually leading to functional maturation of metabolic features of adipocytes including lipid uptake and storage (lipoprotein lipase, fatty-acid synthase) and late endocrine functions (adiponectin) by day 30. Present results show a close correlation between adipose tissue development and chick biology and a difference in the scheduled expression of regulatory factors controlling adipogenesis compared with in vitro studies using cell lines emphasizing the importance of in vivo approaches.

This resistive switching is concomitant to an electronic phase separation induced by the pulse.

The lattice spacings, elasticity moduli and/or quasi-elastic force parameters of the host-crystal lattice, and concentration coefficients of the dilatation of solid-solution lattice due to the respective solutes are selected as the input numerical experimental data used. The above-mentioned interaction energies prove to have non-monotonically decreasing ('quasi-oscillating') and anisotropic dependences on discrete interatomic radius-vector, and themselves are strong and long-range. In all f.c.c.-(Ni,Fe)-base solutions, there is strain-induced attraction in many co-ordination shells. In general, the strain-induced interaction between impurity atoms in y-Fe is weaker than in α-Ni (but in some solid solutions, it may prove to be of the same order). The verification of applicability of the approximation of strain-induced interaction of impurities for f.c.c(Ni,Fe)-C alloys (by means of analysis of thermodynamic C activity and 'short-range order' parameters of C-atoms' distribution revealed by Mössbauer spectroscopy) showed that it must be supplemented with additional short-range ('electrochemical') repulsion in the first co-ordination shell. Nevertheless, in any case, the strain-induced interaction of impurity atoms must be taken into account for analysis of structure and properties of f.c.c.-(Ni,Fe)-base solutions. The Monte Carlo simulation procedures applied for constitution of a nanoscale Fe-C-austenite crystallite and based on analysis of the dependences of numbers of the different atomic configurations on C-C interatomic-interaction energies reveal correlation between the potential energy of such a modelling system and the numbers of iterations as well as Monte Carlo steps for the approach to constrained equilibrium. As shown by the example of austenite, for adequate representation of the experimental data on thermodynamic C activity, one needs to take into account for computations the 'electrochemical' (direct) and strain-induced (indirect) contributions to C-C interaction. The estimated sets of energies of such a total interaction within the first several interstitial co-ordination shells with rated radii are presented, and optimal set is selected, which optimally corresponds to experimental concentration and temperature dependences of C activity and the Mössbauer-spectroscopy data on the nearest neighbourhoods of Fe atoms with octahedral C interstitials. The 'equilibrium' relative parts of the different atomic Fe-C and C-C configurations (depending on C-C interaction energies) are determined. The Khachaturyan-Cook microscopic approach is considered to relate the time dependence of the long-range order (LRO) or short-range order to atomic diffusion. It enables to use the data of measurements of time dependence of radiation diffraction or diffuse-scattering intensity for a Ni-Fe solid solution for calculation of both probabilities of elementary atomic-migration jumps to different lattice sites per unit time and 'exchange' or vacancy-controlled diffusion coefficients, respectively. By the use of quantitative experimental information about the Curie temperatures, TC, and neutron diffuse-scattering intensities for disordered f.c.c.-Ni-Fe alloys, it is possible to evaluate the Fourier components, {w̃tot(k), of effective Ni-Fe atomic 'mixing' energies (inclusive the competing exchange interactions of respective permanent magnetic moments) taking into account both long-range 'paramagnetic' ('electrochemical' + 'strain-induced') and Isingtype magnetic contributions that drive the long-range ordering. Magnetism and 'chemical' (atomic) LRO in f.c.c.-Ni1-cFeFecFe alloys are analysed within the self-consistent mean-field approximation, in which the statistical thermodynamics of the non-stoichiometric L12(Ni 3Fe)-type permalloy (as well as L10(NiFe)-type elinvar) is determined by several energy parameters {w̃tot(k)}. There is a revealed interplay of magnetism and long-range atomic ordering with the order-disorder transformation temperatures, TK, (below TC) appreciably different from the corresponding isolated TK values (above TC). The interplay of these two phenomena is examined along two lines, i. e. through the estimation of both temperature-cFe dependence of spatial LRO parameter and magnetisations of Ni and Fe subsystems. As shown, not only the temperature-dependent phase states of such binary f.c.c. alloys can be reproduced, but also the dependence of TK vs. C Fe including the observed asymmetry of phase-diagram curves due to the T- and cFe-dependent magnetic contribution to the effective interatomic interactions etc. As revealed for f.c.c.-Ni-Fe alloy with the use of single relaxation-time kinetics approximation for calculation of equilibrium intensity values, the magnetic contribution to the 'mixing' energy of atoms (in low-spin states) of this alloy facilitates its atomic ordering, and the presence of atoms with essentially different spins may cause the virtually abrupt phase transition from paramagnetic state into magnetic one. The optimal sets of exchange-interaction energy parameters for f.c.c. Ni-Fe alloy are selected. As shown, the doping of small amounts of interstitial C impurities most likely increases ferromagnetic component of bond of Ni spins with Fe spins, reduces ferromagnetic component of bond of Ni spins with Ni spins, and increases antiferromagnetic component of bond of Fe spins with Fe spins in an f.c.c.-Ni-Fe alloy.","Interatomic interactions; Kinetics; Magnetic transitions; Neutron diffraction; Neutron scattering; Ni-Fe-C alloys; Order-Disorder transformations; Phase equilibria; Statistical thermodynamics","Antiferromagnetism; Atoms; Austenite; Chemical analysis; Crystal atomic structure; Crystal impurities; Crystal lattices; Diffusion; Digital storage; Enzyme kinetics; Exchange interactions; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Intelligent systems; Kinetics; Magnetic moments; Mixing; Monte Carlo methods; Neutron diffraction; Neutron scattering; Nickel alloys; Order disorder transitions; Paramagnetism; Permalloy; Phase diagrams; Phase equilibria; Potential energy; Solid solutions; Solution mining; Statistical mechanics; Substitution reactions; Temperature distribution; Concentration coefficients; Fe-C alloys; Interaction energy parameters; Interatomic interactions; Magnetic transitions; Order-disorder transformation; Order-disorder transformation temperature; Self-consistent mean field; Iron alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56149125034

The LPCVD process includes three steps: nucleation using SiH4, selective growth of the silicon nuclei using SiH2Cl2 and finally selective growth of silicon nitride using a mixture of SiH2Cl2 and NH 3 around the silicon dot. The two first steps have already been described in literature. We will therefore focus on the selective growth of a nitride layer on silicon dots. Morphological characterization using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) allows control over dots size - 5 to 10nm - and density - up to 1E12/cm2. High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) shows a crystalline silicon core and an outer shell of amorphous silicon nitride. Energy Filtered TEM pictures confirm that the nitride layer is deposited only around the silicon dots and not on the oxide. Oxidation resistance of the silicon nitride shell is also investigated. A 2nm thick silicon nitride layer is an efficient barrier to an oxidation at 8007deg;C in dry oxygen for 5 minutes. We thus have a very thin high quality stoechiometric nitride layer. Such a high quality nitride film can only be achieved using in-situ deposition i.e. on an oxide-free silicon surface. Finally, hybrid Si/SiN nanodots are integrated in a single memory cell with high-K interpoly dielectric. Electrical results show large threshold voltage shift of 6V. The use of silicon nitride shells on the silicon dots has therefore two main advantages: it provides both oxidation resistance and charge storage enhancement. © 2008 Materials Research Society.",,"Ammonia; Chlorine compounds; Digital storage; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; High-k dielectric; Nanodots; Nitrides; Oxidation resistance; Scanning electron microscopy; Shells (structures); Silicon nitride; Threshold voltage; Vapor deposition; Crystalline silicons; Energy filtered TEM; High-quality nitride films; In-situ deposition; Interpoly dielectrics; Morphological characterization; Nonvolatile memory devices; Threshold voltage shifts; Amorphous silicon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849134777

To investigate electrical characteristics of small molecular organic nonvolatile memory with Ni as a middle metal layer, we developed a small molecular organic nonvolatile memory with the device structure of Aluminum tris (8-hydroxyquinolate) (Al/Alq 3), Ni nanocrystals, and Alq3/Al. A high vacuum thermal deposition method was used for the device fabrication. It is critical that the fabrication process condition for Ni nanocrystals be optimized, including ̃100 Å thickness, 0.1 Å/sec-evaporation rate, and in-situ plasma oxidation for effective oxidation. The reasons we chose Ni for the middle metal layer are that Ni has a smaller grain boundary, which is beneficial for scaling down and has a larger work function (-5.15 eV) that can make a deep quantum well in an energy band diagram, compared with that of Al. Our device showed an electrical nonvolatile memory behavior including Vth, of -2 V, Vw (write) of -3.5 V, negative differential region (NDR) of 3.5-7 V, Ve (erase) of 8 V, and symmetrical electrical behavior at reverse bias. In addition, an interesting behavior of electrical properties was that, although retention and endurance characteristics were similar to the Al device, the Ion/Ioff ratio was greater than 104 at Vr (read) of 1 V. This value of the Ni device was higher than 10 2 compared to that of the Al device. Also, small molecular organic nonvolatile memory with a Ni middle layer with α-NPD at same fabrication condition showed more unstable characteristics than Alq3. We can speculate that there is a relationship in fabrication condition between the middle metal material and the organic material. Finally, we conclude that our device with a Ni nanocrystals middle layer is more reliable and useful for small molecular organic nonvolatile memory. © 2008 Materials Research Society.",,"Grain boundaries; Nanocrystals; Nonvolatile storage; Semiconductor quantum wells; Device fabrications; Electrical behaviors; Electrical characteristic; Energy-band diagram; Fabrication process; Non-volatile memory; Organic nonvolatile memory; Situ plasma oxidation; Fabrication",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849111126

Nubbins were maintained during 6 weeks under two light levels (100 μmol photons m-2 s-1 and 300 μmol photons m -2 s-1) and two feeding levels (starved and fed with zooplankton) in a factorial experiment. There were greater proportions of some polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; e.g., C18:4 n-3, C20:5 n-3, C22:6 n-3) in the zooxanthellae than in the host, suggesting that these PUFA were synthesized by the algae and transferred to the animal. Conversely, C20:4 n-6 exhibited a greater proportion in the host and might have been synthesized by the animal. Light affected the chlorophyll content, the rates of photosynthesis, and the lipid production of all coral samples. Corals maintained in high-light conditions had lower relative phytol content but higher concentrations of fatty acids (FA) and sterols than the shaded corals. Feeding also affected coral metabolism, but differently according to the light level and despite the fact that the host did not directly incorporate the zooplankton lipids (PUFA and cholesterol). In low light, feeding resulted in an increase of growth rates and storage lipid concentrations, mainly saturated fatty acids (SAFA) and membrane constituents (PUFA and sterols).

When thermally driven at moderate temperatures, it can be coupled to solar collectors. The use of flat-plate collectors and air collectors has demonstrated low efficiency in the coupling process and so a low potential of solar energy use in desiccant cooling. In this paper the use of heat pipe vacuum tube (HPVT) collectors in a solar desiccant cooling set up is investigated. First, a model for the collectors is proposed and experimentally validated under various operating conditions. A model of the storage tank taking into account thermal stratification is also validated. The experimentally evaluated efficiency of the HPVT collectors for one operating day varies between 0.6 and 0.7. Finally, simulation of the solar desiccant plant cooling a building is performed for different climates over a summer season. The solar fraction and the overall efficiency of the solar plant are calculated for this period and the potential of the vacuum tube collectors is evaluated for application to the desiccant cooling process. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The numerically evaluated time evolution of several key parameters (such as hydrogen mass flow, temperature and pressure) is reported and its accordance with experimental results available in the literature is discussed, in order to identify the model's strengths and limitations and its validity range, and to offer analytical insight into the behavior of the storage system as different operating parameters are varied.

We developed a generic optimization-based model to support the decision-making process for the design of the hydrogen supply chain. The network design problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem to identify the optimal supply chain configurations from various alternatives. The objective is to consider not only cost efficiency, but also safety. Since there is a trade-off between these two objectives, formal multiobjective optimization techniques are required to establish the optimal Pareto solutions that can then be used for decision-making purposes. With the model, the effects of demand uncertainty can be also analyzed by comparing the deterministic and the stochastic solutions. The features and capabilities of the model are illustrated through the application of future hydrogen infrastructure of Korea.

In table grapes, the ripening period can be extended by selecting new varieties or by applying cultural techniques apt to force the plant growth under unfavorable climatic conditions or to protect the foliage and fruits from meteorological adversities. The harvest date may be advanced by inducing a praecocious budbreak. This is obtained by managing the vineyard as a protected cultivation, that is, by covering the roof and the lateral belts of vineyard with transparent plastic films, which allow a high fraction of solar radiation to pass through and then are able to retain a good portion of energy by limiting the convective and radiative thermal dispersions. Hence, the air temperature increases and induces a faster accumulation of growing degree days which, in turn, stimulate an earlier vine budbreak. The plastic covering is affixed on the vineyard at the end of winter; the earlier the covering, the earlier the budbreak. This latter can be advanced by 10 to 40 days depending on the covering date, the grape cultivar and the climatic characteristics of growing environment. The maximum effect can be obtained by covering the vineyard 50 days before natural vine budbreak in open field; however, the advancing effect could be partially lost during the following phenological phases, when the internal thermal regime is too high respect to the requirements of the reproductive and photosynthetic processes. The plastic film optical properties greatly influence the canopy development and the qualitative traits of the grape clusters. This type of protected cultivation has proved to be particularly suitable for early-maturing cultivars and seedless grapes; these latter, in particular, may improve the berry quality, and any case, avoid the competition of seeded varieties with bigger and savoury berries. The harvest date may be delayed by protecting the ripening clusters from meteorological adversities. This technique profits from the good preservability on vine which characterizes the grapevine cluster and improves this trait by protecting the berry sanitary status during ripening. In fact, starting from veraison, berry skin turns thinner and juice turns sweeter, thus berry becomes more sensitive to fungal attacks, especially after the wetting caused by the late summer rains. To preserve the crop, the vineyard roof in covered with plastic films. Under the best conditions, which are with healthy grapes and low rainy season, the berry integrity may be guarantied for a long period, and the harvest may be delayed by 3 months, without reducing yield and berry carpometric characteristics. For best results, it is very important to maintain berry hydration and turgidity as long as possible, since the grape freshness is the goal to achieve and the attribute which distinguishes this product from that coming from the cold storage. The protected cultivation to delay harvest is particularly convenient for late seeded cultivars, especially for grapes having an appropriate skin thickness, abundant pruine and a big berry with a relatively low surface: volume ratio, which are all traits helping to limit berry transpiration and thus favors its final hydration status.","Early covering; Early ripening; Late covering; Late ripening; Plastic film; Protected cultivation; Table grape; UV","Vitaceae; Vitis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55049087844

Improving the flavour properties of fresh fruit reaching the consumer would add value, increase consumption, and create new markets for these commodities. One of the important characteristics of fruit ripening is volatile aroma production. Using apples (Malus domestica), strawberries (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) and melons (Cucumis melo L. var. reticulatus Naud; C. melo L. inodorus; C. melo L. cantalupensis) fruit as examples, this review focuses on recent developments in fruit aroma research. Both sensory studies and instrumental analysis confirm the importance of volatile production in fruit and its contribution to eating quality. Sensory analysis should further define the contribution of individual volatile compounds to total flavour quality. Volatile biosynthesis and its contribution to fruit eating quality is very complex, and is influenced by many factors, such as genome, harvest maturity, and postharvest handling and storage. Application of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and transgenic lines suppressing ethylene action and biosynthesis demonstrate ethylene involvement in volatile formation and provide useful research tools to elucidate the volatile production process during fruit ripening. Cloning of genes and characterization of enzymes responsible for volatile production helps us to understand the biochemical pathways and control mechanisms. Despite the exciting developments in flavour research, several challenges still remain to be solved. An understanding of the fundamental mechanisms controlling changes in flavour quality is limited, and most biochemical pathways determining this quality trait are still unknown. As part of secondary metabolism, volatile production in fruit is a complex process with tightly controlled systems involving substrates, enzymes and energy from many pathways. It is our hope that the biochemical pathways regulating the synthesis of volatile compounds in fruit will be determined using integrated approaches, including biochemical, genomic, proteomic and microscopy tools to determine fundamental metabolism and its localization. Combining these efforts with direct measurement of sensory properties will lead us to new methods to optimize and retain fruit flavour in the market place.","Apple; Aroma; Fruit ripening; Muskmelon; Sensory; Strawberry; Volatile analysis","biochemistry; biological characteristics; crop production; deciduous tree; dicotyledon; disease resistance; enzyme activity; food storage; fruit; metabolism; nutritive value; ripening; substrate; volatile substance; Cucumis; Cucumis melo; Fragaria x ananassa; Malus x domestica",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54049127354

It has been reported that formaldehyde fixation or freezing hardly affects the mechanical properties of bone after a storage period of several weeks. However, human cadaver bones are usually stored for longer periods of time before use. We therefore investigated the effects of long-term embalming or freezing on the mechanical properties of cortical bone. METHODS: After 5 different storage periods (ranging from 0 to 12 months), goat femora and humeri were used to evaluate the effect of embalming and freezing on torsion, and on bending stiffness and strength. The effect on hardness and bone mineral density (BMD) was also evaluated. RESULTS: Even after 1 year, no statistically significant differences could be found in stiffness, strength, and energy absorption when we compared embalmed or frozen bones to a fresh reference group. In addition, although we found no significant change in BMD, there appears to be a tendency to increasing hardness. INTERPRETATION: We found that there was no effect on the mechanical properties of bone after storage periods of 1 year. We conclude that embalmed or frozen bones can safely be used for mechanical testing, at least for storage periods of up to one year.",,"animal; article; biomechanics; bone; bone density; bone transplantation; cadaver; comparative study; cryopreservation; goat; health care facility; human; mechanical stress; metabolism; methodology; physiology; tensile strength; time; tissue fixation; tissue preservation; Animals; Biomechanics; Bone and Bones; Bone Banks; Bone Density; Bone Transplantation; Cadaver; Cryopreservation; Goats; Humans; Stress, Mechanical; Tensile Strength; Time Factors; Tissue Fixation; Tissue Preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53449099700

Moreover, the changes in consumer load and system configuration in such autonomous power systems represent relatively significant changes due to overall low system inertia. These characteristics coupled with the wind's intermittence and presence of induction generators play havoc with stand-alone power systems like wind-diesel ones in terms of power quality. However, energy storage devices with quick response can effectively increase the utilization of wind energy and improve the power quality. Redox flow batteries (RFB) have many salient features which make them ideal for use in stand-alone power systems. In this paper, we study a hybrid multi-machine power system, comprising of wind energy conversion units, diesels and an RFB system. The interfacing of RFB to wind park bus is proposed to take place through a current-controlled voltage source inverter (CC-VSI), based on hysteresis control. An intelligent control policy based on fuzzy logic is adopted for active/reactive power modulation of the RFB in four quadrants of the power chart. The detailed dynamic equations of the various components of the hybrid power system are presented. Unified models are finally developed for assessment of the proposed scheme. The simulation studies based on this model demonstrate the ability of the proposed novel scheme in assisting the system voltage and frequency regulation under various perturbations.","Hysteresis current control; Mathematical modelling; Power quality; PQ modulation; Redox flow battery; Wind-diesel systems","Asynchronous generators; Diesel engines; Electric current control; Electric inverters; Energy conversion; Flow batteries; Fuzzy logic; Hysteresis; Mathematical models; Modulation; Power quality; Quality control; Wind power; Current-controlled voltage source inverters; Hybrid power generation systems; Hysteresis current control; Modelling and simulations; Multi machine power system; PQ modulation; Stand alone power systems; Wind-diesel systems; Battery storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52049113511

DERs comprise distributed power generators, distributed energy storages and controllable loads. There are, however, many uncertainties that influence the design and operation of DERs. This paper clarifies these uncertainties by proposing and applying a comprehensive framework for uncertainty analysis. We thereby adopt an integrated approach that considers not only the technical, but also the economic and institutional uncertainties. A delineation of the work is a focus on residential DERs and on micro-CHP systems specifically. After the proposed framework for uncertainty analysis is explained the uncertainties pertaining to the design and operation of residential DERs and micro-CHP systems are identified. In a case study system a selection of the uncertainties are quantitatively analysed. The case study system consists of a household that intelligently applies a micro-CHP unit in conjunction with energy storages and that interacts with its energy supplier. With a sensitivity analysis of the system model the salient impacts of the uncertainties on system behaviour and performance are enunciated. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper the control and the deposition of both positive and negative local charges are described and discussed. A basic introduction to both the theoretical and experimental techniques of EFM is also presented. In addition a review of the analytical calculation of tip-surface capacitance interaction is described and then utilised to estimate charge storage in oxide layers and nanostructures from EFM images or spectroscopy curves. The charge resolution of EFM at room temperature and a controlled atmosphere is estimated to be about 20 charge carriers. The EFM technique is also used to inject charges and to study their behaviour in confined silicon nanostructures covered by a thin layer of oxide and separated from the Si substrate by a SiO2 layer. The total injected charge is found to depend on the thickness of the oxide layer. The electric field has emerged to be a key parameter in the injection mechanism. The dynamics and propagation of the deposited charge carriers have been studied and a homogenous distribution of the charge in the nanostructure has been observed. Thanks to these studies and observation, the localisation of the trapped charges has been determined: it occurs mainly in the silicon pattern rather than on the thin covering oxide layer. This charge localisation together with charge energy calculation leads to a better understanding of the origin of the charge dissipation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, macronutrient proportions in the diet can modulate energy intake and body fat deposition. The aim of the study was to investigate muscle and liver oxidative metabolism in response to an isocaloric intake of a HFD and to elucidate the possible gender-dependent response. Eight week-old male and female rats were fed either standard chow or HFD for 14 weeks. Energy intake, body weight and whole animal oxygen consumption were determined periodically. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption, hydrogen peroxide production, TBARS levels, Cytochrome-c-oxidase, Citrate synthase and antioxidant enzyme activities were measured in muscle and liver. UCP1 and UCP3 protein levels were analyzed in brown adipose tissue and muscle, respectively. Male rats showed higher energy efficiency, enhanced adiposity, greater hydrogen peroxide production and less effective antioxidant machinery compared to females. HFD feeding increased energy expenditure but did not modify either tissue oxidative metabolism or oxidative damage in either gender. HFD animals over-expressed uncoupling proteins in order to maintain energy balance (brown adipose tissue UCP1) and to avoid oxidative stress (skeletal muscle UCP3), thus counteracting the alterations induced by the modification of the proportion of macronutrients in the diet.

We conducted a 28-week school-based exercise trial of single-leg drop-landing exercise with 42 prepubertal girls (6 to 10 yrs) randomly assigned to control (C), low-drop (LD) or high-drop (HD) exercise groups. The latter two groups performed single-leg drop-landings (3 sessions/wk-1 and 50 landings/session-1) from 14cm(LD) and 28cm(HD) using the nondominant leg. Osteogenic responses were assessed using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Single-leg peak ground-reaction impact forces (PGRIF) in a subsample ranged from 2.5 to 4.4 × body-weight (BW). No differences (p &gt; .05) were observed among groups at baseline for age, stature, lean tissue mass (LTM), leisure time physical activity, or average daily calcium intake. After adjusting for covariates of body mass, fat mass and LTM, no differences were found in bone mineral measures or site-specific bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip and lower leg among exercise or control groups. Combining data from both exercise groups failed to produce differences in bone properties when compared with the control group. No changes were apparent for between-leg differences from baseline to posttraining.

A fundamental design difficultly is caused by the need to trade-off the input line current wave shape and the dynamic response of the output energy storage capacitor voltage regulation loop. The energy balance requirement inherent in single-phase systems forces a significant 100 Hz voltage ripple on the output capacitor. A high bandwidth voltage regulation loop will feed back enough of the 100 Hz component to distort the current reference signals for the inner current control loop distorting the line wave shape. A reference model can be used to construct a ripple-free estimate of the capacitor voltage.

Both countries' responses are compared to a similar carbon price schedule (US$10/tCO2e in 2013 rising exponentially to $100 by 2050) using a hybrid technologically explicit and behaviourally realistic model with macroeconomic feedbacks (CIMS). Then additional measures are imposed based on the national circumstances of each country; for Canada we simulate a 50% reduction by 2050, and stabilization for China. The scale of the challenge in all cases requires that every available option be vigorously pursued, including energy efficiency, fuel switching, carbon capture and storage, and accelerated development of renewables; to compensate, there are significant co-reductions of local air pollutants such as SOx and NOx. Finally, the abatement cost schedules of China and Canada are compared, and implications considered for carbon permit flows if the cost schedule of the rest of the developed world is assumed to be similar to that of Canada. We found that the developed world and China could collectively reduce emissions by 50% in 2050 at a price of $175/tCO2e, with permits flowing from the developed countries to China; while abatement costs are lower in China up to $75/t, at higher prices reductions are less costly in the developed world. Our results indicate that a global low-carbon society is feasible, on condition that policy makers are willing and able to impose long-term, credible policy packages with carbon pricing policy as the core element, coupled with supplementary regulations to address market failures. © 2008 Earthscan.","Canada; Carbon trading; China; Development; Endogenous technical change; Hybrid model; Low-carbon society; Public policy; Scenario modelling; Stabilization pathways","carbon emission; developing world; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; global change; macroeconomics; stabilization; technological change; Asia; Canada; China; Eurasia; Far East; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47249123628

In the present paper, the flow behaviour is modelled by using the FLUENT code. Two numerical flow models have been elaborated and tested independently in the geometries of an air chamber and a turbine, which is chosen of a radial impulse type. The flow is assumed to be three-dimensional (3D), viscous, turbulent and unsteady. The FLUENT code is used with a solver of the coupled conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy, with an implicit time scheme and with the adoption of the dynamic mesh and the sliding mesh techniques in areas of moving surfaces. Turbulence is modelled with the k-ε model. The obtained results indicate that the developed models are well suitable to analyse the air flows both in the air chamber and in the turbine. The performances associated with the energy transfer processes have been well predicted. For the turbine, the numerical results of pressure and torque were compared to the experimental ones.

In the literature, liposomes have proven efficient in offering a physical barrier to extracellular enzymes and favor penetration into cells. First, this review addresses the issues raised by ATP development in pharmaceutics. Second, studies conducted with ATP liposomally entrapped (lipo-ATP) are described, including pharmaco-technical formulation engineering and related models of assessment. Finally, potential directions for research to better target ATP penetration into the liver are considered. Lipo-ATP were formulated for a number of applications, including sepsis-related disorders; spermatozoid alteration; brain ischemia episodes; and ophthalmic, cardiac, and hepatic use. Key formulation parameters need to be carefully considered to optimize stability and entrapment yield value, and to define the manufacturing process. Positive lipids, such as stearylamine, increase entrapment yield value by electrostatic interaction with negatively charged ATP. A freezing-thawing step in the manufacturing process considerably increases entrapment yield value. Lipo-ATP were assessed using cell culture, isolated organs, and animal experimental models. Very promising results were obtained with antimyosin PEGylated immunoliposomes using isolated rat hearts and experimental myocardial infarction in rabbits. In hepatic applications, lipo-ATP are effective in preventing liver injury during shock and to improve the energy status of cold-stored rat liver, in particular, if liposomes are loaded with apolipoprotein E (ApoE). For liver delivery, liposome size needs to be lower than 100 nm to allow diffusion through the Disse space, but liposome flexibility and lipid content may also influence liver uptake. The role of the liposome charge remains unclear. ApoE and the ligand for the asialoglycoprotein receptor [ASGPr) were both used in the literature, but the ASGPr seems more promising. Ligand-ASGPr interaction is based on the sugar preference (N-acetylgalactosamine≫galactose), the antennary structure (tetra>tri>di>monoantennary), and sugar spacing. Numerous high-affinity ligands have been extracted or designed to target hepatocytes, which can be classified according to their origin (i.e., natural, hemisynthetic, or synthetic). Synthetic ASGPr, such as Gal-C4-Chol (cholesten-5-yloxy-N-(4-((1- imino-2-D-thiogalactosylethyl)formamide), are composed of a lipid anchor (e.g., cholesteryl), a spacer (C2 to C6 chain), and a sugar head (galactose or lactose). The formulation includes ligand incorporation, by either simple preincubation or covalent graft, onto preformulated liposomes or direct mixing with other lipids. The ligand-loaded liposomes encapsulated pharmacological agents, markers, or plasmid DNA. Interesting results were obtained with antitumor or antioxidant agents to promote drug penetration in cell culture (e.g., primary rat hepatocyte or HepG2) and specific targeting to hepatocyte in isolated perfused liver (pharmacokinetic studies). Effectiveness was demonstrated in experimental models (e.g., tumor-bearing animals and hepatotoxic models). These targeted formulations were less toxic than standard formulations and controls. A development scheme that can be applied to other drugs, which may benefit from improved hepatic targeting, is proposed to optimize liposome characteristics and ligand structure, including verifications such as the displacement-binding test, ligand incorporation, cell internalization, tissue diffusion, organ and receptor specificity, and efficiency in experimental models. © 2008 by Begell House, Inc.","ASGPr; Energy status; Formulation; Liver; Targeting","1,2 dioleoyl 3 trimethylammoniopropane; 1,2 distearoyl sn glycero 3 phosphoethanolamine n [methoxy(polyethylene glycol) 2000]; 4 nitrophenylcarbonylpoly(ethylene glycol)phosphatidylethanolamine; adenosine triphosphate; antineoplastic agent; antioxidant; apolipoprotein E; asialoglycoprotein receptor; cholesterol; chymotrypsin A; desmopressin; dilauryloylphosphatidylcholine; disteroylphosphatidylcholine; doxorubicin; formamide derivative; galactose; immunoliposome; lactose; ligand; liposome; liver protective agent; macrogol derivative; myosin antibody; n acetylgalactosamine; octadecylamine; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylglycerol; phospholipid; plasmid DNA; unindexed drug; acrosome; binding affinity; biomedical engineering; brain ischemia; cell culture; cell energy; covalent bond; DNA transfection; drug bioavailability; drug diffusion; drug formulation; drug manufacture; drug penetration; drug solubility; drug stability; drug storage; drug synthesis; drug targeting; drug uptake; electrochemistry; experimental model; freeze thawing; heart infarction; human; hydrolysis; hypovolemic shock; liver; liver cell; liver injury; liver metabolism; liver toxicity; nonhuman; particle size; reperfusion injury; review; sepsis; spermatozoon",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45349101192

They also serve as energy storage in seeds and as membrane building blocks. Their biosynthesis is catalyzed by the acyl-CoA elongase, a membrane-bound enzymatic complex containing four distinct enzymes (KCS, KCR, HCD and ECR). Twenty-one 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) genes have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana genome. In this paper we present an overview of the acyl-CoA elongase genes in Arabidopsis focusing on the entire KCS family. We show that the KCS family is made up of 8 distinct subclasses, according to their phylogeny, duplication history, genomic organization, protein topology and 3D modelling. The analysis of the subcellular localization in tobacco cells of the different subunits of the acyl-CoA elongase shows that all these proteins are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum demonstrating that VLCFA production occurs in this compartment. The expression patterns in Arabidopsis of the acyl-CoA elongase genes suggest several levels of regulations at the tissular or organ level but also under stress conditions suggesting a complex organization of this multigenic family. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","3D modeling; Abiotic stress; Arabidopsis thaliana; Elongase; Expression profiling","Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45049084402

One reason for this is that the main response has been to increase storage of rain rather than to increase the amount of fresh water. Another is that fossil groundwater has been widely seen as inexhaustible. Two fresh water collecting systems are outlined here and it is argued that they have no ultimate limitation, either by the availability of water or by environmental constraints. The first system is the Water Road, with a large surface area so allowing distillation by solar and wind energy. The other is a refrigerated wind turbine system, Water from Air, which offers novel means to collect water from wind.

The proposed deposition mechanism is based on cathodic reduction of MnO4- species. The amount of the deposited material has been controlled by the variation of deposition time at a constant current density. Obtained films were studied by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis. It was found that the composition and microstructure of the films depend on the concentration of NaMnO4 in the solutions used for deposition. The films prepared from the 0·02M NaMnO4 solutions were crack free and porous with typical pore size of about 100-200 nm. Cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry data for the films tested in the 0-1M Na2SO4 solutions showed capacitive behaviour in the voltage window of 0-1·0 V versus standard calomel reference electrode. The highest specific capacitance of ∼220 F g -1 was obtained for 90 μg cm-2 films at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1 using Ni substrates. The capacitance decreased with increasing scan rate.

They provide a function of storage without loss and potentially at high energy density. The selected reaction involves SrBr2 as reactant and H2O as refrigerant fluid. It is adapted to the thermodynamic constraints in temperature (heat provided by plane solar collector, heating and cooling on the level of the floor) and uses reagents having a weak impact for the environment and health. The reactive salt SrBr2 is implemented with an expanded natural graphite in the form of a consolidated material which has acceptable thermal conductivity and permeability adapted to low pressure. The prototype reactor has a total volume of 1 m3. It is able to store, with a complete reaction, 60 kW h or 40 kW h for the heating or cooling function respectively. This prototype was tested under conditions representative of summer or mid-season; the mean heating or cooling powers, typically about 2.5-4 kW, are still insufficient because of a low heat transfer at the interface between the reactive layer and the exchanger wall.

The potential energy stored in a soft body as a result of a deformation caused by an external force is propagated among mass points by Pwoisson equation. The novelty of the methodology is that Poisson-based techniques are established to propagate the energy generated by the external force and to extrapolate the internal forces of a deformed object. A cellular neural network model is established to solve the Poisson model for the real-time requirement of soft object deformation. This proposed methodology not only deals with large-range deformations, but also accommodates isotropic, anisotropic and inhomogeneous materials by simply modifying constitutive coefficients.","Analogy systems; Cellular neural network; Deformation; Poisson equation; Soft objects","Elastic deformation; Energy storage; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Potential energy; Inhomogeneous materials; Soft objects; Poisson equation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44149104941

Based on the proposed approach, for a given load demand, characteristics of the diesel generator and battery bank, a sizing curve is identified on the diesel generator rating vs. storage capacity diagram. The sizing curve helps in identifying all possible feasible system configurations or the design space. Based on the minimum capital cost and the minimum operating cost of the system, the Pareto optimum curve is identified on the system-sizing curve.

However, protein breakdown increases dramatically once a lower threshold of body lipids is reached [phase III (P3)]. Body composition, energy intake, energy expenditure, and energy efficiency were determined in 8 groups of rats (fed, food-deprived up to P2 or P3 of starvation and refed for 3 d, 7 d, or until body mass restoration) to determine whether the kinetics of lipid and/or protein reserve recovery may be slowed down when refeeding occurs after the lipid threshold has been reached. Despite larger losses, P3 refed rats restored their body reserves as efficiently as those refed in P2. Whatever the nutritional status at the onset of refeeding, rehydration occurred first and hyperphagia played a more important role than hypometabolism in the restoration of the lost reserves. However, the pattern of body component gains was different during early refeeding. In P3 refed rats, body lipids were restored preferentially by significant contribution from endogenous lipid production. Thus, the extent of lipid depletion has important consequences for the restoration pattern of the body reserves. It depends not only on the intensity of the energy restriction (partial or total) as already demonstrated but also on the metabolic status at the onset of refeeding. These results may have significant implications on the way refeeding should be conducted after severe energy depletion. © 2008 American Society for Nutrition.",,"protein; triacylglycerol; 3 hydroxybutyric acid; fatty acid; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body fat; body mass; body water; caloric intake; controlled study; diet restriction; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; hyperphagia; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; nutritional status; rat; refeeding; starvation; weight change; weight gain; adipose tissue; animal; blood; caloric intake; caloric restriction; energy metabolism; food; lipid metabolism; metabolism; physiology; starvation; Wistar rat; Rattus; 3-Hydroxybutyric Acid; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Caloric Restriction; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Food; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Nutritional Status; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Starvation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42449142225

The white fat weight in the female abdominal cavity was shown to significantly increase in pregnancy and to decrease in late lactation. As an indicators for nutritional state of females, their body weight difference after parturition (or in late lactation) and expected from the regression equation relating individual body weight at the beginning and the end of each reproductive stage were used (physical condition indexes in pregnancy or lactation). The correlation of the physical condition index in pregnancy with the storage fat weight was 0.67. The metabolic resources of the mother's body proved to favor faster offspring development. The female offspring weight at the age of 3 and 10 weeks as well as adult ones positively correlated with the mother's nutritional state in pregnancy, while the male offspring weight demonstrated a similar correlation at the age of 3 and 6 weeks. Increased negative energy balance during lactation proved to decrease the offspring weight in both sexes after separation from mother and at the age of 6 weeks. High nutritional state of mother in pregnancy favored both the probability of reproduction and life span of female offspring. The reproduction of male offspring did not depend on the mother's physical condition. The life span peaked in male offspring of mothers in a nutritional state below average in pregnancy and above average in lactation. Thus, the physical condition of the mother's body is an important sex-dependent factor of phenotypic variation in the offspring body weight, reproductive competence, and life span. © 2008 MAIK Nauka.","Growth; Life span; Maternal effect; Physical condition; Reproductive success; Sex","Arvicola terrestris; Microtus richardsoni; Muridae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42449128750

Conducting polymer-based electrochemical sensors and biosensors play an important role in the improvement of public health and environment because rapid detection, high sensitivity, small size, and specificity are achievable for environmental monitoring and clinical diagnostics. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in conducting polymer-based electrochemical sensors, which covers chemical sensors (potentiometric, voltammetric, amperometric) and biosensors (enzyme based biosensors, immunosensors, DNA sensors). © 2008 by MDPI.","Amperometry; Biosensors; Chemical sensors; DNA sensors; Electrochemical methods; Gas sensors; Immunosensors; Impedance; Organic conjugated polymer; Potentiometry","Biosensors; Chemical sensors; Chemical stability; Conducting polymers; Conjugated polymers; Diagnosis; Electric impedance; Electrocatalysts; Enzyme sensors; Immunosensors; Organic polymers; Potentiometers (electric measuring instruments); Public health; Solutions; Amperometry; DNA sensors; Electrochemical devices; ELectrochemical methods; Environmental Monitoring; Enzyme-based biosensors; Neutral aqueous solution; Potentiometry; Electrochemical sensors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40849084035

The reactions related to the synthesis of gas can be classified into direct and indirect approach for making such products, such as acetic acid, dimethyl ether, and alcohol. Catalytic syngas processing is currently done at high temperatures and pressures, conditions that could be unfavorable for the life of the catalyst. Another issue of C1 chemistry is related to the methane-initiated process. It has been known that direct methane conversions are still suffering from low yields and selectivity of products resulting in unprofitable ways to produce products, such as higher hydrocarbons, methanol, and so on. However, many experts and researchers are still trying to find the best method to overcome these barriers, for example, by finding the best catalyst to reduce the high-energy barrier of the reactions and conduct only selective catalyst-surface reactions. The application of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) and its combination with other metals for catalyzing purposes are increasing. The existence of an interesting site that acts as oxygen store could be the main reason for it. Moreover, formation of intermediate species on the surface of YSZ also contributes significantly in increasing the production of some specific products. Understanding the phenomena happening inside could be necessary. In this article, the use of YSZ for some C1 chemistry reactions was discussed and reviewed. © 2008 The Chinese Society of Rare Earths.","C1 chemistry; catalyst; methane; methanol; oxygen storage; rare earths; synthesis gas; yttria-stabilized zirconia","Carbon dioxide; Methane; Methanol; Synthesis gas; Yttria stabilized zirconia; Catalytic syngas processing; Dimethyl ether; Oxygen storage; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40749140310

The modified iron oxides were prepared by co-precipitation method using urea precipitant. The role of additives was also examined using XRD and SEM analysis in detail. As a result, Pd, Pt, Rh and Ru additives have an effect on promoting the reduction and lowering the re-oxidation temperature of iron oxide. Especially, it is revealed that the effect of Rh species on lowering the reduction temperature is attributed to decrease of activation energy for H2 reduction according to Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 course. Meanwhile, Al, Ce, Ti and Zr additives played an important role in prevention of deactivation of iron oxide by repeated redox cycles. Redox performances of iron oxides were also enhanced due to cooperative effects by co-addition of Rh and another species such as Al, Ce and Zr.

The targeted period is of particular scientific interest because it covers the transition period from a mainly snow-covered urban environment to a mainly snow-free environment. The campaign is based on four weeks of observations from 17 March to 14 April 2005. It couples automatic and continuous measurements of radiation and turbulent fluxes, radiative surface temperatures, and air temperature and humidity with manual observations performed during intensive observation periods to supplement the surface temperature observations and to characterize the snow properties. The footprints of radiation and turbulent flux measurements are computed using the surface-sensor-sun urban model and the flux-source area model, respectively. The analysis of the radiometer footprint underscores the difficulty of correctly locating this type of instrument in urban environments, so that the sensor sees a representative combination of the urban and nonurban surfaces. Here, the alley contribution to the upward radiation tends to be overestimated to the detriment of the road contribution. The turbulent footprints cover homogeneous zones in terms of surface characteristics, whatever the wind direction. The initial analysis of the energy balance displays the predominance of the residual term (QRes = Q* - QH - QE) in comparison with the turbulent sensible (QH) and latent (QE) heat fluxes, since its daytime contribution exceeds 50% of the net radiation (Q*). The investigation of energy balances observed at the beginning and at the end of the experiment (i.e., with and without snow) also indicates that the snow plays a significant role in the flux partitioning and the daily pattern of fluxes. Without snow, the energy balance is characteristic of energy balances that have been already observed in densely built-up areas, notably because of the hysteresis observed for QRes and QH in relation to Q* and because of the high contribution of QRes, which includes the effect of heat storage inside the urban structures. With snow, the flux partitioning is modified by the snowmelt process leading to contributions of the residual term and latent heat flux, which are larger than in the case without snow to the detriment of the sensible heat flux. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric turbulence; Climate change; Heat flux; Latent heat; Mathematical models; Weather forecasting; Snowmelt process; Surface-sensor-sun urban model; Thermoradiative exchanges; Snow; air temperature; energy balance; heat flux; humidity; radiative transfer; snow cover; urban area; Canada; Montreal; North America; Quebec [Canada]",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40449085121

A three-dimensional numerical model for groundwater flow and heat transport is used to analyze the thermal energy storage system in the aquifer. The model includes the effects of convection and conduction heat transfer, heat loss to the adjacent confining strata, and hydraulic anisotropy. The operation scenario consists of cyclic injection and recovery from two wells and four periods per year to simulate the seasonal temperature conditions. The model has been used to study performances under various operational and geometrical parameters of the storage system. The calculated temperatures at the producing well were relatively constant within a certain range through the year and fluctuating quarterly a year. Operation schedules, injection temperature, injection/production rate, and geometrical configuration of well and aquifer used in the model are shown to impact the predicted temperature profiles at each stage and the recovery water temperature. But aquifer thickness and hydraulic anisotropy have a minimal effect on the performance of ATES systems.","Aquifer thermal energy storage; Cyclic flow; Geothermal energy; Model","Aquifers; Energy storage; Groundwater flow; Hydrogeology; Mathematical models; Underground heat transfer; Water wells; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Cyclic flow; Thermohydraulic evaluation; Geothermal energy; anisotropy; aquifer; groundwater flow; heat transfer; hydrogeology; hydrological regime; numerical model; recovery; storage; temperature profile; well water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40349090001

However, deletion of the psaE gene in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 inhibited neither photoautotrophic growth, nor in vivo linear and cyclic electron flows. Using photoacoustic spectroscopy, we detected an oxygen-dependent, PSI-mediated energy storage activity in the ΔpsaE null mutant, which was not present in the wild type (WT). The expression of the genes encoding catalase (katG) and iron superoxide dismutase (sodB) was upregulated in the ΔpsaE mutant, and the increase in katG expression was correlated with an increase in catalase activity of the cells. When catalases were inhibited by sodium azide, the production of reactive oxygen species was enhanced in ΔpsaE relative to WT. Moreover, sodium azide strongly impaired photoautotrophic growth of the ΔpsaE mutant cells while WT was much less sensitive to this inhibitor. The katG gene was deleted in the ΔpsaE mutant, and the resulting double mutant was more photosensitive than the single mutants, showing cell bleaching and lipid peroxidation in high light. Our results show that the presence of the PsaE polypeptide at the reducing side of PSI has a function in avoidance of electron leakage to oxygen in the light (Mehler reaction) and the resulting formation of toxic oxygen species. PsaE-deficient Synechocystis cells can counteract the chronic photoreduction of oxygen by increasing their capacity to detoxify reactive oxygen species. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the not well-known inherent dynamics, it has been suspected that the BOG compressors are being operated at too much capacity, unnecessarily consuming too much energy. An empirical model is proposed for the estimation of the boil-off rate (BOR) in an LNG storage tank, based on the specification supplied by the LNG storage tank manufacturer. By using the BOR model, an optimal operation algorithm is proposed for a safe and energy-saving BOG compressor operation, which minimizes the power consumption while preparing against the potential failure of one of the operating compressors. Case study results indicate that the energy consumption could be reduced by a half of the conventional method, by increasing the tank pressure while the safety is maintained. The proposed method is expected to be able to contribute to improving the efficiency of the whole gasification plant operation and control without tempering the safety requirements. © 2008 Springer.","Boil-off gas; Compressors; Dynamic modeling and optimization; Energy-saving operation; LNG gasification process",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39749129649

It examines the biological plausibility underlining these associations and the evidence obtained to date from clinical trials and epidemiological studies. Animal studies have shown that dietary short- and medium-chain fatty acids compared to long-chain fatty acids appear to promote weight loss. Similarly, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) appear to favor weight loss compared to saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in human studies. The structure of fatty acids seems to affect their degree of oxidation and deposition. Although results are conflicting, human studies follow the general trend reported in animal studies. These trials suggest that some fatty acids are prone to oxidation and some others lead to fat storage when comparing isocaloric diets. For instance, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids are preferentially oxidizied to other PUFA but results remain inconsistent. Epidemiological studies concerning this issue reported that total dietary fat, which includes MUFA, PUFA, and SFA could increase the risk of obesity, but results are few and conflicting. The rising biological plausibility linking dietary fat quality and risk of obesity, together with the rather recent addition of fatty acids content in food composition tables, support the need for major epidemiological studies in that area. © 2008 The Obesity Society.",,"fatty acid; animal; body weight; classification; disease model; energy metabolism; fat intake; hamster; human; metabolism; mouse; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; rat; review; Animals; Body Weight; Cricetinae; Dietary Fats; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Humans; Mice; Obesity; Rats; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39449133732

A particularity is present in this kind of processes; it concerns the delay of the crystallisation of PCM, called supercooling phenomenon. The development of a 2D porous-medium model for cold storage with coolant flowing enables a detailed analysis of this process. Fluid flows, forced and natural convections as well as the supercooling phenomenon in these packed capsules were particularly analysed using a thermal non-equilibrium model. The solidification process inside the spherical capsules is treated by employing the quasi-stationary formulation. The effects of different parameters on the behaviour of the tank, such as capsule size, porosity of the packed capsules and the tank dimension are examined when the tank is in horizontal position.

The benefit of exercise in maintaining total metabolic control is well known and recent research indicates that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may play an important role in exercise-related effects. AMPK is considered as a master switch in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. AMPK is an enzyme that works as a fuel gauge, being activated in conditions of high phosphate depletion. In the liver, activation of AMPK results in decreased production of plasma glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride and enhanced fatty acid oxidation. AMPK is also robustly activated by skeletal muscle contraction and myocardial ischemia, and is involved in the stimulation of glucose transport and fatty acid oxidation by these stimuli. In adipose tissue, activated AMPK inhibits deposition of fat, but enhances breakdown and burning of stored fat, resulting in reduction of body weight. The two leading diabetic drugs, namely metformin and rosiglitazone, and adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, show their metabolic effects partially through AMPK. These data suggest that AMPK may be a key player in the development of new treatments for obesity, Type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. In this review, the author provide insight into the role of AMPK as a probable target for treatment of metabolic syndrome. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.","AMP activated protein kinase; Diabetes; Dyslipidemia; Exercise; Insulin resistance; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity","5 amino 4 imidazolecarboxamide riboside; adipocytokine; adiponectin; cholesterol; fatty acid; fibric acid derivative; glitazone derivative; glucose; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; leptin; lipid; metformin; rosiglitazone; triacylglycerol; abdominal obesity; adipose tissue; diabetes mellitus; drug mechanism; drug targeting; dyslipidemia; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; fatty acid oxidation; gluconeogenesis; glucose homeostasis; glucose transport; glycemic control; heart muscle ischemia; human; hyperinsulinemia; hypertension; impaired glucose tolerance; kinesiotherapy; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipogenesis; liver metabolism; metabolic regulation; metabolic syndrome X; muscle contraction; nonhuman; obesity; review; weight control; weight reduction; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome X; Multienzyme Complexes; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39049105534

The paper highlights how ab initio modeling allows to: (i) understand the H2 interaction with solids at an atomistic level; (ii) infer the potential of zeolites as hydrogen storage materials; (iii) give insights in the design of new H2 storage materials for applications. The calculations were performed within the periodic approach using the B3LYP functional with all-electron double zeta polarized Gaussian type basis sets. New data are reported using a richer basis set for both zeolite and H2, which ensures a better description of the intermolecular interaction components. In all the considered systems, H2 mainly interacts side-on with zeolites' charge balancer cations. Geometrical and energetic features were also refined at MP2 level adopting clusters cut out from the chabazite framework in order to gauge the dispersive contribution to the interaction energy, not accounted for by the B3LYP functional. Computed BSSE-free binding energies (BEc) showed that H2 interacts poorly with the protons (H+) of the Brønsted sites (BEc ∼ 5 kJ / mol), whereas the interaction with Li+, Na+ and K+ in metal-exchanged chabazites was stronger, particularly for Li+ located in small framework rings (BEc ∼ 12 kJ / mol). When divalent Mg2 + cation is used as a charge balancer, the BEc becomes ∼ 18 kJ / mol, showing that the interplay between cationic polarization and its spatial position in the zeolite framework is crucial in determining the sorption capacity of the material. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Ab initio calculations; Hydrogen storage; Zeolites","Binding energy; Codes (symbols); Computational methods; Zeolites; Ab initio calculations; Cationic polarization; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849194728

The effect of temperature, steam partial pressure and oxidation length has been discussed. The experimental results, as well as the parameters for the JMAK model, show that there is no significant effect of the temperature and the steam partial pressure used in the oxidation stages on the behaviour of the subsequent cycles (taking apart the first one).

Body weights (BW), organ weights, and adipose depot weights (ADW) were also measured. The most affected tissues by CR were the fat depots. Metabolically active organs were the least affected, especially more in females than in males (male weight lost: 24.3% vs. female: 17.3%). Testosterone and estradiol circulating levels did not show changes by CR. Insulin levels were decreased by CR in both genders, but was more evident in female rats than males. Leptin serum levels were higher in male rats than in females, and CR caused a circulating leptin level reduction only in males. In conclusion, our results indicate that leptin and insulin could be one of the keys of the different hormonal control of energy homeostasis in response to CR between female and male rats. In this sense, leptin serum levels correlated statistically with BW and with individual ADW only in male rats, whereas insulin serum levels correlated statistically with BW and with any of the ADW studied only in females. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","Body weight; Energy homeostasis; Fat adipose tissue; Insulin level; Leptin level; Sex hormones","estradiol; glucose; insulin; leptin; testosterone; adipose tissue; animal experiment; article; body weight; caloric restriction; controlled study; estradiol blood level; female; glucose blood level; insulin blood level; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; organ weight; priority journal; rat; sex difference; testosterone blood level; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Caloric Restriction; Female; Insulin; Leptin; Male; Organ Size; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Sex Characteristics; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849156350

The studies show the presence of two single α and β phases with one mixed α + β phase. The maximum H / M ratio was found to be around 0.94 at 308 K and 90 psi. The introduction of interstitial hydrogen particles into a metallic lattice causes several changes in respect to its electrical resistance. Hence an attempt has been made to relate change in the resistance of material with the content of hydrogen. The resistance of the specimen was found to increase with increasing H / M. Thermodynamical parameters viz., the relative partial molar enthalpy (Δ H) and relative partial molar entropy (Δ S) of dissolved hydrogen are found to be 14.50755 ± 0.8 K J / mol H2 and 47.01152 ± 2.42 J / K / mol H2, respectively.

It is found that the resistance of film increases with the absorption of hydrogen and decreases with desorption of hydrogen. The amount of hydrogen absorbed by the film increases with the number of charging/discharging cycle and after four cycles the sample becomes saturated with hydrogen.

Hydride storage technology has been chosen due to project specifications: high volumetric capacity, low pressures (&lt; 3.5 bar) and low temperatures (&lt; 75 {ring operator} C: fuel cell temperature). During absorption, heat from hydride generation is dissipated by fluid circulation. An integrated plate-fin type heat exchanger has been designed to obtain good compacity and to reach high absorption/desorption rates. At first, the storage system has been tested in accordance with project specifications (absorption/desorption 3.5/1.5 bar). Then, the hydrogen charge/discharge times have been decreased to reach system limits. System design has also been modelled in order to simulate thermal and mass behaviour of the storage tank. The model is based on Fluent software. We take into account heat and mass transfers in the porous media and a convective flow required to cool/heat the system during absorptions/desorptions. The thermal and mass behaviour of the hydride has been integrated in the software. The heat and mass transfers experimentally obtained have been compared to results calculated by the model. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Hydride; Hydrogen; Storage","Absorption; Combined cycle power plants; Heat exchangers; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Mass transfer; Hydrogen storage systems; Metal hydrides; Tanks (containers)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38449091032

A comparative evaluation of hydrogen storage efficiency has been done for high tensile strength GMBs at different radius to wall thickness ratio termed as aspect ratio. By experimental and theoretical calculations, we propose the use of high aspect ratio GMBs with storage efficiency from 15% to 25% w/w for GMBs at pressures below 500 bars. Such efficiencies are unique, being greater than large cryostat (∼ 14 % w/w), and safe compared to large pressure vessels, etc. For the pressure range 150-300 bars a prototype hydrogen filling system has been developed in our laboratory. We have experimentally attained gravimetric efficiency η = MH / (MH + MS) as 15-17% for the GMBs.

In the present work the production of hydrogen from the sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reaction has been studied by experimental bench tests. Promising results on the NaBH4 hydrolysis, catalyst performance and stability have allowed practical application of this technology in a brand new commercial device for small laboratory production of hydrogen gas. A hydrogen generator prototype was manufactured and tested by Erredue srl (Italy). Results confirm an effective operation of the device and stable behaviour of the hydrolysis catalyst material.

The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological changes in tall fescue during its regrowth cycle up to the five-leaf stage, and the effect of repeated defoliation at the one-leaf, two-leaf, and four-leaf stages on herbage quality, water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) energy reserves and the rate of subsequent plant regrowth. Crude protein (CP) and metabolizable energy (ME) concentrations decreased with increased leaf regrowth stage, from 27% and 11.3 MJ kg -1 dry matter (DM) at the one-leaf stage, to 16.1% and 9.2 MJ kg -1 DM at the five-leaf stage, respectively. Acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentrations increased during the regrowth cycle by 16 and 9%, respectively. Frequent defoliation therefore maximized the CP and ME concentrations and minimized the ADF and NDF concentrations of tall fescue, but limited DM yields during regrowth. Defoliation at the four-leaf stage resulted in 30% higher stubble WSC concentration and 20% higher leaf DM yield than defoliation at the two-leaf stage of regrowth, but compromised herbage quality. The stubble was confirmed as the primary storage organ for WSC reserves, while leaf and root growth were found to have an equally high priority for available energy following defoliation.

New and old findings appear to delineate an increasingly complex and important role for magnesium in many cellular functions. This review summarizes the available evidence for a link between the regulation of intracellular magnesium availability and the control of cell growth, energy metabolism and death, both in healthy and diseased conditions. A comprehensive view is precluded by technical difficulties in tracing magnesium within a multicompartment and dynamic environment like the cell; nevertheless, the last few years has witnessed encouraging progress towards a better characterization of magnesium transport and its storage or mobilization inside the cell.

We showed that hindlimb muscles of a bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus, order Peramelomorphia) and a small macropodoid, the brushtail bettong (Bettongia penicillata) expressed four MyHCs, slow, 2a, 2x and 2b, and had the corresponding fibre types as other macropods reported earlier. The fastest and most powerful 2b fibres predominated in most bettong hindlimb muscles, but were absent in the gastrocnemius and the flexor digitorum profundus, which are involved in elastic strain energy saving during hopping. The gastrocnemius of four large macropodids also showed little or no 2b MyHC, whereas this isoform was abundant in their tibialis anterior, which is not involved in elastic energy saving. In contrast, 2b MyHC predominated in the gastrocnemius of four non-hopping marsupials. These results suggest that absence of 2b fibres may be a general feature of macropodoid muscles involved in elastic energy saving. Large eutherians except llamas and pigs also have no 2b fibres.

The control strategy is designed to achieve the high-efficiency operation region of the individual power source and to regulate current and voltage at peak and average power demand, without compromising the performance and efficiency of the overall system. A multiple-input power electronic converter makes the interface among generator, energy storage devices, and the voltage dc-link bus. Classical regulators implement the control loops of each input of the converter. The supervisory system coordinates the power flows among the power sources and the load. The paper is mainly focused on the fuzzy logic supervisory for energy management of a specific power electronic converter control algorithm. Nevertheless, the proposed system can be easily adapted to other converters arrangements or to distributed generation applications.

In this article a start has been made for the development of a sustainability framework for carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems in the Netherlands. Using a participatory approach (which includes an exploratory workshop, two interactive meetings, an international survey and in-depth interviews), nine sustainability criteria for CCS based energy systems were defined and 36 main concerns about the sustainability of carbon, capture and storage systems (by criterion) were identified. Analysis shows that concerns related to the following criteria are most relevant: clean, flexible, just, competitive and publicly acceptable. Furthermore, via stakeholder consultations and through interviews, a list of actions to tackle the concerns was developed. These actions can be clustered into three groups: (i) increasing research and development, (ii) including CCS in a policy portfolio, and (iii) raising public awareness. Finally, actions that should take place in the next 2 years were identified. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to get more grip on planning, we carried out a quantitative scenario study for the electricity and cogeneration sector in the Netherlands using the energy bottom-up model generated with MARKAL. We analysed strategies to realise a 15% and 50% reduction of CO2 emissions in respectively, 2020 and 2050 compared to the 1990 level. We found that, if nuclear energy is excluded as a mitigation option, CCS can be sufficiently cost-effective in 2020 to avoid 29 Mt per year in 2020 in the Dutch electricity sector (which is half of the CO2 emission abatement necessary in this year). We identified the following important factors for planning. In a postponement strategy in which CO2 is reduced from 2020, CO2 can be abated at less than 30 €/t up to 2020. A gradual reduction of 2.5% annually from 2010, asks for a climate policy that makes expenditures possible of 50 €/t CO2 before 2015. Construction of coal-fired power plants without CCS are preferably not built or, in the postponement strategy, only to a limited extent. Finally, early planning is required to realise the construction of a transport infrastructure with a length of around 450 km before 2020. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Some recent in-core fuel failures indicated that a long axial crack developed in the cladding was a secondary failure by delayed hydride cracking. The aim of this study is to define the effects of hydride reorientation on the failure of Zircaloy cladding. Different hydride orientations, the amount of zirconium hydride and various cracking types, all have been considered for their effects on the crack growth and stability of the cladding, and have been thoroughly discussed in this paper. A finite element computer code, ANSYS, has been used in conjunction with the strain energy density theory. In summary, the crack propagation will be aggravated if the hydride orientation is shifted from the circumferential to the radial direction. For a larger crack length, the zirconium hydride plays an important role in affecting the crack growth because the strain energy density factor increases as the hydride approaches the crack tip. Furthermore, when thermal effects are considered, a compressive stress exists at the inner side of the cladding, while a tensile stress is found at the outer side of cladding, thus resulting in crack propagation from the outer side to the inner side of the cladding.

The traditional drivers, such as speed and density of integration, are subject to other prerogatives related to variability, manufacturability, power consumption/dissipation (mobile products!), mix of varied digital and analog/RF functions (system-on-chip integration), etc. Controllability of variations and static leakage will add to, and in certain products prevail, over speed and density. Implications at all levels are multiple and are more diverse than just speed and smallness. The goal of the authors has been to see the problem globally from the product level and to place its components in their true proportions. Therefore, we will start with drawing the product-level picture and placing it in a historical perspective.

It is demonstrated for the first time that the critical resistance, which is the value of resistance defining the crystallization time for the chalcogenide material, has a major impact on the extraction of the activation energy for crystallization. Applying a statistical Monte Carlo model for crystallization coupled with an electrothermal model for both the amorphous and crystalline phases, we analyzed the standard methodology for the extraction of the activation energy. It is shown that a careful choice of the critical resistance is mandatory and a new accurate technique is proposed, resulting in a reliable value for the crystallization activation energy of 2.6 eV in the Ge2Sb2Te5-based devices. © 2008 IEEE.","Chalcogenide; Crystallization; Nonvolatile memory; Phase change memory (PCM); Retention","Activation energy; Amorphous semiconductors; Chalcogenides; Crystallization; Monte Carlo methods; Nonvolatile storage; Amorphous chalcogenide; Critical resistance; Electrothermal model; Nonvolatile memory; Phase change memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549012907

A high producing industrial strain was cultivated at a growth rate μ=0.05 h-1 in glucose-limited chemostat cultures, both under penicillin-G producing and non-producing conditions. Non-producing conditions were accomplished in two ways: (1) by cultivation without addition of the side chain precursor phenylacetic acid and (2) by cultivation of a mutant strain which lost all copies of the gene cluster coding for the penicillin biosynthesis pathway. Manipulation of the fluxes through central metabolism was obtained by cultivation on either glucose or ethanol as sole carbon source. A positive relation was observed between metabolite concentrations and carbon flux in central metabolism. Furthermore, in many cases a positive relation was found between the concentrations of free amino acids and their direct precursors in central metabolism. This corresponds with control of the biosynthesis of these amino acids via feed back inhibition by the end product. With respect to the penicillin production pathway, the flux seems not influenced by two of the three precursor amino acids, namely αAAA and valine but is only influenced by cysteine, which requires a large NADPH supply, and the ATP level. An interesting observation is that the absence of penicillin production seems to stimulate storage metabolism (trehalose metabolism). This leads to the final conclusion that the penicillin production flux appears to be mostly influenced by the availability of energy and redox cofactors, where ATP is supposed to exert its influence at ACV-synthetase and NADPH at the cysteine level. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The urban geometry is composed of simple homogeneous buildings characterized by the canyon aspect ratio (h/w) as well as the canyon vegetation characterized by the leaf aspect ratio (σl) and leaf area density profile. Five energy exchanging surfaces (roof, wall, road, leaf, soil) are considered in the model, and energy conservation relations are applied to each component. In addition, the temperature and specific humidity of canopy air are predicted without the assumption of thermal equilibrium. For radiative transfer within the canyon, multiple reflections for shortwave radiation and one reflection for longwave radiation are considered, while the shadowing and absorption of radiation due to the canyon vegetation are computed by using the transmissivity and the leaf area density profile function. The model is evaluated using field measurements in Vancouver, British Columbia and Marseille, France. Results show that the model quite well simulates the observations of surface temperatures, canopy air temperature and specific humidity, momentum flux, net radiation, and energy partitioning into turbulent fluxes and storage heat flux. Sensitivity tests show that the canyon vegetation has a large influence not only on surface temperatures but also on the partitioning of sensible and latent heat fluxes. In addition, the surface energy balance can be affected by soil moisture content and leaf area index as well as the fraction of vegetation. These results suggest that a proper parameterization of the canyon vegetation is prerequisite for urban modelling. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Canyon vegetation; Leaf area index; Mesoscale environmental modelling; Multiple reflection; Surface energy balance; Urban canopy model","Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric turbulence; Energy balance; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Canyon aspect ratio; Leaf area index; Leaf aspect ratio; Surface energy balance; Urban canopy model; Meteorology; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric turbulence; Energy balance; Meteorology; Soil moisture; Vegetation; air temperature; canopy; canyon; energy balance; environmental modeling; humidity; latent heat flux; leaf area index; mesoscale meteorology; parameterization; radiative transfer; sensible heat flux; soil moisture; urban climate; vegetation; Bouches-du-Rhone; British Columbia; Canada; Eurasia; Europe; France; Marseilles; North America; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; Vancouver; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36448953950

The former is dedicated to the detection of linear networks of discontinuities, while the latter aims at segmenting homogeneous areas. An energy is defined, favoring connections of segments, alignments of rectangles, as well as a relevant interaction between both types of objects.

In addition, the soil heat flux was estimated using a harmonic analysis technique to obtain a more accurate assessment of the surface soil heat flux. By doing so, a closure of 96% was obtained.

The interface state density (Dit) is determined by two-levels charge pumping analysis on long-channel partially-SON transistors where the Si-channel is in contact with the substrate. On short-channel SON transistors, where the Si-channel is completely isolated from the substrate, we were able to determine the characteristics of individual trap located inside the gate oxide using random telegraphic signal (RTS) analysis: activation energy and distance from the SiO2/Si interface. The experimental RTS results demonstrate the validity of the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) statistics for a single trap activity and conclusively prove that SON technology does not introduce additional defects at the gate oxide/channel interface when compared to CMOS technology. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

L1H 7K4, Canada","In this paper we present an experimental and theoretical investigation of the exergetic performance of a solar pond (with a surface area of 4 m2 and a depth of 1.5 m) which was built at Cukurova University in Adana, Turkey. The system was filled with salty water to form three zones (e.g., upper convective, non-convective and heat storage) accordingly. A data acquisition device was used to measure and record the temperatures hourly at various locations in the pond (distributed vertically within and at the bottom of the pond, and horizontally and vertically within the insulated side-walls). An exergy model is developed to study the exergetic performance of the pond and its three zones in terms of exergy efficiencies which are then compared with the corresponding energy efficiencies. The reference environment temperature is specified for exergy analysis as the average representative temperature of each month of the year (for example, it is taken as an average temperature of 28 °C for August). Thus, the highest energy and exergy efficiencies are found for August to be: 4.22% and 3.02% for the upper convective zone, 13.80% and 12.64% for the non-convective zone, and 28.11% and 27.45% for the heat storage zone, respectively. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This study asserts that the consumption of resources due to the human economy is a source of great concern because of the load it places on the biosphere. Environmental resources locally used, whether directly or indirectly, from both renewable energy fluxes and storage of materials and energies, are investigated. In this paper emergy analysis is presented and applied to the Province of Siena and to each of its municipalities, in order to evaluate the main flows of energy and materials that supply the territorial system, including human subsystems, with reference to their actual environmental cost. Therefore, the behaviour of the whole system and the interactions between natural and human agents were studied; in other words, the attitudes of the territorial systems toward resource use as revealed by their patterns of emergy consumption were observed. Once expressed in units of the same form of energy through the emergy evaluation, categories of resource consumption and systems of varying scales and organization are compared. Furthermore, indexes of environmental performance based on emergy are calculated. Flows of energy and materials are assessed, and their intensities, which vary throughout the area of the Province, are then visualized on maps. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We suggest defining q as the result of a balance between the energy stored in OM and the external supply of energy needed to release it. We apply this concept to the study of litter decomposition in four European pine forests: boreal, cool Atlantic, Mediterranean and warm Atlantic. Intact litter cores were taken and transported to the laboratory, where needles were sorted into six classes that summarize the main facts of the decomposition: melanisation, fragmentation and perforation by mesofauna. Each class was analyzed by both differential thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry to obtain its spectra of weight loss and energy release. In the non-decomposed needles, two peaks of weight loss and energy release appear: a labile peak at about 350 °C, and a recalcitrant peak at about 450 °C. During decomposition, both peaks (but especially the recalcitrant one) move to lower temperatures, and their shapes change from well defined to flattened. In Mediterranean litters, a third peak appears at about 500 °C, due probably to refractory products of neoformation. There is a continuous increase in the energy stored in the remaining litter (in Joules per unit OM): this increase is concentrated in both the most thermolabile fractions (lost at temperatures <350 °C) and the most thermostable ones (>450 °C). With decomposition OM becomes more recalcitrant (i.e., it is lost at higher temperatures), but its stored energy becomes more available (i.e., it is released at lower temperatures). Overall, the energetic benefit/cost ratio increases. Thus, our results to date do not agree with the current paradigm that q decreases with decomposition; rather, they suggest that, at least in the first phases we studied, q is maintained or even increases. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Thermal storage plays an important role in building energy conservation, which is greatly assisted by the incorporation of latent heat storage (LHS) in building products. LHS in a phase change material (PCM) is very attractive because of its high storage density with small temperature swing. It has been demonstrated that for the development of a latent heat storage system (LHTS) in a building fabric, the choice of the PCM plays an important role in addition to heat transfer mechanism in the PCM. Thermal energy storage in the walls, ceiling and floor of buildings may be enhanced by encapsulating or embedding suitable PCMs within these surfaces. They can either capture solar energy directly or thermal energy through natural convection. Increasing the thermal storage capacity of a building can increase human comfort by decreasing the frequency of internal air temperature swings so that the indoor air temperature is closer to the desired temperature for a longer period of time. This paper aims to gather the information from the earlier works on the developments of PCM's incorporation in building, the problems associated with the selection of PCM and the various methods used to contain them for space heating and cooling applications. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
