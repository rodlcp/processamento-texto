Pseudomonas sp. dominated the spoilage microflora of aerobically packed fillets whereas LAB defined spoilage at the MAP conditions. Modified atmosphere packaging led to a significant shelf-life extension of fillets, in terms of microbial growth and organoleptic deterioration. The preservative effect of CO2 was greater as the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere increased. Under this context, MAP can practically extend the shelf life of chilled gilthead seabream fillets. The growth of LAB was modelled as a function of temperature and CO2 concentration in modified atmosphere packaging. The applicability of the models was validated at fluctuating temperature conditions. The nominal maximum CO2 concentration (CO2,max) for growth and the specific growth rate (kref) at Tref (4°C) in the absence of carbon dioxide were determined to be 98.3% and 0.015 h-1, respectively. The activation energy parameter of the model, which indicates the temperature dependence of the growth rates, was 101.0 kJ/mol showing a strong dependence of LAB growth on storage temperature. Based on organoleptic acceptability the end of shelf life coincided with 107/g Pseudomonas sp. and 106/g lactobacilli for aerobically and MAP stored samples respectively. Based on the developed models this translates to 7, 8, 12 and 32 days of shelf life at 5°C and 0, 20, 50 and 80% CO2 respectively.","Arrhenius; Fish; Lactic acid bacteria; Modified atmosphere packaging; Predictive modelling; Shelf life","Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactobacillus; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas sp.; Sparus aurata",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751701854

The methods aim to allow rapid teaching of robotic tasks in a safe and efficient manner. The techniques can reduce the setup time of a robotic system. This is crucial for SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprize) where the products in the manufacturing area are in small lot size but with high batch mix. The objective of this research is to fuse the information from a range sensor and a camera. An unique method using the surface constraint has been adopted for the calibration of the sensor fusion system. By taking the surface normal of a calibration board as the common feature, the transformation between the two coordinate systems can be formulated. The end result is a fused scene with both range and texture (color in this case) information. The range information will be used for the path generation for robotic tasks. On the other hand, the images captured by the camera together with the graphical user interface provide an user friendly interface platform for the user. As the two images have been fused, the operator can program a path for a robot to execute by 'point-and-click' on the user interface screen. Experimental results have shown that the new method of robot programming, with sensor fusion information, has improved the robotic teaching process by at least 90% as compared to the manual programming method using teaching pendant. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Calibration; Cameras; Data fusion; Electric energy storage; Graphical user interfaces; Image enhancement; Mechatronics; Programmable robots; Random access storage; Robotics; Robots; Sensor data fusion; Sensors; Teaching; Batch mixes; Common features; Coordinate systems; Human-machine interactions; Interface platforms; Lot sizes; Multiple sensors; Path generations; Range informations; Range sensors; Robotic systems; Robotic tasks; Sensor fusion systems; Sensor fusions; Setup times; Surface constraints; Surface normals; Teaching processes; User friendly; Robot programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049127586

In this paper a design method to design the power system of a FCHEV is presented. 10 cases of combining the fuel stack with either the battery, ultracapacitor, or both are investigated. The system volume, mass, efficiency, and battery lifetime are also compared. It is concluded that when ultracapacitors are the only energy storage device the system becomes too big and heavy.

Methods to reduce the total amount of radioactive dose injected into a patient are investigated. On the other hand, a lower dose may require a longer data acquisition time to obtain images of high statistical quality, thus limiting the total number of PET scans performed by a PET facility per day. Through dose optimization, a compromise between the total dose injected into a patient and the required scan time can be achieved, by ensuring maximum count rate performance for the scanner. In this study, we use the Noise Equivalent Count Rate (NECR) as a metric of the rate in which statistically important coincidence events are counted by a PET imaging system. The optimal dose is defined as the total amount of dose required to be injected into a patient so as to induce a maximum NECR for the particular scanner and patient. Ideally, it can be estimated by determining a curve of NECR versus the injected dose for each scanner-patient system. Recent studies estimate optimal dose for a particular system by expressing the NECR as a function of the singles rate instead. In this work we propose an alternative method based on a series of simulations of imaging systems and realistic anthropomorphic phantoms. We used Geant4 Application for Tomography Emission (GATE) to simulate a series of scans and study the independent effect of various parameters to the NECR of a clinical PET system. We investigated the relationship between the NECR and the parameters of patient size, relative axial position of the patient to the field of view (FOV) of the scanner, combined use of reduced dead time electronics and LSO crystals instead of slow-responding electronics and BGO and finally of the energy window of a system. We used two validated scanner models (ECAT HR+ and Biograph), three NCAT phantoms of different size, two bed positions corresponding to the axial shift of either the heart or the bladder region to the centre of FOV respectively and three energy windows with different low energy thresholds. The results show an optimal mean dose range of 55-65MBq for HR+ and 300-450MBq for Biograph, depending on the patient size, when the heart is located at the centre of axial FOV. ©2008 IEEE.","Biograph; Clinical; Dose; GATE; HR+; Monte Carlo; NCAT; NECR; Optimization; PET; Weight","Diagnostic radiography; Digital image storage; Imaging systems; Medical imaging; Mergers and acquisitions; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Optoelectronic devices; Scanning; Technical presentations; Tomography; Windows; Biograph; Clinical; Dose; GATE; HR+; Monte Carlo; NCAT; NECR; PET; Weight; Positron emission tomography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849146513

The proposed modeling needs to allow the ESS sizing according to the objective that needs to be achieved, being braking energy recovery, voltage drop compensation and peak power shaving the most common goals of ESS use in hybrid vehicles. The needed power and energy levels will vary in function of the vehicle features and the driving cycle followed.

The method consists of the determination of the borders of the gland from a set of transaxial tomographic images by use of a specific for each case threshold value. We have measured the thyroid volume of 48 hyperthyroid patients by adding transaxial slices We analysed the slices' data producing interfile format images by Procyon Starlab program and transferring these images in a PC and saved in an uncompressed bitmap format in order to be processed by Interactive Data Language (IDL) tools and Matlab program. Ellipse ROIs are created around each thyroid lobe while rectangular ROIs include both lobes uptake data. Matrices of the maps of the counted voxels of the slices of the organ were created. Their total is multiplied by the elementary voxel size in mm to obtain the final organ volume. Data were extracted and Area, Eccentricity, major & minor axis length, Orientation, equivalent Diameter and Integral Intensity of both left & right lobes were calculated. The delineation procedure adopted in this study was validated by 10 cylindrical phantoms 10 to 100 ml which were imaged under conditions similar to those of the patients' studies and by measuring the actual volume of the gland of 3 patients who subsequently underwent thyroidectomy by submersion. The method is simple and fast with a relative error of up to 3% for length, 11% for area and 8% for volume determinations. ©2008 IEEE.","3D thyroid volume; Medical image measurements; SPECT image; Volume determination in nuclear medicine","Diagnostic radiography; Digital image storage; Image enhancement; Imaging systems; MATLAB; Medical imaging; Nuclear energy; Nuclear medicine; Optoelectronic devices; Radioactive tracers; Technical presentations; Tomography; Volume measurement; 3d processing; 3D thyroid volume; Bitmap formats; Cylindrical phantoms; Delineation procedures; Dose estimations; Gamma cameras; Medical image measurements; Minor axis; Procyon; Relative errors; Single photons; SPECT image; Thyroid glands; Tomographic images; Transaxial; Volume determination in nuclear medicine; Voxel sizes; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849094522

In this work, further investigation concerning the improvement of the hybrid system's focusing properties is conducted. Specifically, microwave radiometry and hyperthermia experiments are performed using water phantoms surrounded by dielectric layers used as matching material. The results showed that the use of dielectric material reduces the reflected electromagnetic energy on the air-phantom interface, resulting in improved detection of temperature variation inside the phantom and higher penetration of the energy when microwave radiometry and hyperthermia is applied respectively. ©2008 IEEE.","Deep brain hyperthermia; Ellipsoidal beamformer; Focused microwave radiometry; Multiband radiometric receiver; Phantom experiments","Beamforming; Dielectric materials; Digital image storage; Electric grounding; Electromagnetic waves; Experiments; Hybrid computers; Hybrid materials; Imaging systems; Optoelectronic devices; Phase interfaces; Radiometers; Radiometry; Technical presentations; Deep brain hyperthermia; Ellipsoidal beamformer; Focused microwave radiometry; Multiband radiometric receiver; Phantom experiments; Microwaves",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849091724

The results of this study could be useful in designing a common detector system where both the CT and PET photons and/or megavoltage cone beam CT (MV CBCT) photons could be detected. The short decay time of the Ce3+ doped single crystal scintillators favors their use in combined PET/CT detectors. To this aim cerium (Ce+3) doped crystal samples of GSO, LSO, LYSO, LuYAP and YAP scintillators were examined under a wide energy range (from 70keV to 4.5MeV). Evaluation was performed by determining i) the luminescence efficiency (emitted light energy flux over incident x-ray or γ -ray energy flux) in the energy range employed in X-ray CT, in Nuclear Medicine (70keV up to 662keV) and in radiotherapy (6MV and 18MV), ii) the spectral matching factor (expressing the spectral compatibility to optical photon detectors) and (iii) The effective efficiency (combination of luminescence efficiency with spectral compatibility). Maximum luminescence efficiency values were observed at about 70 keV for YAP:Ce and LuYAP:Ce and at 140keV for LSO:Ce, LYSO:Ce and GSO:Ce. The highest luminescence efficiency of all the scintillators examined was observed for LSO:Ce. Finally the light emission performance of LSO:Ce and LYSO:Ce scintillation materials was found adequate for use in a single detector multimodality scanner. ©2008 IEEE.","Effective efficiency; Inorganic scintillators; Luminescence efficiency; Multimodality imaging","Animal cell culture; Cerium; Cerium compounds; Detectors; Digital image storage; Electric instrument transformers; Imaging systems; Ionization; Light; Light sources; Luminescence; Nuclear medicine; Optoelectronic devices; Phosphors; Photons; Positron emission tomography; Radiotherapy; Scintillation; Scintillation counters; Single crystals; Technical presentations; Crystal scintillators; Detector systems; Doped crystals; Effective efficiency; Emission performances; Emitted lights; Energy fluxes; Energy ranges; Imaging conditions; Inorganic scintillators; Luminescence efficiency; LYSO:Ce; Megavoltage cone beams; Multi modalities; Multimodality imaging; Optical photon detectors; Radiation therapies; Scintillation materials; Short decay times; Spectral matching factors; Wide energy ranges; X-ray CT; Light emission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849090064

Alkaline treatments offered some potential for improving the methane yield from grass and sugar beet tops. The results show that the CH4 yield of energy crops can be maintained by appropriate ensiling conditions for even after 11 months in ambient conditions. The CH4 yield was best preserved with wet grass mixture without additives. Co-digestion of manure and crops was shown to be feasible with feedstock volatile solids (VS) containing up to 40% of crops. The highest specific methane yields of 268, 229 and 213ICH 4kg-1 VSadded in co-digestion of cow manure with grass, sugar beet tops and straw, respectively, were obtained during feeding with 30% of crop in the feedstock, corresponding to 85-105% of the total methane potential in the substrates as determined by batch assays.

The scheduler performs the dual task of scheduling the users experiencing high channel gains to minimize the energy consumption while at the same time, it takes into account the maximum allowed buffer length of each user to provide an upper bound on the maximum tolerable delay. The idea of a threshold depending on the buffer occupancy is proposed to schedule the users opportunistically unless the deadline for transmission is reached. A maximum delay guarantee is provided in the proposed scheme in addition to average delay guarantee at almost no additional energy cost.

The Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) was applied over a domain of 60 km × 60 km with a horizontal resolution of 1 km. Four meteorological episodes were selected, and, for each of these, the model was integrated using two different land cover situations. The first consisted of a detailed reconstruction of the early nineteenth-century setting of Brussels and its wide surroundings, while the second corresponded to the present-day land cover. Since the nineteenth century, when the recording station of Uccle was established, a major land cover change from an agricultural area to a built surface has taken place. The temperature difference between the simulations at the site of Uccle was assumed to represent the urban effect on the site since the beginning of recording. The urban heat island (UHI) of Brussels was found to have a significant impact on the temperature record in Uccle. The urban-rural temperature difference was found to build up during the evening, gradually decreasing during the night and becoming zero during the day. By analyzing the surface energy balance it was revealed that the UHI is mainly caused by a greater storage of energy in the urban fabric during the day and a release of this heat in the evening.

Several projects have been undertaken to develop a strategy towards a European hydrogen-based transport system. The present paper describes the part of two of those projects: CUTE and HYFLEET:CUTE, sponsored by European Commission's 6th Framework Research Programme, involving several partners, mainly from industry, governments, academic and transport operators. The CUTE project was officially closed on March 2006, while HyFLEET:CUTE is an ongoing project. Both projects have the objective of developing and demonstrating a hydrogen based public transport system. This paper will look at the main conclusions of CUTE project and at the life-cycle analysis of the hydrogen used in the filling station and the fuel cell buses that ran in the city of Porto. The life-cycle analysis covers al phases from production, transport, and storage of hydrogen, up to the operation in the municipal fleet. This included the study of the energy efficiencies and environmental impact (the so called well-totank and tank-to-wheel studies) of different hydrogen production pathways. Regarding the bus operation, the energy and environmental vehicle performance is assessed and compared with current technologies. Furthermore, in the framework of the Hyfleet:UTE project, a new filling station was built by the French oil company Total in Berlin that uses on-site hydrogen production with a LPG reforming system, combined with liquid hydrogen trucked from a Linde factory. The municipal fleet vehicles used are built by MAN and use an internal combustion engine and compressed hydrogen storage.

Three types of surface-modified SiNPs, including OH-SiNPs, COOH-SiNPs, and PEG-SiNPs with a size of ∼45 nm, have been prepared with RuBPY doped for imaging purposes. Intravenous (iv) injection of these SiNPs followed by fluorescence tracing in vivo using the Maestro in vivo imaging system indicated that OH-SiNPs, COOH-SiNPs, and PEG-SiNPs were all cleared from the systemic blood circulation, but that both the clearance time and subsequent biological organ deposition were dependent on the surface chemical modification of the SiNPs. Thus, for instance, the PEG-SiNPs exhibited relatively longer blood circulation times and lower uptake by the reticuloendothelial system organs than OH-SiNPs and COOH-SiNPs. More interestingly, in vivo real-time imaged dominant signal in bladder and urine excretion studies revealed that all three types of iv-injected SiNPs with a size of ∼45 nm were partly excreted through the renal excretion route. These conclusions were further confirmed through ex vivo organ optical imaging and TEM imaging and energy-dispersed X-ray spectrum analysis of urine samples. These findings would have direct implications for the use of SiNPs as delivery systems and imaging tools in live animals. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the in vivo optical imaging method is helpful for in vivo sensing the biological effects of SiNPs by using luminescent dye doped in the silica matrix as a synchronous signal. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Biodistribution; Biological effects; Blood circulations; Delivery systems; Ex-vivo; Imaging tools; In vivo optical imaging; In vivo studies; In-situ; In-vivo; Luminescent dyes; Modified silicas; Optical imaging; Renal excretions; Reticuloendothelial systems; Silica matrixes; Surface chemical modifications; Synchronous signals; Urinary excretions; Urine samples; Animals; Biological organs; Blood; Body fluids; Cardiovascular system; Chemical modification; Digital image storage; Imaging systems; Nanoparticles; Optical image storage; Optoelectronic devices; Oxides; Polyethylene glycols; Silica; Spectrum analyzers; Physiology; Animals; Diagnostic Imaging; Drug Carriers; Female; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Nanoparticles; Polyethylene Glycols; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Silicon Dioxide; Surface Properties; Tissue Distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149113055

Software development projects are, however, often troubled by time and budget overruns, resulting in systems that do not fulfill customer requirements. Both research and industry lack strategies to combine reducing the long software development lifecycles (as required by time-to-market demands) with increasing the quality of the software developed. Software process improvement (SPI) provides the first step in the move towards software quality, and assessments are a vital part of this process. Unfortunately, software process assessments are often expensive and time consuming. Additionally, they often provide companies with a long list of issues without providing realistic suggestions. The goal of this paper is to describe a new low-overhead assessment method that has been designed specifically for small-to-medium-sized (SMEs) organisations wishing to be automotive software suppliers. This assessment method integrates the structured-ness of the plan-driven SPI models of Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Automotive SPICE™ with the flexibleness of agile practices.

Its use (pure or blended) does not demand any modification in the diesel engine and in the existing fuel distribution and storage infrastructure. Moreover, biodiesel has a high energetic yield, fixes the solar energy and contains insignificant amounts of sulphur. Therefore, biodiesel is currently the best substitute for fossil diesel fuel. Besides mono-alkyl esters, glycerol (main co-product), alcohol, catalyst, free fatty acids, tri-, di- and monoglycerides compose the final mixture of biodiesel production process. These and other kinds of contaminants can lead to severe operational and environmental problems. Therefore, the quality control of biodiesel is greatly significant to the success of its commercialization and market acceptance. Some important issues on the biodiesel quality control involve the monitoring of transesterification reaction, the quantification of mono-alkyl esters and free- and bonded glycerol as well as determination of residual catalysts and alcohol. Moreover, the determination of blend levels is another key aspect of biodiesel analyses. Chromatography and spectroscopy are the analytical methods most used for the biodiesel characterization, but procedures based on physical properties are also available. Previously, a review on analytical methods used to evaluate biodiesel quality was written by Knothe. Due to the importance of this field, we made an update of Knothes' review. Therefore, in this paper, we will describe new developments in biodiesel analyses and some references showed in Knothes' paper. Specially, we will describe analytical methods used for quantification of glycerol, mono-, di-, triglycerides, methanol, water, Na, K, P, and steroids in biodiesel or along the transesterification reaction. Also, the determination of biodiesel content in blends and some physicochemical parameters are discussed. At the end, we will assess the available techniques and point out some improvements on analytical methods for biodiesel characterization. © 2008.","Analytical methods; Biodiesel; Chromatography; Fatty mono-alkyl esters; Spectroscopy","Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Catalysts; Characterization; Chromatography; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Esters; Fatty acids; Fuel oils; Fuel storage; Glycerol; Quality control; Solar energy; Spectroscopy; Transesterification; Alkyl esters; Analytical method; Biodiesel production; Environmental problems; Physicochemical parameters; Residual catalysts; Storage infrastructure; Transesterification reaction; Oils and fats",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54349096742

Currently, organizations are unable to cope with collaborative decision making in a particular domain. Mastering domain knowledge and sharing decision rules is a complex yet important issue. In this paper, we first design a generic framework for community-grounded, collaborative decision making enabled, ontology based systems. This framework is constructed with three main engineering tracks: the linguistic engineering track, the ontology engineering track and the group decision engineering track. Each engineering track has its own methodology supported by a tool. Then, we use Semantic Decision Tables to elaborate the knowledge blocks resulting from these three engineering tracks. Semantic Decision Tables are mainly used (1) to elaborate concepts of the domain ontologies, (2) to gather semantically grounded decision rules within a decision group and (3) to provide tabular reports to the users. Finally, an online multilingual knowledge platform - the PROFILE COMPILER is developed as the result. It allows small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to retrieve and personalize existing domain ontology, design and share their decision rules. We illustrate in the domain of Human Resource Management (HRM).","Information systems; Intelligent databases; Knowledge base management systems","Communication; Data structures; Electric energy storage; Engineering; Enterprise resource management; Human resource management; Information management; Information science; Information theory; Internet; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Management; Ontology; Program compilers; Resource allocation; Semantics; Collaborative decision makings; Collaborative settings; Decision rules; Do-mains; Domain knowledges; Domain ontologies; Generic frameworks; Group decisions; Human resources; Intelligent databases; Knowledge base management systems; Linguistic engineerings; Mutual understandings; Online services; Ontology engineerings; Potential solutions; Semantic technologies; Decision tables",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57349096557

This research attempts to comprehensively examine the criteria for measuring entrepreneurial knowledge performance outcomes in small and medium enterprises. To date no studies developed a set of widely accepted measurement criteria associated to entrepreneur knowledge and firm performance. This paper, therefore, aims to fill the gap. Design/methodology/approach: Existing studies on entrepreneurial knowledge were reviewed and their limitations were identified. Mailed structured questionnaire data for this study were collected from SME in Slovenia (168 usable responses). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modelling was used to estimate the model. Findings: The model hypothesis on the relationship among entrepreneurial knowledge and performance were mainly supported, thus reflecting the positive effect of entrepreneurial knowledge and all its dimensions on SME performance. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited to Slovenian SME, but can be generalised to other regions. Practical implications - Entrepreneurial knowledge can have beneficial effects on the firm's growth and profitability. The findings can be used to guide entrepreneur in developing different dimensions of knowledge. Originality/value: This study proved latent elements of entrepreneurial knowledge model. It gives valuable information, which hopefully will help SMEs to respect more the meaning of knowledge. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Knowledge management; Small to medium-sized enterprises","Electric energy storage; Knowledge management; Management information systems; Beneficial effects; Business performance; Confirmatory factor analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Firm performances; Growth and profitabilities; Knowledge models; Performance outcomes; Positive effects; Practical implications; Questionnaire datums; Slovenia; Small and medium enterprises; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Structural equations; Administrative data processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57149127225

Animal feed production - the state-of-the-art technology at the plant- was compared to anaerobic digestion. The latter was simulated in two different scenarios: digestion in small-scale biogas plants in the surrounding area versus digestion in a large-scale biogas plant at the bioethanol production site. Emphasis was placed on a holistic simulation balancing chemical parameters and calculating logistic algorithms to compare the efficiency of the stillage treatment solutions. For central anaerobic digestion different digestate handling solutions were considered because of the large amount of digestate. For land application a minimum of 36,000 ha of available agricultural area would be needed and 600,000 m3 of storage volume. Secondly membrane purification of the digestate was investigated consisting of decanter, microfiltration, and reverse osmosis. As a third option aerobic wastewater treatment of the digestate was discussed.

In principle, an indirect matrix converter is constructed by connecting a front-end bidirectional rectification stage to a conventional two-level inversion stage with no bulky capacitive or inductive energy storage connected to their intermediate dc link. Through the proper modulation and compensation of the resulting converter, sinusoidal input current and output voltage can be achieved with minimized rectification switching loss, rendering the indirect matrix converter as a competitive choice for interfacing the utility grid to, e.g., defense facilities that require a different frequency supply. As an improvement, an indirect matrix converter assembled using a three-level energy processing stage has briefly been mentioned in the literature, but has neither been tested in simulation nor experimentally because its operational principles, pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) control, and index compensation have not yet been discussed in the existing literature. Addressing the previously described issues, this paper focuses on the operational mode analysis of a three-level indirect matrix converter implemented using a neutral-point-clamped inversion stage and the design of a number of PWM and modulation ratio compensation schemes for controlling the converter with improved waveform quality. The performances and practicalities of the designed schemes are verified in simulation and experimentally using an implemented laboratory prototype with some representative results captured and presented in this paper. © 2008 IEEE.","Matrix converters; Neutral-point-clamped inverters; Pulsewidth modulation (PWM); Rectifiers","Counting circuits; Data storage equipment; Industrial applications; Modulation; Power converters; Pulse modulation; Pulse width modulation; Stages; Ac sources; Compensation schemes; DC links; Defense facilities; Different frequencies; Energy processing; Indirect matrix converters; Inductive energy storages; Matrix converters; Modulation ratios; Neutral-point-clamped inverters; Operational modes; Operational principles; Output voltages; Pulse-width modulations; Pulsewidth modulation (PWM); Rectifiers; Semi-conductors; Sinusoidal input currents; Switching losses; Utility grids; Variable voltages; Waveform qualities; Electric rectifiers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049130939

The mechanisms involved in the storage of creatine have not been completely elucidated. Several studies have shown promising results regarding creatine supplementation in sports that require a single high intensity and/or short-term effort. In this context, the biochemical interactions related to the action of creatine in performance improvement are not clear. Further studies into the role of this compound in reactions involved in the storage and production of energy may lead to a better understanding of energy metabolism in physical performance.

In a case study of a steel mill, two of the four different production processes considered used COG, while the other two systems used biomass based synthesis gas to blend with the COG. With the assumed amount of available COG at the steel mill, nearly 300 Gw-hr/yr of MeOH could be produced, using the SMR production system. When 420 Gw-hr/yr of biomass for synthesis gas production were blended with the COG, another 270 Gw-hr/yr of MeOH can be produced. The use of COG to produce MeOH is cost efficient, and has the potential of reducing the specific CO2 emission in the range of 25-65% compared to fossil gasoline, depending on the amount of biomass included in the system setup. The integration of a motor fuel refinery in the steel industry may give benefits, e.g., better energy storage possibilities and increased incentives to utilize residual heat.

The system serves an electric load and a possible hydrogen (H2) load, which could be local transportation. The model is implemented as a linear programming (LP) problem. The objective is to dimension the system components and optimize the operation over a given time span in order to obtain the lowest possible cost of energy ( /kWh). The cost of energy (COE) is calculated as the total cost divided by the total energy delivered (electricity + H2). The Wind-H2-diesel plant model contains the following components: Wind turbine, battery, electrolyser and compressor, H2 storage tanks, fuel cell and diesel power generators. The H2 tank serves both the fuel cell and the H2 load. The model reads capital and OM (operation and maintenance) costs, technical specifications, diesel power generation cost and time-series for wind power, electric load and H2 load. Results are presented through a general case study represented by 100 households and 100 cars that could be run on H2. The study compares the Wind-H2-diesel system with a Wind-diesel system based on two scenarios: 1) electric load only, 2) electric load & H2 load. A 10 year sample of wind speeds from a location in northern Norway has been used. The reference wind power generation equals 3500 full load hours/yr on average. The reference diesel power cost is 0.4 /kWh. Results show that a high diesel power cost is necessary to make H2 cost-effective as energy storage for wind power. As long as diesel power costs are less than 0.2-0.3 /kWh, H2 is not an option. In addition the long-term variability of the wind resource used in the study strongly indicates that fully renewable energy systems, based solely on wind power as the energy source and H2 as the long-term energy storage, are not cost-effective, mainly due to a requirement for a very large (seasonal) H2 storage capacity. The main results indicate that a wind-diesel plant could serve the electric load with a COE of 0.20 /kWh and a renewable fraction of 71% whereas a Wind-H2-diesel plant could serve the same load with a COE of 0.19 /kWh with a renewable fraction of 79%. Including the H2 load could yield the same COE (0.19 /kWh) and further increase the electric load renewable fraction to 83 %. Including H2 will also significantly reduce the relative wind power dumping. The production cost of H2 as fuel is high compared to present costs of fossil fuel. However, it is shortly discussed that H2 still could be competitive as clean fuel for transportation in remote energy systems.","Fuel cell; Hydrogen; Linear Programming; Optimization; Renewable energy; SAPS; Wind power","Long-term variability; Operation and maintenance; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; SAPS; System components; Technical specifications; Wind-diesel systems; Cost effectiveness; Electric loads; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Electricity; Energy storage; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Linear programming; Optimization; Tanks (containers); Wind power; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876777217

The device is based on ABB's STATCOM SVC Light® combined with battery storage. Operating principle and construction of the device are outlined and the design of the battery storage for a given energy specification is described. To match the high performance of SVC Light and obtain a dynamic power compensator, a high-performance battery is needed. To match the high DC-side voltage of SVC Light, a large number of batteries in series, each with a large number of cells, must be used. Thus, to achieve high availability, the battery cells should have a safe short-circuit failure mode. Furthermore, no hazardous materials should be used. A battery type with all those characteristics was recognized in the high-temperature sodium nickel-chloride battery, which has the advantage of being ""failure safe"": a cell failure results in a short circuit of the particular cell, leaving the module operational with almost the same voltage and power rating. Experimental results from a prototype system are also shown and discussed in the paper.","Battery storage; Capacitor storage; Energy Storage; Power Systems; STATCOM; SVC","Active and Reactive Power; Battery storage; High availability; Operating principles; Point of connection; Power electronic devices; Statcom; SVC; Capacitor storage; Chlorine compounds; Electric current regulators; Standby power systems; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876753373

Medieval and early modern pits were located where coal outcropped or was close to the surface and was used only locally and on a small scale. But the development first of turnpike roads, then of canals and finally of railways (themselves fuelled by coal) enabled coal to replace water as the major source of energy. The influence of coal can still be seen in the present-day English landscape, and not just in the various lines of communication, many of which still exist. Although most of the collieries that have worked over the last three hundred years have now closed, sufficient remain, either as working pits or mining museums, to show what a typical colliery was like, with the various components of headgear, heapstead, winding-engine house, control room, screens building, pithead baths, etc. Alongside the pits was the accommodation for the colliery workforce and their families; initially colliers lived amongst the local community, but as larger pits were developed, purpose-built housing was erected specifically for the colliery communities. As well as the housing, these villages incorporated other elements, such as pigeon lofts, allotments and welfare clubs, for the miners' leisure time. Earlier in the twentieth century coal-handling facilities were a frequent sight. Now these have disappeared and the only major element of the end use of coal still visible in the landscape are the coal-fired power stations and their associated waste-ash piles; railways and shipping are now powered by oil, and many power stations also now use gas or nuclear power, although if carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be made economically viable, coal may yet come back into favour for providing large-scale power.","Canals; Coal; Coal mining; Collieries; Colliery communities; Railways",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872668534

On the other hand, the exploitation of wind energy in the specific area is subject to strict constraints that lead to the rejection of substantial amounts of wind energy. In order to deal with the situation encountered, the concept of energy storage systems collaborating with renewable energy sources suggests an appreciable solution that may compensate wind energy rejections. In this context, the adoption of a Wind-Compressed Air Energy Storage (Wind-CAES) configuration on the island of Crete, where the installation of a natural gas terminal is under schedule, is presently investigated. To achieve maximum potential profitability, the provision of guaranteed amounts of energy to the local electricity grid during peak demand hours is examined. Next, to ensure that the system will be able to fulfil its peak demand energy requirements, the CAES unit will be able to shift its mode to the typical gas turbine cycle as well. A simulation algorithm considering the potential operational modes of the proposed configuration comprises the mathematical tool for the CAES system optimum sizing. Based on the criterion of maximum wind energy exploitation, optimum configurations selected are afterwards financially evaluated. From the results obtained the viability of the proposed solution is validated, this supporting the implementation of similar configurations in the rest of Aegean Islands as well.","Aegean islands; Crete; Energy storage; Wind energy; Wind-CAES","Aegean islands; Crete; Electrical networks; Electricity grids; Energy requirements; Energy solutions; Energy storage systems; Gas terminals; Gas turbine cycles; Mathematical tools; Operational modes; Optimum configurations; Peak demand; Power station; Renewable energy source; Simulation algorithms; Specific areas; Strict constraint; System optimum; Wind energy exploitation; Wind park; Wind-CAES; Compressed air; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Exhibitions; Profitability; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870014398

Two different types of resolution were used to solve the equations governing flows, i.e., in laminar flow, the numerical resolution based in finite differences was used; and in turbulent flow the finite volumes method was imposed. Numerical resolution of boundary layers equations allowed to account for the physical rates of heat transfer and motion quantity. The maximum value of velocity in the turbulent mode was larger than that of the laminar mode. The difference between the two modes could be explained by the fact that thermal energy will be converted into kinetic energy and this transformation is larger in the turbulent mode. The reduction in the wall boundary layer with the heat flux could be explained by the increase in the rates of mixture and diffusivity because of the increases in convective currents.

Gaseous energy sources, like natural and bio gas should become an essential fundament as fuel, which offer lower CO 2 and pollutant emission even because of their chemical composition, higher energy density and knocking resistance. The research within the project CNG600 was focused on the development of a monofucl CNG standard van with an operation range of more than 600 km. The use of new simulation and experimental methods, the optimization of the manual gear shift powertrain, application of a light weight storage system and new gas valve technology lead to extremely low CO 2 emission of about 120 g/km. The gas system of the vehicle was developed for monofucl operation. The methane storage system was extended, which resulted in increased fuel mass in the vehicle. The application of low weight pressure vessels made of composite materials helped to keep the overall vehicle mass low. The gas system was equipped with a new valve technology and separated in high pressure, middle pressure and low pressure sections resulting in an overall optimized system for an automotive application. The vehicle longitudinal performance and fuel consumption were simulated during the development process. Consequently, necessary drive train improvements were defined to ensure lower fuel consumptions in city as well as on highway driving routes. In order to support the fuel efficiency of the propulsion system by low power demand of the vehicle, driving resistance minimization measures were implemented as well. The developed concept was applied on a standard van and realized as prototype. Finally, real world measurements conducted with the prototype vehicle on different driving routes supported the validation of the expected results. Under different driving conditions the CO 2 emissions stayed on a very low level.","CNG-Vehicle; Monofuel; Real-world; Simulation","Automotive applications; Chemical compositions; CNG-Vehicle; Development process; Drive train; Driving conditions; Energy source; European Countries; Experimental methods; Fuel efficiency; Fuel mass; Gas systems; Gas valves; Gear-shifts; High pressure; Higher energy density; Light weight; Low level; Low Power; Low pressures; Methane storage; Monofuel; Operation range; Optimized system; Pollutant emission; Propulsion system; Prototype vehicles; Real-world; Simulation; Storage systems; Valve technology; Vehicle mass; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Fuel consumption; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866095303

Unlike conventional gasoline tanks, a hydrogen fuel storage system is more complex in operation and requires a very sensitive monitoring and control electronics. The operation within an automotive environment adds new challenges to the established industrial standards. This paper presents the topic from a systematic point of view. Actually, hydrogen will be mainly stored either as highly compressed gas or as cryogenic liquid at very low temperatures. Additionally to the auxiliary components it also includes an electronic control unit (ECU) for monitoring the fuel level, temperatures and pressures at various locations and for controlling valves and feed pumps, where applicable. Moreover, this ECU interacts with the central control unit of the engine or the central gateway over a CAN-Bus line. The use of electrical power in the (possible) presence of a hydrogen-air mixture imposes a safety-thread unless appropriate precautions arc made. All sensor interfaces have to be designed according to the guidelines for intrinsic safety. The general approach and also practical solutions will be presented. Some parts of the electronic instrumentation may be critical for a safe operation of the storage systems. In case of a liquid hydrogen tank, the maximum fuel level must not be exceeded. These functions have to be handled with respect to the appropriate safety integrity level (SIL), as described in IEC 61508. The paper deals with these safety aspects and outlines requirements and solutions in conjunction with the automotive environment. Several sensor elements only deliver small output amplitudes and may encounter ESD and EMI interferences. Moreover, the sensor interfaces act as safety barriers according to the regulations for intrinsically safe (Ex-i) circuit design. EMI / EMC filters and safety barriers arc required but interfere with the sensor signals. By developing an advanced circuitry, these influences arc minimized and the electronics fulfils its accuracy requirements over the full automotive temperature range and for a minimum life time of ten years. Electrical functions, dependability and functional safety aspects pose challenges on the hardware and software design. In addition to them, a basically competitive design is a must for series production. While the paper focuses on the research aspects and the presentation of practical solutions, it also aims at presenting the design flow and the functional and regulatory boundary conditions.","Electronics; Hydrogen; Instrumentation; Safety; Storage","Automotive environment; Automotive hydrogen storage system; CAN bus; Central control; Circuit designs; Compressed gas; Controlling valves; Conventional gasoline; Design flows; Electrical power; Electronic control units; Electronic instrumentation; Feed pumps; Fuel levels; Fuel storage systems; Functional Safety; General approach; Hardware and software; Hydrogen-air mixture; IEC 61508; Industrial standards; Instrumentation; Intrinsic safety; Intrinsically safe; Life-times; Liquid hydrogen tanks; Monitoring and control; Practical solutions; Safe operation; Safety aspects; Safety barriers; Safety integrity levels; Sensor elements; Sensor interface; Sensor signals; Series production; Storage systems; Temperature range; Very low temperatures; Accident prevention; Cryogenic liquids; Electronic equipment; Energy storage; Fuel storage; Fuel tanks; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Liquefied gases; Sensors; Safety engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866069165

So with the growing number of LNG facilities in worldwide, many new technical personnel are becoming involved in applying and interpreting LNG standards and regulations. In this paper, we will examine each of the major standards and regulations pertinent to LNG facilities.We will also make recommendations regarding steps that we believe facility operators should take. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Liquefied natural gas; LNG; Safety; Terminal","Codes and standards; Energy security; Technical personnel; Accident prevention; Energy policy; Gas fuel purification; Gas supply; Natural gas transportation; Ocean engineering; Standards; Terminals (electric); Waterway transportation; Liquefied natural gas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859998703

This paper presents a new methodological approach for the preliminary design of a Renewable Energy (RE) power plant, primarily aimed at meeting the energy requirements of a Reverse Osmosis desalination unit. The design of the power plant's components involves the calculation of the installed capacity of each RE component (Photovoltaics and Wind Energy Conversion Systems), the size of the energy storage system (Battery), and required auxiliary energy sources (Diesel Consumption). The sizing of the two RE components and the calculation of the corresponding energy production is performed using a simplified mathematical model for the diurnal variation of wind speed and solar radiation. The overall approach is applied for the rapid sizing of components and the estimation of auxiliary energy supply needed for a medium-sized desalination unit in Tunisia, and is complemented with a preliminary economic assessment of the power plant costs.","Desalination; Photovoltaics; Renewable Energy Sources; Reverse Osmosis; Wind power","Alternative energy; Auxiliary energy; Desalination units; Diesel consumption; Diurnal variation; Economic assessments; Energy productions; Energy requirements; Energy storage systems; Hybrid power plants; Installed capacity; Methodological approach; Photovoltaics; Power components; Preliminary design; Remote areas; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Reverse osmosis desalination; Simplified mathematical model; Tunisia; Wind energy conversion system; Wind speed; Decision making; Desalination; Energy resources; Environmental technology; Information technology; Mathematical models; Natural resources; Photovoltaic effects; Reverse osmosis; Sun; Water filtration; Wind power; Power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858327145

To overcome this problem in electrical circuits, the alternative paradigm of power-shaping control was introduced in (Ortega et al., 2003)-where, as suggested by its name, stabilization is achieved shaping a function akin to power instead of the energy function. In a previous work (Garcia-Canseco et al., 2006) we have extended this technique to general nonlinear systems. The method relies on the solution of a PDE, which identifies the open-loop storage function. Despite the intrinsic difficulty of solving PDEs, we show through some physical examples, that the power-shaping methodology yields storage functions corresponding to the power of the system. To motivate the application of this control technique beyond the realm of electrical circuits, we illustrate the procedure with two case studies: a micro-electromechanical system and a two-tank system.

Since the discovery of SEUs at aircraft altitudes, researchers have made significant efforts to monitor the environment. The space and the earth environment contain various ionizing radiations, generated by natural phenomena such as sun activity and manmade radiation that interacts with silicon atoms. If, at ground level, neutrons and alpha particles are the most frequent causes of SEUs, in a space environment, they are protons and heavy ions. When a particle hits the surface of a silicon area, it loses its energy through the production of free electron-hole pairs, resulting in a dense ionized track in the struck region [2]. Interestingly, when the struck silicon area implements a static memory cell, the transient pulse may induce permanent changes: it can indeed activate the inversion of the stored value. In SRAM-based FPGAs, transient faults originating in the FPGAs configuration memory have dramatic effects since the circuits the FPGAs implement are totally controlled by the content of the configuration memory, which is composed of static RAM cells [3, 4]. In this chapter, the effects of the SEUs within the configuration memory of SRAM-based FPGAs will be accurately described, thanks to the graph model presented in the previous chapter, the effects of SEUs within the internal FPGA's resources is modeled and analyzed. © 2008 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.",,"Configuration memory; Earth environment; Electron hole pairs; Electronic circuits; Graph model; Ground level; Modeling and simulation; Natural phenomena; Silicon area; Silicon atoms; Single event upsets; Space environment; Static memory; Transient effect; Transient faults; Transient pulse; Computer control systems; Computer simulation; Earth (planet); Electronic equipment; Ionizing radiation; Radiation shielding; Radioactivity; Static random access storage; Systems analysis; Radiation effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955866393

Technologists in most nuclear industries believe that their wastes can be managed, stored and disposed of in a non-hazardous manner. On the other hand, society remains confused and concerned about its safety, isolation, security and potential long-term impact. During my time at Oxford (1997 to 2000) I set out to demonstrate the technology for safe disposal of radioactive waste and found that the topic is as much sociological as it is technological. This presentation will look briefly at the outcome of that research and apply it to our potential nuclear waste. Globally, progress is being made for the disposal of radioactive waste and for public acceptance of those policies. Finland is leading the way; however, there are many countries still tied for 'dunce of the class'. I believe that the model for Australia's low level radioactive waste (LLW) disposal is already in place. For the disposal of intermediate level waste (ILW) and high level waste (HLW), a single interim storage site leading to a deep geological disposal should finally be acceptable. For public acceptance, though, the facilities will need to demonstrate that, for a time, the process can be reversible if necessary. The possible geo-sequestration of gaseous waste extends the public interest in deep geological disposal, with some saying that they are not confident that the CO2 will stay down there forever - fossil fuel burners, welcome to the real world! Clearly society is yet to trust long-term geological disposal - but there is a way through this, at least for solid waste. For gaseous and liquid waste we have a little way to go and need to work on both the technology and sociology.",,"Australia; Deep geological disposals; Finland; Geological disposals; High level wastes; Intermediate levels; Liquid wastes; Nuclear powers; Nuclear waste disposals; Nuclear wastes; Public acceptances; Public interests; Real worlds; Safe disposals; Storage sites; Actinides; Carbon dioxide; Energy conversion; Fossil fuels; Industrial waste treatment; Nuclear energy; Nuclear industry; Radioactive materials; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Solid wastes; Transuranium elements; Uranium; Waste disposal; Radioactive waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650420745

A well-designed refrigerator provides low energy consumption and noise, have low price and large capacity of storage. Improving of the evaporator heat transfer performance is one of the most important ways for reducing the energy consumption. Therefore, this study performs determination of the influences of the fin spacing and air velocity on heat transfer coefficient, cooling capacity and pressure drop of airside of the evaporator in order to improve the energy efficiency of refrigerator. The evaporator is modeled numerically and several simulations have been done to find airside thermohydraulic performance. The airflow is assumed to be incompressible, Newtonian and laminar under the constant wall temperature boundary conditions on external surfaces of the evaporator pipes. From the numerical results, when the fin spacing is increased, the airside heat transfer coefficient is increased but heat transfer is decreased because of less total area. It has been found that as the air inlet velocity increases the heat transfer coefficient increases. The distance between fins of the evaporator is found to have considerable effect on pressure drop. The fin spacing is decreased pressure drop is increased. For provide the required cooling capacity, the most suitable fin spacing is found as 5 mm at velocity of 0,5 m/s. The study provides a comparison between various evaporator constructions at less time with numerical analyze instead of fabricating a prototype that is an expensive application to choose the proper evaporator for the required cooling capacity in the design of the refrigeration system of a refrigerator. ©2008 TIBTD Printed in Turkey.","Evaporator; Fin spacing; Heat exchanger; Heat transfer coefficient; Refrigerating performance","Air inlet; Air velocities; Air-side heat transfer coefficient; Constant wall temperature; Cooling Capacity; External surfaces; Fin spacing; Heat transfer performance; Low energy consumption; Newtonians; Numerical results; Refrigerating performance; Refrigeration system; Standard of living; Thermohydraulic performance; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fins (heat exchange); Heat exchangers; Heat transfer coefficients; Pressure drop; Refrigeration; Refrigerators; Evaporators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78549232515

Furthermore, the proposed SRAM incurs no area overhead, and has comparable read/write performance versus the CV-SRAM.

In this way the second order problem is much simplified as well as the computational effort. However this approximation has some limitations and in particular for the slow drift oscillations problem it may be important to consider correctly the difference frequency components. The paper presents an analysis of the slow drift exciting forces on a FLNG (Floating Production Storage and Offloading system for production of LNG). The complete second order forces arc computed by WAMIT V6.1s which is based on a boundary element method. Results of the horizontal second order drift forces are presented for several difference frequency values.

These two floating modules form the floating fuel storage facility (FFSF). Owing to the small draft when compared to the length dimensions, the zero-draft assumption is commonly adopted in the modeling of very large floating structures (VLFS) as plates for hydroelastic analysis. However, such an assumption is not applicable to the considered floating modules since the effect of draft on the hydroelastic response is significant when the modules are loaded with fuel. A numerical model taking into account the draft effect is hence developed in order to predict correctly the hydroelastic response and hydrodynamic interactions of floating storage modules placed side-by-side. The floating storage modules arc modeled as plates where an improved Mindlin plate element, developed by coupling the reduced integration method and the additional non-conforming modes, is used. Such a plate element does not exhibit spurious modes and shear locking phenomena, thereby making it applicable to both thin and thick plate models. Furthermore, the Mindlin plate theory predicts better stress resultants as compared with its Kirchhoff plate counterpart. The linear wave theory is used to model the water waves. The wave-induced deflections obtained from the numerical model are validated by experimental tests.

Broadly speaking, cache-hierarchy efficiency can be increased either by improving cache management or by reducing the number of load instructions that reach the cache hierarchy. We introduce the notion of zero loads to approach the latter. This paper explores the potential of tracking locations that contain the value 'zero'. Loads directed to such locations - termed Zero Loads - can be cancelled before they are issued in the cache hierarchy. We find that as many as 21% of the loads are Zero Loads and about one third of them are critical, i.e., ends up on the critical memory path for out-of-order cores. Motivated by this observation, we explore two innovative structures to capture Zero Loads by essentially book-keeping earlier visited blocks/locations that return 'zero'. These schemes are shown to be capable of improving performance and power/energy efficiency considerably.

We consider some of these anomalous phenomena restricting our discussions to the effects of nano-size on energetics and transport behaviour, with a few examples to illustrate materials challenges for efficient energy conversion and storage. We show that nano-size affects the thermodynamical aspects due to excess surface contributions giving rise to enhanced cell voltage in lithium batteries. An anomalous electrical conduction occurs at nano-size, its relevance is briefly highlighted in the context of energy conversion using fuel cells and excitonic solar cells. The benefit of narrowly spaced interfaces also results in rapid energy storage due to the reduction of the effective diffusion path. Thus, in the context of storage behaviour, nanocrystalline electrodes exhibit high capacity as well as Coulombic efficiency and in some cases high rate performance. An interfacial lithium storage mechanism which is a consequence of nanocrystallinity has been discussed to explain the extra storage when metal is brought in contact with Li2O/LiF at nanosize. Superior storage performance by supercapacitors and efficient waste heat conversion by thermoelectric devices using nanostructured materials are also briefly highlighted. This review thus emphasises fundamental understanding and novel concepts at nano-size for the development of excellent materials which achieve efficient energy conversion and storage, both of which are vital in facing the challenges posed by global warming and the predicted future limited energy resources. © 2008 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anomalous phenomena; Cell voltages; Coulombic efficiency; Effective diffusion; Electrical conduction; Energy applications; Enhanced surface; Excitonic solar cells; High capacity; High-rate performance; Limited energy resource; Lithium storages; Mobile charge; Nano-size; Nanocrystalline electrodes; Nanocrystallinity; Novel concept; Size effects; Size reductions; Storage performance; Super capacitor; Surface contribution; Thermoelectric devices; Transport behaviour; Transport length; Energy conversion; Fuel cells; Global warming; Lithium; Nanostructured materials; Waste heat; Solar energy; crystallinity; electrical conductivity; energy resource; global warming; lithium; nanotechnology; resource availability; size effect; solar power; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953754161

For example the consumption is five times greater in January than in August. In order to adjust the natural gas ressources to the fluctuating consumption, gas companies store gas underground: the surplus of natural gas received in the summer must be stored so that it can be available when the weather turns cold in the winter. Two techniques of gas storage are used in France: Aquifer storages have large gas capacities Salt storages are used for their high performance. They can react quickly to fluctuations in consumption (in emergency situations or during unexpected short term demand surges) Furthermore, since the European energy market liberalization (in 2000 and 2007), new gas storage uses have appeared. Indeed, the period and the reason of gas use have been modified which has led to increase the number of injection and withdrawal movements during the year. Moreover, the European legislation imposes on storage operators to publish precisely their gas storage capacities. Mainly due to these reasons, GDF SUEZ group is developing the software SITHERGAZ. This software can simulate the daily salt cavity operation and gives the thermodynamical behaviour of the cavity. This behaviour is strongly depending on the process thermal historic. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to take into account the leaching and the dewatering phases as pre-processors. Moreover, the creep effect needs a careful attention since it strongly affects the results. Finally, the need of short time computation is important in order to be useful for the salt cavity storage operators. In this article, we present the constitutive models of SITHERGAZ, the numerical methods employed and finally a comparison between numerical results and measurements from a GDF SUEZ cavity. We show that numerical results closely match in field measurements. However because of the leaching techniques developed by GDF SUEZ, we emphasise that the cavity used for the measurements is in good agreement with the geometrical conditions required by the models.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953702984

All subsequent steps follow on from this choice: the energy conversion technologies and infrastructure required for its optimal use, and the energy habits, social opportunities, and types of business, as well as the settlement and transport structures which result from it. With the evolution of very densely populated urban economic areas and, at the same time, the progressive depletion of domestic sources of primary energy and a growing demand for energy, the conventional energy system has inevitably become ever more concentrated. To highlight a lack of storage possibilities as one of the principal drawbacks of renewable energies, however, is to take a superficial viewpoint. No modern energy supply system can exist without storage, because there is no simultaneity between primary energy generation or harvesting, and final energy use. The use of renewable energies in buildings and in urban planning, and the adaptation of buildings and orientation to the existing natural environment are critical elements in transforming energy supply at municipal level. At the same time urban planning in terms of distances between residential areas, work, recreation, and shopping areas is a key factor in determining transport behavior and hence energy consumption. The decentralized structures through to the Solar City are becoming increasingly attractive, offering diversity and flexibility. While conventional energy supply is a permanent and expensive; solar energy is becoming an autonomous value added factor for the city and its inhabitants. © 2008 Copyright © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In a country like Kuwait, A/C accounts for 85% of power supplied to homes during peak hours and 55% of annual energy consumption by the residential sector. A fuel-cell-based cogeneration system is proposed to improve the efficiency of generating and utilizing power for cooling in residential buildings. Distributed electric power is generated by a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The electricity is used to operate high-efficiency water-cooled chillers in a district-cooling setup, which replaces packaged A/C units typically used for homes. The exhaust fuel and heat from the SOFC operate a gas turbine and an absorption chiller. A thermal energy storage tank is used for storing chilled water to reduce the total capacity of the system and, hence, capital investment. The integrated fuel-cell air-conditioning (FCAC) system improves the cooling-to-fuel efficiency, expressed as coefficient of performance, by 375%. The peak power requirement is reduced by 65% and the total fuel energy is reduced by 58%. An example system of 2 MW delivers 3750 RT (13.2 MW) of cooling to a district. Over a 9-month period, it saves 94 TJ of fuel energy and feeds 5.21 GWh of electricity to the grid as a surplus.

Now it is recognized as a multifunctional organ involved in the production of hormones, growth factors and cytokines named adipokines. In obese subject the production of adipokines is impaired. In obesity high level of leptin, resistin, and low level of adiponectin have been observed and implicated in insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome. In patients with established coronary atherosclerosis increased body weight is an independent predictor of an acute coronary syndrome. The exact mechanism of obesity induced coronary heart disease is not fully elucidated. Current research is aimed to determine links between adipokines and coronary heart disease. Leptin, adiponectin and resistin are adipokines that are implicated in coronary endothelial dysfunction, trombogenesis and inflammation. These processes are known to precipitate atherosclerotic plaque rupture and acute coronary syndrome. Recent studies demonstrated that high plasma leptin and low adiponectin levels as observed in obese subjects impair coronary acetylcholine-mediated vasodilatation in vitro and in vivo. Resistin also impair coronary vasodilatation but via brady-kinin pathway. Leptin and resistin show proinflammatory effects upregulating cytokine production in macrophages and might lead to destabilization of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. Leptin has been observed to stimulate angiogenesis, platelet aggregation, and atherothrombosis in obese human. In obese subject the production of adiponectin, which has protective effects on coronary blood vessels is suppressed.

As a developing country, South Africa has met challenges associated with economic growth. Such challenges include increased energy demand, exploring alternative sources of energy, trying to reduce carbon emissions and its associated environmental impacts. South Africa is embarking on the expansion of the Nuclear Energy Program. It has developed legislation for this expansion to take place in an organized, transparent and responsible manner. Some of the strategic actions that the government is planning are uranium mining and milling, conversion, enrichment, fuel fabrication and power generation. All these will impact highly on the generation of radioactive waste and will therefore require rigorous waste management planning. To try and address the associated impacts South Africa is in the process of establishing the National Radioactive Waste Management Agency. The guiding principles for the establishment of this Agency include: 4. Transparency and openness to the public A. Involvement of stakeholders 4 Polluter pays principle A Sound decision making based on scientific information, risk analysis and optimisation of resources The Agency will oversee the implementation of the National Radioactive Waste Management Strategy. The Strategy covers the total life cycle of waste management from generation through institutional control to disposal. This national commitment provides future generations with freedom of choice and builds confidence that all radioactive waste disposal options have been thoroughly investigated. The following hierarchy of the waste management options shall be followed wherever practicable: 4 Radioactive waste avoidance and minimization 4.

While these wastes will be stored in temporary facilities, it is envisaged that final disposal will take place in a deep geological repository. Radiation safety of long-lived high and medium level waste disposal is of central importance for Ukraine today since considerable amount of waste from the Chernobyl accident, ""Shelter"" object's radioactive waste and fuel-containing materials and power industry wastes have been accumulated at the storage sites. Disposal of such wastes in geological repositories in deep stable formations is recognized to be the most foolproof method excluding radioactive waste penetration into environment over thousands of years. To solve the problem of radioactive waste disposal in geological repositories, the first-priority tasks are the following: implementation of regulatory and legal framework for managing radioactive waste to be disposed of in deep geological formations, and develop a regulation to govern the general provisions on safe disposal of radioactive waste in geological repositories. National legal regulation system of nuclear and radiation safety for radioactive waste geological disposal is to be developed in Ukraine. The first document of this kind is General Regulations for Safe Radioactive Waste Disposal in Geological Repositories"" entered at Ministry of Justice of Ukraine on 11/06/2007. The provisions of this document are based on principles and requirements of IAEA and ICRP, consider national and foreign experience gained at radioactive waste management objects. This document consists of four clauses. The first one ""General Provisions ""presents the aim, the field of application and general characteristics of the object. Principles of Safe Disposal of Radioactive Waste in Geological Repositories"" describes the manner of radioactive waste management: environmental and population health protection now and in future not imposing excessive load on the future generations, prevention of the repository's impact outside the national territory and holding on principles of radiological protection of population. Requirements for Safe Radioactive Waste Disposal in Geological Repositories"" consists of several sub-clauses containing general requirements to accident prevention at various stages of the repository's flfe cycle - site selection, designing, construction, operation and shutdown. In the clauses devoted to implementation of the aims, the rpiain attention is paid to safety evaluation ensuring the protection level for the personnel, population and environment provided by regulations, rules and standards for nuclear and radiation safety as well as necessary technical decision support etc. The clause ""Quality Assurance"" comprises a complex of stage-by-stage measures directed at control of meeting the safety conditions in site selection, designing, construction, operation and shutdown. Implementation of the document will allow improving of the present radioactive waste management methods and creation on this basis of independent documents on site-seleclion, designing and construction of the geological repository.

Different solvent-to-waste ratios by weight were used to determine the optimum process. The mixture was then filtered, and solvent was recovered from the filtrate through distillation. The extraction and filtration steps were at ambient temperature. The recovered fuel oil was analyzed for fuel charactistics. The maximum recovery of fuel oil occurred with a four-to-one ratio of MEK to sludge. Thirty-nine percent of the sludge mass was recovered as fuel oil using this system. On analysis, the recovered fuel oil was similar to typical fuel oils, except for elevated levels of carbon residue and sulfur. This solvent extraction process can be implemented as a continuous process to reduce the amounts of waste oil-based sludge, while recovering valuable fuel oil. Copyright 2008.

The primary objective is to validate and verify numerical models used to design more efficient cryogenic storage tanks for use in long-duration space missions. A key challenge of the experiment is to characterize and control the fluid flow and energy balance in the experiment system so they can be used for boundary conditions in the models. In this manner the performance of the numerical models can be directly compared to experimental results in microgravity and improved to extrapolate beyond the experimental boundaries. To date, a ground-based breadboard system has been developed with the primary objective of verifying flight concepts in the areas of fabrication and thermal performance. The breadboard consists of an acrylic fluid test tank that is thermally isolated from the outside environment. Heaters on the tank introduce controlled energy into the fluid, a room temperature refrigerant used as a cryogenic fluid simulant, whose temperature and pressure rise is accurately measured over time. A mechanically pumped fluid loop circulates the refrigerant in the chamber to distribute heat and control pressure, and velocity flow fields are measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The test tank is constructed of stainless steel and acrylic materials. The transparent acrylic portion of the tank allows velocity flow field measurements, at rates of 1 μm/s to 2 mm/s using PIV. The lower stainless steel portion of the test tank provides a structural mounting platform while facilitating the installation of fluid fittings and a pressure transducer. The test tank is mounted within a sealed vacuum jacket to limit convective and radiative heat transfer. The enclosure is constructed of aerospace grade aluminum that has been electroless nickel coated. The internal surfaces have been highly polished for low emissivity to reduce radiative coupling between the test tank and vacuum enclosure; temperature matching the jacket to the tank further reduces the radiative heat loss. Hermetic connections provide fluid line and sensor access to the test tank. Strip heaters mounted to the test tank and vacuum enclosure allow precise power input. Eighty-seven high precision RTDs are mounted internally and externally to the test tank and vacuum jacket to provide a detailed mapping of the system's thermal profile.","Cryogenic storage; Microgravity experiment; Pressure control; Zero boil-off technology","Acrylic material; Control pressure; Cryogenic fluids; Cryogenic storage; Cryogenic storage tank; Electroless nickel; Experiment system; Fluid flow; Fluid lines; Fluid tests; Ground based; High precision; Internal surfaces; Mechanically pumped; Microgravity experiment; Numerical models; Particle image velocimetries; Power input; Pressure rise; Primary objective; Radiative coupling; Radiative heat loss; Radiative heat transfer; Room temperature; Space missions; Temperature matching; Thermal Performance; Thermal profiles; Vacuum enclosure; Vacuum jackets; Velocity flow; Zero boil offs; Zero boil-off technology; Alumina; Cryogenics; Earth (planet); Enclosures; Flow fields; Flow visualization; Fluids; Microgravity; Microgravity processing; Numerical methods; Pressure control; Refrigerants; Stainless steel; Tanks (containers); Testing; Transducers; Vacuum; Experiments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349380300

That's why their dynamics cannot be ignored. On the basis of the accepted and critically clarified assumptions, a linearized mathematical model of the recuperative counter flow heat exchanger has been derived, taking into account the wall dynamics. The model is based on the fundamental law of energy conservation, covers all heat accumulation storages in the process, and leads to the set of partial differential equations, which solution is not possible in closed form. In order to overcome the solution difficulties, the procedure of differential discrete modelling is applied, leading to the set of ordinary differential equations of a rather high order. These equations are transformed into the state space form suitable for the Matlab environment. The experimental investigations were made, putting some different typical input variables. Specifying the input temperatures and output variables, under the constant initial conditions, the step transient responses have been simulated and presented in graphic form for the particular positions in the heat exchanger in order to compare these results with the experimental data collected from the real process.

The most promising technologies for CCS are: oxy-fuel (O-F) combustion, pre-combustion capture, and post-combustion capture. This paper discusses the recent work conducted by Siemens Power Generation, Florida Turbine Technologies, Inc. (FTT) and Clean Energy Systems, Inc. (CES) in adapting high temperature gas turbines to use CES's drive gases in high-efficiency O-F zero emission power plants (ZEPPs). CES's O-F cycle features high-pressure combustion of fuel with oxygen (O2) in the presence of recycled coolant (water, steam or CO 2) to produce drive gases composed predominantly of steam and CO 2. This cycle provides the unique capability to capture nearly pure CO2 and trace by-products by simple condensation of the steam.An attractive O-F power cycle uses high, intermediate and low pressure turbines (HPT, IPT and LPT, respectively). The HPT may be based on either current commercial or advanced steam turbine technology. Low pressure steam turbine technology is readily applicable to the LPT. To achieve high efficiencies, an IPT is necessary and efficiency increases with inlet temperature. The high-temperature IPT's necessitate advanced turbine materials and cooling technology. O-F plants have an abundance of water, cool steam ̃200°C (400°F) and CO2 that can be used as cooling fluids within the combustor and IPT systems. For the ""First Generation"" ZEPP, a General Electric J79 turbine, minus the compressor, to be driven directly by CES's 170 MW, high-pressure oxy-fuel combustor (gas generator), has been adapted. A modest inlet gas temperature of 760°C (MOOT) was selected to eliminate the need for turbine cooling. The J79 turbine operating on natural gas delivers 32 MWe and incorporates a single-stage free-turbine that generates an additional 11 MWe. When an HPT and an LPT are added, the net output power (accounting for losses) becomes 60 MWe at 30% efficiency based on lower heating value (LHV), including the parasitic loads for O2 separation and compression and for CO2 capture and compression to 151.5 bar (2200 psia). For an inlet temperature of 927°C (1700°F), the nominal value, the net output power is 70 MWe at 34% efficiency (LHV). FTT and CES are evaluating a ""Second Generation"" IPT with a gas inlet temperature of 1260°C (2300°F). Predicted performance values for these plants incorporating the HPT, IPT and the LPT are: output power of approximately 100-200 MWe with an efficiency of 40 to 45%. The ""Third Generation"" IPT for 2015+ power plants will be based on the development of very high temperature turbines having an inlet temperature goal of 1760°C (3200°F). Recent DOE/CES studies project such plants will have LHV efficiencies in the 50% range for natural gas and HHV efficiencies near 40% for gasified coal[1].

This is primarily motivated by regulations following a growing awareness regarding the potential impact of climate-change, and partly the opportunities for use of carbon-dioxide (CO2) with enhanced oil recovery (EOR). However there remain significant technology, engineering, investment and political barriers that need to be overcome before CCS can be accepted as commercially mature for the power generation industry and the finance community. The risk with early projects is high, while collaboration and trust between government, industry and investors will also be needed to commercialize the technology. With an emerging sense of urgency regarding a global consensus for tackling climate-change, one also observes that technology pathways are integrated with political agendas and it becomes important to roadmap a commercial strategy for the respective technologies taking account of government requirements for compromise and burden sharing. To some extent this can also impact on comparative choices for the most cost-effective technologies that are supported through to future commercial deployment. The situation is complicated by the fact that technology choice-be it pre-combustion, post-combustion or oxy-combustion-remains an open question, where parties are probably influenced by their historical expertise, available hardware and near-term perception of future carbon challenge. The fact that energy, materials and engineering costs have been escalating rapidly while there is also a fundamental paradigm change occurring, somewhat undermines the use of historical data and past experience to predict business opportunities for the future. Within this context the paper considers on-going carbon market evolution in three regions, namely Texas, North Europe and Canada, seen from a technology and project developer perspective. The paper applies updated project engineering costs for capture from natural gas (NG) and coal using post- and oxy-combustion technology. Under all circumstances projects still exhibit poor economic return on invested capital and depend on government participation; they therefore remain unattractive to the investment community. But perhaps more important is the current perception of technology and market risk which also appears to undermine motivation to make significant commitments when evaluating projects within the old paradigm. However such a situation is not politically sustainable and a new paradigm must emerge. This will occur through regulation and significant changes in pricing in the energy and commodity market-including valuation of captured and avoided CO2. And this will also impact on the relative merits of various technology options. For the time being these discussion and results are only indicative of how a new paradigm and evolving technology may become ""game-changing"", but the paper does attempt to provide some foresight into future opportunities.

In the proposed topology only a simple voltage control loop ensures that the output voltage is regulated against load changes as well as input supply variations and the current control loop is not used to correct the input currents.

This is the case when a sink of information, or a gateway, is only occasionally present in the network. We consider a network consisting of a set of motes that in order to save energy independently of each other go into offline mode, switching theirs radios off. We propose a cooperative mechanism for distributed data storage that allows complete data retrieval with high probability. Reliable data retrieval is crucial for data-critical applications. Reliability is achieved by introducing redundancy in the system by applying Reed-Solomon scheme for data encoding. This solution can tolerate the situation where a certain number of devices in the sensor cluster is unavailable at the moment of information retrieval. A probabilistic analytical model is developed to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm. This model is verified by simulation and prototype testing. Prototyping is done on the OpenSensor platform developed at Aalborg University. Performance results indicate that the proposed cooperative data distribution method outperforms the non-cooperative one. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Aalborg University; Cooperative mechanisms; Critical applications; Data distribution; Data encoding; Data retrieval; Distributed data; High probability; Information storage; Measured data; Non-cooperative; Offline modes; Probabilistic analytical models; Prototype testing; Prototyping; Reed solomon; Save energy; Sensor cluster; Algorithms; Data storage equipment; Gateways (computer networks); Information services; Redundancy; Sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650233709

But almost none of these MAC protocols, except a few, have addressed mobility in their structure which poses many new challenges to the MAC concept in wireless sensor networks. This paper collaborates on a little enhancement on MS-MAC, a mobility adaptive MAC protocol, in WSN. The MS-MAC protocol handles mobility by proactively increasing the frequency of the Sync period inside the active zone. However this increase is based on a static approach which forms the active zone with a constant value of R and appears to be problematic when the border node becomes mobile as well. In this paper we aim at optimizing the value of R by dynamically increasing or decreasing it according to the distance the border node takes from the border region. We expect that this dynamic approach increases the energy efficiency by preventing the nodes inside the virtual clusters going into the active zone unnecessarily but yet at the cost of an increased latency. © 2008 IEEE.","Active Zone; MAC; Mobility Prediction Energy Efficiency; Wireless Sensor Network","Active Zone; Adaptive MAC; Design Principles; Intensive research; MAC; MAC protocol; MAC protocol design; Mobility Prediction Energy Efficiency; Performance parameters; Static approach; Trade off; Virtual clusters; Bit error rate; Computational fluid dynamics; Energy efficiency; Image storage tubes; Network performance; Routing protocols; Sensor networks; Systems engineering; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650177981

The aim of this experimental and theoretical study is to have a better understanding of the instability phenomena occurring in cryogenic liquids under storage conditions. The thermodynamic model we developed in this study, describing both the Interfacial thermal boundary layer and the wall boundary layer, is based on the experimental data at the laboratory scale. Experimental study gives a better indication on the evaporation mechanism of the stored liquid near the evaporative surface region. The temperature difference between the surface and the bulk liquid for various absorptive heat flows resulting in different rate of evaporation was measured for a cryogenic liquid stored. Theoretical study devoted to the free convection theory by using the integral approach including the coupling of dynamic and thermal phenomena gives the temperature and velocity profiles in laminar and turbulent wall boundary layers at various wall heat flux as well as the evolution of the thickness of the interfacial boundary layer as a function of the evaporated mass flow. © 2008 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Boundary layer; Liguid nitrogen; Modelling; Natural convection; Storage","Convective heat transfer; Integral approach; Interfacial boundary; Low temperature storage tanks; Temperature differences; Thermal boundary layer; Thermal phenomena; Thermodynamic model; Boiling liquids; Boundary layers; Cryogenic liquids; Energy storage; Evaporation; Heat flux; Liquid nitrogen; Models; Natural convection; Digital storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649243968

Using nanoporous carbon periodic supercells with 216 atoms and 50 % porosity, constructed with a novel ab initio approach devised by us, the dangling bonds of the carbon atoms were first saturated with hydrogen, then relaxed and its total energy calculated with and without hydrogen. Next the same number of hydrogen atoms, in molecular form, was randomly placed within the pore of the pure carbon supercell, then the sample relaxed, and finally its total energy calculated, also with and without hydrogens. From these results the average energy per hydrogen atom is obtained for both cases.

These will be the highest energy collisions in a controlled environment to-date. The first single beam circulated on the 10th of September 2008, while the first collisions are expected for Spring 2009. The ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) system selects events online in a three level trigger system in order to keep those events promising to unveil new physics at a budgeted rate of• 200 Hz for an event size of• 1.5 MB. This paper focuses on the data-logging system on the TDAQ side, the so-called ""Sub-Farm Output"" (SFO) system. It takes data from the third level trigger, and it streams and indexes the events into different files, according to each event's trigger path. The data files are moved to CASTOR, the central mass storage facility at CERN. We report first on the functionality and performance requirements on the system and describe the solution we opted for; to use a small farm of commercial PCs with 3 RAID controllers on each. The data-acquisition software application running on these PCs has been designed to take maximum advantage of the independent RAID controllers, allowing fast I/O. Together with a high speed network, this minimizes the size of the needed farm. Finally we focus on the behaviour of the full data-logging system during the ""continuous ATLAS data-taking mode"" with cosmics since August 2008 and the first beam events, since performance and reliability will be of equal importance during the physics datataking period. ©2008 IEEE.",,"ATLAS experiment; Centre of mass; Controlled environment; Cosmics; Data files; Data-logging; Energy collisions; Large Hadron Collider; Mass storage; New physics; Performance requirements; RAID controllers; Single beam; Software applications; Third level; Trigger and data acquisition; Trigger systems; Colliding beam accelerators; Farms; Harvesting; Logging (forestry); Tellurium compounds; Mergers and acquisitions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649216842

Nanocrystal memories, utilizing the Coulomb blockade effect, have the potential to satisfy such a requirement. The primary motivation in the use of nanocrystal memories is the potential to scale the tunnel dielectric thickness to a small dimension, resulting in lower program and erase voltages during operation. By using nanocrystal charge storage sites that are electrically isolated, charge leakage through localized oxide defects can be reduced, even with the use of a thin tunnel dielectric.

In essence, a Micro-grid consists of bundled renewable micro sources and loads connected together by fast acting power electronics. Energy storage and low-bandwidth supervisory control is often added. The combined unit on aggregate can appear to the main network as a 'model citizen'. A low-voltage distribution network is a four-wire system and single phase loads and sources can conceivably be connected. The objective of this paper is to show how current balancing control can be achieved in addition to real and reactive power control. Means to perform current sharing are discussed and a solution to achieve balanced currents is presented and simulated. © 2008 IEEE.","Micro-grid; Phase locked loop (PLL); Renewable energy; Voltage source converter (VSC)","Combined units; Current-sharing; Distribution networks; Four-wire systems; Low bandwidths; Low-voltage distribution networks; Micro-grid; Phase locked loop (PLL); Real and reactive power; Renewable energy; Renewable energy generations; Single-phase loads; Supervisory controls; Voltage source converter (VSC); Distributed parameter networks; Distribution of goods; Information systems; Mesh generation; Phase locked loops; Phase shift; Power converters; Power electronics; Power quality; Reactive power; Voltage distribution measurement; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64949164272

The dependence of capacitance and package size on peak current has also been studied. The larger the capacitance, the higher the peak discharge current and the greater the discharge energy. The peak current also increases with package area and saturates at the device with package area over 250mm2. The standard CDM testing usually provides three-pulse positive and negative testing to verify the ESD-withstand voltage of a product for reliability testing. This voltage typically relates to internal factors such as product capacitance, protection circuit design and technology. However, pulse repetition and stress level also affect the ESD sensitivity of a device. The comparison between CDM-withstand stress level and repeatability of memory products is presented. The withstand voltage of a product is 1000V with 1+/- stress pulse, whereas it is 750V with 3+/- stress pulses and 500V with 10+/- stress pulses. The CDM-withstand level decreases with stress pulse repetition. The electrical test yield of memory product after CDM stress test is reported. It is proposed that not only stress level but also the repetition of the testing pulse influence an electrical test yield. © 2008 IEEE.","CDM; ESD; Pulse repeatability; Stress level; Withstand voltage","CDM; ESD; Pulse repeatability; Stress level; Withstand voltage; Capacitance; Electric insulation testing; Electric insulators; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatic discharge; Random access storage; Reliability; Testing; Continuum damage mechanics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64549152851

It was observed that distributed fault recovery increases 98% the average delivery rate and that duplication of storage responsibility minimizes the message loss. Its congestion control differentiates communication losses from buffer overflow. CTCP is called collaborative because all nodes detect and act on congestion control and also because it includes distributed storage responsibility. It is scalable and independent of the underlying network layer.

In addition, the device may also be used to compensate current harmonics of nonlinear loads. Since the maximum amplitude variations in the supply currents become minimized, the compensator provides a possibility for power rating reduction of the transmission system. The compensator consists of a shunt active filter and a supercapacitor (SC) bank energy storage coupled to the system dc link via a bidirectional 3-phase dcdc converter. The purpose of the equipment is to draw steady average power from the mains and to compensate the power fluctuations demanded by the load with the energy stored in the SC bank. In basic steady state operation the SC is discharged when the load power is greater than the average power. Correspondingly, the SC is charged from the mains when the load power is smaller than the average power. The control of the system is based on the p-q theory and the functionality of the system is verified by computer simulations with Matlab Simulink in a 250 kW stone crusher application. The simulation results show that the power fluctuations of the load are effectively reduced and the harmful causes, such as voltage flicker at the PCC, are expected to decrease substantially. ©2008 IEEE.","Active power filter; Energy storaging; Power conditioning; Supercapacitor","Active filters; Capacitors; DC generators; Electric fault currents; Electric load forecasting; Energy storage; Flywheels; MATLAB; Power converters; Active power filter; Average power; Current harmonics; Dc-links; Energy storaging; Fluctuating loads; High-power; Load power; Matlab-SIMULINK; Maximum amplitudes; Non-linear loads; P-q theories; Power compensators; Power conditioning; Power fluctuations; Power ratings; Shunt active filters; Simulation results; Steady-state operations; Supercapacitor; Supply currents; Transmission systems; Utility grids; Voltage flickers; Voltage fluctuations; Electric power transmission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63049131381

These are, following the time line: Conventional Feet (CF), Energy-Storing-and- Returning (ESR) feet, and recent socalled 'bionic' feet. Research studies have shown enhanced performance properties of ESR feet compared to early CF. However, even with the advanced technology today, none of the ESR feet is capable of significantly reducing energy cost of walking or enhancing amputee's gait pattern [1]. From the 1990s gradually more attention has been paid to the incorporation of active elements in prosthetics as passive devices are not capable of providing the amputee with sufficient ankle power during gait. Most of these bionic devices are still on research level nowadays but one can expect that they will become available on the market soon. In this paper, the evolution of prosthetic feet over the last two decades is reflected. The importance of mimicking human ankle biomechanics in prosthetic foot design is discussed.

The hybrid power system consists of battery and ultracapacitor (UC). It can be expected that the improvement of system efficiency and the long duration period of the energy storage can be achieved by using battery as a main storage and UC as an auxiliary source. UC are electrical energy storage devices which have dynamics features of high power density, very fast power recycling capability and have mechanical robustness. In a short term power applications, this type of energy storage system is widely used for improving power consumption especially when charge and discharge time recovery are critical. However the voltage offer by UC is depending on their operating condition. Thus a power dc-dc converter is required as well as high dynamics control technique should be selected to get the best operating of UC. Therefore in this paper the new fuzzy control technique is being used to control the power flow of UC to supply the transient power demand for a proposed hybrid system. The bidirectional DC-DC converter is used to connect the UC with the battery for the controlled instantaneous electric power flow. The proposed control technique applied in this hybrid system has been verified by the simulation during various condition of the load.©2008 IEEE.","Battery; DC-DC converter; Fuzzy controller; Ultracapacitor","Capacitors; Competition; Control system stability; DC-DC converters; Electric grounding; Electric power measurement; Energy storage; Flywheels; HVDC power transmission; Hybrid computers; Land vehicle propulsion; Ultrasonics; Vibrations (mechanical); Auxiliary sources; Battery; Bidirectional dc-dc converters; Charge and discharges; Control techniques; DC-DC converter; Electric power; Electrical energies; Energy storage systems; Fuzzy controller; High dynamics controls; High power densities; Hybrid energy systems; Hybrid power; Hybrid power systems; Improving power; Long durations; Mechanical robustness; Operating conditions; Power applications; Power DC-DC converters; Power demands; Power flows; Recycling capabilities; Short terms; System efficiencies; Ultracapacitor; Fuzzy control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63049095685

Moreover, most of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, are uncertain and uncontroable. In order to overcome these drawbacks, the rejected energy can be applied to pumped storage power plants and reutilized via hydro-turbines when needed. Optimal sizing of such power plants is crucial in enhancing the recovery of the rejected energy. In this paper, optimal sizing of pumped storage power plants for increasing the penetration of renewable energies are studied. Both technical and economical aspects are considered.

The proposed system is a new concept of small-compressed air energy storage (S-CAES) integrated with induction generator. The system consists of 3 main components: air compressor, energy storage system and power generation. The air compressor uses a general reciprocating engine that produces a compressed air. It is stored in pressurized vessels. The energy storage system uses S-CAES, which is developed as a small volume and installed above ground to avoid the site limitation as the conventional CAES does. Therefore, it can be located in any location. The S-CAES system is operated in low pressure that not more than 10 bar, so, it easy to available component in country and inexpensive. The induction generator (IG) is used in power generation, which does not have combustion units as the conventional CAES that used gas turbine. Thus, the system does not burn fuel and exhaust pollution.

However, in order to provide power demand of a residential load, it may be required to over design fuel cell power module which is not economically advisable. Furthermore, due to the sluggish dynamic response of fuel cell in transient events, there will be load following problem. In such cases, it is recommended to combine fuel cell with other electrical energy storage devices to satisfy sustained load demand and transient events. While batteries have low power densities and limited lifetime in highly cyclic application, ultracapacitors can be used. An ultracapacitor (UC) bank can supply a large burst of power but cannot store much energy. By operating the FC and UC in parallel, both steady state and peak power demands can be satisfied.

A computing program was used to find the optimized time schedule of charging the storage tanks during each day, according to the solar radiation conditions. The results show that the use of such system can improve the capability of energy gathering comparing to the individual water storage tank during the cold months of the year. Of course, because of the solar radiation angles and shorten daylight in December & January, the performance will be the same as the simple solar water heaters (in the northern hemisphere).

Major targets were development of austenitic materials and nickel-based super alloys for the hottest sections of boilers, steam lines and turbines. Other targets were development of boiler and turbine designs for the more advanced conditions, and finally economic viability of the AD700 technology has been investigated. The project has been very successful and 40 partners from the European power industry have worked together in several projects cofunded by the European Commission for 10 years. Procurement of a mature and commercially optimised AD700 plant could take place around 2015. The investigated nickel-based materials have shown very high creep strengths but they are hard to manufacture. Ongoing tests indicate that the developed austenitic material will fulfil its creep strength target and is now ready for commercialisation. Improved materials allow higher steam temperatures and pressures. Improved thermodynamic design optimises plant efficiencies for the given steam parameters. The present paper presents a proposal for an improved steam cycle named the Master Cycle (MC) based on a revision of the double reheat steam cycle where the bleeds of the IP turbines have been moved to a feed pump turbine bleeding on the first cold reheat line. The MC offers solid heat rate improvements of -3.5% compared with single reheat cycles. These improvements maintain a flexible operation mode of the plant in relation to renewable energy production plants and facilitate efficient energy supply for a post combustion carbon capture installation. Further thermodynamic improvements enable an efficiency for a seawater-cooled 800MW AD700 power plant around 55% based on the MC.

To achieve that, a number of control schemes have since been proposed with the traditional double-loop linear control scheme being more popular because of its simple conceptual formulation and physical implementation. Despite of its popularity, the harmonic compensation ability of the traditional double-loop scheme is relatively poor, which although can be improved by using better controller transfer functions, is usually more complex and thus requires a more powerful processor. Avoiding these added complexities, this paper presents and compares a number of time-delay control schemes for UPS control, where the main building blocks needed are readily available memory storages and simple transfer functions formulated with either no or at least one control zero for canceling the plant pole. Unlike other existing schemes, the presented time delay control schemes have high compensating gains only at those harmonic frequencies typically produced by most non-linear and unbalanced loads, with zero gains observed at all other frequencies. With this load-matching characteristic, the presented control schemes are expected to be more robust and less sensitive to implementation noises. In addition, the presented control schemes are deduced to have fast dynamic response, implying that the supply's output voltage is virtually not influenced by any transient load transitions. Even more favorable is that the above-described performance features are attained under all load-operating conditions and at the same level of implementation easiness as for the traditional double-loop control scheme. Lastly, for verifying the practicality of the control schemes, an experimental UPS was assembled for testing with some results presented in a later section of the paper. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Data storage equipment; Dynamic response; Electric inverters; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Linear control systems; Power supply circuits; Time delay; Transfer functions; Uninterruptible power systems; Building blocks; Control schemes; Controller transfer functions; Double loops; Double-loop controls; Fast dynamic response; Harmonic compensations; Harmonic frequencies; Linear controls; Memory storages; Non-linear; Operating conditions; Output voltages; Performance evaluations; Supply qualities; Time-delay controls; Transient loads; Unbalanced loads; Uninterruptible power supplies; Delay control systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62949160710

Heat treatment is one of the traditional methods to relieve the residual stresses. But it is often limited by the manufacturing condition and the size of the structures [1]. In this article a procedure called vibratory stress relief (VSR) is discussed. VSR is a process to reduce and redistribute the internal residual stresses of welded structures by means of post-weld mechanical vibration. The effectiveness of VSR on the residual stresses of welded structures, including the drums of hoist machine and thick stainless steel plate are investigated. Parameters of VSR procedure are described in the article. Residual stresses changes on weld bead are measured before and after VSR treatment by metal magnetic memory method. Several specimens, after welding and vibratory treatment, were cut off the welded plates and submitted for tensile, impact, hardness tests and metallographic analysis. The results show that this control method is suitable for evaluation of residual welding stresses variations after the weldment's treatment and that VSR process can reduce the residual stress middle carbon steel.","Residual stresses; Vibratory stress relief; Welded joints","Carbon steel; Dimensional stability; Hardness testing; Magnetic storage; Metallography; Plates (structural components); Residual stresses; Stainless steel; Strength of materials; Stress relief; Structural metals; Vibrations (mechanical); Welded steel structures; Welds; Before and after; Control methods; Cut offs; Fatigue lives; Hardness tests; Manufacturing conditions; Mechanical vibrations; Metal magnetic memories; Metallographic analysis; Residual welding stress; Stainless steel plates; Vibration energies; Vibratory stress relief; Weld beads; Welded joints; Welded metals; Welded plates; Welded structures; Welding process; Weldment; Welding",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62949136792

With this topology, variable speed operation can be obtained in both pumping mode and generating mode, and reactive current can be controlled independently of the active power flow and the operation of the pump turbine. By utilizing the controllability of the variable speed system, power fluctuations from wind turbines can be compensated to limit the influence on the rest of the grid. At the same time the pumped storage can be controlled to take part in the frequency control of the system and also to control grid voltage or flow of reactive power.

Furthermore, it is very effective compared to centralize bulk generation if it is sited near the load. To reap the maximum benefit, a cogeneration system must be optimally sized. This paper presents a study of cogeneration system for typical hospital buildings in Malaysia. A mixed integer non-linear optimization technique is used to size the system. A Newton Raphson and Conjugate method have been used in the optimization process. The optimization technique models the cogeneration system together with a thermal storage system that will provide broader spectrum in the optimization exercise. Hospital facility with maximum demand of 5 MW and 2 MW are simulated. The annual savings will be optimized operationally by varying hourly generation output. Matching the generated electrical and thermal energy to the load will be optimized. Having thermal storage in the model will enhance the matching procedure towards better overall efficiency. Five different capacities of gas turbine generator that are available commercially are used in the simulation to determine the choice of optimal size system.

Systems that are able to go anywhere and be truly ""autonomous"" have a huge advantage over those dependent on finite power sources. They do not require regular maintenance of a battery; therefore they can be put into places where it might be difficult to replace components. The question is ""How to power an autonomous system?"" Energy harvesting has been proposed as a means to harness energy from a system's operating environment and convert it to electricity. Research was undertaken in order to thoroughly investigate the current state of harvesting technologies and the results are presented in a comprehensive literature review. The review focuses on the underlying theory and the operating principles used by electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and electrostatic harvesters. We have also investigated and discussed the research and methodology used by previous researchers in developing their own systems. From preliminary analysis, it is evident that harvesters alone are incapable of powering large loads directly; therefore harvester circuits have also been investigated. Consequently the literature review presents a detailed overview of harvesting circuits and describes the work done in the development of circuits that manage harvested power and storage devices.

Most powders are known to be cohesive, many agglomerate spontaneously when exposed to humid atmosphere or elevated storage temperature. Agitation of the powder (especially powders with different bulk densities) may result in migration of smaller particles downwards and of larger ones upwards. Another problem is segregation whose main cause is the difference in particle size, density shape and resilience. There are standard mixing devices, such as drum tumblers or Turbula mixers. Alternate device type used is the static mixer of Kenics type. Static mixers save energy, disable segregation and effect particle migration. In this paper, static mixers, as devices for powder mixing, are tested as well as Turbula and V-shaped drum mixer, since those devices are commonly used for powder blending in industry. Mixtures that were blended by means of those three devices were made out of the model material, quartz sand, in different component ratios (20:80 and 30:70). The results were statistically calculated and graphically presented. Cohesion indexes were measured with Powder Flow Analyser to see the effect of material flow on the mixture quality. The results obtained by those three devices, the particle size effect and cohesion indexes, bring us to the conclusion that static mixers could be used for mixing of powders, but their shape, number of mixing elements and the mixer length should be adapted for each mixture separately, experimentally and mathematically, through modelling of the system. © Printed in India.","Blending; Flowability; Mixer; Parametric statistic","Bulk densities; Common operations; Drum mixers; Flowability; Humid atmospheres; Material flows; Mixer; Mixing devices; Mixing elements; Mixture qualities; Model materials; Parametric statistic; Particle migrations; Particle size effects; Powder blending; Powder flows; Powder mixing; Quartz sands; Save energies; Standard mixing; Static mixers; Storage temperatures; Adhesion; Blending; Chemical industry; Compressive strength; Mixtures; Oxide minerals; Particle size; Powders; Quartz; Segregation (metallography); Mixers (machinery)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61949295140

These aim at improving the adaptation of the mesh to the image while producing better-shaped triangles. True to Hale's idea, no image segmentation is ever tried, but since the atom placement and movement criteria are more sensitive to image borders, experiments indicate that the resulting meshes tend to conform more closely to the image features.

At this pH, chemical stability is improved by an increase in drug concentration (1-5 mg/ml) and a decrease in temperature (5-36 °C), the latter demonstrated by a linear Arrhenius-plot. The activation energy is low (Ea = 10.2 kcal/mol), thus the Q10 value is only 1.8 in pure aqueous solutions. The degradation at the lowest concentration investigated in pure aqueous solution apparently follows zero order kinetics. The reaction order is changed at higher concentrations. We are presenting a hypothesis of intramolecular proton transfer from the thiol to the ionized carboxylic group as the initial step in the oxidative degradation pathways of captopril. Long-term stability of 1 mg/ml captopril in aqueous solutions at pH 3, stored at 36 °C for one year, shows that the sugar alcohol sorbitol accelerates degradation of the drug while Na-EDTA at a concentration as low as 0.01% is sufficient to stabilize these samples. Purging with N2-gas prior to storage is not essential for drug stability, as long as Na-EDTA is present. Only at a low level of Na-EDTA (0.01%) combined with a high level of sorbitol (35%), purging with N 2-gas appears to have a small effect. The destabilizing effect of sugar alcohols is confirmed by accelerated degradation also in the presence of glycerol.

The structure of the energy sector and socio-economic conditions vary considerably between these three countries. A total of 24 large (emitting more than 0.1 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2) industrial sources of CO2 emissions, registered in 2005 in the European Trading Scheme, consists of 11.5 Mt of CO2 from Estonia, 1.9 Mt from Latvia and 5.6 Mt from Lithuania. The highest amount of CO2 emission in Estonia is related to the oil shale used as the main fuel for power generation; the two largest Estonian power plants-Estonian and Baltic-produced respectively 7.7 and 2.25 Mt of CO2 in 2005 and 9.4 and 2.7 Mt of CO2 in 2007. CO2 emission from oil shale combustion is significantly higher in comparison with other fossil fuels as energy sources. This is why CO2 emission per capita in Estonia is about two times higher than the average value in Europe. The three Baltic States are located within the Baltic sedimentary basin, the thickness of which varies from 100 m in Northeast Estonia up to 1900 m in Southwest Latvia and 2300 m in West Lithuania. The most prospective formation for geological storage of CO2 is the Cambrian reservoir. 15 large structures have been identified in Latvia with a total capacity exceeding 300 Mt of CO2. The tightness of structures is evidenced by 40 years of successful operation of the Incukalns Underground Gas Storage. Due to shallow setting, geological conditions in Estonia are unfavourable for CO2 storage. Therefore an option of transporting CO2 from Estonia via pipelines. &copy; 2008 Estonian Academy Publishers.",,"Carbon dioxide emissions; European Commission; Geological conditions; Geological storage; Industrial sources; Oil shale combustions; Sedimentary basin; Socio-economic conditions; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Industry; Oil shale; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61449147957

For this, a concept involving a Lagrangian stochastic particle model (LSPM) coupled with an Eulerian regional atmospheric modelling system (RAMS) is used. The atmospheric turbulent dispersion of radionuclides (represented by non-buoyant particles/neutral traces) in the LSPM is modelled by applying non-homogeneous turbulence conditions. The mean wind velocities governed by the topography of the region and the surface fluxes of momentum and heat are calculated by the RAMS code. A moving least squares (MLS) technique is introduced to calculate the concentration of radionuclides at ground level. The numerically calculated vertical profiles of wind velocity and temperature are compared with observed data. The results obtained demonstrate that in regions of complex terrain it is not sufficient to model the atmospheric dispersion of particles using a straight-line Gaussian plume model, and that by utilising a Lagrangian stochastic particle model and regional atmospheric modelling system a much more realistic estimation of the dispersion in such a hypothetical scenario was ascertained. The particle dispersion results for a 12h ground release show that a triangular area of about 400km2 situated in the north-west quadrant of release is under radiological threat. The particle distribution shows that the use of a Gaussian plume model (GPM) in such situations will yield quite misleading results. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Accidental release; Atmospheric dispersions; Atmospheric modelling; Complex terrains; Concentration of; Eulerian; Gaussian plume models; Ground levels; Lagrangian; Mean-winds; Moving least squares; Non-homogeneous; Observed datum; Pakistan; Particle dispersions; Particle distributions; Stochastic particle models; Surface fluxes; Turbulent dispersions; Vertical profiles; Wind velocities; Atmospheric radioactivity; Curve fitting; Dispersion (waves); Dispersions; Industrial poisons; Lagrange multipliers; Nuclear energy; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Radioisotopes; Radiometry; Random access storage; Random processes; Surface topography; Thermal spraying; Trellis codes; Turbulence; Stochastic models; radioisotope; radioisotope; article; atmospheric dispersion; computer model; computer simulation; dose calculation; magnetic and electromagnetic equipment; mathematical model; normal distribution; priority journal; radiation dose; aerosol; air pollutant; atmosphere; chemistry; computer simulation; methodology; Pakistan; radiation monitoring; theoretical model; wind; Aerosols; Air Pollutants, Radioactive; Atmosphere; Computer Simulation; Models, Theoretical; Pakistan; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Monitoring; Radioisotopes; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60849096989

One of the principal problems is that the majority of these images are guided, principally by image intensity, creating complications when images possess noisy information. This work proposes an automatic segmentation method for images obtained by CT. It proposes the use of active contour with an energy function that weights the image's potential with object information known a priori to segmentation. To validate the proposed technique, wood pieces, saturated in water and noise, were inspected to isolate knots and other defects.

The proposed architecture is based on selectively duplication of the most vulnerable registers values in a cache memory embedded beside the processor register file so called register cache. To do this, two parity bits are added to each register of the processor to detect up to three contiguous errors. To recover the erroneous register value, two distinct cache memories are utilized for storing the redundant copy of the vulnerable registers, one for short lived registers and the other one for long lived registers. The proposed method has two key advantageous as compared to fully ECC protected register file: 1) the proposed architecture corrects up to three contiguous errors while the ECC protected register file just corrects one bit error, and 2) the proposed architecture consumes about 25% less power than the fully ECC protected register file.

Glass ceramics, lead sodium niobate silicate (PNNS), barium sodium niobate silicate (BNNS) and barium titanate silicate (BTS), allow the development of dielectrics with various permittivity values ranging from 20 to 700. Glasses were formed by melt-rolling the respective constituents which were then crystallized by reheating the glass at higher temperatures. Heat treatment schedules were formulated based on DTA results. A spectrum of crystalline phases, ranging from perovskites, tungsten bronzes and pyrochlores to fresnoites, were generated within the various glass matrices. Disadvantages, such as difficult glass formability, less control over crystallization due to multiphase formation etc., associated with high permittivity PNNS and BNNS glass ceramics served as the motivating factor for exploring low permittivity glass ceramics.

After the WEEE and RoHS came into effect the new focus became lead-free solder pastes such as SnAg or SnAgCu (SAC). One approach to improve the thermal fatigue properties of these alloys is to add a third or fourth alloying element SAC + X. Until now, this was always done by metallurgical alloying, requiring special apparatuses, conditions and, exceptional processing expertise. Hence, it is even more difficult and more expensive to produce a powder out of these alloys. The project ""nanoFlux"", funded by the German federal ministry of research and education, is a new approach to alloy special elements into a solder joint during a conventional retlow process used in SMD technology. A standard powder is mixed with a flux containing Al, Co, Fe, or mixtures of these elements. NanoFlux should not significantly influence the melting point or the pasty range to be used in established lead-free processes. This could drastically lower the costs for the manufacturing and storage of special alloys. Recent results already show successful alloying for Co and Fe. The thermal properties were monitored during an insitu reflow differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) experiment. To verify a successful doping, reflowed, cleaned, and dissolved solder balls were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP OES). Parallel to those experiments, a test board was set up and a thermal cycle test has been conducted. The higher remaining shear strength was linked to the microstructural characteristics of the different solders through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. It was possible to successfully dope a solder joint with a fourth element by mixing a Co or Fe containing flux with the solder powder. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Automotive electronics; Coupled plasmas; Differential scanning calorimeters; Energy dispersive; Fatigue properties; ICP-OES; In-situ; Lead-free; Lead-free solders; Microstructural characteristics; New approaches; Sn-Ag-Cu; Solder balls; Solder joints; Solder powders; Special elements; Thermal cycle tests; Thermal properties; Alloying; Alloying elements; Alloys; Atomic spectroscopy; Automobile electronic equipment; Brazing; Data storage equipment; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dissolution; Emission spectroscopy; Inductively coupled plasma; Iron alloys; Laser interferometry; Melting point; Metallic compounds; Molecular spectroscopy; Optical emission spectroscopy; Powders; Scanning; Scanning electron microscopy; Shear strength; Soldering; Soldering alloys; Thermodynamic properties; Welding; Lead",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149104423

Respondents cite the use of 'keywords in title and description tags' as the most used SEM technique; while 'Pay for Placement' was found to be the most widely used Paid Search technique. In concurrence with the literature, measuring SEM performance remains a significant challenge with many firms unsure if they measure it effectively. An encouraging finding from the study is that Irish SMEs adopt a positive ethical posture when undertaking SEM.","Ethics; Information search; Search engine marketing; Search engines; Website optimization","Computer software; Distributed computer systems; Electric energy storage; Electronic commerce; Engines; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Internet; Marketing; Optimization; Search engines; Telecommunication networks; Ethics; Information search; Ireland; Locating informations; Optimisation; Search engine marketing; Search techniques; Sem techniques; Small to medium enterprises; Website optimization; World Wide Web",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049134589

The sensor comprises an array of 128 × 128 single-photon pixels, a bank of 32 time-to-digital-converters, and a 7.68 Gbps readout system. Thanks to the outstanding timing precision of single-photon avalanche diodes and the optimized measurement circuitry, a typical resolution of 97 ps was achieved within a range of 100 ns. To the best of our knowledge, this imager is the first fully integrated system for photon time-of-arrival evaluation. Applications include 3-D imaging, optical rangefinding, fast fluorescence lifetime imaging, imaging of extremely fast phenomena, and, more generally, imaging based on time-correlated single photon counting. When operated as an optical rangefinder, this design has enabled us to reconstruct 3-D scenes with milimetric precisions in extremely low signal exposure. A laser source was used to illuminate the scene up to 3.75 m with an average power of 1 mW, a field-of-view of 5 ̂ and under 150 lux of constant background light.

The microstructure and phase composition of materials was characterized by X-ray diffraction, whereas the powder morphology and degree of additive dispersion were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The hydrogen desorption behaviour of nanocomposites was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. The results show that addition of porous diatomite structure leads to decrease in desorption temperature, since there was no other effect that can have an influence on kinetics, such as formation of the metastable γ-phase, reduction of oxides to the native metal and/or homogeneous dispersion of the catalyst.

Are there missing links? Accumulating evidence shows that humans have well developed 'self-addictive' appetite pathways to enhance the uptake of highly energy-dense food. Humans synthesize fewer co-factors and vitamins than other mammals and must ingest them. Both processes probably arose to maximize available energy for the developing, large association cortex of the human brain. The default phenotype resulting from consuming an 'addictive', westernized, highly refined, energy-dense, hypomicronutrient diet is 'malnutritive obesity' or 'malnubesity'. A relative lack of antioxidant (and other) co-factors contributes to inefficiently oxidized energy. This 'stress' leads to central fat deposition, disordered energy use by cell mitochondria, especially in muscle and liver, and malfunctioning immune, coagulation, endothelial, and other systems. The resultant problems appear to range from epigenetic reprogramming in utero to end organ damage of the metabolic syndrome and the immune failure of cancer. Treatment of 'malnubesity' may require: (1) understanding the drivers and mechanisms of addictions, (2) reprioritizing satiating, micronutrient-dense whole foods, (3) nonjudgmental general, psychological, and medical support for those at risk or affected by obesity; and (4) practical incentives/regulation for healthy food production and distribution. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"brain cortex; diet restriction; dietary intake; drug dependence; energy balance; energy cost; food intake; human; lipid storage; malnutrition; metabolic syndrome X; nutritional status; obesity; priority journal; review; socioeconomics; vitamin supplementation; Animals; Antioxidants; Brain; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Evolution; Humans; Immune System; Malnutrition; Metabolism; Nutritional Sciences; Obesity; Phenotype; Public Health",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57449108759

The main parameters studied include CD the content and size of shreds. The study indicates that the fracture energy and modified characteristic length were found to increase significantly with the increasing proportion and size of CD shreds due to anchoring and bridging effects.

Storage of PHA by mixed microbial cultures occurs under transient conditions of carbon or oxygen availability, known respectively as aerobic dynamic feeding and anaerobic/aerobic process. In these processes, PHA-accumulating organisms, which are quite diverse in terms of phenotype, are selected by the dynamic operating conditions imposed to the reactor. The stability of these processes during long-time operation and the similarity of the polymer physical/chemical properties to the one produced by pure cultures were demonstrated. This process could be implemented at industrial scale, providing that some technological aspects are solved. This review summarizes the relevant research carried out with mixed cultures for PHA production, with main focus on the use of wastes or industrial surplus as feedstocks. Basic concepts, regarding the metabolism and microbiology, and technological approaches, with emphasis on the kind of feedstock and reactor operating conditions for culture selection and PHA accumulation, are described.

Innovation leadership is a strategic way of implementing innovation that is applicable especially to SMEs. This is because SMEs are flexible, lightly-structured and thus can adapt to the requirements of the innovation leadership model.

We quantify the relation between the threshold offset and the degradation in the required signal-to-noise ratio to preserve a desired symbol error rate. Based on the analysis we conclude some useful guidelines with respect to various system parameters. One of the main problems in an ED-PAM with arbitrary number of modulation levels, integration time, and bandwidth is to find a simple way to calculate the optimal threshold values. We rise to this challenge by proposing a new multilevel threshold calculation method which is attractive to use from both performance and complexity point of views for a wide range of system parameters.

The addition of 0.5% (w/v) pine wood shavings to the growth medium yielded a 14-fold increase in hydrogen production over a period of 55 days relative to cultures grown in the same medium without wood shavings (average rate was about 0.45 ml H2 ml culture-1 day-1). The shavings were also shown to be degraded by C. saccharolyticus in the absence of any other carbohydrate source. A study on storage of the cells at 42 °C in the presence of either agarose or alginic acid cultures immobilized on granulated activated carbon, wood shavings or perlite revealed that the immobilization improved both the storability and hydrogen evolving capacity of the cells. From these carriers the soft wood shavings showed the best performance.

The raw materials were screened to a narrow particle size distribution and mixed into four different batches and then pelletized under controlled conditions. Physical pellet characteristics like compression strength, densities, moisture content, moisture absorption and abrasion resistance were determined. In addition, the thermochemical characteristics, i.e. drying and initial pyrolysis, flaming pyrolysis, char combustion and char yield were determined at different experimental conditions by using a laboratory-scaled furnace. The results indicate that the particle size distribution had some effect on current consumption and compression strength but no evident effect on single pellet and bulk density, moisture content, moisture absorption during storage and abrasion resistance. Differences in average total conversion time determined for pellet batches tested under the same combustion conditions was less than 5% and not significant. The results are of practical importance suggesting that grinding of saw dust particle sizes below 8 mm is probably needless when producing softwood pellets. Thus it seem that less energy could be used if only over sized particles are grinded before pelletizing. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Existing approaches for event detection are mainly based on some predefined threshold values and, thus, are often inaccurate and incapable of capturing complex events. For example, in coal mine monitoring scenarios, gas leakage or water osmosis can hardly be described by the overrun of specified attribute thresholds but some complex pattern in the full-scale view of the environmental data. To address this issue, we propose a nonthreshold-based approach for the real 3D sensor monitoring environment. We employ energy-efficient methods to collect a time series of data maps from the sensor network and detect complex events through matching the gathered data to spatiotemporal data patterns.

Despite a wide distribution, their role during insect embryogenesis has not been examined so far. In this study, we show the mobilization of PolyP polymers during the embryogenesis of the cockroach Periplaneta americana. PolyP was detected by enzymatic and fluorimetric assays and found to accumulate in two main sizes by agarose gel electrophoresis. Confocal microscopy showed their presence in small vesicles. In addition, X-ray microanalysis of small vesicles showed considerable amounts of calcium, sodium and magnesium, suggesting an association of PolyP with these elements. Variations of the free Ca+2, Pi and PolyP levels were observed during the first days of embryogenesis. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that phosphate ions modulate PolyP variation and that PolyP hydrolysis result in increasing free Ca+2 levels. This is the first investigation of PolyP metabolism during embryogenesis of an insect and might shed light on the mechanisms involving Pi storage and homeostasis during this period. We suggest that PolyP, mainly stored in small vesicles, might be involved in the functional control of Ca+2 and Pi homeostasis during early embryogenesis of P. Americana. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Special attention is paid to policies supporting the emergence and development of the regional innovation system in this transition process. Regional innovation systems in developing countries have very recently started to be conceptualised as specialized hubs in global innovation and production networks (Asheim, B., Coenen, L., Vang-Lauridsen, J., 2007.

In: Pietrobello, C., Rabellotti, R. (Eds.), Upgrading and Governance in Clusters and Value Chains in Latin America. Harvard University Press). A specialized hub refers to a node in a global value chain that mainly undertakes one or a few of the activities required for the production and development of a given good or service or serves a particular segment of the global market. In global value chains, firms in developing countries have traditionally been responsible for the lowest added-value activities. However, a few emerging regional innovation systems in developing countries are beginning to challenge this scenario by rapidly upgrading in the value chain. There is, however, still only a poorly developed understanding of how the system of innovation emerges and evolves to support this transition process and what the role of regional innovation policy is in building the regional conditions that support indigenous small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) in this transition process. This paper aims at reducing this omission by analyzing the co-evolution of the strategies of indigenous SMEs and the regional innovation system of Bangalore (India). © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting ""fuel silicon"" is shipped around the world to emission-free silicon power stations for either immediate electricity generation or stockpiling. The high energy density of silicon and its stable storage make it an ideal material for maintaining national economic functioning through security of base load power supply from a renewable source. This contrasts with the present situation of fossil fuel usage with its associated global warming and geopolitical supply uncertainties. Critical technological requirements for the silicon economy are carbon-neutral silicon production and the development of efficient silicon-fired power stations capable of high-temperature rapid oxidation of fuel silicon.

On the other hand, the area is characterized by very high wind speeds and abundant solar energy, thus the exploitation of the available renewable energy sources (RES) may significantly contribute to the fulfillment of the local societies energy demand at minimum environmental and macroeconomic cost. However, the stochastic availability of wind energy and the variable availability of solar energy, the daily and seasonal electricity demand fluctuations, as well as the limited local electrical network capacity result in serious restrictions concerning the maximum renewable power penetration. In this context, the present paper investigates the possibility of creating a combined electricity generation facility based on the exploitation of wind or/and solar potential of an area as well as on the utilization of an appropriate energy storage configuration in order to replace the existing thermal power stations with rational investment requirements. For this purpose, the major parameters of the proposed integrated configuration are firstly calculated and its financial viability is accordingly analyzed. One of the main targets of the proposed solution is to maximize the RES exploitation of the area at a minimum electricity generation cost, while special emphasis is given in order to select the most cost-efficient energy storage device available. According to the results obtained the proposed solution is not only financially attractive but also improves the quality of the electricity offered to the local communities, substituting the expensive and heavily polluting existing thermal power stations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Particularly in the case of wind turbines this leads to unpredicted line loading and requires balancing energy, at relatively high costs, depending on market structures. Consequently, the income from the production from such non-dispatchable generators can be significantly reduced by the penalty costs incurred. This paper investigates the potential of operating an energy storage device in parallel with the non-dispatchable generator in order to compensate the inaccuracies of the forecasted infeed and to avoid infeed deviations. A time series based simulation methodology is discussed, suitable for any type of non-dispatchable generator. The methodology contains a procedure for simulating different forecast errors, applying an exponentially weighted moving average approach. Analysis procedures and system performance indices are introduced for the evaluation of the configuration's performance. The applicability is shown in two case studies, using measurement data from a wind turbine and from a photovoltaic system. Both case studies show that the suggested configuration considerably improves the reliability or dependability of the network infeed, in turn reducing the demand for balancing energy and back-up generation. The relation between forecast error magnitude and required energy capacity is identified and the coherence of the time series analysis is discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A eutectic mixture of capric acid (CA) and myristic acid (MA) is incorporated with expanded perlite (EP). Thermal properties, thermal reliability, and thermal conductivity of the form-stable composite PCM are determined. The maximum CA-MA absorption of EP was found to be 55 wt% without melted PCM seepage from the composite, and therefore this mixture was described as a form-stable composite. The form-stable composite PCM was characterized using the FT-IR spectroscopy method. The melting and freezing temperatures and latent heats of form-stable composite PCM were measured using DSC analysis. Thermal cycling test of the form-stable composite PCM indicated good thermal reliability in terms of changes in thermal properties after 5000 thermal cycling. The thermal conductivity of the form-stable CA-MA/EP composite PCM was increased about 58% by adding 10 wt% expanded graphite (EG). The form-stable CA-MA/EP/EG composite PCM was considered as an effective LHTES material in the building energy conservation due to suitable phase change temperatures, high latent capacities, good thermal reliability, and good thermal conductivity. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Typical dc-dc converters are discussed which operate to power-conditioning any particular ARR technology (solar, wind, fuel cell, etc.). It is also discussed a new proposed dc-dc converter which is employed to increase the output dc voltage delivered by the PV panels. The new approach employs a series-combined connected boost and buck-boost dc-dc converter for power conditioning of the dc-voltage provided by a photovoltaic panel array. Analysis of the two series-combined dc-dc converters is presented along with simulation and experimental results.

The solar radiation ranged between 287 and 898 W/m2 during the time of experimentation. At nighttime, drying was carried out by combusting biomass. The initial moisture content of the processed mackerel was 72.50 ± 0.44% (w.b.) and was reduced to the final moisture content of 16.67 ± 0.52% (w.b.) in S-BHCD and 16.92 ± 0.54% (w.b.) in OSD. Eleven drying models were used and the coefficients of determination (R2) and constants were evaluated by nonlinear regression to estimate the drying curves of dried mackerels. The Midilli model was found to more satisfactorily describe the drying process of mackerel in S-BHCD with R2 of 0.9999, χ2 of 0.0000374, and RMSE of 0.0057.

This goes against the principles of inherent safety and is often also undesirable for financial and quality reasons. The main reasons for the large inventories are the super-sized equipment in modern world-scale plants and process control requirements. Loss of containment (LOC) can cause major incidents in the process industry and lack of quick isolation is often cited as a contributing factor by investigators of such incidents. Some regulators have therefore prescribed the use of emergency isolation as in the case of storage of liquefied petroleum gases (LPGs). While it might be true that in storage yard settings the benefits of quick isolation usually outweigh the adverse effects, this cannot be said for a process plant setting. A desire for quick isolation circumvents the necessary discussion about the wisdom of isolation, the speed at which this isolation should occur and also the practicality. Quick isolation of a flow, in a process facility, can create unanticipated and undesirable process conditions some of which might prove to be more hazardous than the initiating LOC event. For example, emergency isolation of LPG systems under fire conditions can cause boiling liquid expanding vapor explosions (BLEVEs). Pressure effects or missiles from such BLEVEs can easily damage adjacent equipment and cause domino effects. Draining energy from such systems, e.g., through depressurization, might be safer than relying on the integrity of the containment system during fire situations. Root causes for LOC include random equipment failures, age-related failures, human error and systematic failures. Factors that greatly increase the consequences of a LOC incident include equipment congestion and encroachment by third parties. Encroachment is often beyond management's control; however, a buildup of congestion within the plant is under management's control. An uncontrolled and haphazard provision of quick isolation valves can significantly increase the number of leak points as well as congestion in a process plant. Such congestion can potentially turn a flash fire incident into a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), which has significant knock-on effect potential. Issues surrounding the design, installation and operation of remotely actuated valves in a process plant need therefore to be evaluated on an individual basis and compared with the pros and cons of other alternatives. Installation of emergency isolation in a process plant based on a simple summation of inventories is therefore ill advised. Emergency isolation should be one possible solution to a potential LOC design scenario. Any solution should be based on the application of risk-derived criteria that distinguish between safety, environmental and nuisance events and also between spills and airborne releases. Within this framework it is particularly important to address performance criteria that a solution has to meet; e.g., retention of hazardous material, spurious trips, etc. Performance is strongly dependent on the intervention by the operator and unrealistic expectations can yield unsatisfactory designs. There are at present no practical industry guidelines for designers that address the circumstances in which remotely actuated valves should be installed. This paper aims at providing practical rules for the installation of remotely actuated isolation capabilities.",,"Boiling liquids; Butane; Control theory; Design; Equipment; Gas industry; Hazardous materials; Liquefied gases; Liquefied petroleum gas; Liquid fuels; Pressure effects; Process engineering; Springs (components); Vapors; Adverse effects; Airborne releases; Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosions; Containment systems; Contributing factors; Control requirements; Depressurization; Design scenarios; Domino effects; Equipment failures; Fire conditions; Flash fires; Human errors; Industry guidelines; Inherent safeties; Isolation valves; Leak points; Loss of containments; Possible solutions; Potentially hazardous materials; Process conditions; Process industries; Process plants; Root causes; Storage yards; Systematic failures; Third parties; Vapor cloud explosions; Process control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449107124

Performance of single decoupled generation set are discussed supported by results of laboratory tests. The variable speed system provides high quality voltage in wide speed range when the step of load is low. However, when the step load is significant the voltage drop is not acceptable. Therefore to provide high quality produced voltage an additional energy storage, made from supercapacitor and bidirectional DC/DC converter, is applied. Such system performs very stiff voltage in any load condition. Integration of renewable wind energy system is provided via DC link of the variable speed decoupled autonomous generation system. The priority of the power draw is from the wind source. This is assured by a method of three reference signals for the DC link voltage.

Typically, Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries are utilized for this application. However, supplying a large burst of current, such as motor startup, from the battery degrades battery plates, resulting in destruction of the battery. An alterative way of supplying large bursts of current is to combine VRLA batteries and supercapacitors to form a hybrid storage system, where the battery can supply continuous energy and the supercapacitor can supply the instant power to the load. In this paper, the role of the supercapacitor in a PV Energy Control Unit (ECU) is investigated by using Matlab/Simulink models. The ECU monitors and optimizes the power flow from the PV to the battery-supercapacitor hybrid and the load. Three different load conditions are studied, including a peak current load, pulsating current load and a constant current load.

The method introduces the concept of a near field region in close proximity to the mat foundation and a far field at distance. The near field is modeled as a region of nonlinear soil response with strain compatible shear stiffness and viscous material damping. The shear strain in a representative soil element is used as the basis for strain compatibility in the near field. In the far field, radiation damping using low strain soil response is used. Frequency dependent complex dynamic impedance functions are used in a model that incorporates horizontal displacement and rotation of the foundation. The focus of the paper is on the computation of the horizontal shear force and moment on the tank foundation to enable foundation design. Significant SSI effects are shown to occur for tanks sited on soft soil, especially tanks of a tall slender nature. SSI effects take the form of period elongation and energy loss by radiation damping and foundation soil damping. The effects of SSI for tanks are shown to reverse the trend of force and moment reduction under earthquake loading as is usually assumed by designers. The reasons for this important effect in tank design are given in the paper and relate to the very short period of most tanks, hence, period lengthening may result in load increase. A comparison is made with SSI effects evaluated using the code SEI/ASCE 7-02. Period elongation is found to be similar for relatively stiff soils when assessed by the code compared with the results of the dynamic analysis. For soft soils, the agreement is not as good. Code values of system damping are found to agree reasonably well with an assessment based on the dynamic analyses for the range of periods covered by the code. Energy loss by material damping and radiation damping is discussed. It is shown that energy loss may be computed using the complex dynamic impedance function associated with the viscous dashpot in the analytical model. The proportion of energy loss in the translation mode compared to that dissipated in the rotational mode is addressed as a function of the slenderness of the tank. Energy loss increases substantially with the volume of liquid being stored. © 2008 ASCE.","Damping; Earthquakes; Foundation design; Seismic effects; Soil structures; Soil-structure interaction; Storage tanks","Codes (symbols); Damping; Design; Dynamic analysis; Earthquakes; Electric field effects; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Energy dissipation; Flow interactions; Foundations; Frequency domain analysis; Frequency response; Piles; Probability density function; Radiation; Radiation effects; Seismic design; Seismic response; Seismology; Shear strain; Soil mechanics; Soil structure interactions; Soils; Structural design; Tanks (containers); Foundation design; Seismic effects; Soil structures; Soil-structure interaction; Storage tanks; Steel tanks; cyclic loading; damping; displacement; dynamic analysis; dynamic response; foundation; frequency dependence; seismic response; shear strain; soil-structure interaction; storage tank",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449086009

Small Irish companies are becoming aware of the opportunities provided by offshoring their software development activities and are beginning to harvest the benefits. Two case studies were undertaken in two small Irish companies that have offshored their software development to subsidiaries in Romania and India respectively. Building on Lings'[1] reference model for distributed development, the current paper aims at illustrating particular ways of putting these strategies into practice in the case of small companies by relaying on people who can bridge the two cultures.

A recent implementation of pulsed power supplies for the ring elements with microsecond response times allows us to identify the daughter ion fragment masses and to disentangle fragmentation that occurs from excited states immediately after photoexcitation from that occurring on a longer time scale of several microseconds to milliseconds. We find that attachment of crown ether significantly alters the dissociation channels since it renders the π σ* (N H3) state inaccessible and hence prevents the N-H bond breakage which is an important fragmentation channel of Trp H+. As a result, on a long time scale (&lt;10 μs), photoexcited Trp H+ (CE) decays exponentially whereas Trp H+ displays a power-law decay. The only ions remaining in the latter case are TrpH+ radical cations with a broad internal energy distribution caused by the departing hydrogen. Large changes in the fragment branching ratios as functions of excitation wavelength between 210 and 290 nm were found for both Trp H+ and Trp H+ (CE). © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Amino acids; Complexation; Crown ethers; Electric power distribution; Ethers; Hydrogen; Ions; Ligands; Organic compounds; Photoexcitation; Photolysis; Branching ratios; Dissociation channels; Dissociation lifetimes; Dissociation pathways; Electrostatic ion storages; Excitation wavelengths; Fragmentation channels; H bonds; Internal energy distributions; Ion fragments; Long times; Protonated; Pulsed power supplies; Radical cations; Response times; Ring elements; Time scales; Dissociation; crown ether; indole; indole derivative; proton; quaternary ammonium derivative; tryptophan; absorption; article; chemistry; electron transport; kinetics; mass spectrometry; photolysis; time; Absorption; Crown Ethers; Electron Transport; Indoles; Kinetics; Mass Spectrometry; Photolysis; Protons; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Time Factors; Tryptophan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349099705

New strategies must be developed and implemented in the major energy consumption systems like those for water supply. With pump storage systems is possible to store energy at a lower price since water is pumped to an upper reservoir during off-peak hours. During peak hours hydropower energy can be produced by release of water to the lower reservoir through a water turbine. The combination of these systems with wind turbines can bring many advantages since the energy production by wind sometimes exceeds the electricity consumption needs. In this way, the excess of energy generated by wind turbines can be used to pump water. This paper presents an optimization model that determines the best hourly operation for one day, according to the electricity tariff, for a pumped storage system with water consumption and inlet discharge. A wind turbine is introduced in the system and the optimization model is applied. The rules obtained as output of the optimization process are subsequently introduced in a hydraulic simulator, in order to verify the system behaviour and compare it with the normal water supply operating mode, as well as to quantify the real energy costs savings with this hybrid solution. The developed optimization models (in MATLAB) use linear and non linear programming to provide the best solution in terms of pump and turbine operation for each time step. Simultaneously the population water consumption must be guaranteed, and the hydraulic system restrictions fulfilled. The definition of optimal pumping schedules allows the reduction of operation and maintenance costs associated with pumping energy as well as the increase of global hydraulic system performance. The analysis of results shows that nonlinear programming has a non negligible economic saving. With the introduction of the wind turbines, the profits are further significant. © BHR Group 2008.","Energy efficiency; Optimization; Pump-storage; Renewable energy; Water supply systems","Chemical oxygen demand; Dynamic programming; Elastic moduli; Electric generators; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Engines; Hydraulic equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Hydraulics; Linear programming; Linearization; Maintenance; MATLAB; Operating costs; Optimization; Pumping plants; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Reservoirs (water); Sewage pumping plants; Turbines; Wastewater; Water conservation; Water piping systems; Water supply; Water supply systems; Wind turbines; Best solutions; Economic savings; Electricity consumptions; Electricity tariffs; Energy consumptions; Energy costs; Energy productions; Hybrid solutions; Hydraulic simulators; Hydraulic systems; Hydropower energies; New strategies; Operating modes; Operation and maintenances; Optimal pumping; Optimization models; Optimization processes; Pumped storages; Pumping energies; Renewable energies; Renewable energy; Saving energies; Storage optimizations; Storage systems; System behaviours; Time steps; Turbine operations; Water consumptions; Water turbines; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56149121941

This paper presents biomass equations developed from trees directly weighed in open forest on fertile soils in the southern Amazon (SA) and allometric equations for bole-volume estimates of trees in both dense and open forests. The equations were used to improve the commonly used biomass models based on large-scale wood-volume inventories carried out in Amazonian forest. The biomass estimates from the SA allometric equation indicate that equations developed in forests on infertile soils in central Amazonia (CA) result in overestimates if applied to trees in the open forests of SA. All aboveground components of 267 trees in open forests of SA were cut and weighed, and the proportion of the biomass stored in the crowns of trees in open forest was found to be higher than in dense forest. In the case of inventoried wood volume, corrections were applied for indentations and hollow trunks and it was determined that no adjustment is needed for the form factor used in the RadamBrasil volume formula. New values are suggested for use in models to convert wood volume to biomass estimates. A biomass map for Brazilian Amazonia was produced from 2702 plots inventoried by the RadamBrasil Project incorporating all corrections for wood density and wood volume and in factors used to add the bole volume of small trees and the crown biomass. Considering all adjustments, the biomass map indicates total biomass of 123.1 Gt (1 Gt = 1 billion tons) dry weight (aboveground + belowground) for originally forested areas in 1976 in the Brazilian Legal Amazon as a whole (102.3 Gt for aboveground only) at the time of the RadamBrasil inventories, which were carried out before intensive deforestation had occurred in the region. Excluded from this estimate are 529,000 km2 of forest lacking sufficient RadamBrasil inventory data. After forest losses of 676,000 km2 by 2006 - not counting 175,000 km2 of this deforested area lacking RadamBrasil data - the estimated dry biomass stock was reduced to 105.4 and 87.6 Gt (aboveground + belowground and only above-ground). Thus, in 2006 the carbon storage in forested areas in Brazilian Amazonia as a whole will be around 51.1 Gt (assuming 1 Mg dry biomass = 0.485 Mg C). Biomass estimates by forest type (aggregated into 12 vegetation classes) are provided for each state in the Brazilian Legal Amazon. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A proper balance between both approaches and the effective tool adoption will help organizations to meet their objectives and evolve. Small and medium enterprises and Cooperatives (S&C) share common characteristics throughout Latin America. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) lack of formality in their roles and relationships among interacting individuals, whereas Cooperatives are usually small companies with weaknesses as to management techniques and technological equipment. In fact, both have difficulties when finding the right personnel and tools that best suit their needs. Considering Venezuela as our study subject, we have herein proposed some criteria to assist S&C in the tools selection that support their development processes while fostering the balance required between agility and discipline.

In addition, the high recovery performance of SAGD makes it a popular option for these non-conventional oil resources. Steam processes are energy intensive and result in generation of emissions which are detrimental to humankind and the environment. The use of non-thermal processes involving CO2 as a miscible or immiscible gas phase in combination with steam for heavy oil recovery is considered as a viable alternative to limit the drawbacks of steam generation. These processes have the capability to enhance oil recovery through CO2 utilization during production and also provide an avenue to dispose CO2 after production. Numerical simulation studies have been carried out utilizing STARS (a three phase, multi-components reservoir simulator) to optimize a baseline SAGD process and wind-down process with CO2 Injection. The baseline process was operated until maturity then CO2 injection was used to initiate wind-down after 4, 6 and 8 years of a 12 year production operation. Following each of the wind-down processes, CO2 disposal was undertaken for 25 years and the storage potential evaluated. The baseline SAGD process had a recovery factor of 76%. The SAGD wind-down processes with CO2 injection after 4, 6 and 8 years had recovery factors of 54%, 77% and 79% respectively. This and other parameters proved the feasibility of SAGD wind-down process with CO2 injection and its potential to enhance oil recovery.

In one configuration, thioaniline-functionalized CdS NPs are electropolymerized in the presence of thioanline-modified Au NPs to yield an oligoaniline-crosslinked CdS/Au NPs array. The NP-functionalized electrode generates a photocurrent with a quantum yield that corresponds to ca. 9%. The photocurrent intensities are controlled by the potential applied on the electrode, and the redox-state of the oligoaniline bridge. In the oxidized quinoide state of the oligoaniline units, the bridges act as electron acceptors that trap the conduction-band electrons that are transported to the electrode and lead to high quantum yield photocurrents. The reduced jr-donor oligoaniline bridges act as π-donor sites that associate N,N′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium, MV2+, by donor/acceptor interactions, Ka=5270 M-1. The associated MV2+ acts as an effective trapof the conduction-band electrons, andin the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor, high photocurrent values are measured (ca. 12% quantum yield). The electropolymerization of thioaniline-functionalized Au NPs and thioaniline-modified CdS NPs in the presence of MV2+ yields a MV2+-imprinted NP array. The imprinted array exhibits enhanced affinities toward the association of MV 2+ to the oligoaniline π-donorsites, KA = 2.29 × 104M-1.

This image is used to detect air pollution at regional level, in coarser resolution. Remotely sensed data can be used qualitatively to provide a regional view of pollutants and to help assess the impact of events such as biomass burning or dust transport from remote sources. In this study, we explored the relationship between particulate matters of size less than 10 micron (PM10) derived from the Landsat TM using regression technique. We was developed a new algorithm that can effectively estimate the spatial distribution of atmospheric aerosols and retrieve surface reflectance from remotely sensed imagery. The algorithm was developed base on the aerosol characteristics in the atmosphere and the algorithm is modified to accommodate the visible and thermal bands of Landsat TM5 image. We were obtained the atmospheric reflectance values by subtracting surface reflectance from the amount of reflectance measured from the satellite. The satellite recorded reflectance is the sum of the surface reflectance and atmospheric reflectance. The efficiency of the developed algorithm, in comparison to other forms of algorithm, will be investigated in this study. Based on the values of the correlation coefficient and root-mean-square deviation, the proposed algorithm is considered superior.

Electrical conductivity increases with the increase in the water volume fraction and percolation thresholds were observed. The critical volume fractions where the percolation thresholds appear depend on the type of oil used in the microemulsion formulation. Electrical conductivity was measured at different temperatures and the activation energy of conduction flow was evaluated. At the percolation threshold the activation energy of conduction flow reaches a minimum value.

In the past decade, adipose tissue has been shown to have endocrine functions regulating cardiovascular physiology. In the present review we will analyze current knowledge about adiponectin, the most abundant peptide secreted by adipocytes, with particular focus on its cardiovascular actions. Adiponectin secretion is inhibited by TNF-α and by catecholamines, and is stimulated by PPARγ activation. Adiponectin acts through two main receptors, AdipoRl and AdipoR2. In the liver, adiponectin modulates lipid and energy metabolism, stimulating fatty acid catabolism and reducing gluconeogenesis. In skeletal muscle, it promotes fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake. Taken together, the metabolic actions of adiponectin enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce circulating lipid levels. Adiponectin also has a protective effect against atherogenesis, acting on the endothelium and smooth muscle cells, raising NO secretion and inhibiting production of adhesion factors. In the heart, adiponectin inhibits cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, through poorly understood mechanisms. Adiponectin production has also been shown to be reduced in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, and its circulating levels have prognostic significance in various cardiovascular diseases. Finally, the role of this peptide as a therapeutic target has been evaluated, through various lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Weight loss, physical exercise, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and PPARα and PPARγ agonists enhance adiponectin production. Further studies are needed, however, to clarify the clinical relevance of adiponectin in the pathophysiology and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.","Adiponectin; Adipose tissue; Atherosclerosis; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity","adiponectin; adiponectin receptor 1; adiponectin receptor 2; catecholamine; losartan; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; ramipril; rimonabant; tumor necrosis factor alpha; atherosclerotic plaque; cachexia; cardiovascular disease; disease course; drug effect; dyslipidemia; endothelial dysfunction; foam cell; heart failure; heart hypertrophy; heart muscle fibrosis; human; inflammatory cell; insulin resistance; protein analysis; protein degradation; protein function; protein secretion; protein structure; review; Adipocytes; Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Atherosclerosis; Biological Markers; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Dyslipidemias; Endothelium, Vascular; Foam Cells; Humans; Receptors, Adiponectin",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58849156931

Similar to previous works addressing the encapsulation of molecular nitrogen in the endohedral cavities of carbon nanotubes we obtain, with increasing the number of encapsulated molecules, the formation of various non bonded molecular conformations namely, linear chains, zig-zag arrays, and several tubular helicoidal configurations. However, our density functional theory calculations reveal that the interaction potential between the encapsulated nitrogens and the internal surface of the carbon structure is not always repulsive for all our considered intermolecular distances. In fact, we have obtained the presence of a second energy minima in the N2-wall interaction energy curve, located near the inner surface, suggesting the possible existence of a more reactive carbon wall. For a single encapsulated nitrogen molecule, energy barriers of the order of 4 eV need to be overcome in order to achieve N2 adsorption to the carbon structure. However, we have found that with the close proximity of neighboring co-adsorbed nitrogens (a fact that naturally occurs at high densities of stored N2) these barriers are considerably lowered, favoring the existence of reaction paths through which adsorption to the internal surface could occur. Finally, by analyzing the electronic structure of our nitrogen containing carbon capsule we observe, with increasing the number of stored N2, the existence of sizable energy shifts and changes in the orbital nature of the highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals, which favours the possibility of having a sizable charge transfer and subsequent bond formation between the nitrogen species and the carbon wall. We believe that our results shed some new light into the properties of small molecules under extreme confinement and should be taken into account when analyzing the maximum storage capacity as well as the transport properties of nitrogen molecules encapsulated in carbon hollow nanostructures.

The guidelines initiated a review of each river to find good solutions-combinations of retention of water and increased spillway capacity. To comply with the guidelines, a dam-safety program undergoes in the country to rebuild a large number of dams to improve their safety-for higher design floods and also in many other respects. Technical solutions include dam reinforcement, spillway capacity increase and temporary storage of water in large reservoirs. Stenkullafors has a spillway with two gated overflow openings. Its revised design flood is 40% higher than its existing spillway capacity. Based on a cost-benefit analysis, modifying one spillway opening to a lower crest was chosen as the main measure to cope with the flow. Through hydraulic model tests, the spillway crest profile was optimized so as to achieve the required capacity on one hand and to minimize the cost of the spillway crest and the new gate on the other. The sill elevation in the right spillway opening was lowered by 4.3 m and a new higher tainter gate was installed. The dam has now been rebuilt to higher safety level. This paper addresses hydraulic model tests and the risk of flood occurrence during the construction time. Also, the construction process and difficulties that were encountered are described.

An adequate knowledge of the general features of EYM is therefore important, both from an academic and social point of view. In a previous study, we have shown that high-school students present the misconception that carbohydrates, especially glucose, are the sole metabolic fuel for ATP production by human cells. In the present work, we investigated the possible origins of the occurrence of this misconception among students. The analysis of students' answers to questionnaires indicated that the misconception appears as soon as in the 8th grade and remains unchanged throughout subsequent school years. The analysis of grade textbooks showed that the misconception is likely to be a consequence of the teaching of nutrition in the 8th grade, when a single function is emphasized for each nutrient. The energetic function is mainly associated with carbohydrates, while proteins and lipids are considered structural and storage molecules, respectively. An extreme similarity was observed between students' knowledge of nutrient's function and textbook contents. Analysis of high-school textbooks suggested that the misconception would be reinforced because of the detailed teaching only of glucose metabolism, with rare mention of lipids or amino acids as metabolic fuels. The consequences of that approach are discussed and suggestions are made on an alternative teaching of energy-yielding metabolism. © 2008 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.","Energy-yielding metabolism; Misconception; Textbooks analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57149095133

Animals can respond to changes in environmental conditions, through adjustments in the size of the funnels, the fluid stored inside the barrel, or the output flow through the spouts. In the present study, we investigate the interplay among these processes through the analysis of seasonal changes in organ size and metabolic rate in a lizard species (Liolaemus bellii) that inhabits extremely seasonal environments in the Andes range. We found that digestive organ size showed the greatest values during spring and summer, that is, during the foraging seasons. Energy reserves were larger during summer and autumn, and then decreased through winter and spring, which was correlated with overwintering maintenance and reproductive costs. Standard metabolic rate was greater during the high-activity seasons (spring and summer), but this increase was only noticeable at higher environmental temperatures. The ability of many lizard species to reduce their maintenance cost during the cold months of the year, beyond what is expected from temperature decrease, is probably related to their success in coping with highly fluctuating environments. Here, we demonstrate that this ability is correlated with high physiological flexibility, which allows animals to adjust energy acquisition, storing and expenditure processes according to current environmental conditions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Annual cycles; Fat bodies; Gut; Metabolism; Phenotypic plasticity","acclimatization; animal; article; body size; caloric intake; Chile; climate; digestive system; energy metabolism; environment; growth, development and aging; hibernation; lizard; metabolism; season; Acclimatization; Animals; Body Size; Chile; Climate; Digestive System; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Hibernation; Lizards; Seasons; Animalia; Liolaemus bellii; Squamata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54949091873

The world population growth rate is the major factor contributing for the increase in global pollution and energy and water consumption. In 2005, the world population was approximately 6.5 billion and this number is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050 [United Nations, 2008. www.un.org, accessed on July]. Water supply systems use energy for pumping water, so new strategies must be developed and implemented in order to reduce this consumption. In addition, if there is excess of hydraulic energy in a water system, some type of water power generation can be implemented. This paper presents an optimization model that determines the best hourly operation for 1 day, according to the electricity tariff, for a pumped storage system with water consumption and inlet discharge. Wind turbines are introduced in the system. The rules obtained as output of the optimization process are subsequently introduced in a hydraulic simulator, in order to verify the system behaviour.

A heat exchanger of thermal energy storage is used for separating two fluids, storage medium, and heat transfer fluid (HTF). There are two types of pipe in the heat exchanger, a vertical straight pipe and a helical coiled pipe. The experimental results were validated with the created mathematical model of nonsteady state heat exchanger. The highest storage efficiency is 0.631 at the HTF flow rate of 0.1 kg/s in a helical coiled pipe heat exchanger. The HTF and storage medium temperatures were measured for validating the model at various HTF flow rates. The agreement between model and experiment was presented with the error below 10%. This model is able to calculate the storage temperature of solar thermal power plants that performs in the liquid temperature range of selected HTF and storage medium.

Optimal commercial CA conditions (2.5% O2, 0.7% CO2, with pre-cooling and fruit from the optimal harvest date), browning-inducing CA conditions (1% O2, 10% CO2, using no pre-cooling and fruit from a late harvest) and two intermediate CA conditions (2.5% O2, 10% CO2 and 15% O2, 0.6% CO2, both including pre-cooling and fruit from the optimal harvest date) were evaluated. The combination of oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations, pre-cooling period and harvest time plays a key role in core breakdown presumably in the protein levels during controlled atmosphere storage of pears. Our results show that impaired respiration is highly related to protein synthesis alterations, and activation of defense mechanisms. Triosephosphate isomerase, a key enzyme of the energy metabolism was up-regulated under browning-inducing conditions in an attempt to use alternative more efficient anaplerotic pathways to cope with the applied stresses.

The TES system consists of a packed pebble bed in thermal contact with a heat transfer oil contained in a storage tank. An electrical hot plate simulates the collector/concentrator which heats up the oil circulating in a hollow copper spiral coil thus charging the storage. A model for the collector/concentrator system is developed to enable simulation of the feedforward IMC structure. Using a Simulink block model, the simulation results reveal that a feedforward IMC structure performs better than a feedforward structure. The feedforward IMC structure is tested experimentally and the performance of the control structure is acceptable within a few degrees of the set temperatures. Experimental results are also compared with the simulation results. The simulated responses are found to relate closely to the experimental ones and any discrepancies between the two are discussed. Furthermore, the feedforward IMC structure is also compared experimentally with a combined feedforward and PID feedback structure. Results of the comparison indicate that the feedforward IMC structure performs better than the combined feedforward and PID feedback structure. The thermal profile of the storage during the charging experiment with the feedforward IMC structure is also presented and the results obtained from the storage profile indicate that the storage tank is thermally stratified. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Application of thermal energy storage (TES) reduces cost and energy consumption. The efficiency of the overall operation is affected by storage tank sizing design, which affects thermal stratification of water during charging and discharging processes in TES system. In this study, numerical simulation is used to determine the relationship between tank size and good thermal stratification. Three dimensional simulations with different tank height-to-diameter ratio (HD) and inlet Reynolds number (Re) are investigated. The effect of the number of diffuser holes is also studied. For shallow tanks (low HD) simulations, no acceptable thermocline thickness can be seen for all Re experimented. Partial mixing is observed throughout the process. Medium HD tanks simulations show good thermocline behavior and clear distinction between warm and cold water can be seen. Finally, deep tanks (high HD) show less acceptable thermocline thickness as compared to that of medium HD tanks. From this study, doubling and halving the number of diffuser holes show no significant effect on the thermocline behavior. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The most successful design method to achieve an accurate capacitance matching employs a parallel arrangement of identical unit capacitors to implement each filter capacitor. However, this procedure can be directly applied only if the filter coefficients can be written as rational numbers, since each capacitor is implemented as an integer number of unit capacitors in parallel. This paper presents a systematic procedure, with low computational effort, to approximate the filter coefficients by integer ratios causing acceptable errors in the filter frequency response, whereas keeping the total number of unit capacitors small, in order to save die area. This procedure was applied in the design of a sixth-order SC band-pass filter, which has been fabricated in a 0.35 μm CMOS technology. The fabricated filter occupies an area of 0.913 mm 2, exhibits low sensitivity to fabrication process deviations and has an output dynamic range of 79.2 dB. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Capacitance matching; Design method; Switched-capacitor filters","Approximation algorithms; Capacitors; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric filters; Energy storage; Frequency response; Optical design; Paper capacitors; Switched filters; Systematic errors; Wave filters; Band-pass; Capacitance matching; CMOS technologies; Computational efforts; Design method; Design methods; Die area; Filter coefficients; Integer numbers; Rational numbers; SC filters; Switched-capacitor; Switched-capacitor filters; Systematic procedure; Capacitance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849140171

The experiences of ten European SMEs who have tried to use Stepwise EPDs for market communication and as a basis for eco-design are described and discussed. The experiences suggest that Stepwise EPDs based on life cycle assessment can be a cost-efficient tool to improve the environmental performance of products. For normal marketing activities the Stepwise EPDs were disappointing.

Exposure to chronic stress can promote the development of physiological and behavioral dysfunctions, including alterations in feeding behavior. The aim of this study was to verify whether chronic restraint stress alters the consumption of a highly palatable, highly caloric diet (chocolate), chronically offered to the animals. Male rats ate more chocolate than females, and they also exhibited a higher weight gain, abdominal fat deposition, and higher plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and glucose. The stress exposure decreased body weight, increased adrenal weight and decreased plasma insulin levels. Overall, female rats had lower plasma insulin levels and chocolate consumption prevented the increased adrenal gland weight after exposure to chronic stress, suggesting a reduction of stress effects induced by palatable food consumption. Taken together, these results suggest a peculiar metabolic pattern, related to energy store and expenditure, in stressed animals receiving a palatable diet. Since these effects were sex-specific, we may also propose that females and males subjected to restraint stress and chocolate consumption are differentially affected. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The Hunter color parameters (L, a, b), hue angle (h), and total color difference (TCD) were used to estimate the color changes of paprika during thermal treatment at different temperatures (60, 80 and 99 °C) and water activities (0.459, 0.582 and 0.703). The changes in L, a, b and TCD values were significantly influenced by the processing time, temperature and water activity. The color changes during processing and storage were described by a first order kinetic model. The temperature dependence of the degradation followed the Arrhenius relation. Samples with a high water activity exhibited a high rate constant of the color degradation. The effect of water activity on activation energy was not significant. A linear relationship between the water activity and rate constant of the color parameters was found. By incorporating the linear relationship krefaw into the Arrhenius equation, a modified Arrhenius equation was proposed which was used to predict paprika color changes as influenced by temperature and water activity. © 2007 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.","Color; Kinetics; Paprika; Water activity","Activation energy; Chemical activation; Color; Colorimetry; Data storage equipment; Degradation; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Heat treatment; Optical properties; Parameter estimation; Rate constants; Sulfate minerals; Water treatment; Arrhenius relations; Color changing; Color degradation; Color differences; Color parameters; Effect of water; First order kinetic; high rates; High water; hue angle; Linear relationships; nove l approach; Processing Time; Temperature dependences; water activities; Water recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47649088260

For the proposed reactor system, the solar energy absorbed by flat plate collectors was transferred to a heat storage tank, which continuously supplied an anaerobic-filter reactor with water at a maximum temperature of 35 °C. The packed reactor was a metallic cylindrical tank with a peripheral twin-wall enclosure. Inside this enclosure was circulated warm water from the heat storage tank. Furthermore, a mathematical model was developed for the prediction of the temperature distribution within the reactor under steady state conditions. Preliminary results based on model simulations performed with meteorological data from various geographical regions of the world suggested that the proposed solar reactor system could be a promising and environmentally friendly approach for anaerobic treatment of wastewater and biological sludge. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of thermal treatment on the HMF content of honeydew and floral honey during the isothermal heating process at mild temperatures. Water content, formol number, total acidity, pH value and minerals were also determined in both honey types as their characteristics differ with composition, which is able to affect the rate of HMF formation. Potassium content and pH value were found as the distinguishing properties and both were greater in honeydew honey than in floral honey (p&lt;0.01). Honeydew and floral honey samples were heated at 75, 90 and 100 °C for 15-90 min and analysed for HMF content by HPLC-RP. The Arrhenius model was used to calculate reaction rate constants and activation energies which were found to be different for each of the honey types. Heating at 90 °C for up to 90 min in floral honeys and up to 75 min in honeydew honeys did not cause a significant increase of HMF and not exceed the threshold level of 40 mg kg-1.

A needle of ∼30 μm diameter is positioned on-axis right behind the foil, creating a radial electric field that deflects the secondary electrons radially outward so as to miss the sample and to hit the micro-channel plate (MCP) detector placed down beam. The MCP signal provides the start signal for the positron lifetime spectrometer. A grid can be further introduced between the sample holder and the MCP to yield a cleaner signal by preventing the positrons with large transmitted scattering angle from hitting the MCP.

Modeling of those layers is done using linear design method and a simulation software. Such chirped structures are fabricated by an anodization process. Samples are prepared on mono and multicrystalline silicon substrates with 15, 40, 60, and 80 layers. The reflectance spectra of such prepared porous reflectors are evaluated and the results show an increase in bandwidth of over 50% of the total width in comparison with the conventional, unchirped reflectors. We demonstrate clear advantages of introducing chirped multilayer structures over conventional ones.

In particular, they see it as a critical component for the dispatch of wind and other renewable power. The technology involves storing off-peak-generated energy in the form of compressed air, usually in an underground reservoir. It gained momentum during the next decade because of its promising thermal efficiency and response capabilities for providing load-following and peaking power support. But since the commissioning of the only two existing CAES plants in the world, the 290-Mw Huntorf plant in north Germany in 1978 and the 110-Mw Alabama Electric Corp plant in McIntosh, AL, in 1991, CAES developments have been rare. One reason for this is that setting up a CAES facility is pricey and requires finding a geologic formation that can support it. CAES plants work like big batteries. Electric motors drive compressors that compress air (at perhaps 1100 psi) into an underground geologic formation during off-peak hours. When the electricity is needed most, the precompressed air is used in modified combustion turbines to generate electricity. Natural gas or other fossil fuels are still required to run the turbines, but the process is more efficient, using up to 50% less natural gas than standard production, according to Sandia National Laboratories.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56649091525

In this work, carbon black (type N220) was used as a filler, and its loading was varied from 0 to 50 phr. The mechanical properties (e.g., the tensile strength and catastrophic tearing energy) increased with a filler loading up to a certain loading, and a decrease in the mechanical properties was observed with higher filler loadings. The tensile strength and catastrophic tearing energy of the aged samples decreased after 3 and 6 days of aging at 100°C. The results for the electrical conductivity properties of unaged samples showed a percolation threshold at 20 phr, and the values were consistent with further filler loadings. After aging, the percolation threshold was still maintained at 20 phr. The morphologies of unaged and aged samples were significantly different: holes were observed to occur in the aged samples.

In Experiment (Exp.) 1, a total of 220 pigs weaned at 22 ± 1.7 d and 6 ± 1.2 kg of body weight were used; Exp. 2 included 64 animals weaned at 20 ± 0.9 d and 6 ± 1.1 kg of body weight. Pigs in Exp. 1 were randomized in a Complete Block Design with 11 replicates (pens of five pigs) per treatment. In Exp. 2, pigs were completely randomized to four replicates (pens of four pigs) per treatment. Raw canola oil (Exp. 1), and tallow (Exp. 2), was used as supplementary energy sources; storage of these ingredients (49 days) was under weaning room conditions (27-32 °C and 87-100% relative humidity) to favor oxidation. Dietary treatments were in both experiments: (1) control (CON); (2) addition of vitamin C, 150 mg/kg and no β-carotene (VC); (3) addition of β-carotene, 350 mg/kg and no vitamin C (βC), and (4) vitamin C, 150 mg/kg and β-carotene, 350 mg/kg (VCβC). Peroxides were determined for canola oil, tallow and diets, while vitamin C and β-carotene were measured only in the final diets. Productive performance was measured in both experiments, Exp. 1 for 24 days and 20 days for Exp 2. In Exp. 1, blood samples were collected from two pigs per pen to determine thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. In Exp. 1, there were no differences (P>0.130) in average daily feed intake (AFI: 395, 369, 384 and 400 g/d), average daily gain (ADG: 301, 278, 301 and 304 g/d) and feed efficiency (G:F: 769, 758, 783 and 760 g/d), for CON, VC, βC and VCβC treatments, respectively. The GSH-Px activity (P>0.390) and TBARS (P>0.179) in plasma were not different between treatments. In Exp. 2, VC and βC diets apparently reduced AFI (interaction, P<0.05), while a transient β-carotene effect (P<0.05) was evident in ADG during the second half of the experiment (270 vs. 240 g/d), thus resulting in a slight numerical difference in favor of β-carotene and vitamin C dietary additions in G:F. Lack of a clear response to the experimental antioxidants may be explained by the presence in surplus amounts of vitamin E and selenium, plus the regular addition of inorganic antioxidant compounds. Results from the current research do not justify vitamin C and/or β-carotene inclusion to weanling pig diets since no animal performance or antioxidant effect was demonstrated. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Gostauto 12, LT-01108 Vilnius, Lithuania","We present a FORTRAN90 program GCFP for the calculation of the generalized coefficients of fractional parentage (generalized CFPs or GCFP). The approach is based on the observation that the multi-shell CFPs can be expressed in terms of single-shell CFPs, while the latter can be readily calculated employing a simple enumeration scheme of antisymmetric A-particle states and an efficient method of construction of the idempotent matrix eigenvectors. The program provides fast calculation of GCFPs for a given particle number and produces results possessing numerical uncertainties below the desired tolerance. A single j-shell is defined by four quantum numbers, (e, l, j, t). A supplemental C++ program parGCFP allows calculation to be done in batches and/or in parallel. Program summary: Program title: GCFP, parGCFP. Catalogue identifier: AEBI_v1_0. Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEBI_v1_0.html.

No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 17 199. No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 88 658. Distribution format: tar.gz. Programming language: FORTRAN 77/90 (GCFP), C++ (parGCFP). Computer: Any computer with suitable compilers. The program GCFP requires a FORTRAN 77/90 compiler. The auxiliary program parGCFP requires GNU-C++ compatible compiler, while its parallel version additionally requires MPI-1 standard libraries. Operating system: Linux (Ubuntu, Scientific) (all programs), also checked on Windows XP (GCFP, serial version of parGCFP). RAM: The memory demand depends on the computation and output mode. If this mode is not 4, the program GCFP demands the following amounts of memory on a computer with Linux operating system. It requires around 2 MB of RAM for the A = 12 system at Ex ≤ 2. Computation of the A = 50 particle system requires around 60 MB of RAM at Ex = 0 and ∼ 70 MB at Ex = 2 (note, however, that the calculation of this system will take a very long time). If the computation and output mode is set to 4, the memory demands by GCFP are significantly larger. Calculation of GCFPs of A = 12 system at Ex = 1 requires 145 MB. The program parGCFP requires additional 2.5 and 4.5 MB of memory for the serial and parallel version, respectively. Classification: 17.18. Nature of problem: The program GCFP generates a list of two-particle coefficients of fractional parentage for several j-shells with isospin. Solution method: The method is based on the observation that multishell coefficients of fractional parentage can be expressed in terms of single-shell CFPs [1]. The latter are calculated using the algorithm [2,3] for a spectral decomposition of an antisymmetrization operator matrix Y. The coefficients of fractional parentage are those eigenvectors of the antisymmetrization operator matrix Y that correspond to unit eigenvalues. A computer code for these coefficients is available [4]. The program GCFP offers computation of two-particle multishell coefficients of fractional parentage. The program parGCFP allows a batch calculation using one input file. Sets of GCFPs are independent and can be calculated in parallel. Restrictions:A &lt; 86 when Ex = 0 (due to the memory constraints); small numbers of particles allow significantly higher excitations, though the shell with j ≥ 11 / 2 cannot get full (it is the implementation constraint). Unusual features: Using the program GCFP it is possible to determine allowed particle configurations without the GCFP computation. The GCFPs can be calculated either for all particle configurations at once or for a specified particle configuration. The values of GCFPs can be printed out with a complete specification in either one file or with the parent and daughter configurations printed in separate files. The latter output mode requires additional time and RAM memory. It is possible to restrict the (J, T) values of the considered particle configurations. (Here J is the total angular momentum and T is the total isospin of the system.) The program parGCFP produces several result files the number of which equals to the number of particle configurations. To work correctly, the program GCFP needs to be compiled to read parameters from the standard input (the default setting). Running time: It depends on the size of the problem. The minimum time is required, if the computation and output mode (CompMode) is not 4, but the resulting file is larger. A system with A = 12 particles at Ex = 0 (all 9411 GCFPs) took around 1 sec on a Pentium4 2.8 GHz processor with 1 MB L2 cache. The program required about 14 min to calculate all 1.3 × 106 GCFPs of Ex = 1. The time for all 5.5 × 107 GCFPs of Ex = 2 was about 53 hours. For this number of particles, the calculation time of both Ex = 0 and Ex = 1 with CompMode = 1 and 4 is nearly the same, when no other processes are running. The case of Ex = 2 could not be calculated with CompMode = 4, because the RAM memory was insufficient. In general, the latter CompMode requires a longer computation time, although the resulting files are smaller in size. The program parGCFP puts virtually no time overhead. Its parallel version speeds-up the calculation. However, the results need to be collected from several files created for each configuration. References:. [1] J.

These characteristics in mind an imaginable energy system setup can be explored with the framework. In a case study the possible coverage of the global energy demand, by solar- and wind power in junction with a backup technology is treated. Design/methodology/approach - Spatially and temporally high disaggregated data describing different aspects of the energy supply side (especially devoted to renewable resources and related availabilities) as well as the energy demand side are investigated. This information is processed to serve as input for the TIMES model generator in a special adapted model. The complete workflow is enclosed in a graphical user interface implemented as a plugin in the software package ArGIS. Findings - The elaborated case study shows the practicability ofthe approach to treat spatially and temporally high disaggregated problems in the energy system. Especially sensibilities of an optimal system setup in dependency on assumptions on specific costs for energy transport or storage can be investigated in a very detailed manner. Research limitations/implications - Since the spatial and temporal disaggregated examination implies the treatment of huge datasets, simplifications have to be made in the description of the technological setup of the energy system. The approach is appropriate to describe single scenario set-ups but not a complete forecast based system development. Originality/value - Geographic information systems (GIS) and geographic information are tied together with a conventional modeling approach of energy systems. That enables the cognition and quantification of influences and sensibilities related to spatial and temporal deviations in our energy system either on the supply or the demand side.","Energy; Geographic information systems; Renewable energy","Competition; Computer systems; Electric load forecasting; Energy management; Geographic information systems; Graphical user interfaces; Insulating materials; Renewable energy resources; Wind power; Case studies; Conventional modeling; Data-sets; Design/methodology/approach; Energy; Energy demands; Energy sectors; Energy supplies; Energy systems; Energy transports; Geographic information; Global energy demand; Model framework; Model generator; Modeling approaches; Operational research; Renewable energy; Renewable resources; Set-ups; System development; System set-up; Temporal characteristics; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53349144007

Lysine contents in potatoes are similar to animal protein and its flour can be utilized to overcome protein and calorie malnutrition. Design/methodology/approach - Composite flours were prepared by substituting wheat flour with potato flour at 20 per cent, with guar gum 3 per cent and GMS at 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0. The blends were subject to proximate analysis and calorific value determination. Naan prepared from composite flours were evaluated by panel of judges to access suitable level of supplementation. Findings - Statistical analysis revealed significant decrease in moisture, protein, crude fiber while increase in the fat content of composite flour. Replacement of wheat flour by potato flour has non significant effect on the ash and carbohydrates contents nitrogen free extract (NFE). Moisture, protein and fat contents decreased significantly with the passage of time during storage while crude fiber, ash content and NFE were found to be non-significantly affected by duration of storage. Potato flour at 20 per cent level of substitution along with 3 per cent guar gum and 0.6 per cent GMS was found to be acceptable by panel of judges having maximum acceptability of naan. Practical implications - Potato flour supplementation can be done through roller flour mills or small scale grinders (chakki) to enhance the value of flour to be used by masses in order to overcome the protein malnutrition as quantity of potato flour protein is comparable to animal protein. Originality/value - Presently potatoes are consumed as vegetable and during peak season processed into flour, starch and dried products. Potato flour is rarely used for the production of baked products in Pakistan. Potatoes are rich in starch, vitamin B1, and vitamin B2, ash content, fiber content and essential amino acids as compared to cereals. Thus potato flour can utilized to improve the energy status of masses. Research conducted was unique in its nature as effect of both storage periods was evaluated and the suitable levels of replacement of potato flour were investigated.","Food products; Nutrition; Pakistan","Animalia; Cyamopsis tetragonoloba; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53249086000

The energy management algorithms aim at the reliable and effective control of the energy flow that is basically used to meet the load requirements of the autonomous system. The developed simulated algorithms were compared to each other in order to determine the most efficient strategy as far as hydrogen production and autonomy are of concern.

The use of color, shape, digital sound processing and voice signal altogether are investigated in this work. The color detection is based on the color histogram and shape detection is based on edge map histogram. Sound characteristics are resolved with the extraction of seven characteristics: short time average energy, zero-crossing rate, energy band ratio, delta spectral magnitude, root mean square of square sum of signals, high sounds and low value characteristics ratios.

The optimal capacitor placement for injecting reactive power into a power system yields the highest system power factor, decrease in total generation cost and total system losses. The optimal power flow is used to compute the optimal system operating point at the lowest total generation cost under the normal steady state condition. After that, the sensitivity analysis is applied to evaluate the change of total generation cost with respect to the change of reactive power at any bus to determine the optimal location of the capacitor banks. The method of optimal power flow sensitivity is simple but powerful. This method greatly reduces the computational work of computing optimal power flow for several different systems in which capacitors are to be installed. The sensitivity technique is applied to 5-bus and 9-bus test systems.

To avoid these problems, his paper proposes a new anti-resonance active system for power capacitors. The proposed active system is composed of a power electronics current converter connected in series with the power factor capacitors.

The endurance of such equipment is defined by the durability of their internal sensitive components. In this study, vibration induced fatigue life analysis of an axial leaded aluminium capacitor is performed. Three point bending tests are performed for the composite FR-4 printed circuit boards (PCBs) material in order to determine bending modulus. Experimental modal analysis is used to validate a simulation model of the PCB. Step stress tests (SSTs) of reinforced and unreinforced capacitors which are mounted on the test PCBs are performed. It is found that the failure locations on the test PCBs are compatible among themselves and all the failures are due to flexure stress developed at the lead wires and solder joints. Numerical fatigue analyses are performed to define failure in terms of damage index. In addition, the Weibull model is used to define mean time to failure (MTTF) values. The comparison between MTTF values shows that the fatigue lives are strongly increased by the eccobond reinforcement. The last stage in this work is to focus on the influence of some design parameters on the fatigue life. An exponential equation is proposed to find the relation between lead-wire diameter and the fatigue damage. It is shown that fatigue damage becomes a maximum for a square shaped PCB and it appears that component body diameter is more effective than the body length in increasing fatigue life. © Journal Compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Accelerated life testing; Failure; Printed circuit boards; Vibration fatigue","Aluminum cladding; Amplifiers (electronic); Bending (deformation); Bending tests; Capacitance; Capacitors; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Damage detection; Dielectric devices; Durability; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electronic equipment; Electronic equipment manufacture; Energy storage; Fatigue of materials; Lattice vibrations; Lead; Light metals; Military applications; Military engineering; Modal analysis; Oscillators (electronic); Pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Printed circuit boards; Printed circuit manufacture; Printed circuits; Reinforcement; Soil structure interactions; Stresses; Structural dynamics; Testing; Vibrations (mechanical); Wire; Accelerated life testing; Bending modulus; Damage indices; Design Parameters; Electronic components; Experimental Modal Analysis; Exponential equations; Failure; Failure locations; Fatigue analyses; Fatigue life analysis; Fatigue-life; Flexure stresses; Harsh environments; Mean-time-to-failure; Mech anical fatigue; Random vibrations; Sensitive components; Simulation modelling; Solder joints; Step-stress; Three-point bending tests; Vibration fatigue; Weibull models; Wire diameters; Fatigue damage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52649165228

A brief overview is provided of the energy use and carbon emissions associated with the smelting of the major metals from their ores or concentrates. Generic alternative smelting technologies are considered for each metal where available. Carbon emissions for any given metal are similar for different processes when those emissions associated with the generation of electric power from coal are considered. However, if electric power can be sourced from generation methods without significant carbon emissions, a shift in smelting technologies from carbothermic reduction processes to electrothermic or electrochemical reduction processes can in most cases reduce carbon emissions to minor levels and meet future needs for low emission smelting technologies. This shift would effectively move carbon emission control from the smelting operations to power generation where it can probably be most efficiently handled. With the growing concern about climate change and the corresponding demand to reduce the production of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide in particular, It seems inevitable that In the near future a cost will be placed on the emission of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This must lead to a long-term shift away from an economy based on the use of fossil fuels. There Is much debate on replacement energy technologies, whether they are renewable energy forms, or geothermal energy or nuclear power. Carbon capture and storage may also prolong the use of fossil fuels but at considerable additional cost. Fuels will still be required as a convenient and manageable means of storing energy for use In transportation and all forms of mobile equipment, although future fuels may not all be sourced from fossil oil supplies, but may in part be biofuels or may be hydrogen, generated from the thermal or electrolytic decomposition of water.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56649091363

The unusual configuration requiring the storage of water in an elevated reservoir for filling peak power demand was needed to enable visitors to the Falls to see a reasonable water flow during peak demand times. During periods of low power demand, some power from the main plant runs ""pump generators"". These devices pump some water from the upstream end of the forebay into a storage reservoir on the hill above the pump generating plant. During peak demand periods, the water flows by gravity back through the pump generators, which then operate as generators to provide additional electricity to the power grid. The water returns to the forebay and to the main generating plant. At this time, both the main plant and the pump generating plant can be operating at full capacity.

An acrylic phantom containing 12 cylindrical holes of known volume was used to test the tomography measurement system. In order to improve the quality of tomography images, two procedures were used, namely, 'subtraction of dark image' and 'correction of light field', as well as a sequence of filters such as the median and the Gaussian. Image processing techniques were used for the segmentation of flaws in the CT images. The Marching Cubes algorithm was used in the visualisation process and the Decimation algorithm was used to obtain volume and surface area measurements of flaws. The programs were developed in C++ and Java, using the VTK - Visualisation Toolkit library.

To what extent an improvement of glucose tolerance shortly after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGBP) is reflected in lipid levels in liver and skeletal muscle, markers of insulin resistance, has not been clarified. Methods: Whole-body MRI and MR spectroscopy (MRS) of liver and muscle and measurements of biochemical markers of glucose and lipid metabolism were performed at baseline and 1, 6, and 12 months following surgery in seven morbidly obese women. Volumes of adipose tissue depots and liver and muscle lipids were assessed from the MRI/MRS data. Results: At 1 month postoperatively, body mass index and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues were reduced by 9%, 26%, and 10%, respectively, whereas no reductions in intrahepatocellular or skeletal intramyocellular lipid concentrations were found. Free fatty acid and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were elevated two- and sixfold, respectively; glucose and insulin levels were lowered, indicating increased insulin sensitivity. Further weight loss up to 1 year was associated with reductions in all investigated lipid depots investigated, with the exception of the intramyocellular compartment. Conclusion: RYGBP causes rapid lipid mobilization from visceral and subcutaneous adipose depots and enhanced free fatty acid flux to the liver. An exceptional disconnection between liver fat and insulin sensitivity occurs in the early dynamic phase after surgery. However, in the late phase, the energy restriction imposed by the surgical procedure also reduces the liver lipids, but not the intramyocellular lipids. © 2008 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Adiponectin; Free fatty acids; Gastric bypass; Hepatic lipids; Insulin; Leptin","3 hydroxybutyric acid; biochemical marker; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; lipid; adipose tissue; adult; article; bariatric surgery; body mass; clinical article; fatty acid blood level; female; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; human; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intraabdominal fat; intracellular space; lipid analysis; lipid blood level; lipid liver level; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; liver level; morbid obesity; muscle level; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; postoperative period; priority journal; Roux Y anastomosis; stomach bypass; subcutaneous fat; weight reduction; whole body MRI; Adiposity; Adult; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gastric Bypass; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Mobilization; Liver; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Obesity, Morbid; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53849108133

The mother influences the original inoculum and the development of infant microbiota, which in turn is associated with later weight gain. Objective: We characterized the gut microbiota in women according to their body mass index (BMI) and the effect of weight gain over pregnancy on the composition of microbiota before delivery. Design: Overweight women (n = 18) were selected according to their prepregnancy BMI from a prospective follow-up study. Normal-weight women (n = 36) were selected as controls in consecutive order of recruitment. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy was defined as > 16.0 kg for normal-weight and > 11.5 kg for overweight states according to Institute of Medicine recommendations. The composition of gut microbiota was analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization coupled with flow cytometry (FCM-FISH) and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results: Bacteroides and Staphylococcus were significantly higher in the overweight state than in normal-weight women as assessed by FCM-FISH and qPCR. Mother's weight and BMI before pregnancy correlated with higher concentrations of Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Staphylococcus. Microbial counts increased from the first to third trimester of pregnancy. High Bacteroides concentrations were associated with excessive weight gain over pregnancy (P = 0.014). Conclusions: Gut microbiota composition and weight are linked, and mother's weight gain is affected by microbiota.

The RR increased from 9 ± 1 to 26 ± 3, 10 ± 1 to 53 ± 2, 11 ± 1 to 55 ± 2, and 18 ± 1 to 75 ± 3 mL of O2 per kilogram hour for whole, sliced, baton, and shredded carrots, respectively, as the temperature increased from 4 to 20°C. On an average, RO2 and RCO2 were increased by 85% and 64%, 100% and 72%, and 151% and 124% for sliced, baton, and shredded carrots, respectively, compared to the RR values of whole carrots. The temperature dependence of RR followed an Arrhenius-type relationship for all types of carrots, with activation energies in the range of 35 ± 3 to 62 ± 2 kJ/mol. Type of cut was the major factor for both RO2 and RCO2, with shredded carrots having the highest rates and whole carrots the lowest. RR of whole carrots did not vary during storage, whereas it increased for cut carrots and especially for shredded carrots. The respiratory quotient (RQ) increased with temperature and did not vary during storage in all types of carrots, except the RQ of whole carrots decreased significantly over time. © 2008 Institute of Food Technologists®.","Food quality; Fresh-cut fruits and vegetables; Modified atmosphere packaging; Respiration rate; Temperature abuse","carbon dioxide; article; carrot; food handling; kinetics; metabolism; methodology; oxygen consumption; temperature; theoretical model; thermodynamics; Carbon Dioxide; Daucus carota; Food Handling; Kinetics; Models, Theoretical; Oxygen Consumption; Temperature; Thermodynamics; Daucus carota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53549093556

In this work we provide, for the first time, a detailed ultrastructural description of the spermatozoa of B. alternatus and B. diporus and discuss its possible relation to their reproductive features. Sperm was obtained from the vas deferens, and was processed to obtain transmission electron micrographs and fluorescence micrographs. Spermatozoa of these species show similar morphological traits, which are closely related to the general model described for the Serpentes. Furthermore, several synapomorphies for the squamates can be identified in these cells.

Poly(ethylene oxide)/lauric acid and poly(ethylene oxide)/stearic acid blends show high values of heat of melting and heat of crystallisation which exceed theoretically determined values - it is a synergistic effect that is advantageous in terms of energy storage. The PEO blends were investigated by PLM, SEM, AFM, WAXD, SAXS and 1H NMR techniques - PLM, SEM and AFM allows to observe regions, in which parallelly-packed crystals of fatty acid are present. WAXD results of PEO/fatty acid blends confirmed hindered crystallization of PEO in PEO/fatty acid blends and, finally, lower degree of polymer crystallinity. The NMR study shows that mixing of PEO and lauric acid results in an increase of PEO amorphous phase content in blends as compared to the pure PEO. From FTIR spectra, taken during melting and crystallization, it can be seen that for both investigated blends in the solid state there is only one maximum of band from ν(C{double bond, long}O) (in position indicating that C{double bond, long}O groups are engaged in formation of hydrogen bonds), while in the liquid state there are two maxima - position of the first maximum is characteristic for ν(C{double bond, long}O) vibrations of C{double bond, long}O groups that do not participate in formation of hydrogen bond, whereas position of the second maximum in the liquid state proves the presence of C{double bond, long}O groups involved in formation of hydrogen bonds.

The kinetics of polymerization are complex. The special case of indirectly curing the thin layler of composite below the metallic bracket base further increases this complexity. It was hypothesized that the concept of ""total energy,""-the reciprocity between power density and exposure duration-does not hold for orthodontic light-cure bracket bonding. Methods: Stainless steel brackets were bonded on deciduous bovine incisors with a standard light-cured composite. A calibrated, powerful halogen lamp allowed for modification of power density from 300 to 3000 mW/cm2. Metallic brackets were bonded in 8 groups of 20 incisors each with various combinations of power densities and exposure durations to obtain 3 levels of energy density (6000, 12000, and 24000 mJ/cm2). Another group of 20 incisors served as the positive control with a conventional powerful halogen lamp (1000 mW/cm2) for 40 seconds. After storage for 24 hours at 37°C in water, the bracket shear bond strength (SBS) and the adhesive remnant index (ARI) were measured. Results: It was confirmed that bracket SBS mainly depends on the energy density of the light cure. All groups with an energy density of 6000 mJ/cm2 had significantly lower SBS than the groups with higher energy densities (P &lt;0.01). The dependence of SBS on exposure duration for the same energy density followed an exponential model of nonlinear regression (r2 = 0.98). Conclusions: The concept of ""total energy"" does not hold for orthodontic light-cure bracket bonding. An exposure time of less than 4 seconds, irrespective of the power density, cannot guarantee sufficient bracket bond strength. There seems to be an advantage of power density over exposure duration in the context of metallic bracket bonding. These results show that, for an efficient light-cure bracket bonding, there is an absolute lower limit of exposure duration (4 seconds) and an upper limit of useful power density (3000 mW/cm2). © 2008 American Association of Orthodontists.",,"resin cement; stainless steel; Transbond XT; analysis of variance; animal; article; cattle; dental bonding; dental care; kinetics; light; orthodontic device; phase transition; radiation exposure; regression analysis; shear strength; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Cattle; Dental Bonding; Dental Stress Analysis; Kinetics; Light; Orthodontic Brackets; Phase Transition; Regression Analysis; Resin Cements; Shear Strength; Stainless Steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53049095253

Special emphasis is put on the ramp-up of CCS with respect to timing of investments and requirement of corresponding CO2 transportation and storage infrastructure. The investigation comprises scenario analysis through modeling possible development of the electricity supply system for EU25 and together with a more detailed analysis of Northern Europe (Germany, UK, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway). The modeling has been carried out with a techno-economic model (minimizing the system cost) including a detailed description of the present stationary European electricity generation system as obtained from the Chalmers Energy Infrastructure database. It is concluded that CCS can play a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions at a cost in the range of 20-60 €/t over the period studied. In EU25 as much as 39 Gt CO2 may be captured over the period 2020-2050 implying a steep ramp-up, i.e. most CCS capacity is added during the first two decades after 2020 from which it is assumed to be commercially available. Corresponding capture in Germany and UK amounts to 9 and 4 Gt, respectively. The analysis show that a transportation infrastructure can be put in place for about 2-5 €/t CO2. However, the steep ramp-up obtained from the model obviously do not take into account other issues which must be resolved for a large scale implementation of CCS. Examples of such issues are discussed in the paper and concern establishment of a legal framework regulating subsurface storage of CO2, inclusion of captured CO2 in the European Union emission trading scheme and issues related to fuel markets and fuel supply to accommodate an increased use of coal as a fuel. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper concentrates on the transport of CO2 between source (CO2 capture at plants) and sink (geological storage reservoirs). In the cost estimation of CO2 transport, the pipeline diameter plays an important role. In this respect, the paper reviews equations that were used in several reports on CO2 pipeline transport. As some parameters are not taken into account in these equations, alternative formulas are proposed which calculate the proper inner diameter size based on flow rate, pressure drop per unit length, CO2 density, CO2 viscosity, pipeline material roughness and topographic height differences (the Darcy-Weisbach solution) and, in addition, on the amount and type of bends (the Manning solution). Comparison between calculated diameters using the reviewed and the proposed equations demonstrate the important influence of elevation difference (which is not considered in the reviewed equations) and pipeline material roughness-related factor on the calculated diameter. Concerning the latter, it is suggested that a Darcy-Weisbach roughness height of 0.045 mm better corresponds to a Manning factor of 0.009 than higher Manning values previously proposed in literature. Comparison with the actual diameter of the Weyburn pipeline confirms the accuracy of the proposed equations. Comparison with other existing CO2 pipelines (without pressure information) indicate that the pipelines are designed for lower pressure gradients than 25 Pa/m or for (future) higher flow rates. The proposed Manning equation is implemented in an economic least-cost route planner in order to obtain the best economic solution for pipeline trajectory and corresponding diameter. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Even though CO2 price caps or ""safety valves"" have been suggested as methods to limit uncertainty emanating from fluctuating prices of CO2 permits that would hurt the industry's profit and thereby also energy security, our analysis shows that price caps set at a too low level are detrimental to the adoption of e.g. modern biomass-fired capacity as a replacement for existing coal-fired power plants. We therefore conduct a series of experiments with different policy scenarios to analyze under which regime emissions are most effectively reduced. With respect to CO2 price uncertainty, it turns out that even for moderately rising CO2 prices, fluctuations frequently lead to investment into carbon capture and storage (CCS), while investment is often not triggered in the face of deterministic CO2 prices. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Surface plasmon resonance effect causes two contrary phenomena. Thus, if in the vicinity of the Tb(III) emission centers are present nanoparticles of Ag, observed is additional improvement of the Tb(III) emission. While, presence of Au nanostructures in the silica doped with Tb(III) causes quenching of the luminescence.

Effective way to minimise the moisture of energy plants is to keep them harvested in the storage. The stems of the topinambours cut in autumn reaches 20% moisture content in 11 days, the sunflowers-in a month. Physical-mechanical characteristics of chopped stems-angles of fall and natural crumble, is important for construction of stores of chopped mass. These angles of large-stalked plants, chopped by forage combines E-281C and Krone-Big varied marginally: angle of fall-from 74° to 82°, angle of natural crumble-from 45° to 47°. There were investigations on main physical-mechanical characteristics of chopping quality of bioenergy plants. Chopping quality of topinambours and sunflowers, chopped by the stationary fodder chopper SPP-1 was sufficient high, and we recommend this chopper to chop the bioenergy plants.

Minced pork samples (100 g) were packed using two types of packaging films: (a) a common food film with high permeability (HPF) and (b) a film with low permeability (LPF). The respiratory activity of meat microflora and the use of a LPF resulted in a modified atmosphere in the package headspace developed during storage. Oxygen concentration decreased from 18.7% (after packaging) to 7% (after 15 days of storage) in packages with LPF, stored at 0 °C, while CO2 increased from 3% to 10.5%, respectively. On the contrary, no significant atmosphere changes were observed during storage of HPF packages. The self-developed modified atmosphere in LPF packages resulted in a significant inhibition of pseudomonad growth which was more pronounced at low storage temperatures. For example, during storage at 0 °C, the growth rate of pseudomonads in meat packed with LPF was reduced by 48.7% compared to HPF. At 10 °C the latter reduction decreased to 13.7%. LPF packaging was also found to inhibit the growth of Brochothrix thermosphacta but this inhibition was weaker compared to pseudomonads. The effect of storage temperature on the growth rate of pseudomonads and B. thermosphacta in minced pork packed with the different films was modeled using an Arrhenius equation. For both bacteria, the activation energy was higher for LPF packaging. This can be attributed to the increased inhibitory effect of the modified atmosphere at lower storage temperature. The Arrhenius model was further used to evaluate the effect of temperature on the time required by the two bacteria to reach a spoilage level of 107 CFU/g. The results showed that when LPF packaging is combined with effective temperature control the time-to-spoilage can be significantly extended compared to HPF packaging. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

PCM storage designs have been proposed, but no detailed evaluation has been made of the actual contribution of the PCM to the total heat storage under typical end-use conditions. In this work annual simulations were done to compare the performance of a storage tank with PCM to a standard tank without PCM. A model was constructed to describe the heat storage tank with and without PCM, the collector, pump, controller and auxiliary heater. Realistic environmental conditions and typical end-user requirements were imposed. Annual simulations were carried out for different sites, load profiles, different PCM volume fractions, and different kinds of PCM. The results of all simulation scenarios indicate that, contrary to expectations, the use of PCM in the storage tank does not yield a significant benefit in energy provided to the end-user. The main reason for this undesirable effect is found to be increased heat losses during nighttime due to reheating of the water by the PCM. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve decentralization, in each control area, the connections between this area and the rest of the system and the effects of possible contracts are treated as a set of new disturbance signals. In order to minimize effects of load disturbances and to achieve desired level of robust performance in the presence of modeling uncertainties and practical constraints on control action the idea of mixed H2/H∞ control technique is being used for the solution of LFC problem. This newly developed design strategy combines advantage of H2 and H∞ control syntheses and gives a powerful multi-objectives design addressed by the linear matrix inequalities (LMI) technique. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method a four-area restructured power system is considered as a test system under different operating conditions. The simulation results with the proposed controller are shown to maintain robust performance in the presence of SMES unit in two areas at power system and without SMES unit in any of the areas. Analysis reveals that the proposed control strategy with considering SMES unit improves significantly the dynamical performances of system such as settling time and overshoot against parametric uncertainties for a wide range of area load demands and disturbances in either of the areas even in the presence of system nonlinearities. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The MTS algorithm introduces additional techniques for improvement of search process such as initialization, adaptive search, multiple searches, crossover and restarting process.

The aim of this research is to simulate a solar single effect lithium bromide-water absorption cooling system in Ahwaz. The solar energy is absorbed by a horizontal N-S parabolic trough collector and stored in an insulated thermal storage tank. The system has been designed to supply the cooling load of a typical house where the cooling load peak is about 17.5 kW (5 tons of refrigeration), which occurs in July. A thermodynamic model has been used to simulate the absorption cycle. The working fluid is water, which is pumped directly to the collector. The results showed that the collector mass flow rate has a negligible effect on the minimum required collector area, but it has a significant effect on the optimum capacity of the storage tank. The minimum required collector area was about 57.6 m2, which could supply the cooling loads for the sunshine hours of the design day for July.

Suitable computer programs were prepared for optimizing and predicting the thermal performance of the considered system. Numerical calculations were carried out on typical summer and winter days in Tanta (latitude 30° 47′N) for different thicknesses and mass flow rates of the flowing water to study the effect of these parameters on the daily productivity and efficiency of the system.

The maximum proportion of CA/MA eutectic mixture as phase-change material (PCM) absorbed in gypsum wallboard was about 25 wt% of total weight. No leakage of the PCM from the phase-change wallboard was observed after 1,000 thermal cycling. The melting and freezing temperatures and latent heats of phase-change wallboard were measured as 21.12C and 21.46C, 36.23 and 38.28 J/g, respectively, by DSC analysis. These properties make it functional as LHTES medium, which can be applied to peak load shifting, improving the use of waste heat and solar energy, as well as more efficient operation of heating and cooling equipment. In addition, the phase-change wallboard has good thermal reliability in terms of the changes in its thermal properties after 500 and 1,000 thermal cycling. Furthermore, thermal performance test indicated that the phase-change wallboard can be considered as an effective building element because of reducing the indoor temperature of the room approximately 4C and thereby improving thermal comfort of a building envelope.","Capric acid; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Myristic acid; Phase-change wallboard; Thermal properties; Thermal reliability","Building materials; Buildings; Conservation; Differential scanning calorimetry; Digital cameras; Energy conservation; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Eutectics; Flywheels; Gypsum; Heat storage; Heating; Laser interferometry; Latent heat; Mixed convection; Pulse code modulation; Renewable energy resources; Solar buildings; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Systems engineering; Thermal cycling; Thermodynamic properties; Thermography (temperature measurement); Waste heat; Well equipment; Building elements; Building envelopes; Capric acids; Cooling equipment; Differential scanning calorimetry (photo-DSC); DSC analysis; Eutectic mixtures; Freezing temperatures; Gypsum wallboards; Indoor temperature; Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES); Myristic acid (MA); Peak load shifting; Phase change material (PCM); Phase changes; Thermal performance; Total weight; Walls (structural partitions)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47749126625

The corresponding CC capacities in a range of 100-600 MW were examined. The CC performance can be improved by decreasing an inlet air temperature and humidity to 15 °C (ISO) and 100% RH before entering air compressor of a gas turbine (GT). All year ambient temperature in Bangkok is normally higher than 15 °C. This research used a steam absorption chiller (AC) to cool intake air to the desired temperature level and no storage unit was needed. The CC uses a cooling tower (CT) for cooling purpose. In the 400 MW power plant as an example, it could increase the power output of the GT by 9.32% and the CC by 5.8%, while the ST power decreased by 3.42% annually, as some steam was supplied to the AC.

This strategy was implemented in a software package called AERO and relates four conditions which depend on real time data acquisition and on the process simulation. The main advantage of AERO controller is that it can be used in different geographic regions, during different seasons and with different aeration systems, automatically adjusting its set points. The objectives of AERO controller are to equalize the temperatures inside the bin, to cool the grain mass whenever is possible and to maintain the moisture content under safe conditions. The results showed that the proposed strategy is efficient to achieve these objectives. Moreover, significant energy saving has been achieved with the AERO controller. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A way to improve performance of these systems is to utilize more than one type of source of energy chosen to provide some degree of complementarity. An interesting, albeit improbable, combination is obtained using hydroelectric and photovoltaic energy, taking advantage of the complementarity between these two types of sources coupled to reservoir and/or battery storage. This paper discusses energy complementarity in time and proposes a numerical dimensionless index, evaluating this energy complementarity between two types of energy sources, in the same or in different locations, or between two sources of the same type in different locations.

Although there has been studies on ICTs effect on business organizations, little has been done on the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME), in developing countries. The research was conducted to identify how SMEs in the Western Cape of South Africa use ICT. Issues examined included currently employed ICT, person to computer ratios, spending and acquisition of ICT, and adoption of new ICT. The research found that SMEs in the Western Cape are using a wide range of ICT, with 88% using networks, and 70% using some form of customer relationship management software. The person to computer ratio was computed and 78% of SMEs in the Western Cape showed a 1:1 (Person: Computer) ratio. Spending habits with regards to three ICT sectors (hardware, software and services) were analysed and although majority of SMEs showed no adjustment in their spending habits, 30% did claim an increase is expected for both software and hardware spending.

Their main disadvantage is poor voltage and frequency regulation under varying load and speed. This paper introduces a new and simple method for voltage and frequency control of three-phase unregulated speed induction generators in the islanding mode. The method uses a constant voltage constant frequency (CVCF) PWM converter without regulating the DC capacitor voltage. The capacitor voltage is left changing with the loading conditions and the AC side voltage is regulated by controlling the modulation index. This eliminates the need of an auxiliary switch in the DC side which reduces the cost and also reduces the high frequency current components flowing in the DC capacitor and that increases its life time. The proposed technique is tested under step changes in load and prime mover speed. The proposed technique gives the same response as the old technique but without the use of DC side switch. ©2008 AACC.","Constant voltage constant frequency (CVCF) operation; Electronic load controller (ELC); PWM converter; Self-excited induction generators (SEIG)","Capacitance; Capacitors; Conservation; Counting circuits; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Modulation; Pulse modulation; Pulse width modulation; Renewable energy resources; Speed; Wind power; AC-side; Auxiliary switches; Capacitor voltages; Constant voltage constant frequency (CVCF) operation; Constant-voltage constant-frequency; Electronic load controller (ELC); Frequency controls; Frequency regulations; High-frequency currents; Hydraulic energy; Islanding; Life-time; Loading conditions; Prime movers; PWM converter; PWM converters; Renewable energy sources; Self-Excited Induction Generator; Self-excited induction generators (SEIG); Simple methods; Step changes; Three-phase self-excited induction generators; Variable DC-link; Varying load; Asynchronous generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52449120160

Conventional voltage source inverter has a large electrolytic capacitor as energy store element in order to keep the dc link voltage constant. However, a large electrolytic capacitor increases the input current distortion. Replacing the large electrolytic capacitor by a small film capacitor the input current quality is improved but the output currents are distorted by low order harmonics. This paper proposes a simple current control method for a voltage source inverter without the use of a large electrolytic capacitor in the dc link in order to compensate the low order harmonics in the output currents. The proposed current control scheme employs just one PI regulator and since that the space vector modulation is used in this control the switching frequency of the converter is kept constant. ©2008 IEEE.","Current control; Low-pass filters; Modulation index; Voltage source inverter","Capacitance; Dielectric devices; Electric current control; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric inverters; Electrolytic capacitors; Energy storage; Modulation; Power converters; Power electronics; Control methods; Current control; Current-control method; DC-link; DC-link capacitors; DC-link voltages; Energy store; Input current distortion; Input currents; Low-order harmonics; Low-pass filters; Modulation index; Output currents; PI regulators; Space-vector modulation; Voltage source inverter; Capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349120392

It is simple and more cost-effective than other topologies. The new high-voltage IGBTs on the market enlarge the possibilities and add to the attractiveness of that topology, in particular in high voltage applications. However, despite the overall design simplicity, the designer must guard against a number of problems with this type of a converter. A major problem is in the staircase saturation of the isolation transformer core. One of the possible reasons is the mid-voltage point shift, which can be caused by the input capacitor mismatch. This paper analyses in detail how input capacitors influence the voltage unbalance in a high voltage half-bridge converter. In this project polypropylene capacitors were used. Thus special attention will be paid to polypropylene capacitors. Through analysis the maximal possible asymmetry between the input capacitors can be estimated. From the asymmetry the resulting mid-voltage point shift will be calculated and finally verified with simulations and measurements. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Bridges; Capacitance; Capacitors; Cost effectiveness; DC generators; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Energy storage; Hyperthermia therapy; Plastic products; Power electronics; Project management; Thermoplastics; Topology; Capacitor mismatches; Dc/dc converters; Electronics applications; Half-bridge; Half-bridge converters; High voltage applications; High voltages; Input capacitors; Isolation transformers; Overall design; Point shifts; Simulations and measurements; Voltage unbalances; Paper capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349120207

Unlike in the most previous papers, DC links of the converters are kept separate. Because of this, a path to a zero-sequence circulating current is not formed between the inverters or the rectifiers. However, it is shown that the three-phase currents may contain zero-sequence components. This is a consequence of a current circulating through the converter units. It is also shown that this kind of a circulating current may overcharge the DC link capacitors. In addition to the circulating current, a cross current flows between the inverters because of asynchronous switchings. The formation of both the cross current and circulating current paths is illustrated in detail. Simulation results are presented to validate the discussion about cross currents, circulating currents, and the capacitor charging effect. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Energy storage; Power electronics; AC/DC/AC converters; Capacitor charging; Circulating currents; Current flowing; DC-link capacitors; DC-links; Sequence components; Simulation results; Switching effects; Three-phase currents; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349119121

This idea, that the intended application of the result of an assessment has consequences for methodological choices, is beginning to spread in the LCA research community. One problem is that standard LCA methodology is developed to answer questions about environmental impacts of the current production and use of one unit of a product or minor product or process changes. When this methodology, unchanged, is used to provide answers to questions about strategic technology choice, i.e. not decisions that aim at improving a process within an existing technological environment, but with the long-term goal of changing large-scale technological systems, the result could be of little value or misleading. In many cases, LCAs produce more noise than knowledge. This observation seems to be of particular importance for LCAs of energy technologies and for how energy use is treated in all kinds of LCAs. Here, it is suggested that a better understanding of some critical methodological issues related to time, universality, cause-effect relationships, technical maturity and system innovation, could result in better studies that reveal fundamental environmental issues related to the objects of study and reduce the noise from irrelevant information.

Furthermore, the mid-merit strategy and 24 hours time frame resulted in the best use of the system with wind and storage. © 2008 IEEE.","Energy storage; Load duration curve; Plant mix; Renewal energy resource; Wind","Energy conversion; Energy resources; Energy storage; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; 21st century; Electrical energy; Load duration curve; Operational strategies; Optimal time; Plant mix; Renewal energy resource; System operations; Time frames; Wind; Wind generation; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349108302

Photovoltaics are not an ideal source for charging batteries as their output is heavily dependent on weather conditions. Therefore, when batteries are used in photovoltaic systems, the performance characteristics differ significantly from batteries used in more traditional applications and the battery life is usually shortened. In conditions of varying solar radiation and load profile the battery may experience a low State of Charge (SOC). A low SOC for extended periods of time will cause increased sulphation, which severely reduces the life of the battery. Typically, steps are carried out to protect the battery and to charge the battery more effectively. Such methods include Intermittent Charging (IC), Three Stage Charging (TSC) and Interrupted Charge Control (ICC), among others. This paper quantifies the effectiveness of these three battery charging algorithms and evaluates their ability to maintain the battery at a high state of charge. The measurement setup is comprised of a solar simulator, which replicates the output of a large 50W photovoltaic panel using a low power cell. Repeatable load and solar radiation profiles and temperature control are implemented using LabView so that identical operating conditions can be set up to compare the three battery charging systems. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Battery life; Charging systems; Intermittent charging; Interrupted charge control; Lab VIEW; Load profiling; Low costs; Low powers; Measurement set-up; Operating conditions; Performance characteristics; Photovoltaic Systems; Photovoltaics; Solar simulators; Solar Systems; Stand-alone photovoltaic systems; State-of-charge; Sulphation; Temperature controlling; Valve regulated lead-acid battery; Weather conditions; Control systems; Electric energy storage; Electromagnetic waves; Lead acid batteries; Photovoltaic effects; Power electronics; Programmable logic controllers; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Sun; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349108134

They require a higher number of semiconductors and either multiple isolated dc sources or a bank of series connected capacitors. Consequently, the control complexity increases considerably, since more switching devices normally result in a higher number of possible combinations and the balance of the capacitors has to be guaranteed. But on the other hand, multilevel inverters create an extra degree of freedom due to existing redundant voltage vectors, which produce the same output phase voltage level but with diverse effect on the dc-link and floating capacitors. Among the existing control techniques the Virtual-Flux Direct Power Control (VF-DPC) has showed to be very suitable for grid connected systems since it controls the active and reactive powers directly without any internal current control loop or PWM modulator. However, in order to adapt the VF-DPC for multilevel systems, specifically for the recently proposed five-level Active Neutral-Point Clamped converter, additional features must be included and/or modified in the inner main control loop. In order to allow the controller to select a higher number of available voltage vectors, the active and reactive power hysteresis strategies are modified. Additionally, a method to balance the dc-link and floating capacitor voltages by applying available redundant states is implemented, based on the actual condition of the voltage across the lower dc-link and floating capacitors, as well output phase currents direction. The proposed five-level VF-DPC has been implemented using a 6kW five-level prototype and has shown good static and dynamic performance. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Beamforming; Capacitance; Capacitors; Chlorine compounds; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric inverters; Electric power factor; Electromagnetic compatibility; Electromagnetism; Energy storage; Power control; Power converters; Power electronics; Reactive power; Remote control; Vectors; Active and reactive powers; Control complexities; Control loops; Control techniques; Current control loops; DC sources; DC-link; Degree of freedom; Direct power control; Floating capacitors; Grid-connected systems; High voltages; High-quality; Multi-level inverters; Multi-level systems; Neutral point clamping; Output phase; Static and dynamic performance; Switching devices; Switching losses; Vol tage vector; Wave forms; Control systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349107916

In state-of-the-art PWM converters in general electrolytic capacitors are used in the DC voltage link. The weak point of these components is the uncertainty in life time especially if the converter is operated within a wide temperature range. To avoid failures in operation the electrolytic capacitors have to be monitored to pre-detect the end-of-life status of the components. To estimate the status of the capacitor, the ohmic resistance of the component has to be determined. The proposed monitoring unit is located directly at the capacitor terminals for measuring it's ohmic resistance. To predict it's end-of-life it is furthermore necessary to consider the component's operation temperature. In comparison to known monitoring circuits the proposed concept leads to a low-cost unit whose manufacturing costs are almost neglibile as compared to the electrolytic power capacitor. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Counting circuits; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electronic equipment; Energy storage; Ohmic contacts; Paper capacitors; Power electronics; Pulse modulation; Pulse width modulation; DC voltages; End-of-life; Life-time; Manufacturing costs; Ohmic resistance; Operation temperatures; Power capacitors; PWM converters; Real-time monitoring; Wide temperature range; Electrolytic capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349103659

Firstly, a general model for vibration-driven harvesters is described. Using this model, an optimal linear resistive load for the harvester can be analytically calculated. As the vibration-based harvester provides varying AC power, while electronic loads need a stable DC power supply, it is useful to analyze the harvester behavior when connected to a non-linear AC-DC rectifier. Using the same general model, an optimal DC voltage load can be calculated for every frequency. The difference between the optimal output power flow from the harvester to both load circuits depends on the coupling coefficient of the harvester device. To validate previous conclusions, two power processing circuits are designed and built, the first emulating a resistive input impedance and the second with a constant input voltage. A piezo-electric bimorph is taken as energy harvesting device. A buck-boost DC-DC converter without input filter capacitor, operating in discontinuous conduction mode, is shown to have a resistive input impedance. A buck converter with input filter capacitor is used to evaluate the rectifier load-case. Simulations and experimental validation show that the efficiency of the overall system, harvester device with power processing circuit, increases if the power processing circuit has a fixed DC-voltage as input. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Damage detection; DC-DC converters; Dielectric devices; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric impedance; Electric impedance measurement; Energy storage; Harvesters; Lattice vibrations; Networks (circuits); Piezoelectricity; Power electronics; Vibrations (mechanical); Wave filters; A-stable; AC power; Buck converters; Buck-Boost; Coupling coefficients; DC power supplies; DC voltages; Discontinuous-conduction-mode; Electronic loads; Energy harvesters; Energy harvesting; Experimental validations; General model; Input impedances; Input voltages; Non-linear; Output powers; Power processing; Rectifier load; Resistive loads; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349083576

The original TRIGA fuel was HEU with U235 enrichment 93%. The neutron and thermal hydraulic data for SSR are found in the Safety Analysis Report (SAR) [1]. Almost all TRIGA HEU fuel bundles are now burned-up. Part of the spent fuel was loaded and transferred to US, in a Romania - DOE arrangement. The rest of the TRIGA fuel bundles have to be temporarily stored in the TRIGA facility. As the storage conditions had to be established with caution, neutron and thermal hydraulic evaluations of the storage conditions were required. Some criticality evaluations were made based on the SAR data. Fuel constant axial temperature approximation effect is usual for criticality computations. TRIGA SSR fuel bundle geometry and materials model for SCALE5 CSAS module allows introduction of a fuel temperature dependency for the entire fuel active height, using different materials for each fuel bundle region. Previous RELAP5 thermal hydraulic computations for an axial and radial power distribution in the TRIGA fuel pin were done. Fuel constant temperature approximation overvalues pin factors for every core operating at high temperatures. From the thermal hydraulic point of view the worst condition of the storage grid occurs when the transfer channel is accidentally emptied of water from the pool, or the bundle is handled accidentally to remain in air. All the residual heat from the bundles has to be removed without fuel overheating and clad failure. RELAP5 computer code for residual heat removal was used in the assessment of residual heat removal. As it is known, the cooling conditions are worsening in air, compared with water cooling. We made a couple of evaluations of TRIGA bundle clad temperatures in air cooling conditions, with different residual heat levels. The criticality computations have shown that the spent TRIGA fuel bundles storage grid is strongly sub-critical. So, there is no danger for a criticality accident for this storage grid type. The assessment is done for the revised Romania TRIGA SSR Safety Analysis Report (SAR) and to be approved by the Romanian regulatory body, CNCAN.",,"Accidents; Architectural design; Cooling; Cooling water; Criticality (nuclear fission); Elastic moduli; Electric power plants; Fluid mechanics; Fuels; Hydraulics; Linguistics; Neutrons; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Polynomial approximation; Power plants; Programming theory; Security systems; Semiconductor relays; Spent fuels; Storage (materials); Synthetic apertures; Target drones; Water treatment; Air cooling; Computer coding; Constant temperatures; Cooling conditions; Criticality accidents; Fuel bundles; Fuel temperatures; Grid-type; High temperatures; International Congress on Advances in Nuclear Power Plants; Materials modelling; Nuclear renaissance; Power distributions; Regulatory bodies; Residual heat; Romania; Safe storage; Safety analysis report; SAR data; Steady states; Storage conditions; Sub-critical; Test reactors; Thermal-hydraulic; Transfer channel; TRIGA fuel; Water cooling; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52249108067

Prof. Lineu Prestes 2242, São Paulo, Brazil","Local Scaling and Fractional Scaling Analysis (FSA) have bee applied at the system level to surge flow transients in a pressunzer with the purpose of sizing a 1/100 volume scale test facility. It was shown that the relation between pressure and volume displacement rates is analogous to that of generalized ""effort"" and ""flow"" in interdisciplinary analysis of complex systems. At the component level, a relation between pressunzer liquid volume and the volume displacement rates is obtained. Properly scaled outsurge transients in a full scale pressurizer have identical pressure and liquid volume histories as compared to a properly designed 1/100 volume experiment facility. As highlighted in the original papers explaining the FSA methodology, its application at the system level can be used to synthesize the results from analysis and experiment in compact form for efficient storage, transfer, and retrieval of information. It also serves to rank the process quantitatively and thereby objectively in the order of their importance. For the case in analysis, surge flow dominates all other volume displacement rates (the second in importance was due to the heater). The dominant agent of pressure change in the pressurizer is that due to maximum surge flow For similarity, the same dominant agent of change is assumed for the experiment, which permits to define its surge flow. Likewise, the heating power of the experiment, necessary to control the specified out-surge flow transient, is calculated assuming equality in the second largest agent of change, which is that due to heating The concept of local similarity, which establishes that the experiment should have the same local heating number as the full scale pressurizer, has confirmed the heating power defined by FSA.","Fractional change metric; Fractional rate of change; Fractional scaling; Hierarchy of complex systems; Holistic scaling approach; Information synthesis; Local scaling; Pressurizer similarity; Scale distortion","Arsenic; Chlorine compounds; Electric power plants; Experiments; Heating; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Test facilities; Testing; Transients; Complex systems; Flow transients; Fractional change metric; Fractional rate of change; Fractional scaling; Fractional scaling analysis; Full scale; Heating power; Hierarchy of complex systems; Holistic scaling approach; Information synthesis; Interdisciplinary analysis; International Congress on Advances in Nuclear Power Plants; Liquid volume; Local heating; Local scaling; Local similarity; Nuclear renaissance; Pressure changing; Pressurizer similarity; Scale distortion; System levels; Volume displacements; Power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52249099452

For the EPR to remain competitive on the worldwide nuclear energy market, standardization and high unit net electrical output are key features of EPR deployment. The first EPR, the only Generation III+ advanced reactor design that is currently being built, is being constructed at Olkiluoto, Finland. Many of the plant systems for this first-of-a-kind unit are optimized for the climate and heat rejection method (once-through cooling) used at Olkiluoto. Two such systems are the Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) and the Turbine/Generator (T/G) system. To achieve the EPR's target net electrical output for tropical climates and various condenser heat rejection methods, design studies were performed that showed that the NSSS and T/G system designs developed for the Olkiluoto site conditions required modification. Tropical climates are more representative of the continental United States, and reflect sites with an average ambient temperature above 60°F. To optimize the EPR design for tropical climates, two sets of parametric studies were performed to determine the maximum NSSS power level that could be achieved, and to evaluate the effects of tropicalization on T/G performance for a range in condenser heat rejection methods (e.g., once-through cooling, natural draft cooling towers, etc.). These parametric studies explored a range of design considerations with four goals: (1) to maintain a highly reliable design, (2) to minimize changes to the Olkiluoto standardized design, (3) to optimize T/G performance for tropical conditions, and (4) to achieve the target net electrical output. This paper reports the results of these studies, and demonstrates how the net electrical output goal for U.S. EPR is met with tropical heat sink conditions and a range of condenser heat rejection methods.",,"Condensers (liquefiers); Cooling; Cooling systems; Electric power plants; Electron resonance; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Energy resources; Heat sinks; Heat storage; Industrial engineering; Labeling; Labels; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Optimization; Paramagnetic resonance; Quantum theory; Standardization; Steam power plants; Tropics; Uncertain systems; Advanced reactor design; Ambient temperatures; Condenser heat; Continental United States; Design considerations; Design studies; Heat rejection; International Congress on Advances in Nuclear Power Plants; Natural draft cooling towers; Net electrical output; Nuclear energy market; Nuclear power; Nuclear renaissance; Nuclear steam supply system; Olkiluoto , Finland; Parametric studies; Plant designs; Plant systems; Power leveling; Reliable design; Site conditions; System designs; Tropical climates; Tropical conditions; Tropicalization; Power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52249098589

Many Brazilian conventional mines present a significant risk of exposure to radiation due to Uranium and Thorium. CNEN inspects the mines but there are several small mining sites dedicated to open pit short term mineral extraction, called ""garimpagem"", that are of difficult control.

Using these hemi-sphere images through the lens the direction of the lights can be estimated. As it considers the energy of pixels in the images the bright regions contain more light information than the other regions. To detect these regions image processing is additionally needed. But using iris of fish-eye lens and ND filters which reduce the incident light we can estimate the bright regions without additional image processing.

The CBO fraction contributes mainly to more meaningful carbon sequestration due to their long-term stability and hence storage. The formation and stabilization of CBO is a complex process and studies on determination of the exact composition of this fraction are meagre. In this study, an attempt was made to characterize the CBO of a soil in terms of the other SOM fractions such as fulvic fraction (FF), humic fraction (HF) and fine soil litter. The weight loss on ignition (LOI) data of extracted SOM fractions and fine soil litter were used to characterize CBO. Rate constants (k) of the oxidation reactions during the LOI were calculated using percentage weight losses at different temperatures of the FF, HF and fine soil litter. Calculated activation energies (Ea) of the other SOM fractions at different temperatures were used in a multiple regression analysis to predict the E a of the CBO fraction.

The copolymer was synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization, and its structure was analyzed using IR and electronic absorption spectroscopy. The contribution of the aniline and methylthiophene moieties to intramolecular electronic transitions was derived based on electronic absorption, photoluminescence, and photoluminescence excitation spectra of the copolymer. It was found that both CdS and CdSe nanoparticles induce the copolymer-to-particle energy transfer and charge transfer. The CdSe nanoparticles were more effective in the above processes and initiated a complex energy transfer route with an intramolecular energy transfer in the copolymer as an intermediate step. However, heterostructures based on the copolymer-CdS composite showed comparable or even higher photovoltaic performance than those based on the copolymer-CdSe composite. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"ABS resins; Absorption; Absorption spectroscopy; Acetonitrile; Aniline; Cadmium alloys; Cadmium compounds; Charge transfer; Chemical reactions; Composite films; Copolymerization; Data storage equipment; Energy transfer; Ion exchange; Light emission; Luminescence; Monomers; Nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Negative ions; Photoluminescence; Plastic products; Polymer films; Polymers; Separation; 3-Methylthiophene; CdSe nano-particles; Charge separation; Chemical oxidative polymerization; Complex energy; Electronic absorption spectroscopies; Electronic absorptions; Electronic transitions; Heterostructures; Hybrid Systems; Intra-molecular energy transfer; Methyl thiophene; Organic/inorganic interfaces; Particle energies; Photoluminescence excitation spectra; Photovoltaic performance; Polymer matrix composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53849127870

One of the important measures to attain this is by establishing and implementing best practice within E&P operations business worldwide. Several projects have been started to support TKP's effort to reach operational excellence. This paper is concerned with one of the projects, ""Integrated Operations - A Key Enabler to Operational Excellence in maintenance Management of FPSOs"". The main objective of this project is to enable TKP to take a step further into operational excellence by implementing more effective work processes, and developing new theory, methods and tools for maintenance optimization. TKP regards Integrated Operations (10) as an important instrument to reach this objective. The research project focuses on three activities; 1) Describe and analyse future work processes for strategic and tactical analyses, 2) develop tools and methods to support strategic and tactical maintenance decisions, and 3) implement and verify work processes, tools and methods. Cases are used to develop, test and verify work processes, tools and methods prior to implementation, and have proven essential to create consensus. Recent experience shows that challenges with IO are more related to organisation and competence than technology itself. The Man, Technology and Organisation (MTO) focus is chosen when developing new work processes to meet the challenges related to competence and organisation. Close cooperation with onshore and offshore staff is critical when developing the new work processes. The main challenge for the development of tools and methods is related to balancing simplicity and theoretical basis. It is seen that many of the new tools and methods may be feasible just because the IO setting enables the use of onshore centralised expertise. The project has clearly seen that a successful implementation of 10, to reach operational excellence in maintenance management, requires full attention to balancing personnel competence, technology complexity and organisation (MTO), and ensuring management ownership (visions, maintenance strategy, measurable goals).

As the energy demands of Dubai are ever increasing, MDE has been releasing (net) gas resulting in rapid dwindling of remaining reserves. In order to reduce the amount of alternate fuels required to meet the Dubai energy demands, MDE initiated a drastic field intervention campaign prior to June 1, 2006. Preliminary feasibility studies concluded that the only identified practical option of increasing drainage capacity was to re-enter existing wells drilling high deviation multi-laterals with coiled-tubing, underbalanced drilling (CTUBD) techniques. After approximately three months of rigorous project planning and engineering, the well sequence of Phase I was initiated (4 wells). Upon completion, a 73% net increase (including average field decline) of gas from the Margham field was observed equating to a gas lift cost of less than $2/Mscf (25% less cost than alternate fuels). Due to the success of Phase I, an additional four wells were approved. Upon Phase II completion, a 125% increase (over non-intervention predicted field production rate) resulted, equating to a gas lift cost of less than $1.33/Mscf. The reduction in lift cost in Phase II was attributed to the cost of front-end engineering, mobilization, retention of equipment and additional start-up costs all being absorbed in Phase I. Also, the technical limit (rig move, milling time, drilling time, etc.) for the CTUBD operation was not reached until the drilling of the third well. Thereafter a third and final phase was approved consisting of three additional wells. The total number of wells rejuvenated was eleven. This paper addresses the conceptualization of the project, the well selection criteria, identified risk and uncertainties, the risk management methods employed, environmental impact, implementation practices, key achievements, production improvement, ultimate recovery enhancement and a cost versus value summary. Overall the CTUBD intervention campaign as a mature field rejuvenation technique has been a great technical and economic achievement. In addition to the apparent increase in production, the rejuvenation of the Margham field will allow for more efficient gas storage methods in the future (if required) due to the increased injectivity index and the ability to use fewer wells for gas cycling.

Success is dependent upon efficient and effective use of company skills and knowledge. Saudi Aramco and Petris developed a long term solution called Data Services (DSS) to the information and knowledge management associated with the O&G assets of Saudi Arabia. The system grew out of a comprehensive multiyear study of users' workflow, existing information issues and inventory of data, applications and processes. The issues were classified into common themes of problems. A root cause analysis identified the sources of problems. This enabled the design to focus on solving the problems rather than treating symptoms. The solution was constructed to be independent of data type and format. The system architecture is generic so that the business and workflow logic can be configured by each group without necessitating change to the underlying software. It provides the flexibility to introduce new data, new database models and even different data storage mechanisms as they occur during the long life of the projects. The services are built to achieve the following objectives: Provide a single-point of access to manage data Control data quality when entered into the system and when transferred out Facilitate the communication between data producers and consumers Provide an automated facility to capture & Index data as it passes through the E&P workflow. Help users in choosing data and recommend data to be used Maintain business integrity between data inside and outside Data Services The Data Services idea was developed around the Smart Business Objects (SBO) concept. The system intelligence is coupled with data and indexed to form the SBO. These objects are served by generic software components (services). Each SBO preserves its own behavior and provides different set of services to its interested users.

A representative example is the washing machine drum's main drive. Both manufacturers and designers have augmented their preoccupations and researches to optimize the efficiency of this drive due to the large and increasing number of devices in use and also stimulated by the market requests. At the same time, their efforts have been directed to maintain the drive's main advantage i. e. its low cost. A simple strategy to optimize the S/TPIM drive's efficiency is to replace the fixed capacitance of the starting capacitor of the motor with an electronically switched capacitor. In this approach, an accurate dynamic characteristic of the actuator, i.e. electric motor and washing machine's drum, need to be determined for the implementation of the starting capacitance's command law. In this paper an estimation method of the drive's mechanical strain at coarse start-up is presented. The dynamic model of the drive is based on the direct- and quadrature-axis theory; this approach provides accurate estimates of the drive's response. The on-line measurements of the input voltages and currents are performed with a fast data acquisition board and a virtual instrumentation software environment providing noise-free measurements. The main advantage of this method consists in its simple implementation on the washing machine and to provide torque predictions both in stationary and in dynamic regimes in real operating conditions. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Command law; Cost applications; Dynamic characteristics; Dynamic regimes; Estimation methods; Fast data acquisition; Induction motor drives; Input voltages; International conferences; Low costs; Low powers; Main drive; Mechanical straining; On-line determination; On-line measurements; Phase induction motors; Real operating conditions; Software environments; Start Ups; Switched capacitors; Virtual instrumentation; AC motors; Automation; Capacitance; Capacitors; Data acquisition; Dielectric devices; Dynamic response; Electric currents; Electric drives; Electric equipment; Electric machinery; Energy storage; Estimation; Industrial engineering; Instruments; Motors; Optimization; Robotics; Washers; Washing; Washing machines; Induction motors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51949111701

Such structural and more spread-out features are important cues for segmentation but are more difficult to exploit. The difficulty also comes from the fact that repetition need not be perfect, and will actually rather be partial, approximate, or both in most cases. This paper presents a multi-label image segmentation algorithm that processes a single input image and efficiently discovers and exploits repeating elements without any prior knowledge about their shape, color or structure. The algorithm spells out the interplay between segmentation and repetition detection. The key of our approach is a novel, point-wise concept of repetition. This is defined by point-wise mutual information and locally compares certain neighborhoods to accumulate evidence. This point-wise repetition measure naturally handles imperfect repetitions, and the parts with inconsistent appearances are recognized and assigned with low scores. An energy functional is proposed to include the point-wise repetition into the image segmentation process, which takes the form of a graph-cut minimization. Real scene images demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to handle partial and approximate repetition. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Bottom-up; Energy functional; Graph cuts; Image segmentation algorithms; Local features; Man-made objects; Mutual information; Prior knowledge; Segmentation processing; Single input; Via points; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Digital image storage; Feature extraction; Image processing; Labeling; Labels; Pattern recognition; Image segmentation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51949102643

The variable switching frequency is generated by incorporating a negative or positive variable time delay into the switching period of the Normal mode. This paper describes the Normal mode of operation, which is realized by switching the converter at its damped resonant frequency with zero time delay, and presents a complete mathematical model through which the performance of the converter can be accurately predicted.

It is based on the multilevel converters principle and designed for unidirectional power transfer applications. Each device blocks one voltage level, then high voltage converters can be synthesized with low voltage devices. The main advantage of this topology is the reduced number of transistors and gate drives. Possible applications have a wide range from low power silicon-based voltage multipliers, implemented inside microchips, to medium power level DC links for multilevel inverters based distributed generation (DG) systems, where a capacitor's voltage balancing is a challenge for more than three levels.

Antônio Carlos 6627, Pampulha CEP 31270-010 - Belo Horizonte - Minas Gerais, Brazil","Communication is usually the most energy-consuming event in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The lifetime of these networks is determined by the capacity of batteries and one of the biggest challenges is to reduce the energy consumed in the communication. Several techniques to reduce the energy consumption have been proposed in routing protocols: diminish the traffic of data, optimize the routes or the control of the topology. However, the management and operation of the node's radio is responsibility of the medium access control (MAC) protocol. This thesis presents four new transmission power control (TPC) techniques for MAC protocols in WSNs. These techniques are based on the interaction between sensor nodes and take into account the limitations of resources such as processing, memory and energy in the calculation of the minimum of transmission power. To evaluate these techniques, four MAC protocols had been developed: Iterative, Attenuation, AEWMA and Hybrid. The Iterative was the first MAC protocol with TPC developed exclusively for WSN. These protocols have been experimented in the Mica Motes2 platform, in diverse scenarios varying parameters such as internal and external environment, the distance among the communicating nodes, the occurrence of simultaneous transmissions, the use of multi-hop transmissions and node mobility. Results have shown that TPC protocols reduce the energy consumption by up to 57% in comparison to the protocols with fixed transmission power. Moreover, the protocols with TPC increase the throughput of the network while maintaining a very high delivery rate. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Access control; Beamforming; Cellular radio systems; Data storage equipment; Energy policy; Hybrid sensors; Laws and legislation; Management; Medium access control; Mica; Network management; Power control; Power transmission; Routing protocols; Sensor networks; Sensors; Silicate minerals; Telecommunication equipment; Transmissions; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Attenuation ,; Communicating nodes; Delivery rate; Energy consumption; External environments; Mac protocols; Medium-access control protocols; Multi-hop transmissions; Network operations; Node mobility; Sensor nodes; Transmission power control; Transmission powers; Ubiquitous networks; Varying parameters; Network protocols",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849152921

DVR has been used in distribution networks for several years as a mean to mitigate voltage sags. In designing a DVR, there is always a trade-off between the size of energy storage system and the rating of DVR. An IDVR, which is two DVRs installed in two feeders with common dc bus, has the capability of active power exchange between two DVRs, and thus the energy storage device is not an issue. Therefore, the design criteria for the selection of rating of an individual DVR are not applicable in IDVR structure. In this paper, the basic equations governing the operation of an IDVR are obtained. The important factors which cause the difference between IDVR and individual DVRs are addressed.

Optical absorption and PL spectroscopy experiments performed on the melt-quenched silver-doped glass indicate the presence of single Ag+ ions, Ag+ - Ag+ and Ag+ - Ag0 pairs, and Ag NPs. After thermal processing of the material, nonradiative energy transfer from the Ag+ - Ag0 luminescent centers to Ag NPs is observed by uniform suppression of band emission and the vanishing of the excitation band associated. Furthermore, evidence for PRET is observed after glass heat treatment by the appearance of a new excitation band near the surface plasmon resonance peak of Ag NPs at about 420 nm, when emission of silver pairs is monitored around 550 nm. In fact, excitation at 420 nm leads to a band emission centered around 530 nm indicating that the excitation of luminescent silver species indeed takes place via PRET. The luminescence is interpreted as arising from a Ag NP→ Ag+ - Ag0 → Ag+ - Ag+ energy transfer scheme. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.",,"Absorption; Absorption spectroscopy; Emission spectroscopy; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Glass; Light emission; Luminescence; Nuclear propulsion; Optical glass; Photoluminescence; Plasmons; Resonance; Surface plasmon resonance; Surface treatment; Ag+ ions; Band emissions; Excitation bands; Heat-treatment; Luminescent centers; Nano composites; Non-radiative energy transfer; Optical absorption; Photoluminescence (PL); PL spectroscopy; Plasmon resonances; Silver nanoparticles; Silver species; Thermal processing; Transfer scheme; Silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51849132436

UPFC model is presented, using Sparse Matrix Converters, and the system controllers are designed to allow both a good steady-state and dynamic response. ©2008 IEEE.","Sliding mode control; Sparse matrix converters; Unified power flow controller","Computer networks; Dynamic response; Electric power factor; Electric power systems; Electricity; Flow control; Joints (structural components); Matrix algebra; Online searching; Power converters; Reactive power; Sliding mode control; Sparse matrices; Sparse matrix converters; Unified power flow controller; Electric control equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749085597

The paper details the operational experience while drilling a lateral well with an emphasis on drilling optimization and LWD processing; given the ability to receive real-time, memory quality, data via a telemetry drill pipe network. Recent advances in Logging While Drilling technologies call for broader bandwidths and faster telemetry data rates for full utilization of data available downhole. In addition to the improvements in LWD technologies, there has been a remarkable development of downhole drilling dynamics and optimization tools. A telemetry drill pipe network that delivers real-time memory quality data at 57,000 bps transmission rates, provides a step change in capability for the industry - dramatically changing the decisions that can be made in real-time The major lessons learned during the project were i. Real-time monitoring is a valuable tool for controlling and mitigating dynamic dysfunctions downhole resulting in immediate ROP improvements; ii. High volume of real-time memory data imposes new challenges on surface software systems; iii. High resolution bore hole images via telemetry drill pipe facilitate real-time on-site dip picking and analysis of downhole conditions; iv. Handling of telemetry drill pipe at surface plays a key role in improving the efficiency of overall drilling operation. With a telemetry drill pipe network, the present generation of drilling engineers can have high quality down-hole dynamics information and mechanical specific energy (MSE) data real-time while drilling. Likewise, the geologists and petrophysicists can have access to 8 sector gamma images and 16 sector density images, real-time via telemetry drill pipe. The success of the project has provided the industry with an impetus to pursue this technology as a ground-breaking path towards making real-time informed decisions while drilling.

Besides offering longer working distance between RFID-reader and tag than passive RFID, this also enables the tags to do sensor measurements, calculations and storage even when no RFID-reader is in the vicinity of the tags. In this paper we study the effect on tag energy cost and read out delay incurred by some typical back-off algorithms (constant, linear, and exponential) used in a contention based CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/ Collision Avoidance) protocol for A-RFID communication. For the type of A-RFID scenarios considered, where the number of tags is varied as well as how fast they pass a reader, simulation results show the importance of selecting the correct length of the Initial Contention Window (ICW) and the algorithm coefficient based on the number of tags. The study also indicates that by dynamically selecting the proper back-off algorithm coefficients (based on the number of tags), viz. the initial contention window size and the back-off interval coefficient, the tag energy consumption and read-out delays can be significantly lowered compared to using a static back-off algorithm. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Boolean functions; Carrier sense multiple access; Computer networks; Computer programming languages; Integrated circuits; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Security of data; Sensors; Windows; Back-off; CSMA/CA; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51549112493

Some of the stringent requirements of these applications can be achieved by high switching frequency. On the other hand, the use of high switching frequency may degrade the overall system efficiency, which can be alleviated by the utilization of soft-switching techniques. In this paper, a generic soft-switching diagram that can generate topologies for turn-on snubber, zero-voltage transition, zero-current-zero-voltage transition inverters with coupled filter inductor is proposed. This approach facilitates the understanding of these techniques by both newcomers and senior engineers, making the advantages and disadvantages of each soft-switching technique much clearer. © 2008 IEEE.","Circuit synthesis; Coupling circuits; Lossless circuits; Switching circuits","Computer networks; Digital signal processing; Electric converters; Electric power plants; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Modulation; Power plants; Propulsion; Switching frequency; Topology; Wave filters; Circuit synthesis; Coupling circuits; Lossless circuits; Soft-switching techniques; Switching circuits; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51449116982

Damselflies react to time stress with a shortening of their development time, and often show compensatory growth to avoid a smaller size at metamorphosis. Behaviour (increased foraging) and digestive physiology (increased growth efficiency) underlie this life history plasticity. Both ecological and physiological costs of this accelerated life history have been shown: time-stressed larvae are less responsive to predators and hence suffer higher mortality by predation, and show larger mass loss during starvation and reduced investment in immune function and in energy storage. These costs may explain why time-stressed larvae suffer a reduced lifetime mating success in the adult stage. © Oxford University Press 2008.

Sun drying of dates is the common practice prevailed in Pakistan. Sun dried dates have a short life and are not free from contamination and aflatoxins. Therefore, these cannot be presented in the international market for better return. About 22 % of the total dates produced in the country are wasted every year due to unavailability of proper drying/ processing, and storage facilities. To overcome these problems, a solar-cum-gas fired dates dryer was developed at the Farm Machinery Institute, National Agricultural Research Centre, Islamabad. It consisted of eight flat-plate solar collectors, a drying chamber, and an axial flow fan. A gas burning system was also developed as a supplement source of heat. This dryer was installed and evaluated at Mitra Abad, Dhaki, D. I. Khan in August 2003. Experimental results indicated that the system was capable of drying/processing about 544 kg of fresh dates within 5 days. The seasonal drying capacity of the dryer was predicted at about 4 tonnes, with a value addition of Rs. 72,116.

Using fossil fuels is currently the only way to meet the rapidly increasing demand for energy, so they will continue to dominate the energy supply for many years to come. It was through the three key factors, i.e., the continuing escalation in demand for energy, the challenge to ensure the energy supply to meet this demand, and concerns over climate change, stimulated Shell to develop its latest energy scenarios: Scramble and Blueprints. Under the Scramble scenario, policymakers give most attention to securing supplies of energy but less attention is given to more efficient use of energy, until supplies of energy become tight. Greenhouse gas emissions are not seriously addressed until there are major climate shocks. In Blueprints, growing action at the local level leads the way in addressing the challenges of economic development, energy security and environmental issues. In this scenario, carbon pricing is introduced, which stimulates the development of clean energy technologies and significant improvements in energy efficiency. This results in a set of shared responses that reduce CO2 emissions by 2050 to much lower levels than happens in Scramble. For this reason, Shell favors Blueprints.

A novel low-voltage pulse-width modulator is proposed. The modulator can be directly powered from the 0.9-V input instead of using the 2.5-V output as in general modulator designs. Sophisticated low-voltage analog blocks, which normally consume a large amount of power and chip area, are not required in the modulator. The impact of output-voltage ripple and transient-induced output-voltage perturbation on the operation of analog blocks inside the modulator is eliminated. Boost converter start-up sequence is also greatly simplified. A CMOS-control rectifier (CCR) is also proposed to improve converter power efficiency. The CCR is used to replace the conventional rectifying switch to provide adaptive dead-time, which helps to minimize charge-sharing loss and body-diode conduction loss. Corresponding thermal stress on the rectifying switch is hence minimized. The CCR also enables the use of small off-chip inductor and capacitor at sub-MHz switching frequency to improve light-load efficiency. This converter has been implemented in a 0.35-/Km CMOS process. It is designed to operate at ∼667 kHz with a 1 μH inductor and 4.7 μF output capacitor to reduce both switching loss and form factor.

Nano-structured calcium silicate (NCS) is a proprietary new material comprising nano-size platelets stacked together in a unique open framework structure forming discrete particles of about 1 to 5 microns in size. The material has a high pore volume with a consequent high liquid absorbency of up to about 500 to 600 g oil 100 g -1 silicate (ASTM Oil Absorption test D281), and a high surface area of up to about 500 m2 g-1. Phase change materials (PCMs) absorb and release heat energy (latent heat) associated with the liquid-solid transition at their melting point. Alkanes (paraffin waxes) which have good latent heat properties (∼160 to 190 J g-1) are often used, as they are non-toxic and the operating temperature (melting point) can be tuned by altering the hydrocarbon chain length. The major practical problem of containing the liquid phase on melting has been overcome here by incorporating the alkane PCM into the highly porous NCS matrix to a level of about 300 wt% of NCS (1 kg of composite comprises 250 g NCS and 750 g PCM). The resulting composite NCS-300PCM remains a powdery solid above the alkane melting point and can be readily incorporated into packaging materials to provide heat buffering properties of about 110 J g-1 of composite. The NCS-300PCM composite utilising Rubitherm RT6 alkane with a melting point of about 8°C was incorporated into a 10 mm paperboard liner and also into bubble-wrap liners placed on the inside walls of a fluted paperboard container to provide effective thermal buffering capacity for the contents of the container around this temperature. A rectangular container with dimensions 270 by 200 by 180 mm was constructed from 4 mm C-fluted paperboard and lined with six bubble wrap 'Post-It' bags containing a total of 400 g NCS-300PCM composite spread thinly and evenly in the six bags. The NCS-300PCM composite provided effective thermal buffering capacity by maintaining the temperature inside the container at 10°C for some 5 hours after the outside temperature had increased to about 23°C. The temperature/time profile on the inside wall of the NCS-300PCM liners for the empty container, was the same when the container was filled with 2 kg of asparagus, which served as a model for perishable food. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the NCS-300PCM composite in providing thermal buffering to such food produce. The extent of thermal buffering appears to be sufficient to ensure the temperature of perishable foodstuffs inside such a container remains below about 10°C during transport and temporary storage en route from the supplier to the market, thereby enabling the freshness to be maintained. Hence the use of NCS-300PCM composite phase change materials contained in bubble wrap liners is a simple way to impart effective thermal buffering capacity to a fluted paperboard container or other type of package, to ensure the contents of the container are buffered at a requisite temperature for a desirable period of time.","Calcium silicate; Packaging; Phase change; Temperature control; Thermal buffering","Calcium; Calcium alloys; Food storage; Phase change materials; Calcium silicate; Packaging; Phase change; Temperature control; Thermal buffering; Silicates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51449107926

Since the discovery that adipocytes may secrete a variety of bioactive molecules (hormones, chemokines, and cytokines), an endocrine and paracrine role for white adipose tissue (WAT) in the regulation of energy balance and other physiological processes has been established, particularly with regard to brain and muscle. In contrast, little is known about the interactions of WAT with liver. Hence, we examined the effect of the secretory products of WAT on hepatocytes. Conditioned medium of human WAT explants induced significant steatosis in hepatocyte cell lines. Factor(s) responsible for the conditioned medium-induced steatosis were screened by a battery of blocking antibodies against different cytokines/chemokines shown to be secreted by WAT. In contrast to interleukin-8 and interleukin-6, the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was capable of inducing steatosis in hepatocytes in a time-dependent manner at concentrations similar to those found in conditioned medium. Incubation of conditioned medium with antimonocyte chemoattractant protein-1 antibodies prevented triglyceride accumulation. Investigation of the mechanism leading to the triglyceride accumulation showed that both a diminution of apolipoprotein B secretion and an increase in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase messenger RNA may be involved. Conclusion: The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 secreted by adipose tissue may induce steatosis not only recruiting macrophages but also acting directly on hepatocytes.

The high-speed gamma-ray tomograph comprises five 500 mCi 241Am gamma-ray sources, each at a principal energy of 59.5 keV, which corresponds to five detector modules, each consisting of 17 CdZnTe detectors. The DACS design is based on Microchip's PIC18F4550 and PIC18F4620 microcontrollers, which facilitates an USB 2.0 interface protocol and an Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) interface protocol, respectively. By implementing the USB- and Ethernet-based DACS, a sufficiently high data acquisition rate is obtained and no dedicated hardware installation is required for the data acquisition computer, assuming that it is already equipped with a standard USB and/or Ethernet port. The API (Application Programming Interface) for the DACS is founded on the National Instrument's LabVIEW graphical development tool, which provides a simple and robust foundation for further application software developments for the tomograph. The data acquisition interval, i.e. the integration time, of the high-speed gamma-ray tomograph is user selectable and is a function of the statistical measurement accuracy required for the specific application. The bandwidth of the DACS is 85 kBytes s-1 for the USB communication protocol and 28 kBytes s-1 for the Ethernet protocol. When using the iterative least square technique reconstruction algorithm with a 1 ms integration time, the USB-based DACS provides an online image update rate of 38 Hz, i.e. 38 frames per second, whereas 31 Hz for the Ethernet-based DACS. The off-line image update rate (storage to disk) for the USB-based DACS is 278 Hz using a 1 ms integration time.

Difficulties and advantages of NaBH4 synthesis by natural available boron source colemanite and borax minerals were discussed. We show that basic chemicals suffice for NaBH4 production in a procedure designed to work below 275 °C. This procedure may be used to compensate for the loss of materials during the recycle. In this procedure, hydrogen including substances have been used to remove oxygen and bond remaining hydrogen to the by-product NaBO2 of dehydrogenation reaction. The wet and dry applications of producing NaBH4 have been also discussed. Moreover, a shorter procedure can be proposed to directly obtain NaBH4 from borax mineral. Among these processes, dehydrogenation is critical but it requires plenty of water. Hence, new types of catalyst are important to reduce the amount of water required during dehydrogenation. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Hydrogen energy; NaBH4","Hydrogen; Nonmetals; Hydrogen energy; NaBH4; Sodium borohydride; Sodium",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849118483

Two mRNAs, an unspliced form of ferritin H mRNA and succinate dehydrogenase subunit b (SDHb) mRNA, are known to comprise an iron responsive element (IRE) in their 5′-untranslated region making them susceptible to translational repression by IRPs at low iron levels. We have investigated the effect of wild-type human IRP1 (hIRP1) and the constitutively active mutant hIRP1-S437 in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster. Endogenous Drosophila IRE-binding activity was readily detected in gel retardation assays. However, translational repression assessed by polysome gradients was only visible for unspliced IRE-containing ferritin H mRNA, but not for SDHb mRNA. Upon expression of exogenous hIRP1-S437 both mRNAs were strongly repressed. This correlated with a diminished survival rate of adult flies with hIRP1 and complete lethality with hIRP1-S437. We conclude that constitutive IRP1 expression is deleterious to fly survival, probably due to the essential function of SDHb or proteins encoded by yet unidentified target mRNAs. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Clustering sensor data as a core task of mining sensor data plays an essential role in analytical applications of sensor networks. Although several algorithms have been proposed to address the problem of distributed clustering, in the domain of sensor networks these algorithms face major new challenges such as limited communication bandwidth and constraints in power supply, and storage resources. Moreover, previous studies about clustering in sensor networks have mostly focused on clustering sensor nodes and designing better network topology for the purpose of energy conservation rather than clustering sensor data for future analytical purposes. In this paper a communication efficient distributed algorithm is proposed for clustering sensory data. This approach addresses the limited bandwidth issue through summarized transmissions. Furthermore communication efficiency of the algorithm contributes to reduced power consumption.

We propose a cooperative mechanism for data distribution that increases system reliability, and at the same time keeps the memory consumption for data storage low on each device. A Reed-Solomon coding scheme is applied as a solution where a certain number of unavailable devices can be tolerated without jeopardizing the system reliability. A prototype of a system is implemented to test the protocol behavior under realistic conditions. Prototyping is done on the OpenSensor platform developed at Aalborg University. To observe the system performance in different settings, additionally a simulator is developed. Performance results indicate that the proposed cooperative data distribution method outperforms the non-cooperative one.

The majority of the visible universe exists in a state of weak ionization, the so called fourth state of matter: plasma. Plasmas are ubiquitous, from those occurring naturally; interstellar molecular clouds, cometary comae, circumstellar shells, to those which are anthropic in origin; flames, combustion engines and fusion reactors. The evolution of these plasmas is driven by the interaction of the plasma constituents, the ions, and the electrons. One of the most important subsets of these reactions is electron-molecular ion recombination. This process is significant for two very important reasons. It is an ionization reducing reaction, removing two ionised species and producing neutral products. Furthermore, these products may themselves be reactive radical species which can then further drive the evolution of the plasma. The rate at which the electron reacts with the ion depends on many parameters, for examples the collision energy, the internal energy of the ion, and the structure of the ion itself. Measuring these properties together with the manner in which the system breaks up is therefore critical if the evolution of the environment is to be understood at all. Several techniques have been developed to study just such reactions to obtain the necessary information on the parameters. In this paper the focus will be on one the most recently developed of these, the Ion Storage Ring, together with the detection tools and techniques used to extract the necessary information from the reaction. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Dissociative recombination; Flowing afterglows; Imaging; Mass spectrometry; Product excitation; Rates and cross-sections of reaction; Reaction dynamics; Reaction products; Storage rings","Atoms; Clouds; Combustion; Dissociation; Electrolysis; Electrons; Flow interactions; Fusion reactors; Internal combustion engines; Ion sources; Ionization; Nuclear reactors; Photodissociation; Plasmas; Rate constants; Smoke; Thermochemistry; Circumstellar; Collision energies; Combustion engines; Detection tools; Dissociative recombination; Driving forces; Flowing afterglows; Imaging; Internal energies; Interstellar molecular clouds; Ion storage ring; Ionised species; Mass spectrometry; Molecular ions; Neutral products; Product excitation; Radical species; Rates and cross-sections of reaction; Reaction dynamics; Reaction products; Storage rings; Ions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50149097751

The greenhouse impacts of combustible fuels consist not only of combustion emissions but also of emissions from the fuel production chain and possible effects on the ecosystem carbon storages. It is important to be able to assess the combined, total effect of these different emissions and to express the results in a comprehensive way. In this study, a new concept called relative radiative forcing commitment (RRFC) is presented and applied to depict the greenhouse impact of some combustible fuels currently used in Finland. RRFC is a ratio that accounts for the energy absorbed in the Earth system due to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations (production and combustion of fuel) compared to the energy released in the combustion of fuel. RRFC can also be expressed as a function of time in order to give a dynamic cumulative picture on the caused effect. Varying time horizons can be studied separately, as is the case when studying the effects of different climate policies on varying time scales. The RRFC for coal for 100 years is about 170, which means that in 100 years 170 times more energy is absorbed in the atmosphere due to the emissions of coal combustion activity than is released in combustion itself. RRFC values of the other studied fuel production chains varied from about 30 (forest residues fuel) to 190 (peat fuel) for the 100-year study period. The length of the studied time horizon had an impact on the RRFC values and, to some extent, on the relative positions of various fuels. © 2008 The Author(s).","Emission analysis; Energy sources; Fuels; Greenhouse impact; Radiative forcing","Climate change mitigation; Climate policies; Combustion activity; Combustion emissions; Earth systems; Emission analysis; Energy sources; Finland; Fuel production; Function of time; Greenhouse gas concentrations; Greenhouse impact; Human actions; New concept; Radiative forcing; Relative positioning; Time horizons; Time scaling; Total effects; Air pollution; Climate change; Coal; Combustion; Energy utilization; Fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Life cycle; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Public policy; Smoke; Thermochemistry; Coal combustion; coal; fuel; climate change; coal; combustion; concentration (composition); emission; fuel; greenhouse effect; human activity; life cycle analysis; mitigation; radiative forcing; article; astronomy; atmosphere; biofuel production; climate; combustion; energy; Finland; greenhouse gas; life cycle; radiative forcing; Air Pollution; Environment; Environmental Exposure; Fossil Fuels; Gasoline; Greenhouse Effect; Vehicle Emissions; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49849100675

It acts on both energy intake and expenditure to maintain relative stability of body weight and energy storage over long period of time. Variation in size of the tetranucleotide repeat located at the 3′ end of leptin gene (LEP3′HVR) can influence leptin expression. Objectives: To predict the association of LEP3′HVR and obesity. Materials and Methods: A case control study consisting of 40 individuals with normal BMI (control group) and 35 individuals with abnormal BMI. LEP3′HVR polymorphic region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS (SPSS, Chicago, Ill). Results: The frequency of LEP3′HVR class I was 52.8% in individuals with abnormal BMI versus 42.5% in the individuals with normal BMI. The homozygous class I (I/I) genotype was identified in 40% of the individuals with abnormal BMI vs 25% of the control group. Individuals with I/I genotypes showed a higher prevalence of obesity when compared with homozygous class II/II genotype (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-5.6). Conclusion: Class (I/I) genotype of LEP3′HVR was associated with increase risk of obesity. © 2008.","Highly variant repeat; LEP3′HVR; Leptin gene; Obesity","leptin; agar gel electrophoresis; anthropometry; article; body mass; case control study; clinical article; controlled study; DNA extraction; female; gene; gene amplification; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; genetic risk; genotype; homozygosity; human; laboratory test; lep3 hvr gene; male; microsatellite polymorphism; obesity; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; statistical analysis; Adult; Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Dyslipidemias; Electrophoresis, Agar Gel; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Leptin; Lipids; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Obesity; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Genetic; Risk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49749084363

Assessments before planting included plant moisture status, root and shoot dry weight, root growth potential (RGP), while after planting root growth, shoot growth phenology, shoot and root dry matter accumulation and stem quality were assessed. Warm storage effects were large, but lift date effects were small. Warm storage for 31 days reduced height and diameter growth, stem quality, total biomass, root growth, and reduced stem quality in the field, but 15 days storage had a smaller effect. Warm storage delayed bud break and shoot growth cessation but survival was unaffected. The depletion of food reserves during storage and low moisture availability might have caused shoot dieback leading to the development of poor quality stems. There was evidence that dry weight fraction of both the shoot tip and the taproot provided good information on the quality of the stock before planting. RGP was also a good indicator of quality.

Getúlio Vargas 333, CEP 25651-075 Petrópolis, RJ, Brazil","Several research groups are giving special attention to quantum walks recently, because this research area have been used with success in the development of new efficient quantum algorithms. A general simulator of quantum walks is very important for the development of this area, since it allows the researchers to focus on the mathematical and physical aspects of the research instead of deviating the efforts to the implementation of specific numerical simulations. In this paper we present QWalk, a quantum walk simulator for one- and two-dimensional lattices. Finite two-dimensional lattices with generic topologies can be used. Decoherence can be simulated by performing measurements or by breaking links of the lattice. We use examples to explain the usage of the software and to show some recent results of the literature that are easily reproduced by the simulator. Program summary: Program title: QWalk. Catalogue identifier: AEAX_v1_0. Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEAX_v1_0.html. Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland. Licensing provisions: GNU General Public Licence. No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 10 010. No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 172 064. Distribution format: tar.gz. Programming language: C. Computer: Any computer with a C compiler that accepts ISO C99 complex arithmetic (recent versions of GCC, for instance). Pre-compiled Windows versions are also provided. Operating system: The software should run in any operating system with a recent C compiler. Successful tests were performed in Linux and Windows. RAM: Less than 10 MB were required for a two-dimensional lattice of size 201 × 201. About 400 MB, for a two-dimensional lattice of size 1601 × 1601. Classification: 16.5. Nature of problem: Classical simulation of discrete quantum walks in one- and two-dimensional lattices. Solution method: Iterative approach without explicit representation of evolution operator. Restrictions: The available amount of RAM memory imposes a limit on the size of the simulations. Unusual features: The software provides an easy way of simulating decoherence through detectors or random broken links. In the two-dimensional simulations it also allows the definition of permanent broken links, besides calculation of total variation distance (from the uniform and from an approximate stationary distribution) and the choice between two different physical lattices. It also provides an easy way of performing measurements on specific sites of the 2D lattice and the analysis of observation screens. In one-dimensional simulations it allows the choice between three different lattices. Both one- and two-dimensional simulations facilitates the generation of graphics by automatically generating gnuplot scrips. Additional comments: •An earlier version of QWalk was first presented in [1].•The simulator generates gnuplot scripts that can be used to make graphics of the output data.•Several examples of input files are provided. Running time: The simulation of 100 steps for a two-dimensional lattice of size 201 × 201 took less than 2 seconds on a Pentium IV 2.6 GHz with 512 MB of RAM memory, 512 KB of cache memory and under Linux. It also took about 15 minutes for a lattice of size 1601 × 1601 on the same computer. Optimization option -O2 was used during compilation for these tests. References: [1] F.L. Marquezino, R.

Building on transaction cost economics and modern economics-based strategy research, this study presents a model that explores the influence of six important knowledge determinants on two key elements of the internationalization strategy, i.e. on the choice of entry mode and market concentration/diversification. We tested the model among 78 internationally operating Finnish ICT SMEs. The survey results indicate that the internationalization strategy is linked with uncertainty, asset specificity, appropriability of knowledge assets through tacitness and legal means, and economies of scale and scope. However, no link was found between opportunism and internationalization strategy of the firm. The paper concludes with implications to managers and future research. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as micro elements of society and part of macro economy, ICT becomes crucial for e-commerce companies to attain sustainable competitiveness. Towards this, organizations must re-evaluate every aspect of their strategies and quickly adapt their working models to incorporate e-commerce as an essential factor for their success. SMEs are critical to the economies of all countries, and specially the developing ones. They cannot be left behind and many of them are already demonstrating their entrepreneurship strength by grasping the opportunities offered by ICT. E-readiness assessment is an evaluation tool that can be used for measuring the diffusion rate of ICT. However, critical issues for e-readiness assessment of SMEs have not been systematically investigated for developing countries. Some existing studies have derived their critical factors from macro perspectives at country level and have not considered the important factors at micro level for SMEs in an integrated way. This paper aims to bridge this gap. This research paper first reviews the e-readiness assessment models proposed for countries at macro scale and then identifies the critical factors for SMEs e-readiness assessment. This is achieved through factor analysis at the micro perspective of some Iranian non-profit ICT SMEs. The extracted factors are organizational features, ICT infrastructures, ICT availability and security and legal environment. This study is probably the first to provide a perspective of critical issues for e-readiness assessment in SMEs based on macro models in a developing country. It gives valuable insight and guidelines which hopefully will help the managers in developing countries to consider the critical issues for e-readiness assessment of their organization in an effective way. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The system's structure is based on environmental impact evaluation (EIE). However, if an erroneous or inadequate methodology is applied, the entire process may be jeopardized. Many methodologies have been developed for making of EIEs, some of them are fairly complex and unsuitable for EMS implementation in an organizational context, principally when small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) are involved. The proposed methodology for EIE is part of a model for implementing EMS. The methodological approach used was a qualitative exploratory research method based upon sources of evidence such as document analyses, semi-structured interviews and participant observations. By adopting a cooperative implementation model based on the theory of system engineering, difficulties relating to implementation of the sub-system were overcome thus encouraging SMEs to implement EMS. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Hotter seasons will lead to even longer storage times and, thus, to shortage of space. Forced cooling methods such as water-immersion and water-spray can be employed to reduce hot-rolled coil cooling time. In this paper, a mathematical model of the thermal behavior of coils is developed to predict and to evaluate the results expected from employing these methods before any real changes can be made on the ground. The results obtained from the model were compared with those from various experiments to verify the model's accuracy. The cooling time was then computed based on changes effected in the boundary conditions appropriate to each of the forced cooling methods employed. Moreover, the savings in storage times were compared to identify the best cooling method. Predictions showed that water immersion at the beginning of cooling cycle was more effective and that the cycle should not exceed 1 h for cost efficiency considerations. When using nozzles to spray it was found that spraying water on end surfaces of coils would be the optimum option resulting in savings in time, water and energy, and with restricted temperature gradient. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work the starch gelatinisation kinetics of D. dumetorum cv. Yellow stored under prevailing tropical ambient conditions (0.98-2.32 kg vapour per 100 m3 airflow) for 0, 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days was studied using a 3 x 5 factorial experiment with three cooking temperature (75, 85 and 95°C) and five cooking times (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 min). Samples were also evaluated for starch properties and gelatinisation temperature. RESULTS: Storage of D. dumetorum tubers caused starch damage. However, the starch gelatinisation temperature was between 70 and 75°C irrespective of the tuber storage duration. The starch gelatinisation reaction followed first-order kinetics defined by the relationship ln(1 - α) = -kGt. The gelatinisation rate was significantly influenced (P ≤ 0.05) by cooking temperature and increased with tuber storage duration. The activation energy also increased with tuber storage duration. CONCLUSION: Although the gelatinisation temperature of D. dumetorum starch was not influenced by tuber storage, the starch gelatinisation process was affected by tuber storage duration, since tuber storage involved a greater need of energy for starch gelatinisation, which may be an effect of the postharvest hardening phenomenon. © 2008 Society of Chemical Industry.","Dioscorea dumetorum; Flour; Gelatinisation; Starch; Storage","Dioscorea alata; Dioscorea dumetorum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49649129401

Due to the growing complexity of these devices, energy aware design exploration has become increasingly important. Current exploration tools often do not support energy estimation, or require the design to be very detailed before the estimate is possible. It is important to get early feedback on both performance and energy consumption during all phases of the design and at higher abstraction levels. This paper presents a unified optimization and exploration framework, from source level transformation to processor architecture design. The proposed retargetable compiler and simulator framework can map applications to a range of processors and memory configurations, simulate and report detailed performance and energy estimates. An accurate energy modeling approach is introduced, which can estimate the energy consumption of processor and memories at a component level, which can help to guide the design process. Fast energy-aware architecture exploration is illustrated using an example processor. The flow is demonstrated using a representative wireless benchmark on two state of the art processors and on a processor with advanced low power extensions for memories. The framework also supports exploration of various novel low power extensions and their combinations. We show that a unified framework enables fast feedback on the effect of source level transformations of the application code on the final cycle count and energy consumption. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Benchmarking; Chlorine compounds; Conservation; Data storage equipment; Embedded systems; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Estimation; High performance liquid chromatography; Mobile devices; Process design; Process engineering; Program compilers; Telecommunication equipment; Abstraction levels; Application codes; Architecture exploration; Cycle counting; Design processes; Embedded architectures; Energy consumption; Energy estimates; Energy modeling; Energy-aware; Energy-aware design; Energy-efficient; Exploration tools; International conferences; Low powers; Processor architectures; Retargetable compilers; Source levels; Source-level transformations; Support energy; Two-state; Unified framework; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50049098025

Structural characterization showed that the one-dimensional nanowires grow along the [001] direction and have the wurtzite structure. The morphology of the nanocrystals is affected by the octadecylphosphonic acid to cadmium (ODPA-to-Cd) mole ratio, the precursor ratio (Cd-to-S mole ratio), the precursor concentration, the precursor injection process, and the type of ligands used in the synthesis. However, we propose that the ODPA-to-Cd mole ratio is the key factor affecting the morphology of the nanowires because it affects both the cleavage rate of the P=S double bond and the nucleation/growth rate of the anisotropic nanocrystals. In addition, it was found that Cd-ODPA complexes give rise to a low diffusion rate of the precursor and hence low reactivity. Therefore, ODPA is good for generating nearly monodisperse and high aspect ratio CdS nanowires. Our nanowires have a high degree of dispersibility and thus can be easily processed for potential applications as solar cells and transistors. Finally, the potential applications of these highly dispersible and high aspect ratio nanowires will also be discussed. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Acids; Cadmium; Cadmium compounds; Chelation; Chlorine compounds; Complexation; Concentration (process); Coordination reactions; Data storage equipment; Electric wire; Nanocrystalline alloys; Nanocrystals; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Nanowires; Photoresists; Pressure drop; Solar energy; Synthesis (chemical); Zinc sulfide; Mole ratios; Mono dispersed; Aspect ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51049110493

Design/methodology/approach The data system is based on information from 83 reorganized Finnish SMEs. Information is divided into four types: pre-filing non-financial, pre-filing financial, reorganization submission, and reorganization plan information. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis is used in data mining to factorize information for each type of information. Logistic regression analysis is applied to assess failure probability. Findings Useful data system can be developed on the basis of pre-filing non-financial information to support reorganization decision. Pre-filing financial information only marginally improves quality of information. Submission and reorganization plan information improve quality in terms of fit but do not significantly improve classification accuracy. Research limitations/implications The sample is small and should be expanded in further studies. The system is developed for Finnish reorganizing firms. It can be generalized to any similar reorganization process. Practical implications The data system is useful for managers, lending specialists, investors, reorganization lawyers, and judges. It warns a SME about reorganization failure before filing petition (passive use). It is also useful in developing successful reorganization plans (active use). Originality/value This paper builds an extensive data system for assessing reorganization failure risk. It makes use of many variables that have not been analyzed in reorganization studies earlier. It deals with SMEs that is rare in reorganization studies. The paper utilizes PLS in assessing failure probability.

Compared to traditional real-time operating systems, embedded system engineers can leverage solutions and knowhow from the Linux development community (e.g., development tools, applications, drivers). Due to the availability of implementations of Internet protocols and network drivers, Linux also facilitates the implementation of embedded systems connected to the Internet. The goal of this paper is to evaluate experimentally the capabilities of the Real-time Linux variant RTAI/LXRT with respect to partitioning between different application software modules. Partitioning ensures that a failure caused by a design fault in one application software module cannot propagate to cause a failure in other application software modules, e.g., by blocking access to the CPU or by overwriting memory. Partitioning is important when building mixed-criticality systems comprising both non safety-critical software modules and safety-related ones. Even at the same level of criticality, partitioning improves the robustness of an embedded system. The experimental results described in this paper point out several limitations of RTAI/LXRT Linux concerning fault isolation. Based on these results, we propose modifications to improve the partitioning with respect to temporal and spatial interference. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Application softwares; Criticality systems; Development tools; Distributed Computing; Fault isolation.; Linux development; Operating systems; Real-Time Operating Systems; Real-time-Linux; Safety-critical software; Spatial interference; Spatial partitioning; System engineers; Automobile drivers; Computer operating systems; Computer programming languages; Computer software; Criticality (nuclear fission); Data storage equipment; Embedded systems; Energy management; Integrated circuits; Internet; Internet protocols; Ketones; Software design; Technology transfer; Real time systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49649115270

The aim of the present work was to study the effect of β-CD on the electrochemical behavior of progesterone in aqueous solution and also to analyze the molecular interactions involved in formation of the inclusion complex. The complex with stoichiometry of 1:1 was thermodynamically characterized. In addition, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) was used to investigate the energetic properties of formation of the inclusion complex along four different pathways (reaction coordinates), considering two possible orientations. From multiple trajectories along these pathways, the potentials of mean force for formation of the β-CD progesterone inclusion complex were calculated. The energy analysis was in good agreement with the experimental results. In the β-CD progesterone inclusion complex, a large portion of the steroid skeleton is included in the β-CD cavity. The lowest energy was found when the D-ring of the guest molecule is located near the secondary hydroxyls of the β3-CD cavity.

The relationship between fluoride content and fluoride release for glass-ionomer cements is not well understood. The aim of this laboratory study was: to determine the fluoride concentrations at the surfaces of glass-ionomer materials with respect to different storage media and different pH environments; to examine the recharge ability of the materials after NaF immersion; and to assess the morphological changes at the material surfaces using scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopic techniques (SEM/EDS). Methods. Five glass-ionomer materials, Fuji Triage (FT), Fuji II LC (FII), Fuji VIII (FVIII), Fuji IX GP (FIX), and Ketac N100 (KN), were analyzed in this study. Resin-based fluoride releasing material Helioseal F (HSF) was used as a comparison material. The sample consisted of 120 cured cement disks (n = 20 disks of each tested material, 10 × 1.5 mm). Five disks of each material were stored in 4 different storage media (I- saline, II- acidic solution ph = 2.5, III- acid solution ph = 5.5, IV- NaF solution (c = 500/106). After 7 days, two disks of each material were transferred from media I, II and III to the NaF solution for 3 min. EDS analysis was conducted in 3 randomly selected spots of each experimental disk. SEM was used to determine morphological characteristics of the material surface. Differences between the experimental groups have been analyzed using Student's t-test with the level of significance set at p < 0.001. Results. FT showed the highest fluoride content at the surface of the material. The lowest amounts of fluoride ions were detected at the surfaces of the FT disks stored at low pH environments, and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Glass-ionomers showed significantly higher fluoride concentrations when compared to the HSF (p < 0.001). After immersion in the NaF solution, fluoride concentrations at the surfaces of the disks increased when compared with previous storage media (FT>FVIII>KN>FII>FIX). SEM analysis of the surface morphology revealed numerous voids, cracks and microporosities in all experimental groups, except for KN and HSF. More homogenous material structure with more discrete cracks was observed in samples stored at neutral pH environment, compared to disks stored in acidic solutions. Conclusion. The tested materials could be considered as promising dental materials with potential prophylactic characteristics due to their relatively high fluoride content, but also the ability to extensively reabsorb fluoride ions, especially in acidic environments. © 2008 Markovic et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49549085516

The trading house, partnered by ConocoPhillips in the project, had planned to invest about ¥50 billion to build moorages for LNG carriers, regasification facilities, and storage tanks at the Port of Long Beach. But the project met with opposition from local residents fearful that the terminal could be a terrorist target or suffer an explosion. As a result of intense lobbying, the California state government decided to freeze approval screening for the terminal. Mitsubishi filed a lawsuit in response, but lost the case in April 2008 and chose not to appeal. In its filing with the FERC, Sound Energy Solutions was forced to withdraw its proposal after Long Beach harbor commissioners ended an environmental review on the project. Since then, Mitsubishi signed an agreement with the Alaska Gasline Port Authority to develop a LNG project in southern Alaska aimed at shipping Alaska North Slope gas to the Lower 48. Under terms of the agreement announced 6/20/2008, Mitsubishi will work with the port authority in developing a spur pipeline to a gas liquefaction plant and export facility at Valdez, following the existing trans-Alaska oil pipeline from a point east of Fairbanks near Delta Junction.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117870304

Other aspects, such as forbidden operating zones and individual turbine efficiency curves, are also important. Although for the self-scheduling of a hydro plant a precise integer modeling of the hydro power production function (HPF) is convenient, in the security constrained short-term hydrothermal dispatch problem for large-scale systems a strategy which best balances an accurate representation with an acceptable computational burden is required. In this paper, a detailed review of different approaches to model the HPF is presented, and a new four-dimensional piecewise linear model is proposed. This model takes into account the water head as a function of forebay and tailrace levels and considers spillage effects. Nonconcave regions of the HPF are approximated by using convexification and regression techniques. A major advantage of this approach is to consider the influence of storage, turbined out-flow and spillage in a single function that can be used in a straightforward way, instead of deriving several curves for different heads. Numerical results show the applicability of this approach to the day-ahead network constrained short-term hydrothermal dispatch problem of the large Brazilian system.

After the mains outage, a fixed frequency and an amplitude of the output voltage are obtained, despite the variable rotor speed. For this reason, it can be successfully applied in the variable-speed wind turbines, adjustable speed water plants, or diesel engines. Moreover, the stand-alone operation of DFIG is useful in a flywheel-based high-energy rotary uninterruptible power supply system. An output voltage is controlled directly by the synchronization of an actual voltage vector with the reference vector represented in a synchronously rotating polar frame. The rotor current angular speed is obtained as a result of vectorial phase-locked loop operation. Any sensors or estimators of the rotor speed or position are unnecessary. Both amplitude and angle control loops are linear. The use of stand-alone operation in grid-connected systems requires mains outage detection. Also, the grid voltage recovery requires a method of synchronization and soft connection of a generator to the grid.

As other sources of energy face restrictions due to availability and environmental concerns, the renewable energy sources get increasing attention. Hydropower for electricity generation is a long and well-known technology being in use for a very long time. The role of hydro-power plants (""hpp"") can differ from continent to continent and from region to region. Whereas in rural and underdeveloped regions hydro power schemes can be the pacemaker for infrastructure, economic and industrial development, in other regions hydropower plants are the backbone of electricity-supply. In the highly industrialized regions, e.g. in Europe much of the hydro-potential is already exploited and the role changed to additional functions. These functions are storage of energy and the possibility of balancing fluctuations of other electricity-sources as wind power. Mountainous regions as the alpine region can also contribute to these storage and balancing demands by providing pumped-storage capacities. In general there are some basic trends for hydro power plants: Run-of-river projects for new production capacities: There are two trends: one aiming for big new plants expanding the existing limits in unit size and output. The other aims for economic solutions for small and medium size-plants and for short delivery times. Pumped storage projects for balancing production and demand especially for areas with a high portion of wind-power fed into the grid. In some countries the rehabilitation and upgrading of older plants can offer some additional potential. New and innovative projects like tidal power plants or the idea of utilization of under-sea currents are under investigation. Based on the Austrian experience of hydro-power-plant-operators and equipment suppliers the general trends are illustrated with examples from current projects. The important role of materials and welding can be demonstrated in different stages of hpp projects: New developments offer technologies for welding-fabrication of turbine runners or efficient on site welding production and installation of penstocks.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed a similar degree of silane grafting among the various blend compositions. However, the highest crosslink content was observed in EOR, whereas the lowest was found for LDPE. From melting temperature and heat of fusion data, a linear relationship between the amount of the crystalline component and the crosslink content was found. The decrease in crystallinity due to crosslinking was very limited, which implied a high thermal energy storage capacity of the silane-crosslinked products and their good mechanical properties at room temperature.

The topology of the network is reflected in a structure composed by small clusters. This clustering allows the synchronous execution of efficient tripartite key agreement protocols based on pairings. The required computations are simple for the devices to implement, the size of the exchanged messages is minimum and the storage memory required in every node is very small. The proposed protocol also avoids the usage of a TTP or a central authority and achieves a good energy balance.

The rectifier is fed by the AC main and the voltage inverter supplies a three-phase induction motor (IM). This motor is controlled in the flux/speed tracking trajectories. The PWM rectifier is used in order to regulate the DC link voltage and to maintain a unit power-factor on the AC main side. At this level, the sliding mode control is utilised in order to regulate the capacitor voltages of the rectifier, and to maintain the network currents in phase with the voltages. For the inverter, the sliding mode control is established in order to regulate the capacitor voltages and to track the stator current references of the motor. The application of this technique is accomplished in the case of the seven levels rectifier connected to the network and of the seven levels inverter supplying an IM. The tests, concerning the influence of the parametric variations of the motor, the capacities reduction and the random variation of the network voltage on the control performances, have revealed a good level of robustness.

This paper investigates the effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) on energy transfer between a cationic polyfluoreneethynylene copolymer (P1) and Texas Red labeled single-stranded DNA (ssDNA-TR). The presence of SDS in solution affects both the optical properties of P1 and TR emission within P1/ssDNA-TR complexes, which provides basic information on the role of SDS in FRET between P1 and ssDNA-TR. Although the quantum yield of P1 decreases in the presence of low concentrations of SDS, the presence of SDS reduces TR fluorescence quenching within Pl/ssDNA-TR complexes and increases the number of optically active polymer repeat units within the proximity of TR, which are beneficial to P1-sensitized TR emission. In the absence of SDS, FRET from Pl to ssDNA-TR provides a 2.6-fold enhancement in TR emission intensity as compared to that upon direct excitation of TR at 595 nm. At the optimum SDS concentration (5 μM), P1-sensitized TR signal output increases to 11.3-fold relative to direct excitation of TR.

One important idea was proposed by Kolmogorov [J. Fluid Mech. 13, 82 (1962)], which attributes the anomaly to variations of the locally averaged energy dissipation rate. Kraichnan later pointed out that the locally averaged energy dissipation rate is not an inertial-range quantity and a proper inertial-range quantity would be the local energy transfer rate. As a result, Kraichnan's idea attributes the anomaly to variations of the local energy transfer rate. These ideas, generally known as refined similarity hypotheses, can also be extended to study the anomalous scaling of fluctuations of an active scalar, such as the temperature in turbulent convection. We examine the validity of these refined similarity hypotheses and their extensions to an active scalar in shell models of homogeneous turbulence and turbulent convection.

The role of two different surfactant systems commonly employed in the synthesis of these QDs (trioctylphosphine oxide-octadecylamine (TOPO-ODA) system and trioctylphosphine oxide-tetradecylphosphonic acid (TOPO-TDPA) system) on the monolayer behavior and the quality of thin films produced has been investigated. The thin films were characterized by quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM), contact angle measurements, fluorescence spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These QD films were further modified by an amphiphilic polymer, poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-tetradecene) (PMA). The hydrophobic interaction between the polymers and the surfactants attached to the QDs drove the self-assembly process. The carboxylic acid functional groups in the polymer were also used to immobilize avidin.

Many such organizations have been interested in Software Process Improvement (SPI). It has been observed that the successful implementation of SPI methodologies is generally not possible within the context of small and medium-sized software enterprises (SMEs) because they are not capable of bearing the cost of implementing these software process improvement programs. Further the proper implementation of software engineering techniques is difficult task for SMEs as they often operate on limited resources and with strict time constraints. There are number of methodologies to address these issues. In this paper, various SPI methodologies for SMEs are discussed and compared.

It is observed that the relaxation process in the studied glass is slow after 1 and 3 years of natural storage, and can be highly accelerated by γ-irradiation. The glass transition temperature Tg and the endothermic peak area, which is directly related to the relaxation enthalpy Δh, were found to exhibit a remarkable change after irradiation and also during an additional natural storage for 6 months and 1 year of the irradiated Se96Sn4 glass. Tg value of γ-irradiated glass increases by 12 K; meanwhile, that of additional 6-months- and 1-year-stored glass Tg increases by 19 and 20 K in comparison to its counterpart of 1-year-aged non-irradiated sample. The same trend is also observed for Δh, which becomes 2.33, 3.61 and 3.65 times that of the 1-year-aged non-irradiated case, respectively, for γ-irradiated, additional 6-months- and 1-year-stored glass.

In this article, the correlation is determined between these electrical properties and the physical and chemical properties of the SiN dielectric layer. It is demonstrated how a SiN dielectrics with a high refractive index have high Si content and show an increased initial leakage current. However, contradictory to the high leakage current, these dielectrics also show high lifetimes. It is shown that SiN dielectrics with a high Si content contain high numbers of charge trapping centers. Over time, a high concentration of trapped charges is build up to such an extend that the local electric field over the dielectric is significantly decreased. This results in the observed reliability improvement of the dielectric. The final intrinsic quality and reliability of MIMC capacitors can therefore be determined by measurable physical properties of the MIMC dielectric at the time of the deposition of this layer. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We used oocyte diameter and cytological characteristics of the gonad to determine reproductive stages in females and males. The condition index was used to describe the oyster's physiological health. Temperature, salinity, seston, and chlorophyll a, b, and c were recorded at the study site. The Cortez oyster had isometric shell growth, reaching 103.2 ± 1.82 mm height and 150.3 ± 4.98 g total weight. Data were adjusted to the von Bertalanffy growth equation (L∞ = 132.2 mm and K = 1.08 y-1), and survival was about 70%. This native species exhibited a distinctive gametogenic cycle, with the beginning and end of the cycle controlled by seawater temperature fluctuation (15-33°C), which once started, is continuous over a 9-mo period (March to November). Elevated temperature (&gt;25°C) produced high gametogenic activity, exhibiting primary, growing, and mature oocytes, and partial spawning in April, September, and November. The peak spawning event occurred in August, when seawater reached peak temperatures of 31°C to 33°C, which was followed by a significant reduction of the condition index. During winter, storage of nutrients took place, and this appears to be used in the following season for gametogenesis. In general, the condition index was high throughout the study period. Energy for growth and reproduction came from phytoplankton blooms in summer and high concentration throughout the year of nonchlorophyll particulate organic matter. Observations show that this oyster is a protandrous species. High survival, elevated yields, and a long, continuous gametogenic cycle indicate that C. corteziensis has importance in aquaculture in Gulf of California.","Condition index; Crassostrea corteziensis; Gametogenesis; Growth; Oocyte size; Oyster; Von Bertalanffy","algae; Crassostrea corteziensis; Ostreidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50049131133

The Navier-Stokes equations, pressure Poisson equations and continuity are written in primitive variables in a noninertial system fixed to the orbiting cylinder and solved by the finite difference method. Ellipticity values between 0 and 1.2 (from pure in-line oscillation through a full circle and beyond) were investigated. Sudden changes in state (jumps) are found when time-mean or root-mean-square values of force coefficients or energy transfer are plotted against ellipticity. Pre- and post-jump analysis was carried out by investigating limit cycles, time-histories, phase angles and flow patterns. These investigations revealed that ellipticity can have a large effect on the energy transfer between the incompressible fluid and a circular cylinder forced to follow an orbital path, and that small changes in the amplitude of transverse motion can have a dramatic effect. The phase angle was altered by about 180° at the jumps. Also investigated were the direction of orbit, which affects the state curves belonging to the time-mean values of lift only, and the effect of initial conditions, which alters the location of jumps without changing the state curves. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Box 41046, Athens 12201, Greece","The vast majority of Aegean Archipelago Islands cover their continuously increasing electricity demand on the basis of oil-fired autonomous thermal power stations, presenting increased operational cost and power insufficiency. On the other hand, this area has a very high wind potential. However, the stochastic behaviour of the wind and the important fluctuations of daily and seasonal electricity load pose a substantial penetration limit for the contribution of wind energy in the corresponding load demand. The problem investigated in the present study concerns the estimation of the maximum wind energy yield, which is acceptable by an autonomous electrical network, on the basis of the probability distribution of the local grid load demand and the corresponding data related to the available wind potential. For this purpose, an integrated numerical method is developed from first principles. More specifically, the proposed calculation method estimates the maximum wind energy contribution on the basis of the existing wind potential data and the information provided by the system operator concerning the corresponding load demand as well as the operational status of the existing thermal power stations. According to the results obtained, one may state that the present situation imposes a quite narrow limit on the wind energy contributing to the fulfilment of the local societies electrical needs. Hence, only by planning and applying an integrated new strategy concerning the incorporation of new wind power in the local networks, including complementary activities, appropriate energy storage installations and improved electrical load management, it is possible to increase the wind energy participation in the autonomous Islands electrical networks. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Three breeds, Belgian Blue (BB) (n = 12), Limousin (L) (n = 12) and Aberdeen Angus (AA) (n = 12) with varying ability to deposit fat and protein were compared. Blood, muscle and subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissue were sampled. Animal performance, carcass and meat characteristics were determined as well as plasma leptin concentration, leptin gene expression in SC adipose tissue, leptin-receptor gene expression in SC adipose tissue and plasma concentration of insulin, tri-iodothyronin (T3), thyroxin (T4) and cortisol. The BB bulls showed the lowest values of leptin gene expression (P < 0.05). Values of plasma leptin concentration and of leptin-receptor gene expression tended to be lower in BB than in the other breeds. For a similar amount of adipose tissue (after normalisation), BB bulls showed a higher ratio of plasma leptin (P < 0.05), whereas normalised leptin gene and leptin-receptor gene expressions did not significantly differ between breeds. Belgian Blue bulls also differed in their metabolic hormone profile, tending to show lower values of insulin, T3 and T4 than the two other breeds.

We also investigated whether the effect of energy restriction can be further enhanced by modification of dietary protein source and calcium. Methods: Liver metabolomic profile of lean and obese C57Bl/6J mice (n = 10/group) were compared with two groups of weight-reduced mice. ER was performed on control diet and whey protein-based high-calcium diet (whey + Ca). The metabolomic analyses were performed using the UPLC/MS based lipidomic platform and the HPLC/MS/MS based primary metabolite platform. Results: ER on both diets significantly reduced hepatic lipid accumulation and lipid droplet size, while only whey + Ca diet significantly decreased blood glucose (P < 0.001) and serum insulin (P < 0.01). In hepatic lipid species the biggest reduction was in the level of triacylglycerols and ceramides while the level of cholesterol esters was significantly increased during ER. Interestingly, diacylglycerol to phospholipid ratio, an indicator of relative amount of diabetogenic diglyceride species, was increased in the control ER group, but decreased in the whey + Ca ER group (P < 0.001, vs obese). ER on whey + Ca diet also totally reversed the obesity induced increase in the relative level of lipotoxic ceramides (P < 0.001, vs obese; P > 0.05, vs lean). These changes were accompanied with up-regulated TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathway metabolites. Conclusion: ER-induced changes on hepatic metabolomic profile can be significantly affected by dietary protein source. The therapeutic potential of whey protein and calcium should be further studied. © 2008 The WJG Press.

The possible influences of such non-idealities of the correlating wave on the measurements as well as on the calculated distance are discussed. Resulting non-idealities in the raw CAPD output values include clipping and non-linearity, yielding offsets and non-linearities in the calculated phase difference between the original and the reflected signal.

One of them is the use of electric storage water heaters (boilers). This equipment raises the water temperature in a reservoir (tank) using the heat generated by an electric resistance. The behavior of this equipment in Brazil is still a research object and there is not a standard in the country to regulate its efficiency. In this context, an experimental program was conducted aiming to collect power consumption data to evaluate its performance. The boilers underwent an operation cycle to simulate a usage condition aiming to collect parameters for calculating the efficiency. This 1-day cycle was composed of the following phases: hot water withdrawal, reheating and standby heat loss. The methods allowed the identification of different parameters concerning the boilers work, such as: standby heat loss in 24 h, hot water withdrawal rate, reheating time and energy efficiency. The average energy efficiency obtained was of 75%. The lowest efficiency was of 62% for boiler 2 and the highest was of 85% for boiler 9. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The PMC and CEU use high frequency transformers in their power modules. This paper presents a design, implementation and testing results of a high frequency transformer for the EPS of satellite applications. Two approaches are used in the design process of the transformer based on the pre-determined transformer specifications. The transformer is designed based on an ETD 29 ferrite core. The implemented transformer consists of one center-tapped primary coil with eleven center-tapped secondary coils. The offline calculation results and measured values of R, L for transformer coils are convergence. A test circuit for measuring the transformer parameters like voltage, current and B-H hysteresis was implemented and applied. The test results confirm that the voltage waveforms of both primary and secondary coils were as desired. No overlapping occurred between the control signal and the transformer, which was not saturated during testing even during a short circuit test of the secondary channels. The dynamic B-H loop characteristics of the used transformer cores were measured.

Optimal capacitor placement in distribution systems has a number of advantages such as reducing losses, improving voltage profile, improving power factor and so on. The conventional objective function of the optimal capacitor placement consists of the total cost of losses and investments. Since capacitors supply reactive loads locally, they improve the load-carrying capability of the lines and therefore play the same role as redundant lines. Thus, optimal capacitor placement can also improve the reliability indices of a distribution system. Therefore two new objective functions are defined here. The first one is defined as the sum of reliability cost and investment cost. The second is defined by adding the reliability cost, cost of losses and investment cost. The latter is a comprehensive objective function which is the resultant of the conventional and reliability-based objective functions. This problem is solved using a particle swarm optimisation-based algorithm. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach are examined using a distribution network. © 2008 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Capacitors; Dielectric devices; Distributed parameter networks; Distribution of goods; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric power distribution; Electric power factor; Energy storage; Finance; Investments; Local area networks; Distribution networks; Distribution system reliability; Distribution systems; Failure statistics; Individual (PSS 544-7); Investment costs; Load carrying capability; Objective function (OF); Optimal capacitor placement; Particle swarm optimisation (PSO); Power factor (PF); Reactive loads; Reliability costs; Reliability index (RI); Total costs; Voltage profiles; Capacitance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47149110377

These features make nitroprussides interesting cyanometallates-based materials where the role of structural factors on the hydrogen storage can be evaluated. The hydrogen adsorption was studied in T[Fe(CN)5NO] with T = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd; in a series of mixed compositions, Co1-X[Fe(CN)5NO] with T=Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Cd; and in Cu0.55Ni0.55[Fe(CN)5NO]. The largest hydrogen storage capacity was found for Ni[Fe(CN)5NO], 2.54 mol/mol (1.85 wt %) at 75 K and 850 Torr. The hydrogen adsorption in nitroprussides shows a marked dependence on the properties of the metal (T) situated at the cavity surface. The electrostatic interaction between the hydrogen molecule quadrupole moment and the electric field gradient at the cavity surface appears to be the main driving force for the hydrogen adsorption, without discarding a possible direct interaction of H2 with the metal (T). In structures with narrow channels (Mn, Cd), pronounced kinetic effects for the H2 adsorption isotherms are observed, which were ascribed to a strong and localized interaction between the H2 molecule and the metal at the cavity surface. The pore accessibility and the pore volume were evaluated from CO2 adsorption isotherms. The free volume for all the compositions are accessible to the CO2 molecule. The CO2 stabilization within the cavities is also dominated by the electrostatic interaction. All the samples were previously characterized using X-ray energy-dispersed spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, and infrared and Mössbauer spectroscopies. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Electric network topology; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen; Metals; Nonmetals; Transition metals; Crystalline structures; Hydrogen adsorption; Molecular materials; Network topologies; Nitroprussides; Structural factors; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50249144546

The heat transfer coefficient investigated is compared with that of the horizontal channel without deflectors. The aim of the deflectors is to lead the fluid to the space between the heated blocks increasing the dynamics in this area. This zone will normally, without deflectors, become a stagnant fluid zone in which low energy transfer rate occurs. The results show that the heat transfer coefficient is larger as compared to that of the case without deflectors. The increment in the heat transfer coefficient is due primarily to the fluid motion stirred in the area between the heated block due to the deflectors. However, it must be pointed out, this implementation also increases the pressure drop in the channel. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

All four metal ammine chlorides can be compacted to solid tablets with densities of at least 95% of the crystal density. This gives very high indirect hydrogen densities both gravimetrically and volumetrically. Upon heating, NH3 is released from the salts, and by employing an appropriate catalyst, H2 can be released corresponding to up to 9.78 wt % H and 0.116 kg H/L for the Ca(NH 3)8Cl2 salt. The NH3 release from all four salts is investigated using temperature-programmed desorption employing different heating rates. The desorption is found mainly to be limited by heat transfer, indicating that the desorption kinetics are extremely fast for all steps. During desorption from solid tablets of Mg(NH3) 6Cl2, Mn(NH3)6Cl2, and Ni(NH3)6Cl2, nanoporous structures develop, which facilitates desorption from the interior of large, compact tablets. Density functional theory calculations reproduce trends in desorption enthalpies for the systems studied, and a mechanism in which individual chains of the ammines are released from the surface of the crystal is proposed to explain the fast absorption/desorption processes. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Hydrogen; Metals; Nonmetals; High-density; Storage capabilities; Hydrogen storage; ammonium derivative; calcium derivative; hydrogen; magnesium derivative; manganese derivative; metal derivative; nickel; absorption; article; catalyst; chemical analysis; chemical reaction kinetics; controlled study; density functional theory; desorption; diffusion; energy conservation; enthalpy; gravimetry; porosity; tablet; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46949101366

The association between these molecules might be lead to a host/guest compound, in which the physical chemistry properties of the guest molecule, such as high solubility, can be decreased. These new properties acquired by the inclusion phenomena are important to develop a strategy for pharmaceutical formulation. Nuclear magnetic resonance and horizontal attenuated total reflectance provided relevant information on the complex stoichiometries and the sites of interactions between the host and guest molecules. Stoichiometries of 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 βCD/IMI have been detected in solution. Self-diffusion coefficient and dynamic light scattering analysis provided information on the self-aggregation of the complex. Also, isothermal titration calorimetry studies indicated the existence of equilibrium between different complexes in solution. In order to determine the preferred arrangement for the inclusion complex formed by the IMI molecule and βCD, theoretical calculations were performed. Of all proposed supramolecular structures, the 2:1 βCD/IMI complex was calculated to be the most energetically favorable, in both gas and aqueous phases. The calculations indicated that the intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving the hydroxyl groups of βCD play a major role in stabilizing the supramolecular 2:1 structure, corroborating experimental findings. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Agglomeration; Arsenic compounds; Chemistry; Chlorine compounds; Data storage equipment; Essential oils; Flow interactions; Hydrogen; Hydrogen bonds; Isomers; Magnetic resonance; Molecules; Nonmetals; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Physical chemistry; Resonance; Self assembly; Stoichiometry; Sulfur compounds; Supramolecular chemistry; Volumetric analysis; Aqueous phases; Cyclo dextrin; Dynamic light-scattering; Experimental techniques; High solubility; Horizontal attenuated; Host and guest; Hydroxyl groups; Inclusion complexes; Intermolecular hydrogen bonds; Isothermal titration calorimetry; Pharmaceutical formulations; Relevant information; Self-aggregation; Self-diffusion coefficients; Supramolecular interactions; Supramolecular self assemblies; Supramolecular structured; Theoretical calculations; Water soluble; Complexation; cyclodextrin; imipramine; water; aqueous solution; article; calculation; complex formation; diffusion; drug formulation; energy transfer; gas; hydrogen bond; isothermal titration calorimetry; light scattering; molecular interaction; nuclear magnetic resonance; physical chemistry; reflectometry; solubility; stoichiometry; supramolecular chemistry; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46049093389

The present review aims at evaluating the role of endocannabinoid system in glucose dysregulation and the effects of cannabinoid 1 receptor blockade on glucose metabolism in both animal models and overweight/obese humans, especially with type 2 diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: Cannabinoid 1 receptors have been identified not only in the brain, but also in the adipose tissue, the gut, the liver, the skeletal muscle and even the pancreas, all organs playing a key role in glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes. Rimonabant, the first selective cannabinoid 1 receptor blocker in clinical use, has been shown to reduce body weight, waist circumference, glycated haemoglobin, triglycerides, insulin resistance index, and to increase HDL cholesterol and adiponectin concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes, confirming data on nondiabetic overweight/obese patients. Almost half of the metabolic changes, including glycated haemoglobin reduction, could not be explained by weight loss, in agreement with direct peripheral effects. SUMMARY: Cannabinoid 1 blockade reduces food intake and body weight and improves metabolic regulation beyond just weight loss. Because of its positive effect on glucose metabolism, rimonabant deserves consideration in the treatment of overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes. © 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Cannabinoid 1 receptor blocker; Endocannabinoid system; Obesity; Rimonabant; Type 2 diabetes","acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase 1; adiponectin; cannabinoid 1 receptor; cannabinoid receptor antagonist; endocannabinoid; fatty acid amidase; fatty acid synthase; glucose; glycosylated hemoglobin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; messenger RNA; metformin; placebo; rimonabant; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; taranabant; transcription factor; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; cannabinoid 1 receptor; cannabinoid receptor; endocannabinoid; piperidine derivative; pyrazole derivative; rimonabant; abdominal fat; adipose tissue; cholesterol blood level; clinical trial; diabetic obesity; diet restriction; drug mechanism; energy expenditure; exercise; fatty acid oxidation; food intake; gene cluster; gene expression; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; human; hyperinsulinemia; insulin resistance; lipid storage; lipogenesis; metabolic regulation; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; protein expression; receptor blocking; review; steatosis; waist circumference; weight reduction; animal; drug antagonism; glucose blood level; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physiology; Animalia; Animals; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Endocannabinoids; Humans; Obesity; Piperidines; Pyrazoles; Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1; Receptors, Cannabinoid",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54049129686

Molecular mechanics (MM +) calculations suggest that the potential energy (PE/kcal mol-1) of the d-fruc (opening structure) is at least three (3.71) times more stable than the PE of the cycling structure of the same matrix. The oxidation constant (Kox) of the anionic form of the d-Fruc (Fruc-NaOH) is about seven times greater than that of the protonated form (Fruc-H2SO4). Therefore, the anionic form is more highly oxidizable than is the cationic form of this matrix. The limit of detection can be as low as 18 ppm (mg L-1) of d-Fruc. This is about 60 times lower than the blood sugar level (BSL) or 100 times lower than that reported previously. The proposed procedure was applied successfully for the oxidation of D-Fruc in uni-fructose powder. The anionic form of D-Fruc (Fruc-NaOH) has the ability to store energy about 744.72 kJ g-1 h at 608 nm in a condensed lightweight form. Kinetic parameters of the oxidative degradation of the anionic form of D-Fruc at different concentration were deduced. A number of models were used to evaluate the kinetic parameters.

Also, the modeling of the load at different levels is simulated which low voltage and medium voltage capacitors those are available in the market are used. Regarding the above factors in addition to the various parameters in optimization problem, the RCGA is used to find the best and real optimal network with the best rate for the capacitors. Finally, this methodology is tested on a region of the distribution network of the city of Ahvaz in Iran and satisfactory results are obtained. These results show that in addition to the decreasing of the network losses and improvement of the voltage profile, the benefit saving due to application of capacitors is increased. © 2008 CRL Publishing Ltd.","Capacitor placement; Genetic algorithm; Optimization; Unbalanced distribution networks","Algorithms; Capacitance; Capacitors; Dielectric devices; Distributed parameter networks; Distribution of goods; Electric currents; Electric equipment; Electric power distribution; Energy storage; Evaporative cooling systems; Genetic algorithms; Switching circuits; Capacitor banks; Capacitor placement; Distribution networks; Distribution systems; Genetic algorithm; Loss reduction; Low voltages; Medium-voltage; Network loads; Network losses; Optimal placements; Optimal values; Optimiz ation problems; Optimization; Real-coded genetic algorithm; Switched capacitors; Unbalanced distribution networks; Unbalanced distribution systems; Voltage profiles; Paper capacitors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49549104001

CF substrates were obtained from polyacrylonitrile precursor heat treated at two different temperatures of 1000 and 2000 °C to produce the desirable CF carbon graphitization index. This graphitization process influenced the CF conductivity and its chemical surface, also analyzed from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. These three-dimensional CF structures allowed a high incorporation of diamond films compared to other carbon substrates such as glass carbon or HOPG. The electrochemical responses, from these four classes of electrodes, were evaluated focusing their application as electrical double-layer capacitors using cyclic voltammetry and impedance measurements. Cyclic voltammetry results revealed that the electrode formed from BDD grown on CF-2000 presented a typical capacitor behavior with the best rectangular shape, compared to those electrodes of CF or BDD/CF-1000. Furthermore, the BDD/CF-2000 electrode presented the lowest impedance, associated to its significant capacitance value of 1940 μF/cm2 taking into account the BDD films. This behavior was attributed to the strong dependence between diamond coating texture and the CF graphitization temperature. The largest surface area of BDD/CF-2000 was promoted by its singular film growth mechanism associated to the substrate chemical surface. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Better batteries, therefore, are crucial. Nottingham's two teams, led by George Chen in the University's School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering and Christian Klumpner in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, are betting on a so-called ""supercapattery"", which combines the properties of both a supercapacitor and a battery, as the next big thing in energy storage technology. Constructed from carbon nanotubes and with a large dash of traditional battery materials, the supercapatteries are currently used for powering portable electrical devices such as laptops. The Nottingham team hopes to stack the devices for large-scale storage.

It is shown that the SIV lifetime is strongly dependent on the passivation quality at the cap layer/interconnect interface, the confinement effect by the surrounding materials to the interconnects, and the available diffusion paths in the interconnects. Contrary to the traditional power-law creep model, we find that the temperature exponent in SIV lifetime formulation is determined by the available diffusion paths for the interconnect atoms and the interconnect geometries. The critical temperature for the SIV is found to be independent of passivation integrity and dielectric confinement effect. Actual stress-free temperature (SFT) during the SIV process is also found to be different from the dielectric/cap layer deposition temperature or the final annealing temperature of the metallization, and it can be evaluated analytically once the activation energy, temperature exponent and critical temperature are determined experimentally. The smaller actual SFT indicates that a strong stress relaxation occurs before the high temperature storage test.

The first two of the presented filters can simultaneously realize high-output impedance low-pass, band-pass and high-pass responses. Also, the two filters can provide notch and all-pass filter responses with interconnection of the relevant output currents. The first developed one needs no critical active and passive element matching conditions and/or cancellation constraints. The second and third introduced ones employ only grounded capacitors. The fourth proposed filter derived from the third one uses only plus-type single output CCCIIs (CCCII+s). The fifth filter can be constructed using commercially available active devices such as AD844s along with additional resistors instead of CCCII+s of the fourth proposed filter to perform experimental test easily. All of the proposed filters have low active and passive element sensitivities. Time and frequency domain analyses are performed for the first, second and third realized filters using SPICE simulation program. Also, experimental test is achieved for the fifth filter.

Furthermore, low-moisture-content coal is needed for the various coal pyrolysis, gasification developed. Hence, various upgrading processes have been developed to reduce the moisture content. Moisture readsorption and spontaneous combustion are important issues in coal upgrading processes. This article discusses results of laboratory experiments conducted to study the options for minimization of readsorption of moisture after drying of selected coal samples. Results suggest that there is little benefit in drying low-rank coal at high temperatures. It was found that the higher the amount of bitumen used for coating, the lower is the readsorption of moisture by dried coal. Also, mixing high-temperature-dried coal with wet coal in appropriate proportion can yield reduced moisture content as the sensible heat in the hot coal is utilized for evaporation.","Blending; Coal drying; Heat treatment; Moisture content; Readsorption; Spontaneous combustion","Chemical reactions; Cladding (coating); Coal; Coal industry; Combustion; Curing; Dewatering; Drying; Energy utilization; Mine fires; Mixing; Moisture; Moisture determination; Smoke; Spontaneous combustion; Thermochemistry; Coal pyrolysis; Coal samples; Energy sourcing; High moisture; High temperature (HT); Laboratory experiments; Low rank coals; Moisture content (MC); Readsorption; Safety hazards; Sensible heats; Transportation costs; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47349091283

Pressure evolution was monitored during discharge tests at constant temperature for different flow rates and initial charge pressures. A decrease in the dynamic pressure measured during the discharge was observed as a function of time, in agreement with the alloy plateau pressure slope. Also, a decrease in the dynamic discharge pressure with increasing discharge flow rates was found, associated with the hydride decomposition kinetics and heat transfer conditions. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","AB5 intermetallic; Hydride container; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydrides","Desorption; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Lithium batteries; Sorption; activation behavior; And heat transfer; hydrogen storages; Metal hydride (MeH); Performance testing; Containers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47049104347

Since the burning of fossil-based fuels is an important source of GHGs, the policies on GHG mitigation encourage the replacement of fossil-based energy with biomass energy. This policy would lead to a large-scale conversion of land to production of crops for biomass energy. The impacts of GHG mitigation policies were analyzed for five types of agricultural land-cropland, managed forestry, pasture, unmanaged forestry, and unmanaged grassland-in terms of their carbon storage capacities and the effects of conversion of the land to use for biomass fuel cropland. The research indicates that biomass energy production would lead to a reduction of the biological carbon-storage capacities of these land types. Although there would still be a net benefit in reducing atmospheric GHG emissions, such benefits would be partly counteracted by the land-use conversion. Thus, this paper provides an example of the need for further study to discern all the implications of proposed GHG mitigation policies and technologies and the degrees to which they are likely to enhance our future. One of the most debated topics today is global climate change, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are widely acknowledged to be responsible for much of the global temperature increases observed in the past century. Aiming at mitigating GHG emissions, most national governments have signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty ratifying the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with the objective of reducing GHG emissions. © 2008 ASCE.","Biomass; Emissions; Energy sources; Global warming; Land usage","Agriculture; Air pollution; Alternative fuels; Biological materials; Biomass; Climate change; Climate control; Climatology; Energy conversion; Forestry; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; International cooperation; Land use; Laws and legislation; Lead; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Storage (materials); Timber; (R ,s ,S) policy; Agricultural lands; Bio mass energy; Bio-mass fuels; Carbon storage; Century (CO); GHG emissions; Global climate changes; Global temperatures; Green house gas (GHG) emissions; Kyoto Protocol (KP); Land use; Mitigation policies; national governments; Storage capacities; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); Leakage (fluid); Biomass; Combustion; Emission; Forestry; Fossil Fuels; Fuels; Gas; Greenhouse Gases; Land Use; Meteorology; Storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45849111791

In the induction equation it appears as an advective term and for this reason it is expected to be important in the solar and stellar dynamo processes. Aims: We explore the effects of turbulent pumping in a flux-dominated Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo model with a solar-like rotation law. Methods: As a first step, only vertical pumping has been considered through the inclusion of a radial diamagnetic term in the induction equation. In the second step, a latitudinal pumping term was included and then, a near-surface shear was included. Results: The results reveal the importance of the pumping mechanism in solving current limitations in mean field dynamo modeling, such as the storage of the magnetic flux and the latitudinal distribution of the sunspots. If a meridional flow is assumed to be present only in the upper part of the convective zone, it is the full turbulent pumping that regulates both the period of the solar cycle and the latitudinal distribution of the sunspot activity. In models that consider shear near the surface, a second shell of toroidal field is generated above at all latitudes. If the full pumping is also included, the polar toroidal fields are efficiently advected inwards, and the toroidal magnetic activity survives only at the observed latitudes near the equator. With regard to the parity of the magnetic field, only models that combine turbulent pumping with near-surface shear always converge to the dipolar parity.Conclusions. This result suggests that, under the Babcock-Leighton approach, the equartorward motion of the observed magnetic activity is governed by the latitudinal pumping of the toroidal magnetic field rather than by a large scale coherent meridional flow. Our results support the idea that the parity problem is related to the quadrupolar imprint of the meridional flow on the poloidal component of the magnetic field and the turbulent pumping positively contributes to wash out this imprint. © 2008 ESO.","Sun: activity; Sun: magnetic fields","DC generators; Electric generators; Equations of motion; Flux pinning; Interactive devices; Magnetic devices; Magnetic field measurement; Magnetic fields; Magnetic flux; Magnetic materials; Magnetic storage; Magnetic structure; Magnetism; Mathematical models; Numerical methods; Photoacoustic effect; Shearing machines; Solar energy; Surface properties; Surfaces; Turbulence; (1 1 0) surface; Convective zones; Induction equations; Large scales; Latitudinal distribution; Magnetic (CE); Magnetic activity; Magnetic pumping; mean fields; Meridional flows; parity problems; Pumping effect; Pumping mechanism; Solar cycles; Solar dynamos; sunspot activity; Toroidal Field (TF); Toroidal magnetic fields; Wash out; Turbulence models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45249092098

It also explores the possible beneficial effects of dietary fish oil supplementation on cardiac lipids and glucose metabolism. With this purpose, male Wistar rats were fed an SRD for 6 months. Whereas half of the animals continued with the same diet for up to 8 months, the other half was fed an SRD in which fish oil (7% + 1% corn oil wt/wt) replaced corn oil (8% wt/wt) from months 6 to 8. The results were compared with rats fed a control diet (starch 62.5% wt/wt). The cardiac muscle of SRD-fed rats showed (1) a significant reduction (P < .05) in key enzymes activities and metabolites involved in glucose metabolism, accompanied by a significant (P < .05) increase of lipid storage (triglyceride, long-chain acyl coenzyme A, and diacylglycerol), and (2) a significant increase (P < .05) of nPKCε protein mass expression in the membrane fraction without changes in the cPKCβII. Dietary fish oil, which reduces the availability of plasma lipid flux and normalizes glucose homeostasis, was able to reverse heart muscle lipotoxicity. Fish oil benefits key enzymes activities in glucose metabolism and normalizes glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentration, and the altered nPKCε protein mass expression translocation in the heart of SRD-fed rats.

The observed absorbance decrease (λ around 720 nm, dark green coloration) with increasing concentration of the inorganic oxidizing agent (KMnO 4) can be attributed to the oxidative hydrolysis mechanism. The oxidative hydrolysis constant (K h) is highly dependent on the strength of the acid used. The HClO4-doped POAN matrix has the ability to store about 128.878 kJ·g-1 chromogenic energy (CE) at the wavelength 720 nm in a condensed lightweight form.

Kinetic parameters of the oxidative hydrolysis reaction of the HA-doped POAN matrix were deduced from absorbance variations with time.

State of the art renewable energy generation systems include separate units such as electrolyzer, hydrogen storage vessel and a fuel cell system for the conversion of H2 back into electricity, when required. In this work, a novel electrochemical system has been developed which integrates hydrogen production, storage and compression in only one device, at relatively low cost and high efficiency. The developed prototype comprises a six-electrode cell assembly using an AB5-type metal hydride and Ni plates as counter electrodes, in a 35-wt% KOH solution. Metal hydride electrodes with chemical composition LaNi4.3Co0.4Al0.3 were prepared by high frequency vacuum melting followed by high temperature annealing. X-ray phase analysis showed typical hexagonal structure and no traces of other intermetallic compounds belonging to the La-Ni phase diagram. Thermodynamic study has been performed in a Sieverts type of apparatus produced by Labtech Int. During cycling, the charging/discharging process was studied in situ using a gas chromatograph from Agilent. It is anticipated that the device will be integrated as a combined hydrogen generator and storage unit in a stand-alone system associated to a 1-kW fuel cell. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the earlier regulated electricity markets, production capacities exceeded demand due to security of supply concerns. The present deregulated markets base investments upon profitability alone, and security of supply issues are claimed to be less important. Market operators trust the pricing mechanism in competitive markets to clear. Then low inflow constitutes a less problem. Several markets, both under regulated and deregulated regimes, have faced serious droughts. Some of them have experienced problems with market clearance (Chile, Brazil, California) while other markets functioned well (The Nordic market). Important features to the market response are the flexibility of demand, the pattern of inflow shortage, the storage capacities, the possibility of trade between regions with different production technologies, and the market design and concentration. We apply an empirical based market model to simulate the effects under two inflow shortage scenarios in an international market with combined hydro and thermal capacities and restricted transmission capacities. We compare the scenarios with actual events and show that the model and the real market outcome are comparable. The simulations do not reveal any problems with the functioning of the market, which should calm down the anxiousness about security of supply in deregulated markets with stochastic energy supply. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, distributed plant operators are eager to reduce uncertainties related to fuel and electricity price fluctuations. These interests meet-up for options in distributed supply that introduces the principle of storage and relocation, typically by integrating heat pumps (HP) or electric boilers (EBs) into the operational strategies of existing CHP plants. This paper introduces the principle of storage and relocation by energy system design, and proposes for the storage and relocation potential of a technology option to be found by comparing options by their storage and relocation coefficient Rc, defined as the statistical correlation between net electricity exchange between plant and grid, and the electricity demand minus intermittent renewable electricity production. Detailed operational analyses made for various CHP options within the West Danish energy system, point to the concepts of CHP-HP and CHP-HP cold storage for effectively increasing energy system flexibility. For CHP-HP cold storage, Rc increases from 0.518 to 0.547, while the plant's fuel efficiency increases from 92.0% to 97.2%. These findings are discussed within frameworks of renewable energy systems, suggesting principles for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation system designs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This work presents a numerical methodology for optimum sizing of the various components of a reversible hydraulic system designed to recover the electric energy that is rejected from wind farms due to imposed grid limitations. The algorithm is applied to study a practical case using time variation data of rejected power from a number of wind farms installed in the island of Crete, Greece. The free design parameters of the system include the turbine size, the size and the number of the pumps, the penstock diameter and thickness, and the reservoirs' capacity, whereas some critical financial parameters are also considered. The numerical procedure combines an evaluation algorithm that simulates in detail the plant operation during a 12-month period, and an automated optimization software based on evolutionary algorithms. The economic analysis uses dynamic evaluation methods and the attainability of various objectives is examined using single or multi-objective optimizations. In addition, the developed numerical tool is used to perform several parametric studies and sensitivity tests in order to analyse in depth the influence of the most important parameters on the plant operation and economic behaviour. The results showed that a well optimized design may be crucial for the technical and economic viability of the examined system. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

During this investigation, discard coals from four stockpiles varying in age from 5 to 40 years were characterised chemically and petrographically, with a specific focus on the petrographic-based abnormal condition analysis to determine the degree of secondary weathering. Drop tube furnace tests were conducted to determine the combustibility of the weathered stockpiled or dumped coals relative to typical Eskom coals, and the resultant char forms were characterised. A direct correlation with the extent of weathering and combustion performance was determined, with the more weathered coals reporting enhanced combustion reactions at lower temperatures. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This region, one of the greatest wetlands in the world, is located in the central western part of South America. It has very peculiar environmental and ecological characteristics, a great biodiversity and an irregular hydrological cycle, which often presents floods during the wet season and droughts and fires during the dry season. The experimental data were collected in a meteorological tower during the Interdisciplinary Pantanal Experiment (IPE-1), on April-May 1998. This was a transition period between the wet and the dry season, which a shallow water layer was present at several parts of the experimental field, even around the 25 m-height extended meteorological tower. The surface energy budget components associated with the existence of the shallow water layer, its diurnal variability and some turbulent variables related to the surface-atmosphere turbulent exchange processes were investigated. Eddy-correlation and variance methods have been used to estimate turbulent fluxes and to study the validity of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory for the Pantanal region. A mixed layer slab model has been used to estimate the height of the turbulent mixing-layer and to provide useful information to test the validity of general relationships concerning horizontal wind velocity variances above Pantanal. In general, the dimensionless relationships between turbulent variables and scaling parameters agree well with the ones found in the literature. Some aspects regarding the heat storage in the shallow water layer present interesting information about its role in the surface-atmosphere energy exchanges processes along the day. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Drops of 2.3, 3.5 and 6.0 mm were released from various heights onto leaf samples of different ages and flexibility, with adjustable inclinations. Water volumes stored on the samples and those splashed, dripped and evaporated from the samples were measured. Splash occurrence depended on fall height according to the Weber number. It always occurred for 2.3-mm drops striking the target at 92.6% of their terminal velocity, and for release heights greater than 0.14 m for 6.0 mm gravity drops. Splash and storage depended on drop diameter and decreased as leaf inclination increased from 0° to 17° then remained stable beyond that. Splash and drop kinetic energy were strongly linked since the proportion of splash increased with drop kinetic energy which conversely had a limited effect on storage. For leaf inclinations from 27° to 47°, splash of 6.0-mm drops increased up to 40% in comparison with splash measured for leaf inclination of 17°, inducing water sweeping away from the sample surface as non-vertical dripping. In our range of conditions, leaf age and flexibility had no significant effect on storage and splash. Finally, these results allowed us to develop the empirical relationships needed for application of a rainfall interception model to banana plants in order to simulate water flows under the plants to manage erosion, agrochemical leaching and disease propagation hazards. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To obtain the ESR for the above-ground part of the biomass (trunks, branches and litter), the temperatures of one trunk of a dominant tree species of the forest site were measured at three height levels and several radial depths. To compute the ESR in the other parts of the above-ground biomass (twigs, leaves and small size components such as palms and lianas) and the ESR atmospheric fraction, the temperature of the air was measured at four different heights inside and above the forest. The air, trunks and other biomass components contributed 35%, 40% and 25% to the total daily ESR of the forest respectively. For the hourly values during the morning, the total ESR was usually observed to be between 30 and 70 W m-2, but with maxima that can exceed 90 W m-2; during rain events minima as low as -200 W m-2 were observed. During the night and at dawn and dusk, the total ESR may constitute a sizable fraction of the net radiation, on some occasions equaling, or even exceeding it. On a daily basis, values of the total ESR were observed to be between -40% and 5% of the net radiation, depending on the weather conditions during the day. Further, the inclusion of the ESR to compute the surface energy balance improves its closure, mainly during the daylight period and, particularly, during the morning hours; but the best closure occurs for the days in which the daily balance of the total ESR is positive. Finally, simplified expressions are presented for those components of the ESR which do not depend on trunk temperature. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of MWNT additions on the structure, mechanical and yielding behavior of PP were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and tensile tests. XRD traces showed that PP crystallized exclusively in α-form within the nanocomposite, indicating that the presence of MWNT did not influence the crystal structure of PP/MWNT nanocomposites via injection processing. DSC results confirmed that the corporation of MWNT enhanced the nucleation process on PP crystallization. It was also found that the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the activation energy (ΔE) increased with the increase of the amount of MWNT, demonstrating that the mobility of the polymer chain is reduced in the presence of MWNT. DMA analysis showed that the storage modulus and heat deflection temperature of PP/MWNT nanocomposite are improved considerably by adding only 0.3-0.5 wt% MWNT. The PP/MWNT nanocomposites were found to be strain rate and temperature dependence. Their yield stress was described successfully by Erying's equation. An index ""n"" was proposed to characterize the reinforcing effect of MWNTs in PP at a given temperature. The results showed that the n values for the PP/MWNT nanocomposites tend to increase with increasing test temperatures, indicating that the reinforcing effect of MWNTs in PP matrix is more pronounced at higher temperatures. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The multi-armed sea star Heliaster helianthus is a key predator of the intertidal and the shallow rocky subtidal communities of north-central Chile. Natural populations of this sea star have been found with up to 60% of the individuals showing some degree of autotomy. The present study evaluated the effects of autotomy on feeding rate and growth of juvenile and adult H. helianthus after experimentally induced autotomy of 17% and 33% of their arms, as well as on the energy content of the pyloric caeca and gonads of adults during the reproductive period. Experimental juvenile sea stars were maintained and fed in the laboratory over a period of five months and adult sea stars for one month, Intact individuals were maintained as parallel controls. The results showed that juveniles undergoing 33% autotomy decreased their feeding rates, and as a consequence showed lowered net individual growth. In contrast, adults with 17% and 33% autotomy showed marked reductions in feeding. The results showed that autotomized adults had between five and seven times lower contents of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins (and thus energetic content) in their pyloric caeca and gonads. The loss of the arms not only decreased the capacity for feeding in sea stars, but also allocated energy away from growth and reproduction into the process of regeneration of arms. This suggests that autotomy reduces the fitness of H. helianthus. Growth was reduced in the juveniles, while adults became limited in their ability to store energy which then limited their reproductive potential. Finally, based on the important effect of autotomy on reducing the feeding capacity of H. helianthus, the role of this sea star as a predator in the environment may be strongly affected. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The model was based on DEB theory and developed prior to empirical information according to a common mechanistic rule in organisms' physiology. Subsequently, both laboratory and field experiments were specifically designed to collect datasets for parameter estimation and testing of the model. This approach to the modelling aimed to reduce uncertainties in parameter estimates and hence improve the applicability of the model. A lab-based starvation experiment was done over 170 days. Changes in body flesh weight were monitored and the respiration rate was measured. Dry flesh weight and the oxygen consumption rate decreased by 63.4% and 44.0% respectively over the experiment. Ash free dry flesh weight was proportional to the dry flesh weight, with coefficients of 83.5% and 58.7% respectively at the beginning and late stages of the experiment. Field-based growth experiments were done on a marine farm at two depths over 150 days to obtain biological and environmental information. The growth rate of oysters at 8 m depth was significantly greater than at 32 m depth. Chlorophyll-a concentration was highly variable, both spatially and temporally. Variation between depths provided ideal information for validation of the DEB model. Estimates of model parameters were augmented from studies in a local population. In comparison with previous studies on the same species from other ecosystems in the world, intraspecies variation was apparent in some parameters including maximum surface area-specific assimilation rate, which governs the ability of an individual for energy acquisition, and the fraction of energy utilisation rate used for maintenance plus growth, which determines energy fluxes to different components. The maximum storage density and volume-specific cost for growth also showed considerable intraspecies variability. Application of the model developed here showed that it is capable of simulating energetics and growth of the oyster in the growing area of central New Zealand. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Cloaking structure is composed of metal wires guiding TEM modes around the object. In high conductive metal wires at microwave frequencies, the TEM modes are dispersionless and the energy propagates along the wires. A plane wave incident onto a wire medium (WM) under any angle, excites both TEM and TM modes, which have similar polarizations. The TEM modes provide full transmission through the cloaking structure if the total length of wires equals a number of half-wavelengths. The TM mode attenuates in WM at frequencies below the plasma frequency of WM and does not contribute to reflection if the WM is dense enough. The angle between WM and the propagation direction of the incoming wave is chosen so that the difference in paths of waves in WM and free space outside the cloak is a multiple of wavelengths in order to eliminate distortion of the phase front. In the infrared range quasi-TEM modes, supporting propagation of plasmons, play role of TEM modes. Parameters of WM are chosen so that the quasi-TEM modes have low dispersion and their phase velocity is slightly less than the speed of light. Results of HFSS simulations demonstrate considerable cloaking effect.","Cloaking; Wire media","Crack propagation; Materials science; Plasma diagnostics; Plasma waves; Reflection; Storage allocation (computer); Structural metals; Waves; Wire; (Hi-Bi) waveguide; a plane; Dispersionless; Distortion (deformation); Free spaces; In order; Infrared (IR); Infrared range; Metal wires; Metamaterials (MTM); nove l approach; phase fronts; Plasma frequencies; Propagation directions; Speed of light; TEM modes; Total length; Transverse-magnetic (TM) modes; wire medium; Transient analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149126399

Here we present a comparative study of the influence of the pseudo-gap on the fluorescence emission of either organic dyes or nanocrystals embedded within a photonic crystal. Our results clearly show that the optical properties of the emitters are primarily controlled by the presence of a pseudo-gap which causes inhibition of the emission in both cases, regardless of the differences in chemical composition. These findings are mainly attributed to a decrease of the number of available photonic modes for radiative decay of the emitter in a photonic crystal compared to the effective homogeneous medium.

Their band structure can be calculated by a Kronig-Penney like equation where one uses next to the Bloch condition the continuity of the field and its derivative. The bulk absorption behaviour can be observed in the band structure as well but the size of the band gap is decreased proportional to the thickness of the frequency dependent layers. These absorption band gaps are complete for both polarisations and all angles of incidence except for modes propagating parallel to the surface. In this work these surface solutions are compared with ordinary surface plasmons and polaritons propagating on a simple metal/polaritonic to air interface. The band structure calculation of a two-dimensional frequency dependent photonic crystal is much more complicated. For a metallic photonic crystal flat bands occur in the band structure for a certain polarisation which are the surface plasmon (Mie) resonances. We show resulting the field enhancement by calculating the local density of states. Furthermore we investigate the band gap for the second polarisation and design a Wl wave-guide to demonstrate the localisation of the electromagnetic field.",,"Absorption; Architectural design; Band structure; Calculations; Crystal atomic structure; Crystal structure; Crystallography; Crystals; Difference equations; Electric fields; Electromagnetic field theory; Electromagnetic fields; Electromagnetism; Energy gap; Gallium alloys; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Nanostructured materials; Numerical methods; One dimensional; Optical data storage; Photonics; Pigments; Plasmons; Polarization; Powders; Silicon on insulator technology; Solids; Structural design; Structural properties; Surface properties; Surfaces; Two dimensional; (1 1 0) surface; (I ,J) conditions; (PL) properties; Absorption band gaps; air interface; Angles of incidence (AOI); Band gaps; Band-structure calculations; Bulk absorption; Electromagnetic (EM); Field enhancement; flat bands; frequency dependent; Local density of states (LDOS); Localisation; One-dimensional photonic crystals (1D-PC); photonic; Photonic crystal materials; polaritons; Surface plasmon (SP); Surface plasmons (SP); surface states; Two-dimensional (2D); Photonic crystals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149091816

These trends are estimated at each grid point by two methods: one fits a straight line to the time series and the other is based on the difference between the average height between the two halves of the time series. In both cases the trend shows large regional variability, mostly where the intense western boundary currents turn. The authors hypothesize that the regional variability of the sea surface height trends leads to changes in the local geostrophic transport. This in turn affects the instability-related processes that generate mesoscale eddies and enhances the Rossby wave signals. This hypothesis is verified by estimates of the trend of the amplitude of the filtered sea surface height anomaly that contains the spectral bands associated with Rossby waves and mesoscale eddies. The authors found predominantly positive tendency in the amplitude of Rossby waves and eddies, which suggests that, on average, these events are becoming more energetic. In some regions, the variation in amplitude over 13 yr is comparable to the standard deviation of the data and is statistically significant according to both methods employed in this study. It is plausible that in this case, the energy is transferred from the mean currents to the waves and eddies through barotropic and baroclinic instability processes that are more pronounced in the western boundary current extension regions. If these heat storage patterns and trends are confirmed on longer time series, then it will be justified to argue that the warming trend of the last century provides the energy that amplifies both Rossby waves and mesoscale eddies. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Curve fitting; Estimation; Heat storage; Meteorological instruments; Modulation; Standards; Surface topography; Time series analysis; Wave energy conversion; Baroclinic instabilities; Barotropic; Geostrophic transport; Global oceans; Jason-1; Mean currents; Meso-scale eddies; Regional variability; Rossby waves; Sea-surface height anomaly; Sea-surface-height; Spectral banding; Standard deviation; Straight lines; Time-series; Western boundary current; Western boundary currents; Ocean currents; amplitude; baroclinic instability; barotropic instability; estimation method; geostrophic flow; mesoscale eddy; Rossby wave; satellite altimetry; sea surface height; western boundary current",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749114737

Beyond its central role in the hypothalamus, leptin modulates peripheral tissues' responses to growth and storage based on nutrient availability, and it regulates the innate and adaptive immune responses. mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) is a core component of intracellular signaling for cellular growth, mRNA translation, and metabolism. Here, we review recent findings on the cross talk between mTOR and leptin signaling. Important roles for mTOR on leptin signaling have been established both in hypothalamic centers to control food intake and in peripheral cells to regulate lipid metabolism and inflammation. Leptin directly activates resident macrophages to form ADRP-enriched lipid droplets and enhances eicosanoid production via a mechanism that is dependent on activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway.

It was assumed that the main body is suspended by an element characterized by nonlinear elasticity and non-linear damping force and is excited harmonicaly in the vertical direction. The two connected by spring pendulums characterized are mounted to the main body. It is assumed, that the motion of the pendulums are damped by nonlinear resistive forces. Solutions for the system response are presented for specific values of the uncoupled normal frequency ratios and the energy transfer between modes of vibrations is observed. Curves of internal resonances for free vibrations and external resonances for exciting force are shown. In this type system one mode of vibration may excite or damp another one, and except different kinds of periodic vibration there may also appear chaotic vibration. Various techniques, including chaos techniques such as bifurcation diagrams and: time histories, phase plane portraits, power spectral densities, Poincarè maps and exponents of Lyapunov, are used in the identification of the responses.

We perform parametric studies by varying the parameters and location of the attachments, in order to optimize TETs from the plate to the NES. We examine in detail the underlying mechanisms influencing TETs by means of Hilbert-Huang Transforms in combination with Wavelet Transforms. These transforms enable one to systematically study the strong modal interactions between the essentially nonlinear attachments and different plate modes. The efficacy of using this type of essentially nonlinear attachments as passive absorbers of broadband vibration energy is discussed.

A common technique in this regard is to track changes in the synchronous vibration due to imbalance. However, such an approach must consider the controller strategy used with the magnetic bearings. Herein, a simulation model is developed that consists of a flywheel system supported by magnetic bearings, which are controlled using an adaptive strategy that suppresses synchronous vibration. The interaction between the rotor vibration and the controller responses are evaluated in order to provide insight into indicators of crack initiation and growth. The results and conclusions are also validated using an experimental test rig. Some insights and guidelines as to appropriate strategies for crack detection in rotor systems interacting with active bearing controllers is presented and discussed.

Rigor development, post-mortem energy metabolism and quality variations were analysed during 72 h cold storage. The body weight averaged 2.9 and 3.5 kg of the fed and starved salmon, respectively. The starved salmon had lower condition factor (0.99 vs. 1.11) and higher slaughter yield (92.6 vs. 87.5%), but the fat content was similar (11.8-12.9%) in the fed and starved salmon. The initial glycogen level was lower in the starved salmon (21 vs. 29 μmol g- 1), whereas initial ATP levels (6.4-6.6 μmol g- 1) were not affected by starvation. Pre-slaughter stress accelerated rigor development, stimulated lactate formation through post-mortem glycolysis, and increased the breakdown of ATP and CP. The effect of stress on rigor development was less pronounced in starved salmon, and a significant interaction was observed between nutritional status and stress. Rigor development was closely correlated to ATP breakdown, especially in fillets. Acute stress accelerated flesh softening during ice storage. After 72 h storage, the fillets of the starved salmon exposed to careful slaughter handling had the significantly firmest texture, whereas the most intense fillet colour was observed in the starved/stressed salmon. Liquid leakage from the muscle during cold storage was lower in the starved salmon, but pre-slaughter stress had no significant impact. It is concluded that a starvation period of five weeks can improve the resistant to acute stress prior to slaughtering of Atlantic salmon that in turn hampers rigor development. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Aquaculture using bio-flocs technology (BFT) offers a solution to both problems. It combines the removal of nutrients from the water with the production of microbial biomass, which can in situ be used by the culture species as additional food source. Understanding the basics of bio-flocculation is essential for optimal practice. Cells in the flocs can profit from advective flow and as a result, exhibit faster substrate uptake than the planktonic cells. The latter mechanisms appear to be valid for low to moderate mixing intensities as those occurring in most aquaculture systems (0.1-10 W m- 3). Yet, other factors such as dissolved oxygen concentration, choice of organic carbon source and organic loading rate also influence the floc growth. These are all strongly interrelated. It is generally assumed that both ionic binding in accordance with the DLVO theory and Velcro-like molecular binding by means of cellular produced extracellular extensions are playing a role in the aggregation process. Other aggregation factors, such as changing the cell surface charge by extracellular polymers or quorum sensing are also at hand. Physicochemical measurements such as the level of protein, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate and fatty acids can be used to characterize microbial flocs. Molecular methods such as FISH, (real-time) PCR and DGGE allow detecting specific species, evaluating the maturity and stability of the cooperative microbial community and quantifying specific functional genes. Finally, from the practical point of view for aquaculture, it is of interest to have microbial bio-flocs that have a high added value and thus are rich in nutrients. In this respect, the strategy to have a predominance of bacteria which can easily be digested by the aquaculture animals or which contain energy rich storage products such as the poly-β-hydroxybutyrate, appears to be of particular interest. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Dubai and Kuwait have taken steps to make LNG part of their fuel mix, while the GCC as a whole has, for some time, been discussing development of nuclear power. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has gone as far as beginning preliminary negotiations with potential suppliers of both nuclear technology and fuel. In April 2008, Dubai agreed a landmark sales and purchase agreement with Qatargas and Shell, whereby the Dubai Supply Authority will receive up to 3 million ton/yr of LNG from Qatargas 4.

Performance evaluation of the systems is presented and results are used as a guide in selecting appropriate phase-change materials (PCMs) for the absorption heat systems. Evaluation of the system indicates that there is a minimum generator temperature for each configuration of the system, below which there is a drastic drop in the performance of the absorption heat pump system. This temperature provides the lead to the selection of appropriate PCMs for heat storage in heat pump systems, especially those powered by solar energy. Eutectics, therefore, are best suited for such operations. This paper shows that the selection of appropriate PCMs can be determined purely from theoretical thermodynamic considerations. Various heat exchange designs for the storage systems are discussed and their merits and demerits pinpointed. The study concludes that the selection and arrangement of the best design of the storage system can only be achieved by optimisation studies, though the two-fluid tube/shell heat exchanger arrangement presents several advantages over the others.","Ammonia-water; Heat pump systems; Lithium bromide; Material selection; Phase change storage materials; Solar","Absorption; Ammonia; Energy storage; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Lead; Lithium; Phase change materials; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Water absorption; Absorption heat pump systems; Absorption heat pumps; Ammonia water; Generator temperature; Heat exchanging; Heat pumping; Heat storage materials; Heat systems; Lithium bromide; Optimisation; Performance evaluation (PE); Phase change materials (PCMs); Phase changes; Storage materials; Storage systems; Two fluid; Heat pump systems; absorption; absorption efficiency; ammonia; bromide; heat source; lithium; performance assessment; pump; solar power; temperature effect; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249093084

During the simulation of the histamine-hH4R complex, considerable changes occurred in the hH4R structure as well as in the interaction pattern of histamine at the binding site. These changes are in agreement with experimental data published on GPCR activation. In particular, the intracellular side of TM helix VI moved significantly away from TM helices III and VII. Moreover, histamine formed an interaction with Asnl47 (4.57) that was previously proved to be important in hH4R activation. Results of the MD simulations of the native hH4R and the JNJ7777120-hH4R complex suggest that these models represent an inactive conformation of hH4R. MD simulation in the presence of JNJ7777120 resulted in the movement of the intracellular side of TM helix VI in the direction of TM helix III.

The third harmonic of the PALS laser beam with energy ~90J and pulse duration ~250ps (FWHM) was used for irradiation of two kinds of targets made of Cu: a slab and a 3.6m thick foil. The focal point of the beam was located either inside or in front of the target surface, and care was taken to ensure the same laser spot radii in both cases (250m). It was demonstrated that these two opposite focal point positions give rise to significantly different laser-plasma interactions: with either depression or maximum of the laser intensity distribution in the center of the beam, respectively. It was also verified that the focal point position inside of the target is favorable for plasma jets creation, whereas the opposite case is more effective for acceleration of flyers. © 2008 Copyright Cambridge University Press 2008.","Crater creation; Electron density distribution; Focal point; Foil acceleration; Interferometric measurement; Plasma jet; Target irradiation; X-ray radiation","Beam plasma interactions; Chemical modification; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Laser beams; Lasers; Lenses; Optical instruments; Plasma (human); Plasma interactions; Plasmas; Positron annihilation spectroscopy; Pulsed laser deposition; Surface properties; Surfaces; Targets; Cambridge University; Focal points; Focusing lens; Laser energies; laser facilities; laser intensity distribution; Laser plasma interaction (LPI); Laser spots; Pulse duration (PD); solid targets; Target surfaces; Third harmonics; Pulsed laser applications",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45749100463

Therefore, the flywheel is kept in its levitated position by an electrostatic field exerted by an array of electrodes above and underneath the flywheel. Once the flywheel is in contact with either the bottom electrodes or the top electrodes, adhesion forces arise which might prohibit the flywheel from being lifted back to its levitated operation position. The subject of this paper is the investigation of the pull-off forces emerging during the start-up phase of an electrostatically actuated silicon disk, which is a test structure for such a levitated flywheel gyroscope. For the experimental determination of the pull-off forces, a test device based on a levitated flywheel gyroscope design is fabricated featuring soft polymeric and thus insulating springs for the inhibition of the lateral movement of the disk. Furthermore, the surfaces of the silicon disk and the electrode contact areas are modified to reduce the amount of the adhesion forces. For such textured surfaces, a pull-off force of 0.25 ± 0.05 mN is measured for a circular disk with a diameter of 3 mm. This corresponds to an adhesion energy per area of 3.5 μiddot; 10-6 mJ/m2.

As the power harvested from the piezoelectric element is relatively low, energy storage devices are needed to accumulate the energy for intermittent use. In this study, the energy storage devices considered include rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. The traditional electrolytic capacitors are not considered due to their low energy density. The charge/discharge efficiencies of the energy storage devices are of major concern. The equivalent circuit model of the energy storage devices is investigated. It is found that the leakage resistances of the energy storage devices are the dominant factor that influences the charge/discharge efficiency in the piezoelectric energy harvesting systems. A quick test method is proposed to experimentally study the charge/discharge efficiencies of the energy storage devices. The experimental results verify our findings. Adaptability, lifetime, and charging protection circuit of the energy storage devices are also discussed.

A large amount of an indigenous plant source of provitamin A carotenoids are lost to postharvest waste. For example, the postharvest loss of mangoes in the region exceeds an annual total of 100,000 metric tons. In our study, 3.75 metric tons of fresh mangoes were dried using a solar dryer to a final moisture content of 10% to 12%, yielding a total of 360 kg dried mango.

Thus, one greenhouse solar dryer is capable of reducing postharvest mango waste by 3.75 tons providing up to 1.15 million retinol activity equivalents of dietary vitamin A. The use of this technology that requires solar energy and manpower has the potential of increasing dietary vitamin A supply by up to 27,000-fold, compared to the currently available vitamin A in the region.

The aim of both adding a compatibilizer and applying high-energy electron radiation, with doses of up to 300 kGy, to the blends was to enhance their mechanical properties and, at the same time, to investigate the possibility of using these procedures for recycling plastic waste. As compatibilizers, styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene elastomer grafted with maleic anhydride (SEBS-g-MA) and trimethylol propane trimethacrylate (TMPTA) were utilised. They were added in the amounts of 10 and 1 wt%, respectively. It was found that SEBS-g-MA and PS were thermodynamically immiscible with the remaining components of the composites at temperatures ranging from -20 to +150 °C, and that both the addition of TMPTA and the application of the electron radiation insignificantly affected the phase transition temperatures and the loss factor.

The present study deals with the assessment of energy and exergy utilization efficiencies in the industrial sector. Attempts have also been made at understanding the effect of varying dead (reference) state temperatures on these efficiencies. In this context, the methodology used is presented first. It is then applied to Turkey, which is selected as an application country, based on the actual data for 2003. Finally, the results obtained are evaluated and discussed. The Turkish industrial sector (TIS) considered includes iron-steel, chemical-petrochemical, petrochemical-feedstock, cement, fertilizer, sugar, non-iron metal industry and others such as textile and yarn, glass and glassware production, paper, beverage and cigarette, food, wood, leather, etc. All activities in this sector are produced by using electricity and heat energy. Parametric expressions of energy and exergy efficiencies are developed as a function of the dead-state temperature. The energy and exergy efficiency values for the TIS are found to vary from 51.95% to 80.82% and 25.30% to 29.50% at the dead-state temperature variations between 0 and 25 °C, respectively. It is expected that this study will be very beneficial in developing energy policies of countries from the exergy management point of view. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a methodology for an overall energy system analysis of a hydrogen infrastructure, which meets a transportation hydrogen demand profile. The methodology starts by building a mathematical model for optimizing the economic operation of electrolyzers on the electricity market by use of Genetic Algorithms. Demand profiles from the optimization are then included in an overall energy system analysis model studying the electricity market and power balance system effects. A sample 2030 scenario analysis of Western Denmark is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the devised methodology. It is shown that Genetic Algorithms is a flexible tool that can be adapted to optimization problems involving energy storage. On the other hand, it is found that the ability of Genetic Algorithms to find a solution is highly dependent on initial variables and the storage constraint.

The paper discusses the benefits and limitations of the different H2 storage applications, and presents a logistic simulation model for performance evaluation of wind-H2 plants. A case study simulating the use of excess wind power in a weak distribution grid to produce H2 for vehicles has been presented. It is shown that the penetration of wind power can be significantly increased by introducing electrolytic H2 production as a controllable load.

Planetary waves, mostly of the first baroclinic mode, are observed as distinctive patterns in global time series of sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and heat storage. The goal of this study is to compare and validate large-scale SSHA signals from coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) with TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite altimeter observations. The last decade of the models' time series is selected for comparison with the altimeter data. The wave patterns are separated from the meso- and large-scale SSHA signals by digital filters calibrated to select the same spectral bands in both model and altimeter data. The band-wise comparison allows for an assessment of the model skill to simulate the dynamical components of the observed wave field. Comparisons regarding both the seasonal cycle and the Rossby wave field differ significantly among basins. When carried within the same basin, differences can occur between equal latitudes in opposite hemispheres. Furthermore, at some latitudes the MIROC reproduces biannual, annual and semiannual planetary waves with phase speeds and average amplitudes similar to those observed by the altimeter, but with significant differences in phase. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Possible applications include their utilization as optoelectronic and display devices, as spintronic material, in signal transmission and information storage, in the fabrication of special papers, as dosimetric materials and room, temperature solid state lasers. Materials doped with tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ present wide bands originated from electronic transitions in the ionic unfilled 3d electronic shell. The Co2+ 3d electrons are outside of the ion core and therefore their optical properties are directly affected by static and dynamic properties of ligand anions. The magnesium, gallate MgGa2O4 is a partially inverted spinel described as a AB2O4 material with two possible positions for A2+ and B3+ cations. Polycrystalline MgGa2O4 : Co2+ samples were produced by solid-state reactions between ultra-pure raw oxides MgO, β-Ga2O3 and the desired CoCO3 quantities. Photoluminescence data at room temperature and 77 K of MgGa2O 4 polycrystalline samples doped with 0.1 and 1.0% of Co2+ are presented. The visible emission observed is attributed to the 4T1(4P) →4 A2( 4F) spin-allowed transition of Co2+ ions tetrahedrally coordinated by O2- ions. The photoluminescence intensity decreases with temperature, but 90% of the 77 K emission integrated intensity remains at room temperature. Moreover, from lifetime results we estimate that Co 2+ emission quantum efficiency is about 1.0 at room temperature. We also observe that between 0.1 and 1.0% of Co2+ the luminescence intensity decreases. For 1.0% of Co2+ the luminescence intensity is 37% of the obtained for 0.1%. This fact is attributed to non-radiative transfer processes of impurity ion relaxation that become competitive at 1.0% of Co 2+ and show that there is a strongly impurity-concentration luminescence dependence. We also observed that for the higher concentration the band, is slightly shifted to the infrared region. Due to low impurity ion concentration it would not be expected an energy transfer between Co 2+ ions, therefore non-radiative decay processes are responsible by temperature luminescence quenching. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.","Ceramics; Co2+; Photoluminescence",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43649083128

Langmuir, 2007, 23, 659). In this work, the self-, corrected, and transport diffusivities of CO2 and CH4 in these materials are examined using molecular dynamics simulation. The activation energies at infinite dilution are evaluated from the Arrhenius fits to the diffusivities at various temperatures. As loading increases, the self-diffusivities in the three frameworks decrease as a result of the steric hindrance; the corrected diffusivities remain nearly constant or decrease approximately linearly depending on the adsorbate and framework; and the transport diffusivities generally increase except for CO2 in IRMOF-1. The correlation effects are identified to reduce from MFI, Cies to IRMOF-1, in accordance with the porosity increasing in the three frameworks. Predictions of self-, corrected, and transport diffusivities for pure CO 2 and CH4 from the Maxwell-Stefan formulation match the simulation results well. In a CO2/CH4 mixture, the self-diffusivities decreases with loading, and good agreement is found between simulated and predicted results. On the basis of the adsorption and self-diffusivity in the mixture, the permselectivity is found to be marginal in IRMOF-1, slightly enhanced in MFI, and greatest in C168 schwarzite. Although IRMOF-1 has the largest storage capacity for CH4 and CO 2, its selectivity is not satisfactory. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Cobalt compounds; Separation; adsorption selectivity; Cobalt alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649144663

Pigment coated and surface sized papers were modified using two types of atmospheric plasma equipment; one at the pilot scale and one at the laboratory scale. In addition, the plasma treatments were compared to conventional corona treatment. Surface energy was estimated by contact angle measurements and surface chemistry by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as a function of the time during three months. The treatments increased surface energy and oxidation level of surface for both papers. The ageing effect could be detected only in the surface energy, whereas the oxidation level remained stable during the twelve weeks. The decay in surface energy was faster during the first weeks of storage and subsequently leveled off leading to a permanent change. The permanent change was explained as a contribution of oxygen containing polar molecular groups, which were detected by XPS. The ageing effect was suggested to originate from already existing polar molecular groups, which have rotated on the surface by plasma-related process and then rotate back into the material in time. A part of the decay was also explained by the plasma cleaning model, in which the ageing effect occurred through re-contamination. Paper is a multicomponent system, where the constituents that have the lowest surface energy were suggested to migrate to paper surfaces. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These methods are destructive and relatively slow, and compete with non-destructive methods like Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in the scanning electron microscope or angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, which are non-destructive and relatively faster methods. In this work we have concentrated on the use of noble gas ion sputtering with low-energy beams in combination with electron excited Auger electron spectroscopy and imaging for analysis of nanostructured and microstructured samples. No attempt will be made here to justify this method over the other methods, as their relative merits depend on the nature of the sample and the problem at hand. We have thus chosen to study samples and problems for which this technique would be obvious to use. This work is also aimed at providing practical standards and guidelines (""metrology"") for the use of the technique in the context of industrial nanotechnology. The use of Auger electron spectroscopy instead of photoemission spectroscopy is preferred for laterally non-uniform samples due to the presently better resolution capabilities of electron beams and narrower information depths of typical Auger electron transitions. The use of Auger electrons for concentration sampling, and low-energy beams of noble gas ions for sputtering, reduces the adverse influence of atomic mixing.

Life Cycle Assessment is a technique for evaluating the environmental performance of a given product by: identifying and quantifying the energy and raw materials used in its manufacturing process, as well as the emissions of pollutants to water, soil, and air inherent in this production, use and disposal, and evaluating the environmental impact associated with the use of energy and materials and the emissions of pollutants, thus identifying opportunities to improve the system in order to optimize the environmental performance of the product. CETEA (Packaging Technology Center) has conducted a Life Cycle Assessment - LCA study of aluminum can with emphasis in life cycle inventory, collecting data for the reference years 2000-2002. The goal of this paper is to present part of this complete study, focusing the influence of aluminium recycling rate on the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) of aluminum beverage cans in Brazil. Methods. The adopted methodology was based on the recommendations of SETAC - Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry and the ISO 14040 Standard, approved by the Sub-Committee 05 of the Environmental Administration Technical Committee, TC-207, from ISO - INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR STANDARDIZATION [1,2]. Data storage and modeling were performed by employing the PIRA Environmental Management System - PEMS [3]. Results. Taking into account the impact categories adopted in this study, it has been shown that recycling helps to improve the aluminium can environmental profile measured as LCI data. Discussion. For the transformed aluminium products, the recycling rate affects the values of the environmental parameters inventoried, but not in the same proportion, since the contribution of other stages of the product system life cycle and the recycling process remain unchanged, including the yield of this process. In general, the recycling balance is always positive due to the importance of the stages that precede the packaging production and the problem of increasing the municipal waste volume. Conclusions. The advantages of the recycling are obviously concentrated on the inventoried parameters related to the primary aluminum production and to the package disposal. The verified benefits of the recycling increase with the recycling rate enhancement. However, the effects on the inventory do not have the same magnitude of the recycling rate. This happens due to the relative contributions of the other life cycle stages, such as the transportation and sheet or can production. In agreement with the presented results, it is possible to conclude that the aluminum can recycling reduces part of the consumption of natural resources and the emissions associated to the stages previous to the production of the packaging. The parameters specifically related to the stage of aluminum production suffer reduction directly proportional to the increase of the recycling rate. In this way, all of the efforts made to increase the recycling rate will have a positive contribution to the LCI of the aluminum can. Recommendations. It is worth pointing out that LCA studies are iterative and dynamic. The data can always be refined, substituted or complemented with updated information in order to improve the representativeness of the analyzed sector. Perspectives. From this study, the aluminum sector in Brazil is able to quantify the benefits of future actions for environmental improvement of the Brazilian aluminum industry, as well as to contribute technically to Environmental Labeling initiatives regarding aluminum products. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Aluminum; Brazil; Can; Electricity; Energy; Environment; Inventory; Life cycle assessment; Recycling","aluminum; article; beverage; Brazil; chemistry; container; environmental management; environmental parameters; environmental protection; life cycle assessment; methodology; municipal solid waste; organization; packaging; priority journal; recycling; standard; toxicology; waste disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45349103238

We begin with showing that any impedance can be synthesized by a circuit consisting of only two simple power converters, one storage element (e.g. capacitor) and one dissipative element (e.g. resistor) or power source. The implementation of such a circuit for synthesizing any desired impedance can be performed by (i) programming the input current given the input voltage such that the desired impedance function is achieved, (ii) controlling the amount of power dissipation (generation) in the dissipative element (source) so as to match the required active power of the impedance to be synthesized. Then, the instantaneous power will be automatically balanced by the storage element. Such impedance synthesizers find a lot of applications in power electronics. For instance, a resistance synthesizer can be used for power factor correction (PFC), a programmable capacitor or inductor synthesizer (comprising small high-frequency converters) can be used for control applications.

The effects of carnitine deprivation on carnitine homeostasis and energy metabolism are not known in jvs-/- mice. Methods: jvs-/- mice were studied 3, 6 and 10 days after carnitine deprivation, and compared to jvs-/- mice substituted with carnitine, wild-type (jvs+/+) and jvs+/- mice. Carnitine concentrations were assessed radioenzymatically. Results: Compared to wild-type mice, carnitine-treated jvs-/- mice had decreased plasma β-hydroxybutyrate levels and showed hepatic fat accumulation. The carnitine levels in plasma, liver and skeletal muscle were decreased by 58, 16 and 17%, respectively. After ten days of carnitine deprivation, the plasma carnitine concentration had fallen by 87% (to 2.3 μmol/l) and the tissue carnitine levels by ≈50% compared to carnitine-treated jvs-/- mice. Carnitine deprivation was associated with a further drop in plasma β-hydroxybutyrate and increased hepatic fat. Skeletal muscle glycogen stores decreased and lactate levels increased with carnitine deprivation, whereas tissue ATP levels were maintained. Conclusions: In jvs-/- mice, tissue carnitine stores are more resistant than carnitine plasma concentrations to carnitine deprivation. Metabolic changes (liver steatosis and loss of muscle glycogen stores) appear also early after carnitine deprivation. Copyright © 2008 S.

In the designed system, an irreversible color change of a chemical chromatic indicator (from red to yellow) progressively occurs due to the pH decline that results from microbial growth and metabolism in a selected medium. The relation of the TTI response (color change) to the growth and metabolic activity (glucose consumption, lactic acid production, pH decrease) of L. sakei was studied. In addition, the temperature dependence of the TTI kinetics was investigated isothermally in the range of 0 to 16°C and modeled with a system of differential equations. At all temperatures tested, the pH and color changes of the TTI system followed closely the growth of L. sakei, with the endpoint (the time at which a distinct visual color change to the final yellow was observed) of the TTI coinciding with a population level of 107 to 108 CFU/ml. The endpoint decreased from 27 days at 0°C to 2.5 days at 16°C, yielding an activation energy of 97.7 kJ/mol, which was very close to the activation energy of the L. sakei growth rate in the TTI substrate (103.2 kJ/mol). Furthermore, experiments conducted on the effect of the inoculum level showed a negative linear relationship between the level of L. sakei inoculated in the system medium and the endpoint of the TTI. For example, the endpoint at 8°C ranged from 6 to 2 days for inoculum levels of 101 and 106 CFU/ml, respectively. This relationship allows the easy adjustment of the TTI endpoint at a certain temperature according to the shelf life of the food product of concern by using an appropriate inoculum level of L. sakei. The microbial TTI prototype developed in the present study could be used as an effective tool for monitoring shelf life during the distribution and storage of food products that are spoiled primarily by lactic acid bacteria or other bacteria exhibiting similar kinetic responses and spoilage potentials. Apart from the low cost, the main advantage of the proposed TTI is that its response closely matches the loss of the quality of a food product by simulating the microbial spoilage process in particular environments.

Gasthuisberg, Herestraat 49, 3000 Leuven, Belgium","Pregnancy-induced metabolic changes are regulated by signals from an expanded adipose organ. Placental growth factor (PlGF), acting through vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, may be among those signals. There is a steep rise in circulating PlGF during normal pregnancy, which is repressed in gravidas who develop preeclampsia. PlGF-deficiency in mice impairs adipose vascularization and development. Here we studied young-adult PlGF-deficient (PlGF-/-) and wild-type mice on a high-fat diet in the nongravid state and at embryonic day (E) 13.5 or E18.5 of gestation. Litter size and weight were normal, but E18.5 placentas were smaller in PlGF-/- pregnancies. PlGF-/- mice showed altered intraadipose dynamics, with the following: 1) less blood vessels and fewer brown, uncoupling protein (UCP)-1-positive, adipocytes in white sc and perigonadal fat compartments and 2) white adipocyte hypertrophy. The mRNA expression of β3- adrenergic receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, and UCP-1 was decreased accordingly. Moreover, PlGF -/- mice showed hyperinsulinemia. Pregnancy-associated changes were largely comparable in PlGF-/- and wild-type dams. They included expanded sc fat compartments and adipocyte hypertrophy, whereas adipose expression of key angiogenesis/adipogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2) and thermogenesis (β3-adrenergic receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, and UCP-1) genes was down-regulated; circulating insulin levels gradually increased during pregnancy. In conclusion, reduced adipose vascularization in PlGF-/- mice impairs adaptive thermogenesis in favor of energy storage, thereby promoting insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Pregnancy adds to these changes by PlGF-independent mechanisms.

In the current work, a closed form approximate analytical solution for the pressure variations, in porous media reservoirs, was derived for conditions of steady periodic isothermal radial gas flow. Two different expressions for the pressure variation were obtained, one as an infinite series and the other as an integral, where the latter is the computationally preferred solution. In order to evaluate the model accuracy, a finite difference numerical solution of the full non-linear problem was developed. The accuracy of the analytical solution was confirmed through, both, error analysis and comparison against the numerical calculations. The analytical solution can be used to calculate the well pressure variations and the radius of the active region around the well. Examples of calculations are provided, and a parametric study is presented to demonstrate the sensitivity of the well pressure to pertinent parameters.

The scheme is based on the use of battery energy-storage systems in the buffers. The storage systems ensure that protected loads downstream of the buffers can ride through upstream voltage sags and swells. Also, by controlling the buffers to operate in either constant impedance or constant power modes, power is absorbed or injected by the storage systems. The scheme thereby regulates the rotor-angle deviations of generators and enhances network transient stability. A computational method is described in which the capacity of the storage systems is determined to achieve simultaneously the above dual objectives of load ride-through and stability enhancement. The efficacy of the resulting scheme is demonstrated through numerical examples. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The yeast non-polar lipids, triacylglycerol (TAG) and steryl ester (STE), are synthesized by enzymes with overlapping function. Recently, genes encoding these enzymes were identified and gene products were partially characterized. Once formed, TAG and STE are stored in so-called lipid particles/droplets. This compartment which is reminiscent of mammalian lipoproteins from the structural viewpoint is, however, not only a lipid depot but also an organelle actively contributing to lipid metabolism. Non-polar lipid degrading enzymes, TAG lipases and STE hydrolases, also occur in redundancy in the yeast. These proteins, which are components of the lipid particle surface membrane with the exception of one plasma membrane localized STE hydrolase, mobilize non-polar lipids upon requirement. In this review, we describe the coordinate pathways of non-polar lipid synthesis, storage and mobilization in yeast with special emphasis on the role of the different enzymes and organelles involved in these processes. Moreover, we will discuss non-polar lipid homeostasis and its newly discovered links to various cell biological processes in the yeast. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Box 600, Wellington, New Zealand","A new nano-structured calcium silicate (NCS) - phase change composite material has been developed to provide effective thermal buffering for paperboard packages during the transport and temporary storage of chilled perishable food from the supplier to the market. NCS is a proprietary material comprising nano-size platelets stacked together in a unique open framework structure having a high pore volume and liquid absorbency. Alkane phase change materials (PCMs) which absorb and release latent heat energy (∼160-190 J g-1) can be used in heat storage and release applications as they are non-toxic and their operating temperature range can be tuned by the hydrocarbon chain length. The major practical problem of containing the liquid phase has been overcome here by incorporating the alkane PCM (Rubitherm RT6, melting point 8 °C) into the highly porous NCS matrix to a level of about 300 wt% of NCS. A paperboard container constructed and lined with six bubble wrap ""Post-It"" bags containing 400 g NCS-300PCM composite provided sufficient thermal buffering capacity to maintain the temperature inside the container at 10 °C for some 5 h after the outside temperature had increased to about 23 °C. A similar performance was obtained when the container was filled with 2 kg of asparagus, as a model for perishable food. The NCS-300PCM composite therefore provides sufficient thermal buffering to ensure perishable food in a paperboard container remains below 10 °C during transport and temporary storage en route from the supplier to the market. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Box 36, 123, Muscat, Oman","2-pyridone (2Py) and 3-pyridone (3Py) were examined in different solvents and their binding to human serum albumin (HSA) was studied using steady-state spectroscopy and time-resolved fluorescence. Solvation of 2Py and 3Py by water was examined in binary mixtures of 1,4-dioxane and water. Analysis of the absorption and fluorescence data reveals the solvation of the hydrogen bonding center in 2Py by one water molecule and in 3Py by three water molecules. A zwitterionic tautomer of 3Py is formed in water and shows distinct absorption peaks from the absorption of the neutral tautomer. Fluorescence of 3Py was observed in polar solvents only, whereas 2Py is fluorescent in polar and nonpolar solvents. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of 2Py in different solvents indicate less solute-solvent interaction in nonpolar solvents. This observation was confirmed by the measured longer fluorescence lifetime of 2Py in cyclohexane compared to that in water. The mechanism of binding of 2Py and 3Py as probe ligands to HSA was investigated by following the intensity change and lifetime of HSA fluorescence after excitation at 280 nm. The presence of 2Py and 3Py causes a reduction in the fluorescence intensity and lifetime of HSA. This observation indicates that subdomain IIA binding site (Sudlow site I) is the host of the probes and the reduction in the fluorescence of HSA is due to energy transfer from the Trp-214 residue to the probe in each case. The distance between Trp-214 and each of the probes was calculated using Förster theory for energy transfer to be 1.99 nm for HSA/2Py and 2.44 nm for HSA/3Py. The shorter distance in the former complex indicates more efficient energy transfer than in the latter. This was confirmed by estimating the quenching rate constant (kq) in each complex. kq was calculated to be 1.44 × 1012 M-1S-1 for HSA/2Py and 3.45 × 1011 M-1 s-1 for HSA/3Py. The calculated distances and the kq values indicate a static quenching mechanism operative in the two complexes. The binding constants were estimated to be K = (3.4 ± 0.4) × 104 M-1 for the HSA/2Py complex and K= (2.3 ± 0.3) × 104 M-1 for the HSA/3Py complex. The number of binding sites of HSA was calculated to be one in both complexes. The latter results, along with the quenching results, indicate that both probes, 2Py and 3Py, bind only in Sudlow site I in subdomain IIA.","2-pyridone; 3-pyridone; Biological probes; Human serum albumin; Hydroxypyridines; Protein-ligand recognition; Resonance energy transfer; Tautomerization","Absorption; Binary mixtures; Binding energy; Binding sites; Bioconversion; Body fluids; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Ethers; Fluids; Fluorescence; Hydrogen; Hydrogen bonds; Light emission; Luminescence; Mixtures; Molecular structure; Molecules; Quenching; Rate constants; Solvation; Solvents; Water analysis; (e ,2e) theory; 2-pyridone; Absorption and fluorescence spectra; Absorption peaks; Bio-medical applications; Different solvents; Efficient energy transfer; Fluorescence data; Fluorescence intensity (FI); Fluorescence lifetime (FLT); Human Serum Albumin (HSA); Hydrogen bondings; intensity change; Molecular Probes (CO); Non polar solvents; Polar solvents; Pyridone; Quenching rate constant; Solute solvent interactions; specific binding; Sub domains; Time resolved fluorescence (TRF); water molecules; Water absorption",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42249111888

Therefore, in this study, magnitudes of the perturbational, dipolar, and direct covalent contributions to the electronic circular dichroism (CD) are evaluated with the aid of quantum chemical computations. Electronic properties of model porphyrin chromophores are analyzed. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD DFT), particularly with the hybrid B3LYP functional, appeared suitable for estimation of the electronic excitation energies and spectral intensities. The transition dipole coupling (TDC) between chirally stacked porphyrins was determined as the most important mechanism contributing to their optical activity. This is in agreement with previous experimental observations, where chiral matrices often induce the stacking and large CD signals. About a 10 times smaller signal could be achieved by a chiral orientation of the phenyl or similar residues covalently attached to the porphyrin core. Also, this prediction is in agreement with known experiments. Perturbation models realized by a chirally arranged porphyrin and a point charge, or by a porphyrin and the methane molecule, provided the smallest CD signals. The electrically neutral methane induced similar CD magnitudes as those of the charge, but spectral shapes were different. For a complex of porphyrin and the alanine cation, a significant influence of the solvent on the resultant CD spectral shape was observed, while for the charge and methane perturbations, a negligible solvent effect was found. Detailed dependence of the induced optical activity on variations of geometrical parameters is discussed. The simulations of the induced porphyrin activity can thus bring important information about the structure and intermolecular interactions in chiral complexes. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Cadmium compounds; Chromophores; Data storage equipment; Density functional theory; Dichroism; Electric excitation; Electromagnetic induction; Electromagnetism; Electronic properties; Inductance; Magnetism; Mechanisms; Methane; Optical materials; Optical properties; Perturbation techniques; Probability density function; Solvents; Ab initio modelling; American Chemical Society (ACS); B3LYP functional; CD signals; Chiral complexes; Chiral environment; Electronic circular dichroism (ECD); Electronic excitation energies; Experimental observations; Geometrical parameters; Intermolecular interactions (IMI); Optical activities; Point charges; Porphyrin chromophores; Quantum chemical computations; Solvent effects; Spectral intensities; Spectral shaping; Time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT); Transition dipole (TD); Variations of; Porphyrins; porphyrin; article; chemical model; chemical structure; chemistry; circular dichroism; dimerization; electron transport; methodology; Circular Dichroism; Dimerization; Electron Transport; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Porphyrins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949252378

In summer, solar radiation is the most important factor in the arctic energy budget. However, the amount of energy available for driving the soil surface systems depends on the albedo of the surface. The albedo of snow is 60-90%, whereas the albedo in snow-free areas is of the order of 10-20%. The energy budget for a given region is therefore strongly coupled to the fraction of snow-covered ground. By use of different kinds of remote-sensing data (Landsat TM/ETM+, SPOT HRV and Digital Camera Images), the inter- and intra-annual snow-cover distribution in Zackenbergdalen has been monitored. Based on the digital camera data, a model of snow-cover depletion was developed to extend the time series of snow coverage (during melt-off) back in time. The model uses an interpolated data set, which includes information on melt energy and end-of-winter snow amounts, to calculate spatial snow-cover extent during the melting season. The results showed that the date with 50% snow-cover in Zackenbergdalen fluctuated within a margin of approximately ±2 weeks around the mean, which was June 21. During the cold season at high latitudes, short-wave radiation is of minor importance in the energy budget, due to the low sun. Results show that during the winter season, heat advection caused by atmospheric circulation, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), may be important in some periods, and that the sea ice conditions in the south-eastern part of the Greenland Sea might be crucial for the winter precipitation budget in Northeast Greenland; that is, significant correlations (R2 = 0.5-0.6) between snow accumulation at Zackenberg and sea ice cover to the east and southeast of Zackenberg was found, showing that reduced amounts of sea ice in the region may be likely to lead to increased snow precipitation. This effect may counteract the expected prolonged average length of the snow-free (growing) season in high-arctic Northeast Greenland in a future climate with higher temperatures. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Quantum mechanical phenomena result from this, hence the term quantum confinement. Originally, QDs were grown from semiconductors such as cadmium selenide or cadmium telluride. Since then, however, the synthesis of QDs from nearly every semiconductor and from many metals and insulators has been reported. Quantum dots of semiconductors and metals are currently the focus of intense research. Their electrical, optical, and magnetic properties are different from those of the bulk systems being more like those from molecular-like clusters in which a large number of atoms are on or near the surface. Apart from unique physical properties, QDs also exhibit interesting applications. With their advantage of size, they are ideal for data storage or memory applications to provide high-density memory elements. Potential applications of nonvolatile flash memory devices utilizing QDs have resulted in extensive efforts being made to form QDs, acting as both charging and discharging islands, by a variety of methods. Semiconductor or metallic QDs incorporated within organic or polymeric materials have demonstrated a memory effect when subjected to an electrical bias voltage. Memory phenomenon in QDs arise from their electrical bistability, which is triggered by charge confinement via a suitable voltage pulse. These materials have shown potential applications in digital information storage because of their good stability, flexibility and fast response speed. Organic electrical bistable materials are those that exhibit two kinds of different stable conductive states by applying appropriate voltages. The materials can be switched from low conductive state (""0"" or OFF state) to high conductive state (""1"" or ON states) by applying an activation voltage. This process is called 'write'. The high conductive state can remain stable without a bias voltage, and can be read back at a lower voltage. The reverse process is realized by applying a reverse bias when the conductive status changes from a high conductive state to a low conductive state, this being termed 'erase'. Materials functionalized with 'erase' and 'write' can be used as RAM (random access memory) and Flash memory. Some materials are write-once-read-many times (WORM), which can be used as ROM (read-only-memory) devices. For commercial use of data storage, devices should satisfy a number of requirements, such as, room temperature operation, low activation voltage to save energy, high ON/OFF ratio, short response time, long retention time and durability. This chapter reviews the recent progress of memory devices exhibiting electric bistability, such devices being based on composites containing quantum dots of semiconductors or metals embedded in organic macromolecular materials. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, this work investigates the structural and textural evolution after the leachate permeability test of clay soils from three potentials sites for acid effluents storage in the south of Tunisia (soil 1, soil 2, and soil 3). We can notice that the coefficient of permeability decreases according to the time in the case of soil 1 and soil 2 and increase from 6.8 × 10-10 to 1.1 × 10-8 m/s for soil 3. The textural changes for the three varieties of clay soils obtained after the leachate permeability test were studied through nitrogen gas adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature; we determined the specific surface areas (SBET) and total pore and micropore volume. The textural study data have indicated that soil 1 had the lowest textural properties with a pore volume in the 0.06-0.09 cm3 g-1 ranges and with a surface area (SBET) varying between 35.4 and 47.4 m2 g-1.

By comparison, the selectivity of the elimination of these elements is in the order F &gt; P &gt; S for soil 1.

The topic of this work is to suggest an activation mechanism which leads to the dependences similar with CE. The solid is assimilated to a system of the harmonic oscillator with a Bose-Einstein energy distribution. Considering an activation process due to a vibrational energy transfer from a homogeneous and isotropic field of thermic oscillators to the solid-state oscillator, the thermodynamic functions are in the relationship ΔS= ΔH*/T is where ΔH* and ΔS* are the activation functions and T is is the isokinetic temperature. Taking into account the definitions of H and S by means of the partition function, the isokinetic temperature is assimilated with the characteristic temperature T = ℏθ/kB An important consequence, a correlation between the isokinetic temperature and the spectroscopic wavenumber of the activated bond, is illustrated by a number of decomposition reactions under non-isothermal conditions. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Activation mechanism; Compensation effect; Isokinetic temperature; Vibrational energy","Cerium; Chemical activation; Computer networks; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Oscillators (electronic); Photoacoustic effect; Solid state oscillators; Transfer functions; (min ,max ,+) functions; activation mechanisms; activation processing; Compensation effect (CE); Energy distributions; harmonic oscillators; Non isothermal conditions; Vibrational energy transfer; Activation energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44849134505

However, this organ surplus is not being fully realized because, in current transplantation practice, the duration of pancreas storage before transplantation is limited to 8-10 hours due to the extreme vulnerability of pancreatic tissue to anaerobic damage caused by preservation. Objectives: To reduces cold ischemic injury in order to increase the utilization of donor pancreases in israel for whole-organ and cell transplantation. Methods: We evaluated a novel two-layer preservation oxygenated cold storage method that uses perfluorocarbon to continously supply oxygen to the pancreas during preservation in conventional University of Wisconsin solution. Results: Pancreatic tissue morphology, viability and adenosine-triphosphate content were serially examined during preservation of the pig pancreas for 24 hours either by a two-layer or by conventional simple cold storage. Already after 12 hours of storage the superiority of the two-layer method over the University of Wisconsin method was apparent. Starting at this time point and continuing throughout the 24 hours of preservation, the tissue concentration were improved in samples preserved in oxygenated UW/PFC as compared to controls stored in conventional UW solution alone. Conclusions: The UW/PFC two-layer preservation method allowed tissue ATP synthesis and amelioration of cold ischemic tissue damage during extended 24 hour pancreas preservation. This method could be implemented in clinical practice to maximize utilization of pancreata for whole-organ and islet transplantation as well as for pancreas sharing with remote centers.","Pancreatic cells; Perfluorocarbon; Preservation of pancreas; Two-layer method; University of Wisconsin solution","adenosine triphosphate; fluorocarbon; University of Wisconsin solution; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cell viability; cold ischemia; concentration response; controlled study; cryopreservation; energy metabolism; female; histology; intermethod comparison; mitochondrion; morphology; nonhuman; organ preservation; oxygenation; pancreas injury; pancreas transplantation; protein synthesis; storage temperature; swine; tissue injury; tissue preservation; tissue structure; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Cryopreservation; Energy Metabolism; Female; Fluorocarbons; Organ Preservation; Organ Preservation Solutions; Pancreas; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43249094515

The International Energy Agency expects that the world electricity demand will grow by 50% by the year 2030 accordingly. In terms of all primary energies, the growth of demand between 2000 and 2050 is expected to be as high as 200%. Since greenhouse gas emissions increase along with the expansion of energy consumption that will bring about environmental degradation, it is pointed out that the irreversible world catastrophe would suddenly occur before energy resources become depleted, Recently, there exists an opinion that more nuclear energy that emits no CO2 gas should be used, and today there are a lot of plans for building nuclear power stations in China and other developing countries in addition to Japan, the U.S. and Europe. One problem of uranium, however, is that it is only temporarily available and its reserve will last no more than 60 years. Another serious problem is that once the present generation consumed uranium, future generations should take care of radioactive wastes during around 100 years of Interim storage and more than 10 thousands years of final storage. These problems show that nuclear energy is not the ultimate solution. Academic people are saying that making an artificial sun on earth through nuclear fusion should be the solution. However, it is presently predicted that it will take over centuries to realize artificial sun, meaning that at this point in time nuclear fusion is not the solution. In this paper, the author strongly insists that, in this impasse, the only ultimate solution that the present-day engineers can propose is the ""GENESIS Project"" that combines new solar-oriented recyclable energies such as photovoltaic power, wind-turbine power or hydraulic power with high-temperature superconducting power cable that has recently become technologically practical.

Tissue samples were collected every three months and analyzed with histological and biochemical techniques. Energy coefficients were also calculated with data from chemical composition of tissues. Gonad samples in almost all developmental stages occurred throughout the year, suggesting that P. sterna is a multispawning species. The evidence indicates that the main reproductive season runs from January through April (21°C to 22°C) and was identified by higher frequency of ripe gonads, more and larger postvitellogenic oocytes and higher protein, lipid, and triglyceride levels in gonad tissue. Within this study period, there were two spawning peaks, July 2003 and January 2004. Gametogenesis was sustained from energy mainly obtained from the digestive gland and secondly from the adductor muscle. Only proteins from these two tissues were mobilized to the gonad for maturation of sex organs, because carbohydrates were stored despite the progress of gametogenesis. The role of mantle tissue was negligible. P. sterna appears to use a combination of stored reserves (conservative strategy) and food supply (opportunistic strategy) as an overall strategy to regulate reproduction.","Biochemical composition; Bioenergetics; Pearl oysters; Pteria sterna; Reproductive physiology","Pinctada; Pteria sterna",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42449092866

The epiphytic group consists of three closely related clusters, each containing 11 to 16 clones. The closest related cultured isolate is the type strain Haliscomenobacter hydrossis (ATCC 27775) (<87% similarity) in the family Saprospiraceae of the phylum Bacteroidetes. Oligonucleotide probes at different hierarchical levels were designed for each cluster and used for ecophysiological studies. All three clusters behaved similarly in their physiology and were specialized in protein hydrolysis and used amino acids as energy and carbon sources. They were not involved in denitrification. No storage of polyphosphate and polyhydroxyalkanoates was found. They all colonized probe-defined filamentous bacteria belonging to the phyla Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, and candidate phylum TM7, with the exception of cluster 1, which did not colonize TM7 filaments. The three epiphytic clusters were all widespread in domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants with or without biological phosphorus removal, constituting, in total, up to 9% of the bacterial biovolume.

Temporal simulation of the demand-supply matching is carried out for various system configurations. The role of hydrogen technologies for energy storage and fuel cell applications is studied and applied to both stationary energy use and transportation sectors. As an alternative, biofuels may take the role of hydrogen both as a storable fuel and for direct use in the transportation sector. It is shown that there is scope for considerable amounts of energy trade between the countries, due to the different endowments of different countries with particular renewable energy sources, and to the particular benefit that intermittent energy sources, such as wind and solar, can derive from exchange of power. The establishment of a smoothly functioning renewable energy supply system is demonstrated with the use of the seasonal reservoir-based hydrocomponents in the northern parts of the region. The outcome of the competition between biofuels and hydrogen in the transportation sector is dependent on the development of viable fuel cells and on efficient technologies for converting biomass residues to fuels.

Based on the widespread use of baffles in moving liquid containers especially in space vehicles, the ability of baffles in reducing the sloshing effects in storage tanks that are especially broader than fuel containers was under question. Concerning horizontal ring and vertical blade baffles, an estimation of hydrodynamic damping ratio of liquid sloshing in baffled tanks undergoing horizontal excitation has been developed analytically using Laplace's differential equation solution. This method involves the assessment of dissipated fraction of total sloshing oscillation energy, which is caused by the flow separation around the baffles. A series of experiments employing a tank model on a shake-table has been carried out to validate the theoretically predicted damping ratio. A parametric study showed that the ring baffles are more effective in reducing the sloshing oscillations. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides ground storage techniques, thermo-chemical techniques with high heat storage capacity and virtually no heat losses in the storage state are most promising. This paper deals with closed sorption systems and focuses on the concept with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)-water as the working pair. In an experimental prototype system setup, vapor pressure and boiling temperatures of highly concentrated sodium lye, as well as heat charge and discharge processes of the storage under low-pressure conditions were analyzed or verified. The storage capacity is limited by the temperature levels of the produced heat and by the solidification of the NaOH lye. The results for the single-stage prototype show that for charging the storage, solar heat input at 150 °C is needed, and that, compared to conventional water storage, the system-volume-related heat capacity could be increased by a factor of 6 for low-temperature space heating (40 °C) and by a factor of 3 for domestic hot water supply (65-70 °C).

Ions with high internal energy, e.g., as a result of photoexcitation, dissociate and the yield of neutrals is monitored as a function of time. This gives information on lifetimes in the microsecond to millisecond time range but no information on the fragment masses. To determine the dissociation channels, we have introduced pulsed supplies with switching times of a few microseconds.

Energy storage devices can be classified into short and long-term response, depending on their application. Technologies with high power density and with the ability to respond to the requests in short time fractions like flywheels, capacitors or superconducting magnetic coils belong to the so-called short-term response energy storage devices category. Energy storage devices with the capability to absorb and supply electrical energy for long periods of time like pumping hydro, batteries, compressed air and hydrogen fuel cells are considered in the long-term response category.

Based on the conviction that material properties determination is a necessary first step for the efficient handling, processing, and use of materials, this work was initiated with the purpose of characterizing grain dust in terms of its physicochemical and thermal properties. Grain dust as a special waste material is a complex, dry, grey powder, composed mainly of grain chips, soil, whole wheat and barley seeds, and straw. The material was found to have a bulk density of 362 kg/m3, specific heat, thermal conductivity, and gross calorific value were 1540 J/kg K, 0.27 W/m K, and 4120 kJ/kg, respectively. Nutritional composition showed low concentrations of protein, and ether extract, and high concentrations of carbohydrates, ash, and crude fiber. Mineral analysis showed that Ca, Fe, and K were available in significant amounts ranging from 30 to 135 ppm. The as-received material is dry enough to be stored very safely and burned for energy production in either its loose form or as pellets. Moreover, adjustments to the ash content and C:N ratio of the material deems it a promising candidate as an animal feed and as a substrate for composting and biogasification. © 2008 International Association for Mathematical Geology.","Grain dust; Grain dust uses; Material characterization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149115043

This paper describes the operation of a central controller for microgrids. The controller aims to optimize the operation of the microgrid during interconnected operation, i.e., maximize its value by optimizing the production of the local DGs and power exchanges with the main distribution grid. Two market policies are assumed including demand-side bidding options for controllable loads. The developed optimization algorithms are applied on a typical LV study case network operating under various market policies and assuming realistic spot market prices and DG bids reflecting realistic operational costs.

It uses a simple energy storage system to generate a very high impulsive torque by which the motor is started before being connected to the mains supply. The spinning motor can then be connected to the mains to operate in a standard Steinmetz connection without incurring high inrush currents, if the moment of mains connection is properly timed. This paper presents a transient model and an accompanying parameter estimation method through which the transient behavior of three-phase induction motors operated with FAS can be analyzed. The proposed model is based on instantaneous symmetrical components and is used to investigate a 3 kW motor started under various operating conditions.

Objective: We wanted to establish whether early gut microbiota composition can guide weight development throughout early childhood. Design: Overweight and obese children (n = 25) were selected from a prospective follow-up study at the age of 7 y and identified according to the International Obesity Task Force criteria. Normal-weight children (n = 24) were selected from the same cohort and matched for gestational age and body mass index at birth, mode of delivery, probiotic supplementation, duration of breastfeeding, use of antibiotics during infancy, and frequencies of atopic diseases and atopic sensitization. Early fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with microscopic and flow cytometry detection and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: The bifidobacterial numbers in fecal samples during infancy, as assessed by the FISH with flow cytometry, were higher in children remaining normal weight, [median: 2.19 × 109 cells/g (interquartile range: 1.10-5.28 × 109 cells/g)] than in children becoming overweight [1.20 × 109 cells/g (0.48-1.59 × 10 9 cells/g); P = 0.02]. A similar tendency was found by FISH with microscopic detection and qRT-PCR. The microbiota aberrancy during infancy in children becoming overweight was also associated with a greater number of Staphylococcus aureus [0.64 × 106 cells/g (0.33-1.00 × 106 cells/g)] than in children remaining normal weight [0.27 × 106 cells/g (0.17-0.50 × 106 cells/g); P = 0.013]. Conclusion: Aberrant compositional development of the gut microbiota precedes overweight, offering new possibilities for preventive and therapeutic applications in weight management. © 2008 American Society for Nutrition.","Bifidobacteria; Children; Gut microbiota; Infants; Obesity; Overweight; Staphylococcus aureus","antibiotic agent; probiotic agent; antibiotic therapy; article; atopy; Bifidobacteriaceae; body mass; breast feeding; child; childhood obesity; clinical article; controlled study; delivery; diet supplementation; feces microflora; flow cytometry; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gestational age; human; obesity; prediction; real time polymerase chain reaction; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus aureus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549088230

The elemental compositions of the samples were determined by the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence method. The Ca/P ratio and Ca concentration was used as markers of the mineralization development. It was found that the AVH mineralization was accelerated by the applied fresh-wet storage procedure. The aggravation of the AVH mineralization was correlated with the Ca content before storage especially in case of old donors. For donors older than 40 years an increase of Ca concentrations by approximately 40% was observed. To limit AVH mineralization due to fresh-wet storage, age of donors should not exceed ∼40 years. Another method to reduce AVH mineralization relies on a modification of the medium commonly applied in the fresh-wet storage procedure, and research are ongoing. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Aortic valve homograft; Calcification; Fresh-wet storage; Mineralization; XRF","calcium; phosphate; age; allograft; aorta graft; aorta valve; aorta valve replacement; article; autopsy; calcification; concentration (parameters); controlled study; correlation analysis; culture medium; graft preservation; human; human tissue; medical research; mineralization; priority journal; storage temperature; X ray fluorescence; Age Factors; Aortic Valve; Calcinosis; Calcium; Humans; Organ Preservation; Phosphorus; Specimen Handling; Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission; Time Factors; Tissue Donors; Transplantation, Homologous",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39649124038

However, there have been only two studies on this topic for wild rodent species. Here, we analyzed digestive flexibility - that is, changes in gut content, activity of digestive enzymes, and gut morphology - during lactation in the caviomorph rodent Octodon degus. In addition, we evaluated changes in the size of other internal organs and analyzed their relationship with the resting metabolic rate. We found that gut content, the dry masses of digestive chambers, the dry mass of liver, and resting metabolic rate were greater in lactating than in nonbreeding control females. In contrast, fat stores were higher in control subjects. Maltase and aminopeptidase-N specific activity did not change with lactation, and both enzymes had greater activity values in the middle portion of the small intestine. Thus, our data indicate that the previously reported increase in food assimilation that occurs during lactation in O. degus is related to a mass increase in several central organs, leading, in turn, to higher energetic costs. Fat stores may help to mitigate these costs, but, as expected for small animals, to a limited extent. Our study reveals a complex interplay among energy acquisition, storage, and expenditure processes that ultimately determine an organism's fitness. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

The maximum fatty acids absorption of EG was found as 80 wt% without melted fatty acid oozing from the composites. Thermal properties of fatty acid/EG composites were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method. DCS results indicated that the melting and solidification temperatures of the composite PCMs were almost the same as those of fatty acids, and the latent heats of composites were little less than those of the pure fatty acids. The heat charging and discharging rate of the composites were obviously increased due to expanded graphite that had a high thermal conductivity.

Samples were collected monthly from May 2004 to May 2005. Lantern and test indexes did not vary significantly. A major peak of gonad index (GI) was observed in winter (sexual maturation period), with a strong declination in November suggesting a spawning period in spring. In coincidence a shortening of feeding activities was expressed by the lower values of gut index (Gut I), suggesting that the gut is a storage organ. The values of gonad energetic content (GEC) and total gonad energetic content (TGEC) showed minimum values in winter (ripe stage) and the maximum in spring (spawned stage). The TGEC reached higher monthly average values (50-200 kJ) than total gut energetic content (TGuEC) (20-40 kJ). These differences indicate that the gonads constitute the most important store organs in L. albus.

Box 54111, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","This study considers the feasibility of hybridization of existing co-generation plant with reverse osmosis and aquifer storage. This hybrid system is characterized by the following technological, economic and strategic advantages: (1) increased range of variation of power to water ratio; (2) possibility to use seasonal surplus of unutilized power for production of additional quantity of water; (3) decreased specific CO2 emissions; (4) improved economic indicators of co-generative technology; (5) creation of strategic water reserve, etc. The proposed study focuses on comparison of conventional co-generative system representing the reference case with the hybrid innovative scheme. The conventional system consists of: (1) power-generating plant, (2) MSF-desalination system. The hybrid system includes (1) power-generating plant, (2) MSF-desalination, (3) RO desalination and (4) aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) technology. Unlike the reference case being based on the conventional systems, the hybrid scheme implies the concept where the seasonal surplus of available unutilized power-generating capacity is consumed by RO and seasonal excess of water accumulated withinunderground aquifer. Proposed study is based on the following assumptions: (1) available power generating capacity ranges from 80% to 100% of the maximum output being equal to 180 MW; (2) total available capacity of existing thermal desalination plant is 38 MGD; (3) seasonal variation of both water and power demand (within the range 100-60%) is considered in the model; and (4) specific energy consumption of projected RO is 6 kW h/m3. For the scenario based on co-generation system (180 MW to 38 MGD) operating at 80-100% of the maximum generating capacity, the following data obtained: (A) unutilized capacity of power plant is sufficient for production of 40-80 MGD by RO; (B) unconsumed water supposes to be accumulated within underground aquifer. Calculated rate of seasonal variation of aquifer recharge ranges between 50 and 80 MGD. © 2006.","ASR; Hybrid-desalination; RO; Water resources management","Aquifers; Desalination; Electric power generation; Energy utilization; Innovation; Reverse osmosis; Water management; Aquifer storage and recovery technology; Hybrid-desalination; Hybridization; Cogeneration plants; Aquifers; Cogeneration plants; Desalination; Electric power generation; Energy utilization; Innovation; Reverse osmosis; Water management; aquifer; cogeneration; desalination; hybridization; water management; water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349008908

At the end of the monitoring, biogas yield was on the same level as before the enhancement, while volume related biogas productivity almost doubled from 1.50 to 2.91 Nm3 m-3 d-1. However, as a consequence of the higher transfer of poorly degraded organic material into the effluent, the residual methane potential of the effluent multiplied by the factor 10. The results of this study show, that most agricultural biogas plants in Austria have a great potential for a significant capacity increase.

The introduced PSS aims at:•the maximisation of the wind energy penetration and•the minimisation of the energy production cost. In former studies, the introduction of PSS in power production systems aims at the power demand peaks saving. In the present study, the PSS storage-production procedure is accomplished without any predefined schedule. Energy is stored whenever:•wind energy is rejected and•the thermal generators that burn cheap heavy fuel oil do not operate at their nominal powers. Furthermore, the production of the thermal generators that burn expensive diesel oil is substituted during the power demand peak hours. Two case studies for Crete and Rhodes are accomplished. An iterative procedure is performed, in order to calculate the optimum pumps and hydro turbines nominal powers in both islands. The optimisation criterion is the energy production specific cost minimisation. The PSS introduction in Crete yields to almost 10% annual electricity production cost reduction. The annual wind energy rejection is nullified. The investment payback period may be less than 5 years. The PSS introduction in Rhodes leads to a 1.85% annual electricity production cost reduction. The PSS project does not exhibit attractive economic indexes. Conclusively, isolated power production systems with energy production specific cost higher than approximately 0.05€/kW h seem to be appropriate for PSS introduction, following the operation algorithm of the present paper. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this activity was to develop a system design for a regional exploration rover, including breadboarding for the demonstration of locomotion capabilities, payload accommodation, power provision and control. The most prominent feature of the SOLERO rover is its ability to operate relying on just-generated solar power, i.e., with minimal use of batteries (used only for contingency or peak power demands). A number of solar-powered vehicles operate in this mode on Earth. However, as Mars is farther from the sun than Earth, the power available from sunlight is significantly reduced and thus designing a working and reliable system is much more difficult. We have achieved power consumption optimization by combining smart power management and an efficient locomotion system. The calculations for power demand have been based on results obtained from ground testing of the breadboard rover and on accurate models of the Martian environment (i.e., reduced gravity, reduced intensity of sunlight, dust contamination on the solar arrays, temperatures, terrain surface, etc.). It was found that the rover should incorporate energy storage for peak demand and contingency situations only, allowing the solar array to be sized for smaller loads and resulting in a lighter, smaller and more reliable rover system. More information about the project can be found in [50, 16]. At the end of the project, one of thebreadboards was significantly modified to serve as a research platform for autonomous navigation and enhanced control.

The results for the physisorption of a single H2 on the concave side indicate that the adsorption energies (E ads) for tetraindenocorannulene and pentaindenocorannulene are very similar, 2.9 and 3.0 kcal/mol, respectively. The later values are slightly larger than that estimated for corannulene, 2.4 kcal/mol, and about half of the encapsulation energy of H2 in C60, 5.4 kcal/mol. The differences in adsorption energies can be explained considering the dipole moments of the molecules. For C50H20 and C 44H18 they are very similar, 4.0 and 3.7 Debye. However, it is much smaller in corannulene, 2.0 Debye, which explains the lower E ads observed for the later polyarene. The Eads presents a different behavior on the electron-poor convex side; they are nearly identical for all of the molecules considered. The interaction energies on the convex side, determined for corannulene, tetraindenocorannulene, pentaindenocorannulene, and C60, are 1.2, 1.1, 1.1, and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. The hydrogen storage capabilities are discussed in terms of the results obtained for the sandwich complexes between pentaindenocorannulene with benzene or corannulene. As a by product, we estimated the complexation energies for the benzene-pentaindenocorannulene and corannulene-pentaindenocorannulene pairs as 6.0 and 8.3 kcal/mol, respectively. Finally, we replaced some carbon atoms in corannulene and pentaindenocorannulene with nitrogen atoms. The adsorption energies were increased; C16N4H10 has nearly the same adsorption energy as the much larger pentaindenocorannulene. In the case of pentaindenocorannulene, the introduction of six nitrogen atoms (12% of carbon atoms replaced) increases the adsorption energy, about 0.2 kcal/mol. The present results showed that the introduction of a small number of nitrogen atoms can increase the adsorption energy in carbon structures without increasing the weight of the material too much, but the increment seems to be strongly dependent on the position of the nitrogen atoms. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Derivatives; Energy utilization; Physisorption; Synthesis (chemical); Corannulene; Encapsulation energy; Pentaindenocorannulene; Tetraindenocorannulene; Nitrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39849109525

We demonstrate that, in the case of the V2O 5 xerogel and the nanocomposites polypyrrole (Ppy)/V 2O5 and polyaniline (PANI)/V2O5, the quadratic logistic equation (QLE) can be used to fit the inverse of the resistance values as a function of the injected charge in nonsteady-state conditions. This contributes to a phenomenological understanding of the lithium ion and electron transport. The departure of the experimental curve from the fitting observed for the V2O5 xerogel can be attributed to the trapping sites formed during the lithium electroinsertion, which was observed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The amount of trapping sites was obtained on the basis of the QLE. Similar values used to fit the inverse of the resistance were also used to fit the absorbance changes, which is also associated with the small polaron hopping from the V(IV) to the V(V) sites. On the other hand, there was good agreement between the experimental and the theoretical data when the profile of the inverse of the resistance as a function of the amount of inserted lithium ions of the nanocomposites Ppy/V 2O5 and PANI/V2O5 was concerned. We suggest that the presence of the conducting polymers is responsible for the different electrical profile of the V2O5 xerogel compared with those of the nanocomposites. In the latter case, interactions between the lithium ions and oxygen atoms from V2O5 are shielded, thus decreasing the trapping effect of lithium ions in the V2O 5 sites. The different values of the lithium ion diffusion coefficient into these intercalation materials are in agreement with this hypothesis. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Lithium compounds; Polyaniline; Polypyrroles; Xerogels; Nonsteady-state conditions; Quadratic logistic equation (QLE); Small polaron hopping; Nanocomposites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40049091119

(Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a key pest of cereal grains, particularly maize, whose infestations start in the field before harvest and extends throughout the storage period. The main control method used against this pest species in warm climates is the use of insecticides and such over-reliance on insecticides for maize weevil control has made insecticide resistance a major concern in this species. Pyrethroids are among the insecticides most frequently used against the maize weevil and problems of resistance to this group of insecticides have been more frequently reported. The high levels of pyrethroid resistance observed in Brazilian populations of the maize weevil are the likely result of intense past selection to DDT leading to cross-resistance to pyrethroids at large. The lack of correlation of geographic distance between the sites of collection of resistant populations and their resistance pattern suggests more relevant roles of local selection and/or broad dispersal of resistant populations by grain trade in the evolution of insecticide resistance. Reduced target site sensitivity, eventually added by enhanced detoxification by glutathione-S-transferases, is the main pyrethroid resistance mechanism observed in maize weevil populations. Behavioral resistance to pyrethroids was also observed in maize weevil populations, adding further difficulties in controlling this insect species. Insecticide resistance contributes towards an individual's fitness under insecticide use, but these same individuals may be placed at disadvantage in the absence of the insecticide. Demographic and competition studies of pyrethroid-resistant and -susceptible populations of maize weevil showed that some resistant populations show fitness disadvantages, while others do not, which is an important management information. Suppression of pyrethroid use is a promising management tactic against pyrethroid-resistant populations of maize weevil showing fitness disadvantage because it favors the susceptibility reestablishment, in contrast with pyrethroid-resistant populations not showing this trait. Some pyrethroidresistant populations were able to mitigate the fitness cost associated with the resistance due to a larger body size and higher respiration rate probably due to a more efficient accumulation and mobilization of energy reserves, allowing enough energy allocation for potentially conflicting physiological processes, such as biochemical defense and reproduction. Fluctuating asymmetry and the profile of hydrolytic enzymes seem to provide further support for this hypothesis, which may also have consequences for dispersal and mating preference, influencing the spread of insecticide resistance in populations of the maize weevil. © 2008 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Brazil; Deltamethrin; Sitophilus Zeamais; Stored Products Protection","Animals; Cell proliferation; Detoxification; Enzymes; Food storage; Health; Brazil; Deltamethrin; Glutathione S-transferases; Insecticide resistance; Management implications; Sitophilus Zeamais; Stored Products Protection; Susceptible population; Insecticides",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895326519

For instance, in recent years the focus has been on spintronics, a future technology where not only the electron's charge but also its spin will be utilized. In this presentation we will deal with a few of these applications from a microscopic theoretical view. The discussion is based on calculations of the electronic structure often within (spin) density functional methods. A large magnetic anisotropy, the fact that there are considerable energy differences between different magnetization directions, has considerable importance for e.g. magnetic storage and permanent magnet applications. We will discuss here how to calculate this quantity, which is exemplified by both a bulk system and a layered material, and the calculational accuracy and the method's predictability. One example of spin dependent transport is the so-called spin transfer torque, the fact that a current through a magnetic layer can rotate its magnetization. We will review its physical origin and present some recent calculations on naturally magnetic layered materials, so-called helical spin density waves. A crucial quantity for applications of the various spectacular magnetic effects is the Curie temperature, the temperature above which the magnetic order disappears. Many systems are limited by low Curie temperatures. A route to calculations of this quantity is described, and with the help of a few calculations we try to generalize what is needed to achieve significant magnetic ordering temperatures. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Curie temperature; Density functional theory; Magnetic materials; Magnetization; Permanent magnets; Calculational accuracy; Magnetization directions; Spin dependent transport; Magnetic anisotropy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43049084083

Specifically, long-term variations in HS are a powerful indicator of climate change as HS represents the balance between the net surface energy flux and the poleward heat transported by the ocean currents. HS is estimated from sea surface height anomaly measured from the altimeters TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason 1 from 1993 to 2006. To characterize and validate the altimeter-based HS in the Atlantic, we used the data from the Pilot Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) array. Correlations and rms differences are used as statistical figures of merit to compare the HS estimates. The correlations range from 0.50 to 0.87 in the buoys located at the equator and at the southern part of the array. In that region the rms differences range between 0.40 and 0.51 × 109 Jm-2. These results are encouraging and indicate that the altimeter has the precision necessary to capture the interannual trends in HS in the Atlantic. Albeit relatively small, salinity changes can also have an effect on the sea surface height anomaly. To account for this effect, NCEP/GODAS reanalysis data are used to estimate the haline contraction. To understand which dynamical processes are involved in the HS variability, the total signal is decomposed into nonpropagating basin-scale and seasonal (HS1) planetary waves, mesoscale eddies, and small-scale residual components. In general, HS1 is the dominant signal in the tropical region. Results show a warming trend of HS1 in the past 13 years almost all over the Atlantic basin with the most prominent slopes found at high latitudes. Positive interannual trends are found in the halosteric component at high latitudes of the South Atlantic and near the Labrador Sea. This could be an indication that the salinity anomaly increased in the upper layers during this period. The dynamics of the South Atlantic subtropical gyre could also be subject to low-frequency changes caused by a trend in the halosteric component on each side of the South Atlantic Current.

For the first time, branching ratios have been determined for the dominating product channels and absolute DR cross sections have been measured in the energy range from 0.001 to 0.7 eV. Dissociative recombination is concluded to result in extensive fragmentation for all three cluster ions, and a maximum number of heavy oxygen-containing fragments is produced with a probability close to unity. The branching ratio results agree with earlier DR studies of smaller water cluster ions where the channel n H2 O+H has been observed to dominate and where energy transfer to internal degrees of freedom has been concluded to be highly efficient. The absolute DR cross sections for H+ (H2 O)n (n=4-6) decrease monotonically with increasing energy with an energy dependence close to E-1 in the lower part of the energy range and a faster falloff at higher energies, in agreement with the behavior of other studied heavy ions. The cross section data have been used to calculate DR rate coefficients in the temperature range of 10-2000 K. The results from storage ring experiments with water cluster ions are concluded to partly confirm the earlier results from afterglow experiments. The DR rate coefficients for H+ (H2 O)n (n=1-6) are in general somewhat lower than reported from afterglow experiments. The rate coefficient tends to increase with increasing cluster size, but not in the monotonic way that has been reported from afterglow experiments.

Previous studies show that creatine (Cr) supplementation, estrogen (E2) replacement, or exercise training are effective for cardiac performance. Objective: To examine the combined effect of Cr and/or E2with exercise training on myocardial energy reservation, using ovariectomized female hamsters. Materials and methods: Female Golden Syrian hamsters were used for this study. A hundred ovariectomized hamsters were divided into no-exercise and exercise-trained groups, in which each group was separated into control (n=10), Cr depletion (Cr-; n=10), Cr supplementation (Cr+; n=10), E2 replacement (E2; n=10) and Cr supplementation combined with E2 replacement (Cr+E2; n=10). In the exercise-trained group, wheel-running exercise (10 min. a day, 5 days a week) was imposed for 9 weeks, and the exercise metabolic rate (EMR) was measured. After the animals were sacrificed, the right ventricles were cut and weighed, which were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -70 °C. The contents of Cr, phosphocreatine (PCr), total Cr (TCr) and creatine kinase (CK) activities were measured, using the spectrophotometric method. Creatine transporter protein (CrT) was measured by Western blotting. Results: Cr+ or E2 combined with exercise training yielded greater accumulation of all myocardial metabolic phosphate contents, CK activity and CrT protein than Cr+ or E2 alone. All parameters regulating myocardial Cr metabolism improved greatly in Cr+ plus E2 combined with exercise training. Conclusion: Creatine supplementation and estrogen replacement, when combined with exercise training, become more effective for myocardial energy reservation via in estrogen-deficient hamsters.","Creatine; Energy reservation; Estrogen; Exercise; Hamsters; Myocardium","creatine; creatine kinase; creatine phosphate; creatine transporter protein; estradiol; membrane protein; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; energy conservation; estrogen therapy; exercise; female; hamster; heart muscle; heart performance; metabolic rate; nonhuman; ovariectomy; spectrophotometry; supplementation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349448706

The dependence of the peak 8 area to the peak 5 area on the 'effective' LET allows the estimation of the LET to be extended to values higher than those estimated by the other methods. Tests of this method, performed for the 'blind' exposure within the ICCHIBAN intercomparison project, resulted in agreement to within 7% with the true LET value and 13% with the true dose value, for a complex mixed radiation field. The limitations of the method are in the uncertainty of the LET estimation of up to 50% for very specific fields and in the difficulty of deconvoluting high-temperature peaks in the glow-curves of MTS-7 detectors after small doses or low-LET irradiation.

The performance of a nanocrystal flash memory depends critically on the choice of nanocrystal size and density as well as on the choice of tunnel dielectric properties. The performance of a nanocrystal memory device can be expressed in terms of write/erase speed, carrier retention time and cycling durability. We present a model that describes the charge/discharge dynamics of nanocrystal flash memories and calculate the effect of nanocrystal, gate, tunnel dielectric and substrate properties on device performance. The model assumes charge storage in quantized energy levels of nanocrystals. Effect of temperature is included implicitly in the model through perturbation of the substrate minority carrier concentration and Fermi level. Because a large number of variables affect these performance measures, in order to compare various designs, a figure of merit that measures the device performance in terms of design parameters is defined as a function of write/erase/discharge times which are calculated using the theoretical model. The effects of nanocrystal size and density, gate work function, substrate doping, control and tunnel dielectric properties and device geometry on the device performance are evaluated through the figure of merit. Experimental data showing agreement of the theoretical model with the measurement results are presented for devices that has PECVD grown germanium nanocrystals as the storage media.

The presence of fields gives rise to partition of the internal energy between field and nonfield energy forms, that are characterized as state functions. Field-dependent components of work and heat are defined with respect to their being delivered at the boundaries, or directly, by action at a distance, to the contents of the system. Interaction energy, that accounts for effects of changes in the sources of the fields is defined. The first law of thermodynamics in the presence of fields states that the change in the sum of the field and nonfield components, of the internal energy, is equal to the change in the sum of the field and nonfield components of heat and work, delivered to the system, and the interaction energy, due to changes in the sources of the field. The equivalence between potential energy and work in conjugate frames of reference facilitates the incorporation of the interaction energy as part of the field-dependent internal energy. In this context, the significance of the degree of coupling between the field and the contents of the system, in conjunction with their thermodynamic variables, is discussed. Intensive field-dependent variables that maintain uniformity, at equilibrium, in the absence as well as in the presence of fields, are defined. In contrast, nonfield and field components of these intensive variables can be nonuniform, and discontinuous across interfaces, at equilibrium. The implication of the theory is illustrated by specific cases that involve electromagnetic and acceleration fields. Energy partition in acceleration fields is shown to depend on mass distribution within the system. A change in position, or in the source of the field produce changes in mass distribution and energy partition. Partition of magnetic and nonmagnetic energy forms, and field-induced heat flow and energy storage are considered. It is shown that for linear matter, the energy per unit volume stored in the field is invariable with respect to the process and work that produce the field vectors, the balance being stored in other nonfield energy forms. Finally, expressions for field-induced temperature and energy changes in an ideal magnetizable gas are derived. It is shown that isothermal magnetization produces a shift in the partition between the field and nonfield parts of the internal energy. © 2008 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.","Energy partition; Fields; First law; Thermodynamics","Electromagnetic field effects; Function evaluation; Heat flux; Interfaces (materials); Magnetization; Thermal effects; Energy partition; Interaction energy; Isothermal magnetization; Energy management; Electromagnetic field effects; Energy management; Function evaluation; Heat flux; Interfaces (materials); Magnetization; Thermal effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42449137157

Proposed solution has the helical shape of coil turns and the special shape of the magnetic core (magnetic core with air gap is needed for increasing stored energy). Helical turns are put on toroidal former and then magnetic core on it. Each turn has the same shape, length and is put in the same magnetic flux. Near-uniform distribution of magnetic flux is the result of the shape of winding and also non-uniform shape (or non-concentric) of magnetic core that has multiple radial air gaps.

PE is also used in devices for the protection against grid disturbances, like voltage sags or power breakdowns. To cope with these disturbances, back-up energy storage devices are used, like uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and flywheels. Some of these devices may use superconductivity. Commercial PE semiconductor devices (power diodes, power MOSFETs, IGBTs, power Darlington transistors and others) are rarely (or never) experimented for cryogenic temperatures, even when designed for military applications. This means that its integration with HTS power devices is usually done in the hot environment, raising several implementation restrictions. These reasons led to the natural desire of characterising PE under extreme conditions, e. g. at liquid nitrogen temperatures, for use in HTS devices. Some researchers expect that cryogenic temperatures may increase power electronics' performance when compared with room-temperature operation, namely reducing conduction losses and switching time. Also the overall system efficiency may increase due to improved properties of semiconductor materials at low temperatures, reduced losses, and removal of dissipation elements. In this work, steady state operation of commercial PE semiconductors and devices were investigated at liquid nitrogen and room temperatures. Performances in cryogenic and room temperatures are compared. Results help to decide which environment is to be used for different power HTS applications. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149106201

Poly(4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) showed a very well-defined electrochemistry with a relatively low oxidation potential of the monomer at 0.9 V versus Ag/Ag+, E1/2 at 0.78 V and stability to long-term switching up to 1000 cycles. The band gap of the polymer films, 1.1 eV, was determined from electrochemistry. Spectroelectrochemistry for p-doped film indicated two absorption peaks at 560 (Vis range) and 1100 nm (NIR) corresponding to π-π* transition (onset 800 nm) band, and the bi-polarons band, respectively, and a band gap of 1.5 eV. The switching ability and kinetic studies of the polymer prove interesting optical properties in p- and n-doping case with a higher % ΔT at the 1100 nm peak, thus making the polymer a suitable material for NIR applications.

Additional insight may be gained by exploring potential constraints through pushing growth rates to their maximum and scoring physiological cost-related variables. Therefore, we reared animals of a univoltine Spanish and Belgian population and of a semivoltine Swedish population of the damselfly Enallagma cyathigerum (spanning a latitude gradient of ca 2350 km) in a common environment from the eggs until adult emergence and exposed them to a transient starvation period to induce compensatory growth. Besides age and mass at maturity and growth rate we also scored investment in energy storage (i.e. triglycerides) and immune function (i.e. total activity of phenoloxidase). At emergence, body mass was greater in Spain and Sweden and lower in Belgium, suggesting a genetic component for the U-shaped latitudinal pattern that was found also in a previous study based on field-collected adults. The mass difference between univoltine populations can be explained by the shorter development time in the Belgian population, and this despite a higher growth rate, a pattern consistent with undercompensating countergradient variation. In line with the assumed shorter growth seasons, Belgian and Swedish animals showed higher routine growth rates and compensatory growth after transient starvation. Despite a strong link with metabolic rates (as measured by oxygen consumption) populations with higher routine growth rates had no lower fat content and had higher immune function (i.e. immune function decreased from Sweden to Spain), which was unexpected. Rapid compensatory growth did, however, result in a lowered immune function. This may contribute to the absence of perfect compensating countergradient variation in the Belgian population and the lowest routine growth rates in the Spanish population. Our results underscore the importance of integrating key life historical with physiological traits for understanding latitudinal population differentiation. © 2007 The Authors.",,"damselfly; growth rate; latitudinal gradient; life history trait; metabolism; oxygen consumption; physiology; starvation; Belgium; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Southern Europe; Spain; Sweden; Western Europe; Animalia; Enallagma cyathigerum; Zygoptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39549122075

This paper addresses this notion of 'thrifty mechanisms' in the light of evidence that catch-up growth is characterized by a disproportionately higher rate of fat gain relative to lean tissue gain, and that such preferential catch-up fat is in part driven by energy conservation mechanisms operating via suppressed thermogenesis. It provides a molecular-physiological framework which integrates emerging insights into mechanisms by which this thrifty 'catch-up fat' phenotype cross-links with insulin and leptin resistance. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

WD for only 24 h resulted in a marked physiological shift in energy homeostasis, including increased body weight gain, body fat, and energy expenditure (EE) but an acutely lowered locomotor activity. The acute reduction in locomotor activity was observed after only 3-5 h on WD. The energy intake and energy absorption were increased during the first 24 h, lower after 72 h, and normalized between 7 and 14 days on WD compared with mice given chow diet. Core body temperature and EE was increased between 48 and 72 h but normalized after 21 days on WD. These changes paralleled plasma T3 levels and uncoupling protein-1 expression in brown adipose tissue. After 21 days of WD, energy intake and absorption, EE, and body temperature were normalized. In contrast, the locomotor activity was reduced and body weight gain was increased over the entire 21-day study period on WD. Calculations based on the correlation between locomotor activity and EE in 2-h intervals at days 21-23 indicated that a large portion of the higher body weight gain in the WD group could be attributed to the reduced locomotor activity. In summary, an acute and persisting decrease in locomotor activity is most important for the effect of WD on body weight gain and obesity in mice.

EMO is a merit order enhanced by heuristic search based algorithms and the ALHN is a continuous Hopfield network with its energy function based on augmented Lagrangian function. EMO is efficient in unit scheduling, whereas ALHN can properly handle generation ramp rate limits, and time coupling constraints such as limited fuel, water discharge for hydro units, and water balance for pumped-storage units. The proposed method solves HTS problem by optimizing step by step of sub-problems in four phases. In the first phase, EMO is applied to solve only thermal unit commitment satisfying power balance, spinning reserve, limited fuel, and minimum up and down time constraints. In the second phase, the enhanced ALHN is used to solve economic dispatch (ED) and commit hydro units based on the obtained unit schedule from the first phase. In the third phase, the enhanced ALHN is applied to handle transmission constraint. In the last phase, the enhanced ALHN is used to commit pumped-storage units and solve final constrained ED. In each phase, heuristic search based algorithms are applied to repair the constraint violations and refine the obtained solution. The proposed EMO-ALHN is tested on a hydrothermal system with 17 thermal, 2 hydro, and 2 pumped-storage hydro units with a scheduling time horizon of 24 h. Test results indicate that the proposed method obtains less costs and faster computational times than those from augmented Hopfield neural network (AHN) and hybrid enhanced Lagrangian relaxation and quadratic programming (Hybrid LRQP) for two test cases. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Here I address the trade-offs between gains and risks and the question of how much and how fast to swim using simple models that optimise the number of lifetime mate encounters. Radically different swimming strategies are predicted for different feeding behaviours, and these predictions are tested experimentally using representative species. In general, male swimming speeds and the difference in swimming speeds between the genders are predicted and observed to increase with increasing conflict between mate searching and feeding. It is high in ambush feeders, where searching (swimming) and feeding are mutually exclusive and low in species, where the matured males do not feed at all. Ambush feeding males alternate between stationary ambush feeding and rapid search swimming. Swimming speed and the fraction of time spent searching increase with food availability, as predicted. This response is different from the pattern in other feeding types. The swimming speeds of non-feeding males are predicted and observed to be independent of the magnitude of their energy storage and to scale with the square root of body length in contrast to the proportionality scaling in feeding copepods. Suspension feeding males may search and feed at the same time, but feeding is more efficient when hovering than when cruising. Therefore, females should mainly be hovering and males cruising, which is confirmed by observations. Differences in swimming behaviour between genders and feeding types imply different mortality rates and predict well the observed patterns in population sex ratios. Sex ratios may become so female-biased that male abundances limit population growth, demonstrating that behaviours that are optimal to the individual may be suboptimal to the population. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Cost of swimming; Feeding behaviour; Population dynamics; Sex ratio; Sexual selection; Trade-offs","crustacean; feeding behavior; food availability; mate recognition; pelagic environment; population dynamics; sex ratio; sexual selection; swimming; trade-off; animal; article; copepod; cross breeding; ecosystem; experimental animal; female; male; physiology; population density; predation; sexual behavior; swimming; Animals; Animals, Laboratory; Copepoda; Crosses, Genetic; Ecosystem; Female; Male; Population Density; Predatory Behavior; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Swimming; Copepoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38649105813

The use of fatty acids as form-stable PCM will increase their feasibilities in practical LHTES applications due to reduced cost of the energy storage system. In this regard, a series of fatty acid/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blends, SA/PMMA, PA/PMMA, MA/PMMA, and LA/PMMA were prepared as new kinds of form-stable PCMs by encapsulation of fatty acids into PMMA which acts as supporting material. The blends were prepared at different mass fractions of fatty acids (50, 60, 70, 80, and 90% w/w) to reach maximum encapsulation ratio. All blends were subjected to leakage test by heating the blends over the melting temperature of the PCM. The blends that do not allow leakage of melted PCM were identified as form-stable PCMs. The form-stable fatty acid/PMMA (80/20 wt.%) blends were characterized using optic microscopy (OM), viscosimetry, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy methods, and the results showed that the PMMA was compatible with the fatty acids. In addition, thermal characteristics such as melting and freezing temperatures and latent heats of the form-stable PCMs were measured by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique and indicated that they had good thermal properties. On the basis of all results, it was concluded that form-stable fatty acid/PMMA blends had important potential for some practical LHTES applications such as under floor space heating of buildings and passive solar space heating of buildings by using wallboard, plasterboard or floor impregnated with a form-stable PCM due to their satisfying thermal properties, easily preparing in desired dimensions, direct usability without needing an add encapsulation and eliminating the thermal resistance caused by shell and thus reducing cost of LHTES system. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In the power generation sector, coal is playing a dominant role in the EU-27 with 25% share of the total installed capacity and almost one-third of the power generation. The role played by the domestic resources and especially by coal is increasingly becoming the focus of the EU energy strategy. There is a strong pressure for the decarbonization of the energy mix. The emission trading scheme (ETS) can have an impact on the shift to lower carbon-intensive fuels. The impact of ETS on coal can be important, because it is very short-sighted and only defines the period up to 2008-2012. The ETS carbon dioxide (CO2) regime must ensure that investments in coal-fired plants in the long term are supported. EU Research Institutes and Coal Industry identified an important CO2 reduction potential by improving the efficiency of the conversion of solid fuels into electricity. Highly efficient clean coal technologies can contribute to reasonable costs and challenge the issue of climate change. It must be pointed out that the EU Energy Policy should now concentrate on the necessity to effectively support demonstration projects and to create the legal framework for the integrated approach of efficiency enhancement and CO2 capture and storage (CCS). However, it is not a proper and rational approach to implement CCS before the technology is demonstrated and before it is clear that it will be commercially viable. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The amino acids are catabolized by both glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and transaminases. Ammonium is reassimilated by glutamine synthetase (GS) and, through the action of asparagine synthetase (AS), is stored in asparagine (Asn). This review presents the ways in which amino acids are converted into Asn and their regulation, mostly in germinating seeds of yellow lupine, where Asn can make up to 30% of dry matter. The energy balance of the synthesis of Asn from glutamate, the most common amino acid in lupine storage proteins, also shows an adaptation of lupine for oxidation of amino acids in early stages of germination. Regulation of the pathway of Asn synthesis is described with regard to the role of GDH and AS, as well as compartmentation of particular metabolites. The regulatory effect of sugar on major links of the pathway (mobilization of storage proteins, induction of genes and activity of GDH and AS) is discussed with respect to recent genetic and molecular studies.

Enalapril, an angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), is classically used in anti-hypertensive therapies, however, earlier publications have shown that this drug could also have significant impact on body weight in rats as well as in humans, besides reducing blood pressure. The effect of this drug in the white adipose tissue has been neglected for long time, even considering that most components of the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin system are expressed in this tissue. Furthermore, the adipose tissue is considered today as one of the most important sites for endocrine/inflammatory regulation of appetite and energy output and AngII has been linked to the metabolism in this tissue. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of chronic enalapril treatment in normotensive rats at earlier ages, evaluating body weight, energy homeostasis, lipid profile and serum levels of the hormones leptin and insulin, in the presence of a standard or a palatable hyperlipidic diet regimen for one month. Our results show that enalapril treatment is able to reduce body fat on both diets, without alteration in serum lipid profile. Furthermore, animals receiving enalapril showed reduction in food intake, leptin level and energy intake. In summary, these findings show for the first time that the ACEi enalapril reduces body fat in young normotensive rats and highlights a novel target to treat obesity and associated diseases. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Many nations are embarking on introduction of clean/renewable solar energy for displacement of oil-produced energy. Moreover, solar photovoltaic (PV)-diesel hybrid power generation system technology is an emerging energy option since it promises great deal of challenges and opportunities for developed and developing countries. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (K.S.A) being enriched with higher level of solar radiation, is a prospective candidate for deployment of solar PV systems. Literature indicates that commercial/residential buildings in K.S.A. consume about 10-45% of the total electric energy generated. The aim of this study is to analyze long-term solar radiation data of Dhahran (East-Coast, K.S.A.) to assess the techno-economic feasibility of utilizing hybrid PV-diesel-battery power systems to meet the load of a typical residential building (with annual electrical energy demand of 35,120 kWh). The monthly average daily solar global radiation ranges from 3.61 to 7.96 kwh/m2. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software has been employed to carry out the present study. The simulation results indicate that for a hybrid system composed of 4 kWp PV system together with 10 kW diesel system and a battery storage of 3 h of autonomy (equivalent to 3 h of average load), the PV penetration is 22%. The cost of generating energy (COE, US$/kWh) from the above hybrid system has been found to be 0.179 $/kWh (assuming diesel fuel price of 0.1$/l). The study exhibits that for a given hybrid configuration, the operational hours of diesel generators decrease with increase in PV capacity. The investigation also examines the effect of PV/battery penetration on COE, operational hours of diesel gensets for a given hybrid system.

The use of fatty acids as form stable PCMs will increase their feasibilities in practical applications due to the reduced cost of the LHTES system. In this regard, a series of styrene maleic anhydride copolymer (SMA)/fatty acid composites, SMA/SA, SMA/PA, SMA/MA, and SMA/LA, were prepared as form stable PCMs by encapsulation of fatty acids into the SMA, which acts as a supporting material. The encapsulation ratio of fatty acids was as much as 85 wt.% and no leakage of fatty acid was observed even when the temperature of the form stable PCM was over the melting point of the fatty acid in the composite. The prepared form stable composite PCMs were characterized using optic microscopy (OM), viscosimetry and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy methods, and the results showed that the SMA was physically and chemically compatible with the fatty acids. In addition, the thermal characteristics such as melting and freezing temperatures and latent heats of the form stable composite PCMs were measured by using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique, which indicated they had good thermal properties. On the basis of all the results, it was concluded that form stable SMA/fatty acid composite PCMs had important potential for practical LHTES applications such as under floor space heating of buildings and passive solar space heating of buildings by using wallboard, plasterboard or floors impregnated with a form stable PCM due to their satisfying thermal properties, easy preparation in desired dimensions, direct usability without needing additional encapsulation thereby eliminating the thermal resistance caused by the shell and, thus, reducing the cost of the LHTES system. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The tradeoff between mean square error (MSE) and the computational burden of the GRNN is addressed. Besides, an efficient technique is proposed for estimation of a radial basis function (RBF) in the GRNN. Hardware realization based upon the techniques is discussed.

In this work, the thermal behavior of Al, Mg, CuO, KMnO4 and also three mixtures containing Al + CuO, Mg + CuO and Mg + KMnO4 were studied experimentally using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry. These mixtures are sometimes used as pyrotechnic mixtures in military industries. Also, the influence of different heating rates (5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min) on the DSC behavior of the mixtures was verified. The results showed that as the heating rate was increased, melting points and ignition temperatures of the mixtures were increased. On the other hand, TG-DSC analysis for Mg + KMnO4 mixture indicates that this mixture melts at 283.0 °C and decomposed at 292.1 °C. By replacing KMnO4 with CuO as the oxidizer of the magnesium, these temperatures enhanced to 368.7 °C and 408.3 °C, respectively. However, replacing Mg with Al in the Mg/CuO mixture decreases the melting and ignition temperatures of the mixture to 231.4 °C and 271.9 °C, respectively.

In addition to characterizing the epoxy - POSS composites, this contribution demonstrates valuable applications of solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The size of domains in the nanocomposites was determined by high-speed MAS 1H - 1H spin-diffusion experiments, offering an alternative to the established methods like SAXS, EM, or AFM. While the latter might fail under certain circumstances (low contrast, or small domains), the 1H - 1H spin-diffusion measurement yielded the size of unbroken primary domains, making also possible their distinction from ""aggregates of primary domains"", the size of the latter being measured by EM or SAXS. Depending on the type of the investigated network the size of the POSS aggregates arising in the nanocomposites was determined to be ca. 1-20 nm. Investigations of molecular dynamics (various ""domain- selective"" relaxation and recoupling solid-state NMR experiments were applied) yielded information making possible the assignment of the contribution of molecular segments to thermomechanical properties like glass transition temperature and storage shear modulus, and to predict the products' ability to absorb mechanical energy. Remarkable motional heterogeneities were found not only in the amorphous phase, where mobile polymer segments of the ""free"" domains coexist with the immobilized chains of the ""constrained"" ones, but also in the crystallites of POSS building blocks, where the amplitudes of segmental reorientations occurring in the midkilohertz frequency region remain relatively large: two-site 180° flips dominating to aromatic rings in the POSSph, crystallites are accompanied by the wobbling of the flip axes with an average fluctuation angle ca. 25°. Similarly, cyclopentyl substituents in the POSSCp crystallites undergo to ca. 35° rotational-diffusion motion. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Crosslinking; Crystallites; Energy absorption; Glass transition; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Aromatic rings; Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS); Rotational-diffusion motion; Polypropylene oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949100385

The neuroendocrine control of bodyweight involves appetite-regulating centres in the hypothalamus, containing both orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons that express leptin receptors (LepR). In the rat, central leptin resistance develops during mid pregnancy, well after hyperphagia becomes apparent, to negate the appetite suppressing effects of leptin. We have investigated the hypothalamic response to leptin during pregnancy and examined the role of pregnancy hormones in inducing these changes. We have shown that there are multiple levels of leptin resistance during pregnancy. Despite elevated serum leptin, neuropeptide Y and agouti related peptide mRNA in the arcuate nucleus are not suppressed and may even be increased during pregnancy. LepR mRNA and leptin-induced pSTAT3 expression, however, are relatively normal in the arcuate nucleus. In contrast, both LepR and leptin-induced pSTAT3 are reduced in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Injecting α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) into the brain, to bypass the first-order leptin-responsive neurons in the arcuate nucleus, also fails to suppress food intake during pregnancy, suggesting that pregnancy is also a melanocortin-resistant state. Using a pseudopregnant rat model, we have demonstrated that in addition to the changes in maternal ovarian steroid secretion, placental lactogen production is essential for the induction of leptin resistance in pregnancy. Thus, hormonal changes associated with pregnancy induce adaptive changes in the maternal hypothalamus, stimulating food intake and then allowing elevated food intake to be maintained in the face of elevated leptin levels, resulting in fat deposition to provide energy stores in preparation for the high metabolic demands of late pregnancy and lactation. © 2008 The Authors.

Achieving this would require the marshalling of extensive technological resources at a very high cost, perhaps $45 trillion would be needed for the development of relevant infrastructure, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its Energy Technology Perspectives 2008 report.

For instance, electricity and gas prices may soar several magnitudes above their normal levels within a short time due to imbalances in supply and demand, yielding what is known as spikes in the spot prices. The markets are also largely influenced by seasons, since power demand for heating and cooling varies over the year. The incompleteness of the markets, due to nonstorability of electricity and temperature as well as limited storage capacity of gas, makes spot-forward hedging impossible. Moreover, futures contracts are typically settled over a time period rather than at a fixed date. All these aspects of the markets create new challenges when analyzing price dynamics of spot, futures and other derivatives. This book provides a concise and rigorous treatment on the stochastic modeling of energy markets. Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes are described as the basic modeling tool for spot price dynamics, where innovations are driven by time-inhomogeneous jump processes. Temperature futures are studied based on a continuous higher-order autoregressive model for the temperature dynamics. The theory presented here pays special attention to the seasonality of volatility and the Samuelson effect. Empirical studies using data from electricity, temperature and gas markets are given to link theory to practice. © 2008 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

Since the outpost and manned rovers are ""human-rated"", these energy storage systems will have to be of proven reliability exceeding 99 percent over the length of the mission. Because of the low (TRL=5) development state of the closed cycle hydrogen oxygen PEM RFC at present, and because there is no equivalent technology base in the commercial sector from which to draw or infer reliability information from, NASA will have to spend significant resources developing this technology from TRL 5 to TRL 9, and will have to embark upon an ambitious reliability development program to make this technology ready for a manned mission. Because NASA would be the first user of this new technology, NASA will likely have to bear all the costs associated with its development. When well-known reliability estimation techniques are applied to the hydrogen oxygen RFC to determine the amount of testing that will be required to assure RFC unit reliability over life of the mission, the analysis indicates the reliability testing phase by itself will take at least 2 yr, and could take up to 6 yr depending on the number of QA units that are built and tested and the individual unit reliability that is desired. The cost and schedule impacts of reliability development need to be considered in NASA's Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) plans, since life cycle testing to build meaningful reliability data is the only way to assure ""return to the moon, this time to stay, then on to Mars"" mission success.

A design with dual-mass flywheel and a crank-mounted compliant chain sprocket greatly reduces interior noise levels due to chain meshing. However, experimental observations showed the compliant sprocket can enter into resonance and generate excessive vibration energy during startup. Special features are incorporated into the compliant sprocket design to absorb and dissipate this energy. Additional damper spring rate, high hysteresis and large motion angle that overlap the driving range may solve the problem during engine start-up period. This work develops a simulation model to help interpret the measured data and rank the effectiveness of the design alternatives. A Multibody dynamics system (MBS) model of the balancer chain drive has been developed, validated, and used to investigate the chain noise. This model includes a cranktrain system coupled to a full balancer drive system that includes the chain drive, balance shafts, and water pump. The nonlinear stiffness and damping effects of the baseline compliant crank chain sprocket and its design iterations are added to the model to understand the basic characteristics and find an optimal setup for the engine start-up period. New MBS solver methodologies were implemented and the subsequent productivity increases are quantified. For subjective noise assessment, simulations of a solid sprocket versus compliant sprocket balancer drive were carried out and compared for certain operating engine speed. © 2008 SAE International.",,"Automobile transmissions; Digital storage; Engines; Mechanical drives; Powertrains; Solid lubricants; Sprockets; Vibrations (mechanical); Wheels; Basic characteristics; Chain-drive systems; Design alternatives; Design and Development; Model and simulation; Non-linear stiffness; Productivity increase; Torsional vibration; Chains",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072472881

In this paper, an effort has been made to partially use the energy stored in the springs (induced due to road undulations) for compressed air generation through a single acting positive displacement pump. The system design and its interface are done considering the actual measured data on a 16T Goods Vehicle at various road and road traffic conditions, namely, the in-city cycle, highway cycle and off-road cycle for both laden and un-laden applications. The preliminary analysis of the data shows a positive indication of availability of simple harmonic displacements after re-sampling of data. The re-sampling has been done using macros developed in Microsoft Excel® and the system response is developed based on the order of re-sampling. It can be strongly inferred from the acquired data that this novel design has a potential to extract road energy and support conventional braking system of commercial vehicles.

Crucial commercial and technical aspects as well as driving forces for decision-makers and customers are disregarded when the focus is solely on improving fuel economy and tailpipe emissions with advanced control and optimisation techniques. The present work aims to define a framework for a hybrid management strategy that is commercially realistic due to the fact that both customer demands on vehicle performance as well as industrial prerequisites and limitations in the control system and the hybrid powertrain are taken into account. The proposed strategy is defined as a set of rules for the hybrid management control system.

The goal is to provide a safer high energy and power battery for aircraft energy storage systems. Aircraft batteries used on military aircraft battery platforms have a low reliability and require significant maintenance and as a result have significant costs associated with them beyond the initial procurement cost. It is desirable to develop state of the art aircraft batteries which have high reliability and minimal maintenance costs. Lithium ion cells can be employed to produce a lithium ion aircraft battery which will have significant advantages over the present nickel cadmium and lead acid aircraft batteries. The lithium ion battery will have higher specific energy, increased energy density, improved cycle life, and lower maintenance requirements. Prior projects with Electro Energy Inc. have shown increased low temperature performance and better capacity per unit volume and weight. The relationship between electrode parameters and the discharge performance of high rate batteries has been discussed previously in characterizing the rate capability of the LiCoO2 electrode by Abraham et al (Discharge Rate Capability of the LiCoO2 Electrode"", J. Electrochem. Soc., 145, 482, 1998). The cathode material LiNi0.33Mn 0.33Co0.33O2 (NMC) has been identified as an excellent candidate for development of a robust positive electrode. NMC has the potential to provide a superior safe high rate cathode compared to LiCoO 2. The proper parameters to achieve optimum compaction for the electrode while leaving adequate porosity in the electrode structure for electrolyte penetration and wetting is also critical to the development of a high performance lithium ion aircraft battery. This development project includes a review of anodes, cathodes, electrolytes, additives, compositions and manufacturing processes in a wafer cell battery configuration to meet the performance requirements of DoD aircraft batteries. Cathode materials were evaluated from three different suppliers and particle sizes from 4 to 10 microns were tested for energy storage and power density. Investigations were conducted on the effects of particle size of the electrode materials and thickness of the electrode on rate capability. An initial design for a 28 volt module and 270 volt aircraft battery has been developed. Test data shows that it will be possible to achieve the initial technical objective of this effort which is to develop a lithium ion cell that will meet the aircraft battery requirements, including fast discharge and recharge over the DoD operating temperature range.

Since most life support systems require power, increased mass and volume efficiency of the energy storage materials can have a dramatic impact on reducing the overall weight of next generation space suits. ITN Energy Systems, in collaboration with Hamilton Sundstrand and the NASA Johnson Space Center's EVA System's Team, is developing multifunctional fiber batteries to address these challenges. By depositing the battery on existing space suit materials, e.g. scrim fibers in the thermal micrometeoroid garment (TMG) layers, parasitic mass (inactive materials) is eliminated leading to effective energy densities ∼400 Wh/kg. The solid-state nature of the fiber battery also provides: Outstanding cycle life: >10,000 cycles, High rate: Near full capacity charge in ∼10 min., and Improved safety and packaging efficiency by eliminating liquid electrolytes. This paper highlights recent development of the multifunctional energy storage for EVA Systems. Advances in the performance of solid-state batteries on fiber/ribbon substrates are presented as well as design considerations for the integration of this technology into advanced EVA systems. Preliminary results are provided for an initial demonstration of the benefits of this technology by powering space suit health monitoring sensors with multifunctional energy storage devices. As wireless sensors are becoming of increased importance to NASA missions in general, this technology is expected to have wide spread application beyond the advanced EVA systems.

Two underground facilities have been in operation since the late 1980s. The construction of the final repository for short-lived, low- and intermediate level waste, SFR (Swedish final repository for radioactive operational waste), started in 1983, and it was put into operation in 1988. The facility is located 50 m below the sea, close to the Forsmark nuclear power plant, where the sea has a depth of ∼5 m. Low-level waste is placed in four rock vaults, each of which has a length of 160 m. Intermediate-level waste is stored in a concrete silo that has a height of 50 m and an inner diameter of 26 m. The disposal vaults are connected to the surface by two parallel access tunnels. The total disposal capacity is 63,000 m 3 , of which about one-half is currently in use. An expansion of the SFR is planned to accommodate radioactive waste from the decommissioning of the nation's power plants. Construction of the interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel, Clab, started in 1980, and the facility was put into operation in 1985. The facility is located at the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant. The fuel assemblies are stored in water pools located in two 120-m-long rock chambers. The roof of the rock chambers is ∼30 m below the ground surface. Construction of a second storage vault has recently been completed. The Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory is an underground facility for developing and testing characterization methods and the different components of a system for deep geological disposal under realistic repository conditions. The facility reaches a depth of 460 m below the surface. After 5 yr of construction, it was put into operation in 1995. The licensing, construction, and operation of these facilities have provided valuable experience that is being used for the site characterization and design work currently in progress for the deep geological repository for spent nuclear fuel. The spent nuclear fuel will be disposed of in a repository located at depths between 400 and 700 m. The disposal concept is based on isolation of the spent fuel in copper canisters surrounded by a buffer of highly compacted bentonite placed in a borehole in granitic rock. Site investigations are currently in progress at two potential sites. This project is a major geoscientific undertaking that is planned to be completed in 2009 with the selection of one of the sites for the deep repository. © 2008 The Geological Society of America.

In 1952 started the uranium ore mining in open pit Baita Plai by 'Sovrom Kuartit' Joint Venture Company. All the uranium ore, having one to five per cent uranium content and more than 20 000 t metal U, were shipped to the Soviet Union, to be used for Soviet military programs. The new uranium deposits in Bihor county (Avram Iancu deposit), in Banat county (Lisava and Ciudanovita deposits) and Suceava county (Crucea-Botusana deposit), were discovered by geological prospecting later on. In 1963, the uranium ore export to the Soviet Union was stopped. After this, the mining activity in those deposits continued in a more restricted manner, the whole ore production being stored at the mine entry and afterwards processed into U3O8 and diuranate ammonium (DUA). Meanwhile, in Romania, the nuclear fuel cycle, based on natural uranium, was developed, including: uranium ore mining; uranium ore processing at Feldioara Processing Plant, where the finished product is the dioxide uranium (UO2) sinterisable powder; production of heavy water at Turnu Severin Plant; production of nuclear fuel type CANDU at Pitesti Nuclear Fuel Plant; commissioning of two reactors type CANDU (Unit 1 and Unit 2) at NPP Cernavoda; and commissioning of the interim dry storage facility for nuclear spent fuel at NPP Cernavoda. Currently, the annual quantity of uranium metal in extracted ore is on the wane given the exhaustion of geological uranium ore reserves at the Baita and Crucea-Botusana deposits. The actual production of uranium ore covers a maximum of 25 per cent of the uranium needed by the two reactors type CANDU from NPP Cernavoda. However, the Uranium quantity needed for the normal life cycle of those two reactors is ensured by the U3O8 and diuranate ammonium (DUA) stocks previously produced and stored at Feldioara Processing Plant. According to nuclear energy development strategy in our country, the construction of Units 3 and 4 at NPP Cernavoda will be resumed, latest in 2009. The units will be commissioning latest in 2014. A new uranium ore deposit was identified in Tulghes close to Crucea-Botusana deposit, but the mining exploitation is under question due to difficulties in getting local community accord and environmental agreement. It this situation it is expected that at the commissioning of Units 3 and 4 at Cernavoda NPP, the uranium mining in Romania will provide a maximum of 12 per cent of the ore needed in the four CANDU units.",,"Deposits; Economic geology; Environmental regulations; Fuel storage; Fuels; Heavy water; Life cycle; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Open pit mining; Ores; Uranium; Uranium dioxide; Geological prospecting; Joint venture company; Mining activities; Mining exploitation; Nuclear energy development; Nuclear fuel cycles; Nuclear spent fuels; Uranium ore deposit; Uranium deposits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060508838

In addition, the Earth spins on its own axis once in 24 h and the rotation axis tilts 23.5° from the perpendicular to the Earth-Sun plane (Fig. 3.1.1). This geometry generates a strong annual cycle, especially at high latitudes. The distance between the globe and the Sun varies but is of lesser importance for the climate on the globe. On the other hand, the tilting of the rotation axis is the major factor in generating the annual cycle in the climate, a cycle that is particularly strong in the boreal zone. In summer, the day is very long; beyond the Arctic Circle we have polar day and the Sun does not set daily. The radiation energy input effects temperature variation. In winter, the days are short and beyond the polar circle we have polar night without daily sun rise.

Transport phenomena and resulting mass flows are governed only by few fundamental physical laws giving rise to different transport mechanisms. The mutual effectiveness of different transport modes depends on the spatial scale. In a way, trees utilize effectively this frame of physical laws in their functioning and interactions with environment. By transport we especially mean the movement a certain quantity of mass or energy between the storage locations of the quantity. Storages may be apparent as sources and sinks of the quantity and unequal amounts of any entity in the storage locations lead to the concept of a non-zero gradient of the quantity. In practical terms, ecosystems store materials as mass (such as carbon, nutrients, water) and heat, and any differences in the amounts of mass and heat tend to disappear by physical mechanisms called transport phenomena. The third fundamental quantity besides mass and heat is momentum which is defined as the product of the mass and velocity of a homogenous fluid (fluid means either gas or liquid) parcel. All of these can be transported by two physically different mechanisms, which are molecular transport and bulk transport, called also convection. Transport of heat may happen also by means of a third heat transport mechanism which is electromagnetic radiation.

Selected alloying elements are Co, Mg, Mo, Ni, Nb, V and Zr, and they were substituted for Fe or Ti atoms separately. Their effects on the formation energy of FeTiH4 were analyzed on the basis of electronic structure. It was found that Zr, Nb, Mo and Mg substitution for Fe decreases the formation energy of the hydride considerably.

These will be the highest energy collisions in a controlled environment to-date, to be provided by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN by mid 2008. The ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) system selects events online in a three level trigger system in order to keep those events promising to unveil new physics at a budgeted rate of ∼ 200 Hz for an event size of ∼ 1.5 MB. This paper focuses on the data-logging system on the TDAQ side, the so-called “Sub-Farm Output” (SFO) system. It takes data from the third level trigger, and it streams and indexes the events into different files, according to each event’s trigger path. The data files are moved to CASTOR, the central mass storage facility at CERN. The final TDAQ data-logging system has been installed using 6 Linux PCs, holding in total 144 disks of 500 GB each, managed by three RAID controllers on each PC. The data-writing is managed in a controlled round-robin way among three independent filesystems associated to a distinct set of disks, managed by a distinct RAID controller. This novel design allows fast I/O, which together with a high speed network permits to minimize the number of SFO nodes.

CCS takes CO2 from large stationary sources and stores it in deep geological layers to prevent its release into the atmosphere. Responding to a G8 Gleneagles request, this study documents progress toward the development of CCS, covering capture, transportation and storage technologies and their costs; storage capacity estimates, regional assessment of CCS potential; legal and regulatory frameworks; public awareness and outreach strategies; and financial mechanisms and international mechanisms. It also discusses the role of CCS in ambitious new energy scenarios that aim for substantial emissions reduction.

Because of the everincreasing energy demand, CO2 emission and petrol shortage, development of DG based on renewable energy sources (RES) registered a considerable growth in the past decade. Having the generation sources physically close to the energy demand is another obvious promotion for the idea of DG. The sources can be solar, wind, CHP (Combined Heat and Power), fuel cells, etc. and are small in capacity. To reduce output power fluctuation, energy storage can be used in conjunction with some of these microsources. Inter-connected, closely located sources and loads which as an integrated system can operate in parallel with main power grid or in an intentional islanded mode form a micro-grid. In a large physical region there can exist multiple micro-grids. Apart from participating in energy markets, an alternative way of making use of and making profit out of multiple micro-grids is to take part in the Ancillary Services (AS) market. This paper investigates the technical feasibility and difficulties of providing such services (in particular primary frequency reserves) as well as the potential profitability of participating in the AS markets based on a setup of multiple micro-grids.","Ancillary services; Distributed Generation; Micro-grid; Multi-micro-grids; Primary frequency control","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Distributed power generation; Electric power distribution; Energy management; Fuel cells; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Ancillary service; Combined heat and power; Feasibility studies; Micro grid; Multi micro-grids; Output power fluctuations; Primary frequency control; Renewable energy source; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944096377

The simplest carbohydrates also contain either an aldehyde moiety (these are termed polyhydroxyaldehydes) or a ketone moiety (polyhydroxyketones). They are the most abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles in living organisms, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen and sucrose) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). All carbohydrates can be classified as monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, or polysaccharides. Anywhere from two to ten monosaccharide units, linked by glycosidic linkage, make up an oligosaccharide. Polysaccharides are much larger, containing hundreds of monosaccharide units. The presence of the hydroxyl groups allows carbohydrates to interact with the aqueous environment and to participate in hydrogen bonding, both within and between chains. Additionally, carbohydrates and their derivatives play major roles in the functioning of the immune system, fertilization, pathogenesis, blood clotting, and development. Derivatives of the carbohydrates can contain nitrogens, phosphates, and sulfur groups. Some carbohydrates can attach by C-, Oor N-glycosidic bonds, giving rise to complex structures namely glycoconjugates. When the sugar moiety is combined with lipid it forms a glycolipid and when it is combined with protein it forms another glycoconjugate molecule, a glycoprotein. The predominant carbohydrates encountered in the body are structurally related to the aldotriose glyceraldehyde and to the ketotriose dihydroxyacetone. All carbohydrates contain at least one asymmetrical (chiral) carbon and are, therefore, optically active. In addition, carbohydrates can exist in either of two conformations D or L, as determined by the orientation of the hydroxyl group about the farthest asymmetric carbon from the carbonyl group. With a few exceptions, those carbohydrates that are of physiological significance exist in the D-conformation. The mirror-image conformations, called enantiomers, are in the L-conformation. The carbohydrates found in plants are monosaccharides, disaccharides, higher oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and their derivatives: glycosides and glycoproteins. However, plants have many polysaccharides and glycoconjugates structures containing L-arabinose and L-fucose, which have been found as complex heteropolysaccharides, namely arabinogalactans and gums, respectively. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930980671

As a typical soft fruits they have a high physiological post-harvest activity, short ripening and a senescence period that makes a challenge for commercialisation of high quality fruit. The objective of this study was to determine the possibility of prolonging strawberry's shelf life, preventing moisture loss and maintaining texture at the storage time by use of different packaging materials. Two strawberry varieties: 'Tenira' and 'Pegasus', which are commercially grown in Latvia, were used for experiments. The effect of packaging material for prolongation of storage time were determined by using PP (polypropylene) trays coated with biodegradable PLA films with thickness 25 and 40 μm, OPP (oriented polypropylene) material with film thickness 40 μm, and PP boxes with holes as a control. The samples were stored in alight vitrines at +5±2 °C temperature. The study proved that the shelf life of strawberries can be extended up to 14 days. The lowest losses of moisture were detected in samples coated with OPP film for both varieties. After 14 day storage the content of O2 in all samples coated with films were equal to zero.

Popular products such as pickle, beer, bread, wine, cheese, sour milk and sausages have been around for millennia. Strictly speaking, the term «fermentation» relates to anaerobic energy metabolism only. Presently, fermentation of foods is defined more broadly as bioprocessing, using micro organisms and their enzymes to achieve desirable quality characteristics. Among the microorganisms of all groups, namely bacteria, yeast and moulds are encountered as functional micro organisms in food processing. This lecture deals with: 1. the use of molecular techniques to monitor the fate of functional as well as contaminating microflora during processing and storage of the fermented products, 2. the contribution of fermented food (components) to human and animal health, 3. the legal aspects of the functional food use (ingredients) and international legislation regarding labelling and the tailor-made design of fermented products, 4. the composition of fermented food products and the role that ""omics"" can play in the future development of safe and healthy food and 5.

One of the minimal processing technologies is sous-vide"" technology using the principle of vacuum-cooking. Beside excellent keeping quality its primary aim is to meet food safety requirements and to reduce food safety risks to a minimal level. It is well known, that the process of heat destruction can be applied kinetically not only to microorganisms but to processes during textural changes. This is specially true in those cases, when heat treatment of products of different character is performed in the same packaging, that is, there is little possibility to make corrections during cooking in the kitchen. Conforming to these aspects the main objective of this research was to analyse kinetics of holding time and temperature relationships of changes in texture of vegetables that can be taken into consideration as raw materials. Texture of vacuum packaged heat treated carrot and potato was characterised on kinetic basis by activation energy. Minimal processing combined with low temperature storage resulted in significant increase in time of keeping quality. Texture of samples heat treated in different ways didn't change significantly during storage. During organoleptic evaluation of samples categories were defined to characterise textural changes according to the recommended end-use.","Kinetic; Sous-vide; Texture; Vegetable","Activation energy; Cooking; Engineers; Food safety; Kinetics; Nutrition; Temperature; Textures; Vegetables; Keeping quality; Low-temperature storage; Minimal processing; Nutritional value; Organoleptic characteristics; Organoleptic evaluation; Sous-vide; Textural changes; Food storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924375730

The process of aging takes place in the course of storage. It takes longer time than the time required to chill a carcass. The aim of aging is to complete the effect of proteolytic enzymes. In the case of beef aging time is 2-3 weeks. During this time the structure of the beef becomes looser. Disadvantage of the long time is the appearance of undesirable alterations, such as rind formation or colour changes (dark red or black colour). These problems can be eliminated by the application of vacuum packaging, but this procedure does not shorten the aging time. As a result of oxygen-elimination metmyoglobin originates which makes the surface greyish-brown. It is well known that frying of beef without aging leads to undesired organoleptic characteristics. Its surface gets dry, looses its original water content, so it becomes tough and firm. In practice different methods are used to accelerate aging processes of beef, but these are slow and hard to control. In the present work we tried to develop a novel aging technology. Duringthe application of active ultrasound such acoustic effects (cavitation, atomization) occur that promote meat softening. By the ultrasound treatment we tried to decrese the aging time of meat so, that the meat retains its original appearance and its texture becomes friable and soft. The so called cavitation is the effect of action. By means of a medium cavitation moves the cells, myofibrilla into positive or negative direction via pulsating shock waves, so decresing the connecting power and increasing the space between them. Besides the above mentioned application active ultrasound (above 1 W/cm2 energy input) is advantageous because it destroys microbes. Raw material of the investigations was beef silverside. A part of the vacuum packaged samples was treated by ultrasound during aging, control samples were untreated. Aging storage lasted 3 weeks at 2°C in case of both treatments. Samples were measured in raw and in cooked form. Cooking was carried out in a steam oven. Changes in color, texture, pH and microbial state were measured. Aging process was monitored by a NIR instrument. Results showed that texture of the treated samples was different from that of the raw meat, changes in color were not significant. According to the NIR measurements samples could be separated from each other based on the different treatments and treatment times.","Active ultrasound; Aging; Beef","Acoustics; Aging of materials; Beef; Cavitation; Color; Engineers; Infrared devices; Nutrition; Shock waves; Textures; Ultrasonics; Accelerate aging; Acoustic effects; Control samples; Different treatments; Organoleptic characteristics; Proteolytic enzyme; Ultrasound treatments; Vacuum packaging; Meats",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924364298

Substances utilized for latent heat storage are known as phase change materials (PCM). The characteristic of PCMs to store heat in a narrow temperature range is important for most applications concerning the energy conservation in buildings. Heat transfer in a latent thermal energy system (LTES) is a transient, non-linear phenomenon with a moving solid-liquid interface. The prediction of temperature distribution and rate of solidification or melting is very important in order to design an LTES unit. In the context of the above, this paper presents the results of a numerical and experimental study on the effectiveness of a prototype chamber with composite walls where one of each independent layers inside them is phase change material (PCM). The numerical part of the study was based on a one-dimensional model for the phase change problem while the numerical treatment was based upon using finite difference methodology. The results obtained were compared with field measurements. Field tests indicated that the PCM (Rubitherm GmbH GR27) performed better at spring and autumn. At that period of time the PCM prevented chamber's indoor temperature from rising up to the uncomfortable level and shifted the peak load two hours later.","Experiment; Heat transfer; LTES; PCM; Simulation","Environmental impact; Experiments; Finite difference method; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Historic preservation; Latent heat; Phase interfaces; Pulse code modulation; Storage (materials); High energy storage densities; LTES; Narrow temperature ranges; Numerical and experimental study; One-dimensional model; Simulation; Solid-liquid interfaces; Thermal energy systems; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924342315

With many of the EU15 countries having large coal reserves, coal is still considered a viable candidate to account for a proportion of that new capacity. CO2 emissions will be one of the key issues to consider when planning the new capacity. The proven high efficiency circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) technology offers a good solution for CO2 reduction both in repowering of coal fired power plants and in greenfield power plants. CFB technology has excellent fuel flexibility and offers the opportunity to further reduce CO2 emissions by co-combusting coal with biofuels. During recent years, once-through supercritical (OTSC) CFB technology has been developed, enabling the next stage in CFB development to proceed to medium-scale (&lt;500 MWe) utility projects such as Lagisza, with net efficiencies near 45%. However, scaling up the technology further to 'real' utility scale (600-800 MWe) with net efficiency of 45-50% is needed to fulfill the future requirements of utility operators. FW has also developed CFB gasification technology for biomass applications. An example of this technology is gasification of biomass with a pressurized gasifier to produce syngas, which can be used for biodiesel production to address the reduction of CO2 emissions from vehicles. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) offers the potential for major cuts in CO 2 emissions of fossil fuel-based power generation in the fairly short term, provided that it gains public acceptance, the required regulatory framework is created and emission trading mechanisms or other incentives can provide solid return on the major investments required. Oxy-fuel combustion is one of the identified main CCS technology options, and Foster Wheeler Global Power Group (FW) is developing its Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) combustion technology for oxycombustion to provide a CCS-ready solution. Foster Wheeler is currently developing a ""dual firing"" concept, which enables the plant to be operated either with or without carbon capture. This paper presents the existing status of CFB technology in respect of boiler efficiency and fuel flexibility. The main advantages of the CFB technology for oxycombustion and a development plan for the Oxy-CFB will be presented.

The operational difficulties related to these unstable modes were successfully overcome by determining the proper cavity temperature set point in combination with phase modulation of the RF fields at the second harmonic of the synchrotron frequency. However, a serious drawback of the method is to increase the energy spread of the electron beam, which is detrimental to the undulator emission spectrum. The use of higher harmonic cavities is a more appropriate technique since it provides damping of the longitudinal modes without increasing the energy spread. A full scale prototype of a 3rd harmonic cavity was manufactured at the LNLS workshops and had its main rf properties measured. Special care was taken to measure the shunt impedance of the fundamental resonant mode since it determines how many cavities will be necessary for the adequate operation of the system, which is designed to operate in passive mode.

One example is the DESIREE double electrostatic storage ring under construction at the Manne Siegbahn Laboratory. As in larger magnetic rings used for the same purpose, beam cooling could improve experimental conditions considerably in electrostatic rings. Although electron cooling of 20 keV protons has been demonstrated at the KEK electrostatic storage ring, electron-cooling times become unrealisti-cally long for slow, heavy ions. The rates of stochastic cooling, on the other hand, are at a first glance unrelated to the beam energy. Furthermore, the low particle numbers expected for many heavy molecules seem to make stochastic cooling attractive, theoretical rates being inversely proportional to particle numbers. In this paper, the rates of stochastic cooling for slow heavy particles are investigated with respect to, mainly, the bandwidths and signal strengths that can be expected at the low particle velocities that are of interest at, e.g., DESIREE, and some numerical examples are presented.",,"Electrostatics; Stochastic systems; Storage rings; Atomic and molecular physics; Electron cooling; Experimental conditions; Heavy particles; Particle numbers; Particle velocities; Signal strengths; Theoretical rates; Cooling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899001176

Charmonium spectroscopy, which is one of the main items in the experimental program, requires antiproton momentum up to 8.9 GeV/c with a resolution δp/p = 10-5. This can only be achieved with electron cooling. The electron cooler proposed for HESR allows beam cooling for antiproton momentum between 1.5 GeV/c and 8.9 GeV/c.

To predict the final momentum resolution of the antiproton beam in HESR, electron-cooling force calculations, simulations of electron cooling and comparison to experimental data are needed.

As energy is essential to all cellular processes, it is thought that complex networks have evolved to ensure survival by maintaining adequate energy reservoirs. However, in times of nutrient abundance and imbalance, improper regulation and coordination of these networks can lead to obesity and other metabolic diseases and syndromes. Obesity genes must be considered as molecular components of such networks which function at an organismal level to orchestrate energy intake and expenditure. Thus, the functions of obesity genes must be understood within the context of these networks in intact animals. Since the majority of genes required for lipid homeostasis are evolutionarily conserved, much information can be obtained relevant to complex organisms by studying simple eukaryotes like C. elegans. Its genetic tractability makes C. elegans a highly attractive platform for identifying lipid regulatory pathways, drugs, and their molecular targets which ultimately will help us to understand the origin of metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes.

Surprising is the fact, that virtually there is no detailed rule of operation for the above equipments. However this abstract is an attempt to fill in the theoretical gap in field of technology of accumulation and distribution of heat in heating systems. In thermal systems, feedings well thermally insulated objects, the problem of necessity to lower temperature of return of heat medium and the recovery of unused in the receiving circuits of the system thermal energy contained in returning stream appears more and more often. This is due to more and more perfect materials, thermally insulating buildings, improved installation circuits, equipped with armature and automatics, and also installations with small framing and, as a result, small thermal inertia. The following categorization was proposed: -the basic heat system; -the heat system with transformation of temperature; -the heat system with a hydraulic distributor or with layered buffer; -the system with heat storage equipped with near-bottom plate; -the system equipped with heat layered storage with many layering segments. For the first two systems, rough schemes were introduced (Fig. 1a, Fig. 2a) and diagrams of heat agent cooling, during its flow via pipe lines of the system (Fig. 1b, Fig. 2b). The third system was dealt separately for each of its two characteristic types: -with vertical hydraulic distributor (Fig. 3a); - with heat layered storage in a position of distributor (Fig. 4a). Two, the most important ways of distributor operation are discussed (Fig. 3b, Fig. 3c).

This aims to improve transparency and the systematic use of the objective knowledge base and allows crucial aspects of nuclear and other energy sources to be addressed in relation to economic, environmental and social dimensions. Using the framework, the comparative advantages of nuclear energy along with the counteracting implications of some problematic issues have been demonstrated in integrated studies carried out for a variety of countries. Current nuclear energy, operating under conditions prevailing in most industrialised countries, exhibits favourable economic performance in terms of production costs and low sensitivity to fuel price increases. The evaluations of environmental performance, based on Life Cycle Assessment and Impact Pathway Approach demonstrate low impacts at global, regional and local levels. Within the western world nuclear also has an excellent safety record, reflected in very low estimates of expectation values for accident risks, in fact much below the experience values for fossil energy carriers. All these positive features of nuclear energy are manifested in low external and total (internal plus external) costs. The sensitive issues for nuclear energy, not well reflected in the external costs framework, include risk aversion towards low probability hypothetical accidents with very severe physical, economic and social consequences, and the perceived problems associated with the necessity to assure safe storage of relatively small volumes of radioactive wastes over an extremely long period of time. Technological developments towards reactor designs which assure both strong limitations to the consequences of hypothetically severe nuclear accidents, as well as radical reductions in the necessary waste confinement times, opens the possibility of improving the social criteria performance of nuclear power which have currently a negative affect on its overall sustainability ranking.",,"Costs; Environmental management; Knowledge based systems; Life cycle; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Sustainable development; Comparative advantage; Comparative evaluations; Economic performance; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renewable electricity; Severe nuclear accident; Technological development; Nuclear reactor accidents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953858196

It is apparent that two strategies have been used in the design of ion conducting electrolytes. The first is to use a combination of two anionic species which has been known to give increased ionic conductivity and is attributed to the so-called mixedanion effect. The second strategy is to dissolve ionic cation salt in a conventional polymeric silicate, borate or phosphate glass containing a same cation. The increased conductivity is attributed to a volume increasing effect of the dissolved ionic salt. Several studies have been reported on lithium phosphate glasses to which lithium halides and lithium sulphate have been added. However, there has been no experimental results for the introduction of sodium sulphate into the lithium phosphate network. How specifically this feature - mixed alkali in the presence of sulphate ion - influences ion transport in the glasses is unclear. It is therefore necessary to investigate the ion transport behaviour of Na 2SO4 containing lithium phosphate glasses in order to understand better the role of Na2SO4 in the ionic cation transport in these glasses. In this paper we report both dc and ac conductivity measurements performed on the 0.5[xNa2SO4-(1-x)Li 2O]-0.5[0.4 (MoO3)2-0.6P2O 5] glasses with x varying between 0 and 1. The complex impedance data is analyzed in conductivity and electric modulus formalism in order to throw light on transport mechanism. The glass composition relative to (x = 0.5) has exhibited a decreasing in the conductivity of about two orders of magnitude compared to the simple end glasses (x = 0, 1). This behaviour is associated with the mixed alkali effect (MAE). It could be attributed to the fact that the two types of alkali ions are randomly mixed and have distinct conduction pathways. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Glass transition temperature; Glasses; Ionic conductivity; Mixed alkali effect; Molybdenum oxide; Phosphate; Sulphate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952915347

Traditionally, greenhouses are opened in order to evacuate heat or moisture. In that case, there is no control on the inside environment. By closing the greenhouse the climate can be controlled perfectly. The greenhouse temperature and moisture content can be brought to their optimal values. Further, the CO2-concentration can be raised for crop fertilisation. Closing the greenhouse implies that heat excesses need to be eliminated, this is very expensive with traditional energy technologies (compression cooling machines). By capturing and storing greenhouse heat, it can be recuperated during the heating season. For this purpose, a large scale heat storage system is necessary. Two small research greenhouses were built at the horticulture research institutes, these units were fully conditioned and operated as small closed greenhouses for tomato growing. Crop behaviour, production rates and energy needs were evaluated in comparison with two small reference open greenhouses (equipped with traditional technologies). An intensive monitoring in the units was of great value for the dynamic analysis of climate, plant and energy. Two models were set up on the climate-plant and the climate-energy interaction. These models were brought together in a TRNSYS simulation environment to an overall simulation tool. This tool allowed fast evaluation and comparison of different energy configurations in order to select the optimal energy concept. The performance of this research work in a practical research environment was nearly impossible due to the high number of interacting parameters, a model based approach was much faster and more efficient. The integrated model allowed to evaluate the effect of different greenhouse climate conditions, crop growing strategies and exploitation versus investment costs.","Energy savings; Full climate control; Tomato","Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449123375

Solar Heating Plants with Seasonal Storage (SHPSS) are promising systems. In Greece, large-scale solar thermal systems are not used widely contrary to the high potential of solar radiation. In this paper, a greenhouse Solar Heating Plant with Seasonal Storage (SHPSS) is simulated using TRNSYS 16 to predict its thermal and economic performance. TRNSYS 16 with its complete and extensible graphical environment makes easy the simulation of real SHPSS parameters. The greenhouse is located in Thessaloniki prefecture, northern Greece. The SHPSS consists of an array of flat plate collectors, a medium-sized storage tank and the thermal load. The load is a greenhouse of an area of 1000 m2. The SHPSS has a 900 m2 solar collector area and a 552 m3 of storage volume. The solar liquid was water. TRNSYS 16 prediction for the system is that about 40% of the total heating load of 705 000 MJ/year can be provided from the sun. The rest of the required energy can be provided by co-heating with conventional or biomass burner. With regard to the duration of the stagnation period, the used tank is reasonably seasonal because its temperature stays high for a relatively long period time (about 90°C for about 4000 h a year). The solar fraction for different system sizes and the 'virtual solar self-sufficiency' conditions are also analyzed even though the actual system was found to be not economically viable. The calculations reveal that a low-cost SHPSS in combination with a biomass burner could be viable in depth of time.","Greenhouse; Seasonal storage; Solar collector; Storage tank; TRNSYS 16","Thessaloniki",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449092571

This paper presents the experience in underground storage of acid gas in Poland. According to actual ecological tendency, since 1993 the acid gas from sour gas sweetening facilities is injected into one oil and one gas reservoir. This process eliminates sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide emission into atmosphere and gives necessary experience for large scale carbon sequestration. On the basis of the above mentioned experiences, the convertibility of the oil and gas reservoirs into underground storage of CO2 emitted by typical power plant is investigated. The full scale compositional simulation showed that initially CO2 injection could be carried out simultaneously with production but later, the production is to be terminated due to the changes in produced gas composition. Finally the life time of the project is estimated.Copyright 2008, European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal storage; Engineers; Forestry; Gas industry; Global warming; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Sulfur dioxide; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage and sequestrations; Compositional simulations; Large-scale carbon sequestrations; Oil and gas reservoir; Sour gas sweetenings; Underground storage; Underground gas storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71049124724

Storage management is a complex activity which faces the challenge of combining the variability of daily commercial client requests along with the capability of the reservoirs to deliver. Gas production and re-injection activity requires standard core competencies of the oil and gas industry, however the process is fast paced as compared to conventional hydrocarbon production activity as time scales from data analysis to decision making is reduced to hours. Stogit Spa, an Italian gas storage company managing 8 depleted gas fields in Italy has implemented an integrated system that dynamically links databases, visualization tools and reservoir/well simulators in order to assist the management process. This system called PERSEO (PErformance Reservoir StoragE Optimization) is aimed at enhancing efficiency by utilising a piece of intelligent fields application. The large amount of data from the 270+ wells of STOGIT equipped with SCADA systems monitoring real time gas rate and well head pressure, provides information for production/injection management. The challenge has been to extract the maximum information from the available database and computerize the process of updating welllreservoir performance automatically. This allows for faster monitoring, analysis and prediction of future well behaviour. A workflow was realised to transform available real time data into calibrated models in the following two steps: Design an algorithm capable of filtering stabilised gas rates and wel pressures for every injectionlproduction period to extract data representative of the well performance Automatic updating of well performance (IPR/VLP) model and matching the algorithm filtered data with theoretical and practical models (back pressure C,n equation).

Also, the effect of substitutionally placed dopants to the dissociation of hydrogen molecule (H 2) at the surface of Mg was investigated via Molecular Dynamics (MD). The results show that 31 out of 32 selected dopants decreased the formation energy of bulk MgH2, within a range of ∼ 37 kJ/mol-H2 where only Sr did not display any such effect. The most favorable elements in this respect are; P, K, Tl, Si, Sn, Ag and Pb.

Total gas content is the summation of three components: ""lost gas"", desorbed gas, and ""residual gas"". ""Lost gas"" is the volume of the gas that desorbs from the sample during the recovery process at wellsite, before the core sample can be sealed in a desorption canister. ""Residual gas"" is the gas that remains sorbed on the sample at the completion of the canister desorption test. A disadvantage of this procedure is the estimation of ""lost gas"". The volume of the ""lost gas"" is usually estimated by extrapolation of desorbed data to time zero using linear and/or polynomial curve-fit to the plot of cumulative desorbed gas versus square root of time. The differences between both methods can become more pronounced especially in high gas content reservoirs. In this paper a new method, which is based on nonlinear regression of measured gas content, is presented. This technique offers an accurate estimation of lost gas which coupled with sorption isotherm impacts the calculation of gas in place, the recoverable reserve and production profiles.

A number of technical and legal issues must be resolved before carbon sequestration can become a viable means to reduce carbon emissions. Recently the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (""IOGCC"") set forth a model statute and model rules and regulations, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") set forth a proposed rule for CO2 injection that could resolve some of these issues and make large-scale carbon sequestration projects a reality. The IOGCC model treats CO2 as a resource and covers the areas of permitting, property ownership, storage operations, and long-term monitoring and liability. Certain parts of the IOGCC model rules were a basis for the EPA proposed rule governing carbon sequestration that was published for public comment on July 25, 2008. This EPA proposed rule creates a new class of underground injection wells regulated as part of the Underground Injection Control program under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Both the IOGCC model statute and the EPA proposed rule provide specific guidance on construction and permit application submittals tailored toward the long-term nature of carbon storage. Carbon sequestration has also recently been addressed on a broader scale as a component of CO2 reduction in other federal proposals. The FutureGen project was recently modified by the Department of Energy (""DOE"") from a $1.8 billion research and development facility to multiple operations that would utilize carbon sequestration technology in coal-fired power plants. Congress has been bombarded with proposed climate change legislation, such as the Lieberman-Waimer bill that proposed a cap and trade program. All of the legislation provides methods for reducing emissions thereby increasing incentives to develop carbon sequestration. Also, carbon sequestration is being encouraged through the use of small-scale experimental projects set in motion by the DOE carbon sequestration partnerships. New rules and regulations addressing the technical and legal aspects of sequestration must be adopted. Until this regulatory framework is available, development of sequestration projects most likely will be hindered or delayed.

To contribute to the understanding of this issue, we investigated, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spatial distributions of body fat during the accumulation process before migration. We collected data from 12 Lesser Whitethroats (Sylvia curruca), 9 European Robins (Erithacus rubecula), 8 Blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla), and 5 Willow Warblers (Phylloscopus trochilus). On average, each bird was examined 3.2 times. Adipose tissue was visualized using T1-weighted spin-echo MRI at 1.5 T. Fat-containing pixels were identified by an image-segmentation procedure. Data were analyzed with respect to (1) fat distribution within the body, (2) relationship between frontal surface area and fat mass increase, (3) fat mass increase in comparison with increase in total body mass, and (4) fat mass in relation to standardized visual classification of fat deposits. Fat increase was reflected by a larger frontal area, though adipose tissue was not deposited equally along the length of the bird. Slices with largest frontal area showed relatively low fractions of fat. Frontal area increased less than expected from conventional geometrical models, which indicates that the body shape is altered. The increase in total body mass was generally higher than the total fat mass increase, which indicates that other tissue, most likely flight muscle, can metabolize rapidly in correlation with fat accumulation. In Blackcap, total fat mass was not linearly related to standardized fat-deposit classes. © 2008 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

It allows the manufacture of Pt particles with very small crystallite sizes even at very high loadings. A series of Pt catalysts were prepared with well defined crystallites. The weak hydrogen adsorption peak at -0.56 v is proposed to be associated to defect sites in addition to edge/corner sites. The ratio of strong/weak hydrogen adsorption peak is proposed to be an indication of ""extent of disorder"" of a Pt particle. A size effect theory consisting of two ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) size effects are proposed: the primary particle size effect that becomes important only when the percentage of corner/edge/defect sites is so high that they dominate the activity, i.e., as particle size falls below 18-20 A. The secondary size effect is associated with (111) terrace size. The decrease of surface specific activity from a crystallite size of 54 nm to 24 nm is estimated to be about 36 mv from CV peak shift. Experimental results are supplied to support the two-effect hypothesis. Several voltammetric peaks observed in H2SO4 and HClO4 for nano-sized Pt/C are assigned to Pt-OH formation/reduction on low coordination sites. These peaks are separated form main Pt-OH peaks by 180-280 mv and they are hypothesized to be related to primary size effect. CO stripping on nano-sized Pt particles exhibits an onset potential close to the potential of hypothesized Pt-OH formation on low coordination sites. This assumed correlation is used to support the theory: adsorbed OH sites for CO stripping are related to low coordination Pt sites. Two distinct CO stripping peaks are observed for Pt particles with XRD sizes larger than 3.3 nm. The two peaks are assigned to different sites, terrace sites vs. other sites. The details of the CO stripping curves are discussed. ©The Electrochemical Society.",,"Chlorine compounds; Crystallite size; Electrolytic reduction; Energy storage; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen; Oxygen; Oxygen reduction reaction; Particle size; Hydrogen adsorption; Low coordination; Onset potential; Oxygen Reduction; Primary particle size; Specific activity; Synthetic methods; Voltammetric peak; Platinum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649184784

The stability after transition to island operation due to a fault in the utility grid depends mainly on the depth and duration of the voltage dip caused by the fault. Particularly sensitive to voltage dips before islanding are directly and through frequency converter connected rotating machines. During transition to island operation fault ride-through capability is also required from these machines. In this paper the stability of the microgrid after fault in the utility grid is studied with different configurations and multiple simulations, which are made with PSCAD simulation software. This paper presents alternative options to maintain the stability of an islanded microgrid by reduction of voltage dip duration or magnitude. On the other hand, the stability effect and the fault ride-through improvement of the converter based distributed generation units with different phase-locked loop component modifications are studied by simulations.

Therefore, a, test bench of hybrid electric vehicles is developed, which can be used to evaluate and optimize each subsystem of hybrid propulsion system in earlier phase. In this paper, the strategies of energy source control and management are first defined and verified. Based on these strategies, the power flow and energy consumption of a hybrid propulsion system in NEDC and FTP cycles are estimated; and the super capacitor energy storage is tested in this platform with real-time simulation system. Further, the hybrid propulsion system of a light vehicle is emulated (in hardware) in this test platform and tested in ECE15 cycle. Both test results prove that the presented strategies of energy sources control and management can ensure good operating condition of the power supply system (e.g. battery, fuel cell) and undertaking peak power demand of traction system. As a result, long life time of power supply system, high efficiency and good performance of vehicles can be achieved.

In this paper a new method is presented to determine the optimum generation capacity and storage needed for a hybrid (wind/PV/battery) system, based on instantaneous wind speed variations. In this method, the power curve of the wind turbine is modified on the basis of wind speed variations. The modified power curve is obtained by considering the energy pattern factor of actual wind as an indicator of the wind dynamics and using a new factor called wind turbine controllability for performance evaluation of the wind turbine controllers in capturing extra energy. The hybrid system calculations will be based on this modified power curve. Results indicate that by using this method and designing hybrid systems based on wind dynamics, the power of different hybrid system components can be calculated more accurately and, while maintaining the system reliability, there will be a significant reduction in the investment cost. © 2008 International Energy Initiative, Inc.","energy pattern factor; hybrid system; power curve; variable speed wind turbine","Hybrid systems; Investments; Speed; Wind; Energy pattern factor; Generation capacity; Power curves; System reliability; Turbine controllers; Variable speed wind turbines; Wind speed variations; Wind turbine power; Wind turbines; economic analysis; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; power generation; reliability analysis; wind power; wind turbine; wind velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549122921

The study also assesses prevailing energy policies that address the challenges associated with supply of modern energy services to the urban poor. The study focuses on the example of energy consumption patterns of urban poor households in Kibera - often said to be Africa's largest slum - and the trends in energy use among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the area, providing an empirical basis for key findings of the study. The findings of the household survey clearly demonstrate the role that kerosene, electricity, biomass and LPG can play in cooking and lighting in low-income areas such as Kibera, Nairobi. According to the survey findings, kerosene is the most important modern energy option for the poor for both lighting and cooking. Electricity also appears to be a relatively important energy option. Biomass in the form of charcoal and LPG appear to be consumed by a relatively small segment of the urban poor in the selected sample area. The results of this survey largely reflect the situation at the national level.

A typical emulsion was drawn in batches from Emulsion Storage Tank into Scomi's system. This emulsion was processed on a continuous flow basis through a custom designed system in order to break ""resolve"" the emulsion and separate its constituents for further disposal or storage of the oil as ""dry oil"". X-O-T is a proprietary process utilized to break emulsions of hydrocarbons/water/solids. The process is based on a series of chemical reactions that interact with other reagents releasing heat and neutralizing the non-covalent forces that form the bonds between the substrate and the wetting agents making it feasible to separate the components of an emulsified mixture of minerals, water and hydrocarbons. A mechanical process for separating the emulsion constituents is needed. The results of the processing of this emulsion were very promising. All solids contained in the initial emulsion were removed from the mixture; some of small particles in the colloidal size range were transferred directly to the recovered water. The emulsion was resolved up to 92% to 98% leaving a small tough invert emulsion that contained no solids and a high concentration of heavy hydrocarbons. Recovered solids were ""dry"" and had hydrocarbon content around 15%. Recovered water was treated using ionic polymer. The result rendered clean water. This technology can prove to be very economical not only for oil recovery, but also as preventative maintenance. The removal of all solids from this stream can strongly impact the tank farm operations budget by reducing downtime, increasing storage capacity and removing expenses such as tank cleaning and sludge processing.

The focus will be on practical information, knowledge sharing to overcome all classical problems due to fluid behavior met by multiphase metering device in extra heavy oil including classical separator. Heavy and Extra-Heavy Oil represents more than 50% of the worldwide oil reserves, and large efforts have been spent to overcome difficulties related to this kind of oil production. Venezuela has pone of the largest reserve of HO and EHO with more than currently 1.5 trillion of oil in place. Different set of technologies and methodologies have been used to overcome the technical production and monitoring challenges in these lifted or pumped wells. Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) at the opposite of Canada companies is currently producing most of the Heavy Oil from cold and therefore non thermal production methods due to historical reasons. Recently, Orocual field in Monagas Northern (Venezuela) was put in production a cluster with extra heavy oil reaching gravity from 8.6 to 11 API and with a viscosity range from 6 Pa.s to more than 20 Pa.s at line conditions. As per fact, this new production cluster did not have any data, and PDVSA could only use conventional storage tanks to try to estimate the liquid flow rate with no possibility to be able to get the gas production because no separator were able to work in these conditions. However, it was essential to PDVSA in this early phase of the development to review the performance of the field and get access to the oil, water and gas flow rates. In these challenging conditions, and after trying other multiphase meters said to work in Extra Heavy Oil, PDVSA found that the only solution was Venturi - multi energy gamma ray combination. This multiphase technology broke the extra heavy oil paradigm related to multiphase technology to measure flow rates accurately and a comparative test were capable to demonstrate when it was possible from a reference point of view that the overall uncertainty of the entire system (Venturi-Tank) was better than 2%. This extended the new multiphase technology operating envelope for PDVSA from Gas to Extra Heavy Oil and provided a unique solution and the capability to monitor and optimize in real-time the production in this field.

An output RLC filter has also been designed and built to minimize the harmonics due to the switching operations of the pulse width modulated (PWM) converter that drives the motor. Simulations were carried out using PSpice and compared with corresponding laboratory experiments.

While it is jeopardizing the future development of several nanotechnologies, such as magnetic data storage, noise can also play a constructive role in many nonlinear systems, activating a resonance response. In this paper, it is proven that various hysteretic systems can exhibit such coherent behavior - a phenomenon that is generally known as coherence resonance when is solely induced by noise, and stochastic resonance when an external oscillatory signal is present. The quantity used to characterize the regularity of the stochastic output is the power spectrum, which displays a maximum at the resonance frequency. The calculation of the spectral densities for the outputs of hysteretic systems is performed in the framework of stochastic processes defined on graphs. The case of hysteretic systems described by rectangular loops is discussed and analytical expressions for the output power spectra are derived. These theoretical results suggest that hysteretic systems can be used by nanotechnology for concentrating the energy of a flat, noisy input into a short bandwidth frequency region. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","Energy; Graphs; Hysteresis; Noise; Resonance","Bandwidth; Digital storage; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic storage; Nanotechnology; Power spectrum; Random processes; Resonance; Spectral density; Stochastic systems; Analytical expressions; Bandwidth frequency; Energy; Graphs; Noise; Oscillatory signals; Resonance frequencies; Stochastic resonances; Hysteresis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62249157691

As PCM has not binder properties, it is expected to decrease mechanical properties of the final mortar. Also the density of the mortar decreases due to PCM lighter specific weight. In order to be used as a final coat for wall plastering, it must verify the requirements of the respective European Standard. This paper presents the results of the composition development and mechanical properties (flexural, compressive and adhesive strengths) testing and validation of three different gypsum mortars, in order to select the appropriate one for thermal testing in test cells. The results show that the effective decrease in the studied characteristics of the mortar does not inhibit the use for plastering, as requirements are achieved by the three studied compositions.","Energy consumption reduction; Gypsum plasters; Interior plastering; PCM","Adhesives; Energy utilization; Free energy; Gypsum; Heat storage; Mechanical properties; Mortar; Plaster; Pulse code modulation; Adhesive strength; Binder properties; Construction systems; Consumption reductions; Effective solution; Efficient use of energy; European Standards; Thermal testing; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60349095612

In exp. 1, the effects of insoluble fibre were studied by mixing diets based on wheat or naked oats with either coarse or fine oats hulls followed by pelleting. Hull inclusion increased (P < 0.05) starch gelatinisation, especially in the diets based on oats. Addition of finely ground oats hulls improved pellet durability, in particular after storage, while no such effect was observed for coarse oats hulls. Oats hulls inclusion caused a more elastic pellet with higher breaking resistance (P < 0.05). Lower (P < 0.05) energy consumption was observed for diets based on oats compared with wheat, while no effect of fibre inclusion on energy consumption was found. In exp. 2, the influence of pelleting on the viscosity effect of soluble fibres in diets based on wheat or oats was studied. A significant increase (P < 0.05) in intestinal viscosity of broiler chickens was observed for all batches of grain exposed to steam pelleting. Viscosity was doubled (P < 0.05) with wheat diets, while the increase in viscosity was even greater in oat diets. In wheat diets, feed intake and weight gain was reduced (P < 0.05), while feed conversion ratio was not affected. Steam pelleting of oats reduced (P < 0.05) feed intake and weight gain, and increased feed conversion ratio (P < 0.05). The improvements (P < 0.05) in metabolisable energy and dry matter digestibility in wheat diets was not consistent with the observed increases in viscosity or with the results obtained with oats.","Insoluble fibres; Soluble fibres; Starch gelatinisation; Steam-pelleting; Viscosity","Avena; Avena nuda; Gallus gallus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58949090840

These organs and tissues have major roles in the use and storage of nutrients in the form of glycogen or triglycerides and in the release of glucose or free fatty acids into the blood, in periods of metabolic needs. These mechanisms are tightly regulated by hormonal and nervous signals, which are generated by specialized cells that detect variations in blood glucose or lipid concentrations. The hormones insulin and glucagon not only regulate glycemic levels through their action on these organs and the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system, which are activated by glucose or lipid sensors, but also modulate pancreatic hormone secretion and liver, muscle and fat glucose and lipid metabolism. Other signaling molecules, such as the adipocyte hormones leptin and adiponectin, have circulating plasma concentrations that reflect the level of fat stored in adipocytes. These signals are integrated at the level of the hypothalamus by the melanocortin pathway, which produces orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides to control feeding behavior, energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis. Work from several laboratories, including ours, has explored the physiological role of glucose as a signal that regulates these homeostatic processes and has tested the hypothesis that the mechanism of glucose sensing that controls insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cells is also used by other cell types. I discuss here evidence for these mechanisms, how they integrate signals from other nutrients such as lipids and how their deregulation may initiate metabolic diseases. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Besides the technical factors, there are other effective parameters such as cost, operability, reliability, environmental impacts, safety and social implications that should be considered when assessing the different pathways as optimal and viable long-term alternatives. To aid this decision-making process, we have developed a generic optimization-based model for the long-range energy planning and design of future hydrogen supply systems. By applying Linear Dynamic Programming techniques, the model is capable of identifying optimal investment strategies and integrated supply system configurations from the many alternatives.

The main topics of this paper are materials preparation, hydrogen capacity, thermodynamics of hydride formation, and the kinetics of hydride formation and decomposition. Hydrogenation of Mg-Al leads to disproportionation with the formation of magnesium hydride and metallic aluminum as the final product. Experimental evidence renders this process reversible. It is observed that the enthalpy of hydride formation of magnesium is lowered upon alloying with Al due to a slightly endothermic disproportionation reaction. Further, it is found that the kinetics of hydrogenation, as well dehydrogenation, may be significantly improved by alloying compared to pure Mg. The expense of these improvements of the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation properties is a lower gravimetric hydrogen density in the hydrogenated product. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

This approach deals with the dynamic data distribution of the DWH on a set of servers. The data distribution that we consider is different from the ""classical"" one which depends on the data use. The distribution in our approach consists in distributing data when the server reaches its storage capacity limit. This distribution assures the scalability and exploits the storage and processing resources available in the organization using the data warehouse. It is worth noting that our approach is based on a multi-agent model mixed with the scalability distribution proposed by the Scalable Distributed Data Structures. The proposed multi-agent model is composed of stationary agent classes: Client, Dispatcher, Domain and Server, and a mobile agent class called Messenger. These agents collaborate and interact to achieve automatically the storage, the splitting (distribution), the redirection and the access operations on the distributed data warehouse. In this paper, we demonstrate the improvements obtained when we have used the multi-agent system and the Messenger agents in the data storage operation. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Data warehouse; Dynamic distribution; Mobile agent; Multi-agent system; Storage","Data storage equipment; Data warehouses; Digital storage; Energy storage; Mobile agents; Multi agent systems; Scalability; Centralized data-base; Data distribution; Distributed data structures; Distributed data warehouse; Dynamic distribution; Multi-Agent Model; Processing resources; Storage capacity; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57349105656

In particular the issue of climate change has grown in political importance as illustrated by the application of the Kyoto Protocol and public debate about issues such as 'food miles'. Whilst the paper concentrates upon the impact of the latter debates on United Kingdom and European Union markets, there is growing evidence that consumer concerns are not just an issue for those markets. Other markets are also showing increasing concern. Food miles is a concept which has gained traction with the popular press arguing that the further food travels, the more energy is used, and carbon emissions are greater. But what is the reality behind the political rhetoric? Using a food miles methodology, this paper compares New Zealand production shipped to the UK with a UK source. The study reported here found that, due to the different production systems, even when shipping was accounted for, New Zealand dairy products used half the energy of their UK counterparts, and in the case of lamb, a quarter of the energy. In the case of apples, the New Zealand source was 10 percent more energy efficient. In case of onions, whilst New Zealand used slightly more energy in production, the energy cost of shipping was less than the cost of storage in the UK, making New Zealand onions more energy efficient overall. In light of these findings, it is argued that climate change should be addressed through a trade policy focus on the more comprehensive task of reducing carbon footprints over time, rather than a narrower focus on carbon miles.","Carbon footprints; Energy; Food miles; Market access",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57249086538

The paucity of energy, communication, processing and storage resources in each WSN node causes the TCP transport model (widely used in broadband networks) to be inefficient in WSNs, a reason why new WSN-specific reliable transport protocols have been proposed in the past few years. This paper presents one of these protocols, the Distributed Transport for Sensor Networks (DTSN). DTSN is able to efficiently support unicast communications in WSNs due to its capabilities to tightly control the amount of signaling and retransmission overhead. The basic loss recovery algorithm is based on Selective Repeat ARQ, employing both positive and negative acknowledgements. Caching at intermediate nodes is used to avoid the inefficiency typical of the strictly end-to-end transport reliability commonly assumed in broadband networks. DTSN is currently implemented in TinyOS. Preliminary simulation results using this code show that DTSN is quite efficient providing block oriented reliability, while the caching mechanism employed in DTSN decreases packet delay for more than one hop. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Energy-efficiency; Quality of service; Reliable data transport; Wireless sensor networks","Broadband networks; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Quality of service; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; End-to-end transport; Guaranteed delivery; Loss recovery algorithm; Negative acknowledgement; Reliable data transport; Reliable transport protocol; Transport modeling; Unicast communication; Computer network performance evaluation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049099214

The heat sink consists of a conventional aluminium fins connected to a rectangular cavity filled with a phase change material (PCM: Šuntech P116 with melting temperature, T m=47°C). One part of the fin is exposed to air, while the other is embedded in a PCM. With this arrangement, the electronic component is cooled by conjugate forced convection and latent heat energy storage. The advantage of using this cooling strategy is that the PCMs are able to absorb a high amount of heat generated by integrated circuits (IC) without acting the fan, during the charging process (melting of the PCM). The governing equations for energy transport were developed and discretised by using the volume control approach. The resulting algebraic equations were next solved iteratively by using TDMA algorithm. Numerical investigations were conducted in order to analyze and optimize the thermal performance of the PCM-based heat sink. The optimization involves determination of the optimum dimensions of the heat sink and PCM cavity that maximize the time required for the base of the electronic component to reach a critical temperature (∼70°C).

An oil-pebble bed is used as the TES material. Energy and exergy analyses are carried out using two different charging methods to predict the performance of the TES system. The first method charges the TES system at a constant flowrate. In the second method, the flowrate is made variable to maintain a constant charging temperature. A Simulink block model is developed to solve the energy balance equations and to perform energy and exergy analyses. Simulation results using the two methods indicate a greater degree of thermal stratification and energy stored when using constant-temperature charging than when using constant-flowrate charging. There are greater initial energy and exergy rates for the constant-flowrate method when the solar radiation is low.

Many photovoltaic systems operate in a stand-alone mode and the total energy demand is met by the output of the photovoltaic array. The output of the photovoltaic system fluctuates and is unpredictable for many applications making some forms of energy storage or backup system necessary. The role of storage medium is to store the excess energy produced by the photovoltaic array, to absorb momentary power peaks and to supply energy during sunless periods or during night. One of the storage modes is the use of electrochemical techniques, with batteries and water electrolysis as the most important examples. In this paper, we report the optimal design for a stand-alone hydrogen system with the volume of hydrogen produced against current as regards the concentration of electrolysis cell. Operating characteristics of a small capacity solar hydrogen system have been determined and also demonstrated that the I-V characteristics of the battery-photovoltaic module and electrolysis cell are influenced by variations in the concentration of the electrolysis cell, which in turn determines the amount of current that flows through it.

In exchange for control of NIS, it is offering to support the country over the status of Kosovo and has held out the prospect of the new South Stream gas pipeline being routed through Serbia. Gazprom will build new gas-storage facilities in the country. A deal was close as Petroleum Economist went to press. The agreement, if approved in Belgrade, would help entrench Gazprom's position in southeast Europe at the same time as it guaranteed long-term supplies of gas to Serbia. Russia's backing of Belgrade over the status of Kosovo is likely to help Gazprom's attempt to buy NIS. The disputed Serbian province has been under UN administration since 1999. But in January 2008, the US and Germany announced plans to recognize it as a country if, as expected, Kosovo declares independence after Serbian presidential elections in February 2008. Support over Kosovo aside, the prospect of the South Stream pipeline crossing Serbian territory is another reward for Belgrade's willingness to offload NIS so cheaply.

This raises the question of how the results are affected by possible seasonal effects on germination energy and germination capacity of seeds. To answer this question, fluctuations in germination energy (GE) and germination capacity (GC) of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) seed was determined throughout the year. The test seeds had been stored for either a short time (2 months and 1 year) or a long time (12 and 13 years). Seed testing was done according to ISTA rules two times (in the first year T1 and the second year T2) in each month during a year. Ten seed lots from five Norway spruce seed zones in Slovakia were used for each treatment. Obtained data were processed by analysis of covariance (independent factors - T and months, covariate - altitude of seed origin). The monthly germination indicators were compared to annual average (using absolute differences and relative seasonal indexes). The results showed that GE and GC of short-term stored seeds were 59% and 92%, and 35% and 81% for long-term stored seeds. Compared to the annual average, the monthly germination indicators fluctuated very differently: for GE three times more than for GC, for long-term stored seeds 2-3 times more than for short-term stored seeds. For GE, significant deviations were found in six months during a year (in the range 11-23%), for both variants of seed storage. In contrast, for GC values such deviations were confirmed only for short-term stored seeds in February and March, but the differences (-2%) were very small and can be neglected. For use in forestry practice, three methods that eliminate existing seasonal fluctuations are proposed. Seasonal indexes seem promising since they enable converting the observed germination indicators at any one time to a value characterising the entire year average (formula 3).","Germination capacity; Germination energy; Long-term stored seed; Picea abies [L.] Karst; Seasonal fluctuation; Short-term stored seed","Cultivation; Digital storage; Forestry; Landforms; Plants (botany); Regression analysis; Germination capacity; Germination energy; Picea abies; Seasonal fluctuations; Short term; Seed; evergreen tree; forestry; germination; karst; seasonal variation; seed; Agriculture; Forestry; Germanium; Germination; Picea Abies; Regression Analysis; Seasonal Variation; Seeds; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53449094677

In healthy subjects, proteins contribute very little to energy metabolism during exercise, which questions the effect of protein in McArdle disease. Methods: In a crossover, open design, we studied seven patients with McArdle disease, who were randomised to follow either a carbohydrate- or protein-rich diet for 3 days before testing. Calorific intake on each diet was identical, and was adjusted to the subject's weight, age and sex. After each diet, exercise tolerance and maximal work capacity were tested on a bicycle ergometer, using a constant workload for 15 minutes followed by an incremental workload to exhaustion. Results: During the constant workload, heart rate and perceived exertion were consistently lower (p<0.0005) on the carbohydrate- versus protein-rich diet. Patients also had a 25% improvement in maximal oxidative work capacity on the carbohydrate versus the protein diet. Conclusions: This study shows that patients with McArdle disease can improve their maximal work capacity and exercise tolerance to submaximal workloads by maintaining a diet high in carbohydrate instead of protein. The carbohydrate diet not only improves tolerance to everyday activities, but will probably also help to prevent exercise-induced episodes of muscle injury in McArdle disease.",,"glucose; insulin; lactic acid; adult; article; blood level; caloric intake; carbohydrate diet; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; exercise; exercise tolerance; female; glycogen storage disease type 5; heart rate; human; male; priority journal; protein diet; randomized controlled trial; work capacity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53049093182

Data collected were subjected to analysis of variance and means separated using least significant difference (LSD) at p = 0.05. C:N ratio, C and N enrichment were calculated and correlation and regression equation established for whole soil and particulate organic matter C and N. Cattle and pig manure significantly increased WS O.C., pH, P, K, Ca and Na, with the exception of Mg, it also significantly increased okra stem girth, pod weight, pod length and pod diameter with the exception of plant height and number of leaves. Cattle and pig manure also significantly increased POM C and N and POM significantly enriched with WS C and N. Application of cattle and pig manure at 60 g kg-1 was found optimal for soil properties considered. Correlation coefficient between WS C and POM C and between WS N and POM N were all positive, however, the correlation decreased with time in C but increased in N.","Cattle manure; Correlation coefficient; Okra; Organic matter; Particulate organic matter; Pig manure; Sandy loam soil; Screenhouse; Soil; Southwest Nigeria","Abelmoschus; Abelmoschus esculentus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bos; Fungi; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52949121802

Due to limited domestic demand, Norway is today exporting large amounts of petroleum products. For the future, various options for export of CO2-lean energy exist, both from Northern and Southern Norway, and both from fossil sources (including carbon capture and storage), and renewable energies (particularly wind power). Transport vectors are hydrogen pipelines, liquid hydrogen ships and HVDC cables, and a plausible customer is central Europe due to its proximity, high population density and lack of domestic energy resources. Within the framework of the ""NorWays"" project, various options to deliver energy for hydrogen-based transportation from Norway to Germany were studied. Eight CO2-lean well-to-wheel energy export chains were evaluated with respect to efficiency, GHG emissions and other environmental impacts, costs and utilisation of Norwegian R&amp;D experience. In the chosen scenarios, energy export via hydrogen pipelines and ships appeared energetically and economically interesting against existing approaches as NG and electricity export. Furthermore, increased utilisation of Norwegian R&amp;D experience and higher value creation is anticipated by the export of a higher refined product. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

During fasting, fatty acids are released from adipose tissue and utilized as energy substrate in liver and extra hepatic tissue. This process is effectively controlled by catecholamines and insulin, which regulate hormone sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase. During a critical illness, increased adipose tissue lipolysis together with decreased fatty acid oxidation leads to increased triglyceride production and deposition in the liver (and in other tissues), with an augmented production of VLDL.

Due to the processing and storage limitations of tiny nodes codes (procedures) that provide different functionalities can be distributed in the network and make the entire network as a single system. Therefore, nodes have to communicate with each other to demand services which are implemented in another nodes using remote procedure call. Since in the sensor networks, energy consumption is mainly dominated by message passing, keeping highly related codes close to each other can extremely degrade the total energy utilization. In this paper we propose a code migration method, named, inspired from the ant clustering algorithm, to move the codes towards the source of request, considering the dynamic behavior of the network. Observing the local rate and direction of requests, procedures migrate to appropriate nodes that converges to the network minimum energy conservation state. Simulation results show the convergence and flexibility of the algorithm. Moreover, it shows more than fifty percent improvement in power conservation in comparison with the case there is no migration in the network. Although we have proposed our algorithm as a technique for code migration, it can be applied on other problems like data centric routing and data storage in wireless sensor networks, while the source of request changes time to time. © 2008 IEEE.","Ant clustering; Code migration; Energy conservation; Wireless sensor networks","Codes (symbols); Digital storage; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Message passing; Network coding; Sensor nodes; Target tracking; Wireless sensor networks; Ant clustering; Ant clustering algorithm; Code migration; Data-centric routing; Hostile environments; Power conservation; Remote Procedure Call; Storage limitation; Clustering algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51649123522

In general, it is desirable to maximize the use of low- or zero-carbon energy sources to reduce CO2 emission. However, such technologies are either more expensive (as with renewable energy) or more controversial (as in the case of nuclear energy or carbon capture and storage) than conventional fossil fuels. Thus, in many energy planning scenarios, there is some interest in identifying the minimum amount of low- or zero-carbon energy sources needed to meet the national or regional energy demand while maintaining the CO2 emission limits. Via the targeting step of pinch analysis, that quantity can be identified. Besides, another related problem involves the energy planning of biofuel systems in view of land availability constraints, which arises when agricultural resources need to be used for both food and energy production. Algebraic targeting approach of cascade analysis technique that was originally developed for resource conservation network is extended to determine targets or benchmarks for both of these problems. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Simulation and optimisation are used to find the most cost effective battery arrangement for specified electric driving range, volume, power and lifetime requirements. Two battery technologies, NiMH and Li-ion, are included in the simplified case study. The result indicates that the battery cost and size are highly dependent on the required electric driving range. It is found that a 3-5km electric driving range is possible with a minor cost increase. An electric driving range of 15-25km is possible, but results in a more bulky, and much more costly, battery system. It is important to point out that the results are not general.

The heat transportation, pumping power consumption, viscosity, and pressure loss of the flowing slurries were measured in order to determine the most suitable concentration of micro encapsulated phase change material (MCPCM) used in the slurry over the range 5-40%. The effects of repeated use of liquid-solid phase-change particles upon melting and solidifying were studied using a small-scale rig of a closed loop circuit comprised of heating and cooling sections. Results indicated that the use of a MCPCM slurry can improve the performance of a working fluid by up to 52% as compared to a single-phase fluid. However, increasing the concentration of the MCPCM to 40% was found to have little effect on heat transport. MCPCM slurry containing a high concentration of MCPCM had a high apparent viscosity. Use of an ionic surfactant was found to be effective in reducing the viscosity. Results also showed that a 20-30% concentration was the most suitable concentration for the working fluid due to the associated heat capacity and reasonable pressure drop. The use of such a slurry could reduce the power consumption of the pump by 16%. Stratification between the solid particles and the carrier fluid was a major drawback and made it difficult to use a conventional open system. This problem was overcome by combining an open and a closed system into a three-stage (open-closed-open) operation.","Latent heat; Phase-change material; Phase-change slurry; Thermal storage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47949109486

To assess mineralization quantitatively, the energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence method was applied for determination. Aortic valve cusp mineralization was estimated based on the Ca/P ratio. We assumed that the Ca/P ratio ≥ 0.6, i.e. 3 × control is the marker of massive mineralization of soft tissue. The experiments indicated that dependence of the Ga/Ca ratios in the tissue on Ga concentrations in the medium could be described by Langmuir's adsorption model. If surface coverage of calcium deposit exceeds ∼65%, mineralization process is inhibited. The Sr/Ca ratios rise linearly with increasing Sr concentrations in the medium. It confirms simple Sr - Ca replacement in the crystal lattice. The investigations indicate that addition of Ga at concentrations 8 mg/1 and Sr at concentrations 20 mg/1 to the mineralization medium can block the mineralization of AVHs. Mineralization-limiting Ga and Sr concentrations are toxic to human organism. However, it may be supposed that high concentrations of gallium and strontium would be beneficial in wet storage of AVHs before transplantation.

During shredding, the wreck is broken into smaller particles, and so the materials it contains are liberated to some extent.

This results in several recovered material streams: ferrous materials, aluminium, copper, zinc, stainless steel and automotive shredder residue (ASR, which consists of mainly nonmetallic materials). Each stream suffers from some degree of contamination by foreign materials due to imperfect separation processes.

However, there are a few problems such as storage, transportation, delivery to the user and usage safely, to be addressed to facilitate commercialization and wide usage of the hydrogen. The absorbed form within the metal hydrides seems to be the best solution of this problem. Since Li is the lightest metal, it has the advantage as the stored amount of hydrogen mass ratio. LiBH4 production process was investigated using elemental Li, B and H2. Spex type ball milling with tungsten carbide, stainless steel and zirconia type vessels, was used to mix the different amount of Li and B under argon atmosphere. X-ray diffraction pattern demonstrated that the LiB was obtained. A system was designed to provide a hydrogen atmosphere of 60 bars to force hydrogen into the LiB structure. FTIR analysis strongly indicated the LiBH4 compound when the mol ratio of B/Li is 0.214. Thermal decomposition and heat flow experiments performed simultaneously with DSC and TGA techniques also indicate hydrogen-rich structure showing greater mass loss. One gram of lithium borohydride sample released 1423 ml of hydrogen with Ni catalyst while NiO caused 1972.94 ml of hydrogen gas desorption, equaling to 90% of the theoretical yield of commercial LiBH4.

Cyril and Methodius, Salvador Aljende 73, Skopje, North Macedonia","Ground motion models represent empirical mathematical-physical models of ground motion under strong earthquakes defined on the basis of databanks of past earthquake records. Within these, the ground motion parameters as dependant random variables are related to the earthquake parameters, the seismic energy transfer characteristics of the region through which the seismic waves propagate and the influence of the local soil conditions as independent random variables. Regression analysis, either single or double, can be applied as a method for their determination. They are used in deterministic and probabilistic methods for prediction and estimation of the expected seismic action of future earthquakes upon the investigated location or region. Ground motion models are very important for prediction of future seismic actions and have been paid special attention. Following the analysis of a variety of published ground motion models for shallow and subduction earthquakes carried out by different authors, there are predictive equations, methods, synthesis, discussions on the state of the art and new trends in investigations of ground motion models. In this study, the author's attention has been focused on the new ground motion model dependant on the azimuth, which the author has developed and applied for determination of peak ground acceleration attenuation laws for the Vrancea intermediate earthquakes (Stamatovska 1996, 2002, 2006, Stamatovska and Petrovski 1997). Besides the already published results for the peak ground acceleration attenuation laws-PGA for the locations Bucharest, Cherna Voda, and Valeni, the author presents, for the first time, the progress of the applied ground motion model dependent on azimuth in determination of the response spectrum attenuation laws for the Vrancea intermediate earthquakes for Cherna Voda and Bucharest locations. © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó.","Corrected epicentral distance; Corrected hypocentral distance; Ground motion model dependant on the azimuth; Seismic focus depth; Spectral acceleration","Acceleration; Acceleration control; Cluster analysis; Difference equations; Earthquakes; Energy storage; Energy transfer; Equations of motion; Equations of state; Food processing; Forecasting; Location; Mathematical models; Models; Motion estimation; Random variables; Regression analysis; Applied (CO); Attenuation laws; Bucharest; Databanks; Earthquake parameters; earthquake records; Ground motion modelling; Ground motion parameters; Ground motions; Peak ground acceleration (pga); Physical model (PM); Predictive equations; Probabilistic methods; Regression (R2); response spectrum; Seismic actions; Seismic energy; Soil conditioning; State of the arts; subduction earthquakes; Synthesis (of chiral ionic liquids); Transfer characteristics; Seismology; earthquake; focal mechanism; ground motion; numerical model; seismic attenuation; seismic wave; spectral analysis; subduction; Carpathians; Eurasia; Europe; Romania; Southern Europe; Vrancea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45849135957

This study has a gate to gate system boundary. The inventory data collection starts at the oil palm fresh fruit bunch hoppers when the fresh fruit bunch is received at the mill up till the production of the crude palm oil in the storage tanks at the mill. The plantation phase and land use for the production of oil palm fresh fruit bunch is not included in this system boundary. This gate to gate case study of 12 mills identifies the potential impacts associated with the production of palm oil using the life cycle assessment approach and evaluates opportunities to overcome the potential impacts. Most of the impact categories show savings rather than impact. Within the system boundary there are only two main parameters that are causing the potential impacts to the environment; they are the Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) followed by the boiler ash. The impact categories that the POME contributes to are under the Respiratory Organics and Climate Change. Both these impact categories are related to air emissions. The main air emission from the POME ponds during the anaerobic digestion is the biogas which consists of methane, carbon dioxide and traces of hydrogen sulfide. An alternate scenario was conducted to see how the impact will be if the biogas was harvested and used as energy and the results shows that when the biogas is harvested, the impact from the POME is removed. The other significant impact is the boiler ash. This is the ash that is produced when the biomass is burnt in the boiler. This potential impact contributes to the ecotoxicity impact category. This is mainly because of the disposal of this ash which in most cases was used for land application in the roads leading to the mil or in the plantations. If the parameters causing these two potential impacts are curbed, then this will be a further plus point for the Malaysian oil palm industry which is already avoiding fossil fuel based energy and chemical use for processing. © 2008 Science Publications.","Biomass; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle impact assessment; Palm oil; Palm oil mill","biogas; biomass; inventory; life cycle analysis; milling; oil industry; performance assessment; plantation; vegetable oil; Asia; Eurasia; Malaysia; Southeast Asia; Auchenorrhyncha; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45249095611

Management of this plutonium is one of the aspects influencing the choice of a fuel cycle back-end option: reprocessing, direct disposal or wait-and-see. Different grades and qualities of plutonium exist depending from their specific generation conditions; all are valuable fissile material. Safeguard authorities watch the inventories of civil plutonium, but access to those data is restricted. Independent evaluations have led to an estimated current inventory of 220 t plutonium in total (spent fuel, separated civil plutonium and military plutonium). If used as MOX fuel, it would be sufficient to feed all the PWRs and BWRs worldwide during 7 years or to deploy a FBR park corresponding to 150% of today's installed nuclear capacity worldwide, which could then be exploited for centuries with the current stockpile of depleted and spent uranium. The energy potential of plutonium deteriorates with storage time of spent fuel and of separated plutonium, due to the decay of 241 Pu, the best fissile isotope, into americium, a neutron absorber. The loss of fissile value of plutonium is more pronounced for usage in LWRs than in FBR. However, keeping the current plutonium inventory for an expected future deployment of FBRs is counterproductive. Recycling plutonium reduce the required volume for final disposal in an underground repository and the cost of final disposal. However, the benefits of utilizing an energy resource and of reducing final disposal liabilities are not the only aspects that determine the choice of a back-end policy.","Americium; Back-end; Curium; Fuel cycle; MOX; Nuclear fuel; Plutonium",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44249092346

At such capacitance value EDLCs are of interest for electrical energy storage. The specific energy of commercial supercapacitors is limited to 5-6 Wh/kg, whereas for batteries the lower limit is 35-40 Wh/kg. Nonetheless other advantages of supercapacitors make them already useful in conjunction with batteries in power applications. Main results related to supercapacitor performance improvement available in literature are presented. Research efforts have been done to increase the specific capacitance of supercapacitor electrodes based on activated or porous carbon material, already used in commercial products. By using available activated carbon with a specific surface area reaching 3000 m2/g, specific capacitance values up to 300 F/g have been reported for the investigated experimental supercapacitors. Nonetheless, further optimization of activated carbon properties and its use in supercapacitor electrodes is required for 300 F/g and higher value. By addition of metallic oxides or conductive polymers in the activated carbon used for EDLC electrodes, specific capacitance enhancement takes place. Carbon nanotubes used in experimental supercapacitor electrodes resulted in specific capacitance as high as 180 F/g but higher electrical conductivity and consequently, specific power than in the case of activated carbon was observed. Addition of a small percent of carbon nanotubes in the activated carbon for electrodes results in performance improvement (higher capacitance and conductivity). Nevertheless, high cost of carbon nanotubes prevents their use in commercial products. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In Mexico, specifically in Baja California, there is an abundance of ""traditional"" renewable resources like sun and wind but also some others like hot springs at the coast, tidal currents and tidal amplitudes of over six meters in the upper part of the Gulf of California associated with a severe scarcity of fresh water. The National University of Mexico (UNAM) started two years ago a well organized research program to assess the amount of these resources and to find the way to use them for desalinating sea water. Very exiting results have being obtained: The abundance of hot springs at the shore, some of them over 84°C, lead to the design of thermal desalinating prototype plants with very little energy consumption. It was found by geochemistry that at a few meters deep, some 50 m, very high temperature can be obtained, easy to use in binary geothermal power plants to generate electricity for desalination. During the survey it was found that the amount of electrical power that can be generated with tidal storage and from deep sea hydrothermal vents is of the order of several thousands of MW.

An amorphous and/or nanocrystalline Mg2M (M=Fe, Ni, Cu) hydrogen storage alloys were prepared by mechanical alloying. For example, the powder 2Mg+Cu mixture mechanically alloyed for more than 18 h has transformed directly to an orthorhombic-type phase. In this powder, discharge capacity up to 26 mA h g-1 was measured. It was found that nickel substituting copper in Mg2Cu1-xNix alloy greatly improved the discharge capacity of studied material. In nanocrystalline Mg2Ni powder, discharge capacities up to 100 mA h g-1 were measured. Additionally, it was found that the nickel powder addition to 2Mg+M/x wt% Ni is advantageous for the formation of Mg-M amorphous structure and for the improvement of the electrochemical properties of the studied alloys. On the other hand, the reaction of hydrogen gas with Mg2M/Ni nanocomposite is enhanced significantly by the addition of catalysts such as titanium.","Electrochemical properties; Hydrogen storage alloys; Mechanical alloying; Mg-based nanomaterials","Binary alloys; Electric discharges; Electrochemical properties; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage alloys; Magnesium alloys; Mechanical alloying; Nanocrystalline alloys; Nanocrystalline powders; Nanocrystals; Ternary alloys; Amorphous structures; Discharge capacities; Hydrogen gas; Mechanically alloyed; Nano-structured; Nanocrystallines; Nickel powders; Copper alloys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42949085179

The maximum percentage of all fatty acids in the shape-stabilized PCMs was found to be 70 wt% in which no fatty acid seepage was observed as the blends were heated over the melting points of the fatty acids. The optic microscope (OM) investigation demonstrated that fatty acid domains were coated by Eudragit E. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) results revealed that the interactions between Eudragit E and fatty acids were only adequate for adhesion of Eudragit E on fatty acid domains. Single phase was observed for the blends by OM, and interactions between the components were investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. The melting and freezing temperatures and latent heats of the shape-stabilized PCMs were measured by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method. Based on the results, it was concluded that Eudragit E/MA, Eudragit E/PA, and Eudragit E/SA blends (30/70 wt%) have good utility potential for LHTES purposes in terms of their satisfying thermal properties and advantages of easy preparation in desired dimensions, direct usefulness function in LHTES systems, and cost effectiveness.","Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); Eudragit E; Fatty acids; FT-IR; Thermal properties","Differential scanning calorimetry; Encapsulation; Fatty acids; Latent heat; Phase change materials; Resins; Thermal energy; Eudragit E; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Optic microscope; Palmitic acid; Thermal properties; Acrylics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549153244

However control has remained an issue to be improved. In this paper, a method is outlined allowing both for dimensioning and for automated control of TABS, with automatic switching between cooling/heating modes for variable comfort criteria. The method integrally considers both HVAC and building automation design aspects, as well as the fact that during design and operation heat-gains are unknown, but that bounds of them normally can be specified. This integral method is termed the Unknown-But-Bounded or UBB method. Applying the method guarantees that comfort can be maintained, as long as the actual heat-gains stay within the predefined range between the lower and upper bounds. The UBB method can also handle non-predictable day-to-day variations as well as room-to-room variations of the heat gains.

In the present study, some parameters that affect the melting and the solidification time of PCM used to store low temperature energy have been observed experimentally. These parameters are inlet temperature and mass flow rate of water used as a heat transfer fluid (m = 2.51, 3.75, and 4.95 kg min-1), fin numbers inside the PCM. For this purpose, PCM has been stored constantly between the coaxial pipes and water adjusted to 45C for the melting process and to 5C for the solidification process, and was circulated by a pump through the inner pipe at the experimental setup. During the experiments, when the water mass flow rate is increased to 49 and 97% with respect to the starting mass flow rate (m = 2.51 kg min-1), a rate of 5 and 15% decrease at the melting time is obtained, respectively. As a result, it has been observed that the effect of the fins placed inside the PCM to the melting and solidification time is much more than the effects obtained by the flow rate and the swirling generators.","Calcium chloride hexahydrate; Melting and solidification; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage","Energy storage; Melting; Phase change materials; Solidification; Thermal energy; Water; Calcium chloride hexahydrate; Swirling generators; Calcium chloride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149142436

Hence, the operation of the pneumatic line in any application plant has an enormous effect on the overall energy efficiency. In analysis the compressed air system can be divided into three subsystems: production, after treatment (storage and transmission) and consumption. These systems interact with each other and strongly affect overall system energy requirements. Starting from the dynamical models of the subsystems a new generic energy efficiency index (CA-index) is introduced in the paper. It can be used both in one compressor and multi-compressor systems. The fact that the consumption of compressed air may be either pressure dependent or pressure independent is taken into account in the basic equations and in the energy efficiency index. The maximization of the index is carried out by defining and solving a mathematical optimization problem, which then gives the best possible operation policy of the pneumatic line. © 2008 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","CA index; Compressed air; Compressor; Dynamic model; Energy efficiency; Optimization; Pneumatic systems","Compressed air; Compressors; Dynamic models; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Optimization; Production; Operation policy; Pneumatic systems; Subsystems; Pneumatic control equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41049093320

High FFA concentrations (cs) caused by lipolysis can damage the quality properties of milk products. Therefore the FFA content is introduced thanks to an increase in the efficiency of modern analytical methods as a milk quality indicator and as an indicator for its price as well. The goal of this paper was to analyse the FFA relations to the other milk quality indicators. The data set (n = 11 586) was evaluated by regression methods. In November and December the respective FFA means were 0.614 ± 0.458 and 0.835 ± 0.491 mmol/100 g with a relatively high variability of 74.6 and 58.8%. The frequency of unsatisfactory FFA values (> 1.3) was 7.51 and 13.93%. Casein content (r = -0.17; P < 0.01) and crude protein content (r = -0.12; P < 0.01) were related more closely with FFA c. The FFAs can increase by 0.066 mmol/100 g with casein decrease by 0.10%. The FFAs in milk fat can slightly increase by the supply of energy to dairy cows (protein and casein decrease) and rise with the deteriorating health state of mammary gland (lactose, r = -0.14; P < 0.01) as well. The somatic cell count correlated with FFAs more weakly (r = 0.07; P < 0.05), similarly like the total mesophilic bacteria count (r = 0.11; P < 0.01), relatively more closely the psychrotrophic bacteria count (r = 0.27; P < 0.05). The deterioration of almost all hygienic indicators signified an FFA c increase. The urea content correlated with FFAs weakly (r = -0.08; P < 0.05) and the fat content imperceptibly as a component of similar substance like FFAs. The mechanical milk stress led to FFA liberation from fat esters proportionally to the intervention intensity (P < 0.001). Even a relatively small mechanical stress caused by mixing comparable to the current milking technology, milk transport and storage increased the FFA c of milk fat from 1.11 ± 0.19 to 1.80 ± 0.40 mmol/100 g (P < 0.05).

The key challenges and opportunities gathered by systematic consultation of senior stakeholders are presented. Coke oven gas and coal gasification are the major short and medium term sources of hydrogen. Underground conversion of coal deposits with integrated carbon capture and storage (CCS) is most important in the long term. Other opportunities include development of renewables, by-product hydrogen and nuclear power. Current lack of infrastructure, particularly for CCS, hydrogen pipelines and clean coal is seen as a significant barrier.

In Iran, sour orange is available between mid-October and March. Frequently, consumers store a large volume of unpasteurized juice at room or low temperatures for consumption when the fresh fruit is not available. The aim of our research was to determine the shelf life of unpasteurized sour orange juice which was stored under conditions similar to those adopted by consumers at home. Materials and methods. Sour orange juice was prepared by hand-squeezing fresh fruit; it was filtered, and then poured into clear or dark green glass bottles. Bottles were stored at room temperature [(28 ± 2)°C], in the refrigerator [(4 ± 1)°C] and in the freezer [(-12 ± 1)°C] for 12 weeks. Additional samples were prepared by supplementing juice with 2% (w/w) citric acid and they were stored in the refrigerator. Total soluble solids and pH values were measured every 2 weeks and analysis was carried out on ascorbic acid content by means of the titration method in the presence of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol. The study was performed for 12 weeks. Results and discussion. Total soluble solids content and pH value of the initial juice were 11.5° Brix and 3.18, respectively. pH appeared not to be significantly influenced by storage time or conditions; however, total soluble solids content in a few samples was reduced to about 9.5° Brix. The initial ascorbic acid content was 130 mg·100 mL1; after 2 weeks, it was reduced by nearly 50% for all unfrozen samples. The final concentration of ascorbic acid in the juice was approximately 20 mg·100 mL1, regardless of storage conditions. The deteriorative reaction of ascorbic acid in the juice at each temperature experienced followed a first-order kinetic model with activation energy of 2.67 kJ·mol1. © CIRAD.","Ascorbic acid; Citrus aurantium; Fruit juices; Iran Islamic Republic; Keeping quality; Packaging; Storage","Citrus aurantium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38549092611

In this work, we study experimentally the structure and electrochemical properties of nanocrystalline Mg2 Cu, (Mg1 - x Mx)2 Ni alloys, as well as Mg2 Cu / M′ and (Mg1 - x Mx)2 Ni / M′ (x = 0, 0.5; M = Al, Mn; M′ = C, Pd) nanocomposites. These materials were prepared by mechanical alloying (MA). In the nanocrystalline Mg2 Cu powder, discharge capacity up to 26 mA h g- 1 was measured. It was found that nickel substituting copper in Mg2 Cu1 - x Nix alloy greatly improved the discharge capacity of studied material. In nanocrystalline Mg2 Ni powder, discharge capacities up to 100 mA h g- 1 were measured. Additionally, it was found that Al or Mn substituting magnesium in Mg2 - x Mx Ni alloy greatly improved the discharge capacity of studied material. For example, in nanocrystalline Mg1.5 Mn0.5 Ni powder, discharge capacities up to 241 mA h g- 1 were measured. On the other hand, mechanically coated Mg-based alloys with graphite or palladium have effectively reduced the degradation rate of the studied electrode materials. Finally, the properties of nanocrystalline alloys and their nanocomposites are compared to that of microcrystalline samples. The substitution of Mg by transition metals leads to significant modifications of the shape and width of the XPS valence band of the nanocrystalline as well as microcrystalline samples. Especially, the valence bands of the MA nanocrystalline alloys are considerably broader compared to those measured for the microcrystalline samples. Results also showed that the strong modifications of the electronic structure of the nanocrystalline alloys could significantly influence their hydrogenation properties. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Metal hydrides; Mg-based alloys; Nanocrystalline alloys","Absorption; Electrochemical properties; Electronic structure; Graphite; Hydrogenation; Nanocrystalline alloys; Transition metals; Valence bands; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Discharge capacity; Electrode materials; Metal hydrides; Hydrogen storage alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349123650

The most frequently used IV lipid emulsions (LE) are composed with long-chain triacylglycerols rich in ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) from soybean oil, but these LE promote lymphocyte and neutrophil death. A new emulsion containing 20% soybean oil and 80% olive oil rich in ω-9 monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) has been hypothesized not to cause impairment of immune function. In this study, the toxicity of an olive oil-based emulsion (OOE) on lymphocytes and neutrophils from healthy volunteers was investigated. Methods: Twenty volunteers were recruited and blood was collected before a 6-hour infusion of an OOE, immediately after infusion, and again 18 hours postinfusion. Lymphocytes and neutrophils were isolated by gradient density. The cells were studied immediately after isolation and after 24 hours or 48 hours in culture. The following determinations were carried out: triacylglycerol levels and fatty acid composition and levels in plasma, lymphocyte proliferation, production of reactive oxygen species, and parameters of lymphocyte and neutrophil death (viability, DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine extemalization, mitochondrial depolarization, and neutral lipid accumulation). Results: OOE decreased lymphocyte proliferation, provoked lymphocyte necrosis, and had no effect on the proportion of viable neutrophils. The mechanism of cell death induced by OOE involved neutral lipid accumulation but had no effect on mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Conclusions: The OOE given as a single dose of 500 mL induced low toxicity to lymphocytes from healthy volunteers, probably by necrosis.

Wet processes using aqueous solutions show reasonable chemical kinetics combined with poor energy economy. A dry, gas-solid process with slower chemical kinetics (demonstrated previously), but better energy economy could be an alternative. This paper addresses the energy economy of a two- or three-stage gas-solid process for magnesium silicate carbonation. It involves production of reactive magnesium as magnesium oxide or hydroxide in an atmospheric pressure step, followed by carbonation at elevated pressures that allow for reasonable carbonation reaction kinetics under conditions where magnesium carbonate is thermodynamically stable. For a feasible large-scale process the kinetics in the individual reactors must be fast enough, while the heat produced in the carbonation step must be sufficient to compensate for energy inputs to the preceding step(s). Results give reactor temperature combinations that allow for operation at a negative or zero energy input, for given carbonation reactor pressure and degree of carbonation conversion, and other process energy requirements. Softwares used were HSC and Aspen Plus. Also, some results from gas-solid kinetics studies with magnesium oxide-based materials at the pressures considered are included. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

As traditional risk factors cannot alone explain the high prevalence and incidence of CVD in this high-risk population, the complex of insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction has increasingly been studied as important non-traditional risk factors. Recent studies show that the adipose tissue is a complex organ with functions far beyond the mere storage of energy. Indeed, it has recently been shown that fat tissue secretes a number of adipokines - including leptin, adiponectin and retinol-binding protein, as well as cytokines such as resistin, visfatin, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6. Adipokine serum levels are furthermore markedly elevated in CKD, likely due to a decreased renal excretion. Evidence suggests that these pluripotent signaling molecules may have multiple effects modulating insulin signaling, endothelial health and putatively CVD. As fat tissue is also a storage depot for energy, much needed in the catabolic milieu of uremia, further research is still needed to elucidate the likely complex interactions between these signaling networks, vascular health and outcome in this high-risk population.

The gelation process and influence of nanoclay content and salt concentration on swelling behavior were investigated. Study of gelation behavior using dynamic rheometry method showed that increasing the nanoclay content decreases the storage modulus, due to the partial adsorption of polymer chains onto the clay surface and ionic interaction between negative layers of sodium montmorillonite and Cr.3+ By increasing the cross-linker concentration of the gelation system, the viscous energy dissipation properties of the nanocomposite gel decreases. Swelling ratio of the nanocomposite gels in distilled water decreased as the concentration of the nanoclay increased.

Storage of hydrogen in the form of liquid organic hydrides has been proposed involving methylcyclohexane. Hydrogen is generally regarded as a possible important future energy carrier for automotive and other applications. Hydrogen as an automotive fuel can be used in conventional internal combustion engines, but can also be applied in proton exchange membrane fuel cell vehicles. The catalytic experiments were made in a tubular pyrex glass fixed bed reactor (with a 20 mm diameter). The temperature range was between 150C and 210C under a total pressure of about 1 atm.

ESR spectra of unirradiated (control) chickpea were composed of an equally spaced sextet originating from the presence of Mn2+ ions and a single weak resonance signal both centered at g=2.00540.0006. Although irradiation was found to have no effect on the Mn2+ signals, it caused a noteworthy increase in free radical signal intensity of chickpea in the studied dose range of (0.1-4.5kGy). In addition, the ESR spectrum of irradiated chickpea recorded at low scan range (10mT) showed that there were more than one radical species, having different spectral features, contributing to the central resonance signal. From this point of view, we focussed on the free radical signal in the present study. The area under the ESR absorption curve which is related to the free radical concentration was determined from the experimental spectra recorded throughout the study, and its variation with microwave power, radiation dose, storage time and temperature was investigated in detail. Free radical concentration was observed to decay very fast within the first 15 days after the irradiation cessation and little thereafter. At the end of the storage period (60 days), the free radical concentration is still higher than that of the control (unirradiated) sample. The decay of free radical concentration at room and high temperatures were described well by the sum of three second-order decay functions representing three different radical species (A, B and C). The activation energies of these radicals, evaluated by Arrhenius analysis, are in the order ECEBEA. Simulation calculations have shown that three radical species (A, B and C) of different spectral parameters were found to best explain the experimental values.","Chickpea; Dosimetry; ESR; Kinetics; Radiation","Activation energy; Computer simulation; Dosimetry; Paramagnetic resonance; Radiation effects; Arrhenius analysis; Chickpea; Simulation calculations; Spectral parameters; Crops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549044301

The method results in developing a reliability-based simulation (RBS) model that is used to analyze single-reservoir hydropower systems. In most of the cascade hydropower systems in the country, a single-reservoir RBS model is usually employed in the design and operation of each of the systems reservoirs. This paper presents a multireservoir RBS model considering the integrated operation of the systems. The model employs the general algorithm of the single-reservoir RBS model; however, with a single-period optimization submodel in determining releases from reservoirs during the system simulation. The objective function of the submodels minimizes the sum of reservoir releases and/or maximizes the sum of reservoir storages in each of the time periods, subject to a reliability constraint on the system's energy yield. The single and multireservoir RBS models are applied in the Khersan hydropower system located in Iran as a case study.

The installed wind-turbine capacity in Western Denmark exceeds the local demand at certain points in time. So far, excess production has been exported to neighbouring countries. However, plans to expand wind power both in Denmark and in its neighbouring countries could restrain the export option and create transmission congestion challenges. This results in a need to increase the flexibility of the local electricity-system. Compressed-Air Energy-Storage (CAES) has been proposed as a potential solution for levelling fluctuating wind-power production and maintaining a system balance. This paper analyses the energy-balance effects of adding CAES to the Western Danish energy-system. Results show that even with an unlimited CAES plant capacity, excess power production is not eliminated because of the high percentage of CHP production. The optimal wind-power penetration for maximum CAES operation is found to be around 55%. The minimum storage size for CAES to fully eliminate condensing power plants operation in the optimized system is over 500 GWh, which corresponds to a cavern volume of around 234 Mm3 at an average pressure of 60 bar.

The metabolic pathways leading to their synthesis involve the action of several enzymes, among which glycogen synthase (GS) or starch synthase (SS) catalyze the elongation of the α-1,4-glucan backbone. At least five SS isoforms were described in Arabidopsis thaliana; it has been reported that the isoform III (SSIII) has a regulatory function on the synthesis of transient plant starch. The catalytic C-terminal domain of A. thaliana SSIII (SSIII-CD) was cloned and expressed. SSIII-CD fully complements the production of glycogen by an Agrobacterium tumefaciens glycogen synthase null mutant, suggesting that this truncated isoform restores in vivo de novo synthesis of bacterial glycogen. In vitro studies revealed that recombinant SSIII-CD uses with more efficiency rabbit muscle glycogen than amylopectin as primer and displays a high apparent affinity for ADP-Glc. Fold class assignment methods followed by homology modeling predict a high global similarity to A. tumefaciens GS showing a fully conservation of the ADP-binding residues. On the other hand, this comparison revealed important divergences of the polysaccharide binding domain between AtGS and SSIII-CD. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Arabidopsis thaliana; Enzyme structure; Glycogen; Starch; Starch synthase","1,4 alpha glucan branching enzyme; adenosine diphosphate; amylopectin; enzyme; glycogen; glycogen synthase; isoenzyme; polysaccharide; starch; starch synthase; starch synthase III; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis; article; binding affinity; binding site; carboxy terminal sequence; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme structure; fold class assignment method; glycogen muscle level; glycogen synthesis; in vitro study; in vivo study; metabolism; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein function; rabbit; Rhizobium radiobacter; sequence homology; technique; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Base Sequence; Catalytic Domain; Cloning, Molecular; Computational Biology; DNA Primers; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Glucosyltransferases; Models, Molecular; Protein Conformation; Substrate Specificity; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Arabidopsis thaliana; Bacteria (microorganisms); Oryctolagus cuniculus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37449001474

Recent studies show that the adipose tissue is a complex organ with pleiotropic functions far beyond the mere storage of energy. Fat tissue secretes a number of adipokines including leptin and adiponectin, as well as cytokines, such as resistin, visfatin, tumor-necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6. RECENT FINDINGS: Adipokine serum levels are markedly elevated in chronic kidney disease, likely due to a decreased renal excretion. Evidence suggests that these pluripotent signaling molecules may have multiple effects modulating insulin signaling, endothelial health and vascular outcome. SUMMARY: Fat tissue is a storage depot for energy and a source of circulating signaling molecules. It plays an important role in the catabolic uremic milieu, and has been linked to systemic inflammation and uremic anorexia. Further research is needed to investigate the complex interactions between adipokine signaling networks and its effects on vascular health and outcome in chronic kidney disease. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Cardiovascular disease; Chronic kidney disease; Fat tissue; Insulin resistance","adipocytokine; adiponectin; leptin; resistin; visfatin; adipose tissue; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney disease; endothelial dysfunction; human; incidence; inflammation; insulin resistance; lipid storage; macrophage; nerve conduction; obesity; oxidative stress; prevalence; priority journal; review; urinary excretion; Adipokines; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Macrophages; Neurons",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37349056083

In this article, studies of the free-cooling potential for different climatic locations are presented. Six cities from around Europe with a wide range of climatic conditions were selected. The size of the LHTES was optimized on the basis of the calculated cooling degree-hours. First, we analysed the influence of the width of the phase change temperature range and determined the optimal melting temperature of the phase change material (PCM). Then, the optimal LHTES was selected, based on the ratio of the mass of the PCM and the volume flow rate of air ventilating the building. We found that the optimum PCM has a melting temperature that is approximately equal to the average ambient air temperature in the hottest month, and that the free-cooling potential is proportional to the average daily amplitude of the ambient air's temperature swings. For all the analysed climatic conditions the PCM with a wider phase change temperature range (12 K) was found to be the most efficient. The optimal size of the LHTES for the free cooling of buildings is between 1 and 1.5 kg of PCM per m3/h of fresh ventilation air. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This article offers an appraisal of political commitment to a CCS strategy among high-income countries in Europe and North America: Which governments are committed, and what particular interests and concerns do they seek to accommodate by supporting CCS? In order to answer these questions, new data are reported on government CCS research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) budgets. RD&amp;D budgets divided by GDP is used as an indicator of political commitment, and explanations are sought for cross-national differences. The analysis shows that fossil fuels reserves and extraction within a country has a very strong bearing on funding levels. Likely explanations include the potential for combining CCS with enhanced resource recovery. All large economies (population &gt;50 million) have a funding program. The smaller states that provide funding (Norway, Canada, the Netherlands) have the highest funding levels relative to GDP. These findings suggest that high-income petroleum producing countries are likely to be leaders in promoting CCS and a favorable regulatory environment. The fact that all large, high-income countries in the two regions now display some interest in CCS further improves its political outlook. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Climate policy; CO2 capture and storage; Comparative analysis; Fossil energy; Political commitment; RD&D budgets; Technological innovation","carbon dioxide; environmental policy; fossil fuel; mitigation; petroleum; Benelux; Canada; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; North America; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36649018778

Two design configurations were considered: (A) one serpentine in the tank (for the secondary circuit) and (B) two serpentines in the tank (for both primary and secondary circuits). An indirect optimal control technique based on Pontryagin's maximum principle was implemented. A detailed collector model and realistic meteorological data from both cold and warm seasons were used in applications. Configuration (A) gives better performance than configuration (B) but cannot be used during the cold season at higher geographical latitudes. The optimal operation strategy involves two step up and down jumps between zero and a maximum allowable fluid flow rate in the primary circuit. During days with overcast sky, the pump in the primary circuit operates almost continuously. During days with cloudy or clear sky, the pump often stops. Heat provided to the user increases when the maximum fluid flow rate increases. This applies to both configurations (A) and (B). In the case of configuration (B), the heat provided to the user becomes rather constant at higher flow rates. When a constant flow rate strategy is adopted, there is an optimum ratio between the volume of the storage tank and the area of the solar energy collection surface: Vs/A ≈ 33.3 L/m2. The optimal control strategy does not exhibit such an optimum: the thermal energy supply to the user (slightly) decreases by increasing the ratio Vs/A. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Funding is provided to energy service companies (ESCo's) to implement projects that can achieve load shifting out of this period. This paper describes how an improved in line water heating concept developed in previous studies was implemented into several real life industrial sanitary water heating systems to obtain the DSM load shift required by ESKOM. Measurements from a selection of these plants are provided to illustrate the significant load reductions that are being achieved during 18:00-20:00. The measured results also show that the peak load reduction is achieved without adversely affecting the availability of sufficient hot water to the persons using the showering and washing facilities served by the water heating system. A very good correlation also exists between these measured results and simulations that were done beforehand to predict the DSM potential of the project. The in line water heater concept provides an improved solution for DSM at sanitary water heating systems due to the stratified manner in which hot water is supplied to the tanks. This provides an improved hot water supply to users when compared to conventional in tank heating systems, even with load shifting being done. It also improves the storage efficiency of a plant, thereby allowing the available storage capacity of a plant to be utilized to its full extent for load shifting purposes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Although unirradiated samples did not exhibit any ESR signals, irradiated samples were observed to present ESR spectra with many resonance lines originating from radiation induced radical or radicals. Dose-response curves associated with the resonance peak heights of CM (I1, I2) and DS (I3, I4, I5, I6) were found to follow linear and power functions of applied radiation dose, respectively. Simulation calculations were performed to determine the structure and spectral parameters of the radiation-induced radicalic species involved in the formation of experimental ESR spectrum of CM using, as input, the room temperature signal intensity data obtained for a sample irradiated at dose of 10 kGy. Kinetic behaviors and activation energies of the radicalic species were also calculated using the data obtained from annealing studies performed at five different temperatures. The presence of detectable signal intensities even after a storage period of 100 days was considered as providing an opportunity in the discrimination of irradiated CM and DS from unirradiated ones.

While material strength directly determines kinetic energy level that could be produced safely combined (coupled) with rotor speed, this study solely focuses on exploring the effects of flywheel geometry on its energy storage/deliver capability per unit mass, further defined as Specific Energy. Proposed chain of finite element analysis and optimization procedure results show that smart design of flywheel geometry could both have a significant effect on the Specific Energy performance and reduce the operational loads exerted on the shaft/bearings due to reduced mass at high rotational speeds. This paper specifically studies the most common six different geometries (i.e., straight/concave or convex shaped 2D cross-sections) and ranks according to their energy storage performance using the proposed procedure. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
