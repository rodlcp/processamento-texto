The system is superior to phase displacement because the cavities are driven at a fixed frequency with certain phase differences between each other. The range of particle momenta is limited by rf-knock out. Rf-induced betatron oscillations and phase dependent momentum changes can be compensated by means of sixteen cavities on the circumference of the accelerator. The amplitude of the betatron oscillations and the energy gain were calculated numerically for storage devices consisting of a spiral-sector FFAG guide field and one or sixteen cavities, respectively, using measured rf-field data. The systems seem to be practical only for electrons with an energy up to 100 MeV. The rf-system works within an energy width of several MeV. © 1975.",,"SCINTILLATION COUNTERS; TIME MEASUREMENT",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016591637

Effects were found both on the pools of nucleotides, as examined by the technic of high pressure liquid chromatography, and on the phenomenon of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Although the normal ratio of ATP and ADP in platelets is about 1.5:1, after incubation with adenosine-8-14C, ATP and ADP were labeled in a ratio of about 7:1. This is consistent with a distribution of the nucleotides among storage and metabolic pools, with the adenosine-8-14C entering principally the metabolic pool. After 2 hr of incubation with 0-5 mM 2-fluoroadenosine (F-Ado), the concentration of F-ATP was approximately 12 μmoles/1011 platelets. The ratio of F-ATP to F-ADP was approximately 7:1, indicating that it entered primarily the metabolic nucleotide pool. Also, during the first hr of incubation, as the F-ATP concentration increased, the ATP concentration fell. When F-ATP-containing platelets were treated with thrombin, an aggregator and storage granule releaser, the nucleotides released into the medium consisted principally of ATP and ADP in a ratio of about 0.8:1, with very little 2-fluoroadenine-containing nucleotides. After thrombin treatment, the washed platelet pellet contained most of the 2-fluoroadenine nucleotides, but with significant increases in the concentrations of F-AMP and F-ADP. This suggests that F-ATP can replace ATP as the energy donor for the aggregation and release phenomena. As reported elsewhere, adenosine strongly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by ADP. However, this inhibitory effect disappears after preincubation for about 30 min. If the preincubation is carried out in the presence of coformycin, a tight-binding inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (Ki ≅ 1 × 10-10M), the inhibition of aggregation by adenosine is markedly prolonged, indicating that the loss of inhibition results from conversion of adenosine to inosine by adenosine deaminase. ADP-induced aggregation is powerfully inhibited by F-Ado, and the inhibition becomes more pronounced on prolonged incubation. This is consistent with the observation that F-Ado has very weak substrate activity with adenosine deaminase. The analog, N6-phenyladenosine, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase that does not form analog nucleotides in platelets, inhibits aggregation strongly, and the inhibition is maintained during incubation of 1 hr. Several other adenosine analogs only weakly inhibit ADP-induced aggregation even in the presence of coformycin. These include 2'-deoxyadenosine, 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin), arabinosyladenine, and formycin A, a C-nucleoside. However, significant quantities of nucleotides of formycin A are formed in platelets in the presence of coformycin. © 1975.",,"adenosine; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; adenylate kinase; coformycin; cordycepin; creatine kinase; creatine phosphate; deoxyadenosine; guanosine diphosphate; radioisotope; vidarabine; adenosine c 14; fluoroadenosine; formicin; human; in vitro study; metabolism; normal human; theoretical study; thrombocyte; thrombocyte aggregation; Adenosine; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Blood Platelets; Chromatography, Liquid; Depression, Chemical; Human; In Vitro; Nucleotides; Platelet Aggregation; Ribose; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Thrombin; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016794074

Because of the rather low ion velocities, the beams can be axially compressed thereby shortening the duration of the beam pulse and increasing the beam power by perhaps several orders of magnitude. The low ion velocities make it possible to build up the beam rather slowly in about approximately 10-6 sec, prior to its axial compression and delivery to the target. This long build up time may permit the use of cheap inductive energy storage devices to drive the beam.

Methods for preparation and storage of the vesicles were devised to allow for the maximal activity and stability of the calcium transport system. The pH and temperature optima for the reaction were observed to occur at pH 8.0 and 30°, respectively. The effects of various ions on the transport reaction were determined. It was found that the extent of the reaction depended on the presence of phosphate or oxalate. Phosphate was found to enter the vesicles at a rate slower than that of calcium. A Ca2+:P(i) ratio of approximately 1.5 was found, suggesting formation of Ca3(PO4)2. Monovalent cations stimulated calcium uptake, with the order of effectiveness being K+ &gt; Na+ &gt; Li+ &gt; NH4+. Inhibition was found with certain divalent cations, but these cations also inhibited the electron transport chain. Of the divalent cations examined, only Mg2+ and Sr2+ inhibited calcium transport without a corresponding inhibition of respiration. Calcium transport exhibited biphasic kinetics, with a low affinity system and a high affinity system. The low affinity system showed a Km of 0.34 mM and a Vmax of 85 nmol/min/mg of protein. The kinetic constants of the high affinity system were 4.5 μM and 2 nmol/min/mg of protein. The energy for calcium transport could be derived from the electron transport chain by oxidation of NADH, D lactate, and succinate, in order of their effectiveness. Respiration driven calcium transport was inhibited by inhibitors of the electron transport chain and by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. ATP could also be used to supply energy for calcium transport. The ATP driven reaction was inhibited by inhibitors of the Mg2+ATPase and by an antiserum prepared against that protein, demonstrating that that enzyme is involved in the utilization of ATP for active transport in inverted vesicles.",,"adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphate; calcium; calcium chloride ca 45; radioisotope; cell membrane transport; escherichia coli; in vitro study; membrane; membrane vesicle; microorganism; theoretical study; Adenosinetriphosphatase; Anions; Biological Transport, Active; Calcium; Cations, Divalent; Cations, Monovalent; Cell Membrane; Enzyme Activation; Escherichia coli; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Magnesium; Sulfhydryl Reagents; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016703348

Edinburgh, United Kingdom","The anatomy of the metathoracic leg is redescribed with particular reference to storage of energy in cuticular elements and the way in which the stored energy is used in jumping. The jump of adult male locusts requires an energy of 9 mJ and that of the female requires 11 mJ. The semilunar processes of each metafemur store 4 mJ at a stress of 15 N, and the extensor tibiae apodeme stores a further 3 mJ at the same stress. The total stored energy in both metathoracic legs is 14 mJ. The extensor tibiae muscle produces a maximum isometric force of over 15 N at 30°C and, when loaded with the extensor apodeme and semilunar processes, attains this force in 0.3 sec with a strain of 0.8 mm. The peak power output is 36 mW or 0.45 W.g-1. The peak isometric force is attained when the tibia is fully flexed and the force falls as the tibia extends. The extensor tibiae muscle A band is 5.5 μm long and the peak force is over 0.75 N.m-2. The peak velocity of shortening is 7 mm.sec-1 or about 1.75 lengths/sec at 30°C. The tensile strength of the extensor apodeme is 0.6 kN.mm-2 and Young's modulus is 19 kN.mm-2. The safety factor does not exceed 1.2 and the safety factor of the semilunar processes and tibial cuticle is little higher. The jump impulse lasts 25-30 msec. A velocity of 3.2 m.sec-1 is reached after a peak acceleration of 180 m.sec-2. The peak power output is 0.75 W at close to maximum velocity. Energy losses in rotating the femur and tibia are small and it is shown that the leg is able to extend at 7 times the normal rate with losses of about 20%. Most of the stored energy is converted to kinetic energy as the animal jumps. A model based on the relaxation of a spring that has the properties of the elastic elements of the locust leg into a level with the same kinematics as the locust leg produces a force distance curve similar to that measured for locust jumps.

It was found that storage with extracellular solution decreased all cortical enzymes. This was not the case with intracellular solution or in kidneys cooled and stored without any solution. A decrease in the potassium concentration of the Ursol solution decreased cortical (Na+ + K+)-ATPase enzymatic activity. The medullary enzymatic changes were similar in the different groups, and lower than in unstored controls. It appears that the changes on the level of the ATPase enzyme system which is related to the cation transport system might play a significant role in explaining the different results seen in clinical or experimental renal preservation systems. These changes can be related to the injury of preservation due to environmental effects of the cation concentrations and to a lesser degree to the damage of the enzyme system which provides the energy for cation transport.",,"adenosine triphosphatase; magnesium; potassium; sodium; animal; article; cold; comparative study; dog; enzymology; kidney; kidney cortex; kidney medulla; metabolism; methodology; organ preservation; oxygen consumption; solution and solubility; tissue preservation; Adenosinetriphosphatase; Animal; Cold; Comparative Study; Dogs; Kidney; Kidney Cortex; Kidney Medulla; Magnesium; Organ Preservation; Oxygen Consumption; Potassium; Sodium; Solutions; Tissue Preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016653142

The detector consists of 1 1 2″ × 1 1 2″ stilbene scintillator associated with a ruggerized photomultiplier. This assembly is mounted inside a plastic anticoincidence shield, viewed by a phototube, in order to eliminate the charged cosmic ray component. The pulses created by neutrons and gamma radiation are separated in the stilbene by means of pulse shape discrimination. The spectrometry is carried out in 6 channels for gamma rays with a time resolution of 41 s andin 3 channels for neutrons with a time resolution of 164 s or inversely with an alternate mode. Integral rate of the shield scintillator is monitored above a threshold set at 300 keV. Logic and binary circuits provide scaling and storage for each channel and also logarithmic digital-to-analog conversion for the spacecraft telemetry.

Unlike most analytical approaches the stimulation is not restricted to small pertubations and thus the growth of instabilities can be followed into the non-linear region. The investigations show that, as a result of an instability, the final energy spread of an initially unbunched beam interacting with a resonant cavity is larger than the vale at threshold and tends to a limit which depends on both the initial energy spread and on the spread at threshold. Although the cavity has a high impedanceonly at the revolution frequency of the beam, the particle distributions contain Fourier components at multiples of the revolution frequency. The growth rate and threshold agree well with those obtained from linear theory, if the cavity filling time is small compared to the growth time of the instability, and if the frequency spread within the beam is small compared to the width of the cavity resonance. If the first condition does not hold, the growth time becomes longer; and a frequency spread within the beam larger than the width of the cavity resonance results in a slight reduction of the threshold spread, and the overshoot of the final energy spread over this spread becomes smaller. © 1975.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344139802

Theoretical ideas about hadronic interactions at high energies are discussed. An exposition is given of the techniques for measuring differential cross sections in the region of very small momentum transfers. A summary is given of the information which has been obtained in various experiments on the total cross sections for Π±N, K±N, NN, and N interactions, the real parts of the elastic scattering amplitudes at t = 0, the slopes of the diffraction peaks, large-angle scattering, and polarization effects in elastic scattering reactions. It is observed that the entire set of experimental data is consistent with dispersion relations and asymptotic theorems. The slope of the diffraction peak exhibits a systematic (approximately logarithmic) growth at high energies. This growth corresponds to a relatively small value for the slope of the Pomeranchuk trajectory, αP'(0)≈0.3 GeV–2. The experimental data in elastic scattering processes and charge-exchange reactions are in agreement with the predictions of complex angular momentum theory. A discussion is given of new phenomena which have been observed using the accelerators at Serpukhov and Batavia and the CERN intersecting storage rings: a growth of the total cross sections for hadronic interactions, a change of sign of the real part of the zero-angle elastic scattering amplitude, and other effects which show up at energies 100 GeV. © 1976 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957164939

It is characterized by a flagellar axoneme of 6 + 0 pattern, a reduction of the chondriome, and the abundance of storage polysaccharide or lipid bodies. The movements of the flagella are of the undulating type and they are performed in the three dimensions of space. They are very slow, with a cycle time of about 2 s. The structure of the axoneme components are similar to those of flagella with a 9 + 2 pattern. Each doublet has overall dimensions of 350 × 220 Å; the space between the adjacent doublets is about 160 Å. The A subfiber bears arms like dynein arms. The diameter of the axoneme is about 1,000 Å. The basal body consists of a cylinder of dense material 2,500 Å long and 1,300-1,400 Å in diameter; a microtubule 200 Å in diameter is present in the axis. This study shows that a 6 + 0 pattern can generate a flagellar movement. The mechanism of the flagellar movement of the male gamete of L. tuzetae does not require the presence of central microtubules and it would include molecular interactions of the dynein-tubulin type between the adjacent peripheric doublets.

The rate of browning was only slightly affected by the addition of ferrous ions both in the absence and in the presence of oxygen.

Colored compounds were undoubtedly incorporated within living forms from the earliest times, but during the transition from heterotrophic to a photoautotrophic metabolism only those pigments were selected that were components of the evolving photosynthetic apparatus and were able to catalyze reactions involving storage of light energy in chemical bonds. In this communication, some properties of tetrapyrroles with a closed porphyrin ring containing a metal ion in the center are discussed. These compounds are present in all principal contemporary photosynthetic pigments, and their synthesis has been demonstrated from simpler compounds under prebiotic conditions. It is probable that during intermediate stages in the evolution of photosynthesis, pigments with oxidizing potentials lower than that of chlorophyll were utilized to store light energy although they were not capable of removing electrons from water. The evolution and function of multiple forms of a given photosynthetic pigment in vivo are discussed.

The smaller (3 to 8 g mean wet weight) Leptasterias hexactis broods relatively few, large young in the winter, while the large (300 to 650 g mean wet weight) Pisaster ochraceus broadcasts relatively many, small eggs each spring. L. hexactis matures at a small size (2 g wet weight) in about 2 years, and P. ochraceus matures at a larger size (70 to 90 g wet weight) in about 5 years (Menge, 1974). As in many broadcasting asteroids, gonad and storage organ indices of P. ochraceus are inversely related over time, and maximum storage-organ index correlates with the summer feeding maximum (Mauzey, 1966). In contrast, both organ indices of L. hexactis and feeding increase and are positively correlated until early autumn, when feeding activity begins to decline. At this time the male gonad index continues to rise, and the storage-organ index drops. In contrast, both organ indices of females rise. Spawning occurs from November to January. Thereafter storage-organ indices decline in females, presumably because females draw upon energy reserves while brooding; storage-organ indices rise in males, presumably because males do not brood and can feed if food is available. The primary cause for the differences between annual reproductive cycles of P. ochraceus and L. hexactis is suggested to be patterns of food availability for the released young (planktonic food for the broadcasted young of P. ochraceus and benthic prey for the brooded young of L. hexactis. Estimates of pre-maturity survival and post-maturity longevity indicate that the probability of survival per individual of young P. ochraceus is vastly lower than that of L. hexactis. However, once mature, P. ochraceus has a much longer expected lifespan. Brooding is suggested to be a coadaptive consequence of competition-induced small size. Assuming planktonic mortality rates in this environment are roughly constant across broadcasting species, I suggest that a small broadcasting species could not produce enough offspring in its expected lifespan to replace itself. This hypothesis is partly supported by some simple simulations. Broadcasting is suggested to permit rapid location and utilization of spatially and temporally unpredictable, but highly desirable, resources by allowing rapid and widespread dispersal. Brooders presumably cannot disperse rapidly and must rely on more reliable, but perhaps less desirable, resources. Factors affecting reproductive patterns in marine invertebrates include (1) food availability for both adults and offspring, (2) planktonic mortality rates, (3) interactions between species and latitudinal changes in these factors, and (4) various physical factors. This paper suggests that competition and predation can have an important effect on the evolution of reproductive methods, a possibility heretofore largely ignored. Although several similar examples of co-occurring species' pairs which differ in reproductive method and size are available, the role of adult interactions is unknown in these examples. © 1975 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250400581

Food plants, in particular fruit and vegetables contain specific health promoting of diseases of civilisation. 2. The quest for yield maximisation of food plants may lead to questionable results. A consequence of high rate of inorganic fertiliser in particular nitrogen application designed to increase crop yield is high of application of pesticides, herbicides and growth regulators. This in turn may severely affect important plant compounds responsable for the biological value of food plants and may favour at the same time pesticide residues. Little known is the fact that an increase in yield, genetically induced, may lead to similar appropriate consequences. Fruit and Vegetable cultivars are bred partially for maximum yield, easier manuell or mechanical harvesting, for more suitable transport or storage or for various desirable marketing properties. This may inadvertently suffer sometimes appreciable reduction in variety characteristic flavour, in valuable compound and in food components of importance to our health. Experimental evidence from the past and present is provided. Market grades-in particular the E.E.C. Standards are directed towards arbitrary requirements, by no means relevant to the consumer, such as weight, size and attractive appearance. The criteria of a system of market grades mean lack of choice for the producer, pressure to maximise yield through maximum use of chemicals in production with the results detrimental for the 'inner quality' of the produce as described above. Practical suggestions are submitted for athorough revision of the present system of marketing grades required by the consumer in the direction of nutritional and hygienic upgrading through the deliberate production of fruit and vegetable cultivars of marketing possibilities, trophic value and optimum disease resistance. In face of the world wide energy crisis - particularly applicable to glasshouse cultivation with its high fuel requirements - the energy should be used for the production of food plants of the highest nutritional and hygienic quality. © 1975 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr. W.

The longitudinal storage modulus is calculated not only from an equation based on an existing force balance treatment but also from the elastic strain energy stored in matrix and fibres, using two different models to derive the stress and strain distributions from which the stored energy is calculated. There is very good agreement between all the calculations. The energy calculations reveal that loss modulus is also greatly increased by discontinuous reinforcement and enable its value to be estimated. Experiments on storage and loss modulus are reported and show that the calculations underestimate storage modulus and overestimate loss modulus. In both cases the factor of error ∼ 2, and arises because the amplified matrix strain is underestimated and is partly hydrostatic; the hydrostatic strain is non-dissipative and therefore does not contribute to the loss modulus. Discontinuous reinforcement can increase loss modulus as well as storage modulus by more than 100 times, and this should help sound and vibration deadening. An estimate is made of the wide ratio of compliance ÷ breaking strength available with discontinuous but not with continuous reinforcement, which opens up new design latitude for components hitherto reinforced with continuous fibres. © 1975 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",,"RUBBER PRODUCTS; COMPOSITE MATERIALS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016483928

The two adenylate effects shown in the absence of Pi are exhibited at lower adenylate concentrations than the ADP plus Pi effect, and are also less sensitive to phloridzin. These results are discussed in terms of probable adenylate effects on membrane-bound chloroplast coupling factor, CF1. At least two ADP binding sites would differ with respect to adenylate concentration for half maximal binding; pH of optimal binding capacity; phloridzin sensitivity; and functional regulation of electron transport, proton uptake, and energy storage within the membrane as measured by delayed light emission. It remains unclear whether the high affinity ADP binding site is identical to a high affinity ATP binding site on CF1. © 1975.",,"adenosine diphosphate; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; phosphate; chloroplast; coupling factor; in vitro study; membrane; photosynthetic phosphorylation; plant; theoretical study; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Cell Membrane; Chloroplasts; Edetic Acid; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Phlorhizin; Phosphates; Photophosphorylation; Plants; Receptors, Drug; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Thiocyanates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016427520

Their declared desire to advance the state-of-the-art by a factor of two has actually been exceeded. The 108 vehicles now in operation throughout the U.S. and Canada are proving with factual costs-energy consumption, freeway speed, and distance performance records that the energy storage battery powered fleet delivery vehicle is indeed a present day fact! These records forecast actual savings in fuel energy costs that add up to substantial savings when compared accurately with the increased gas and/or diesel fuels consumed by the multistop fleet delivery vehicles now available with 1975 EPA pollution control devices. It is a little recognized fact that the EPA standards call for these devices to function properly with nominal engine idling time while stopped for 10% of the driving cycle, whereas the majority of multistop fleet delivery vehicles operate with nominal engine idling time of 50% or greater during their traffic and work route driving cycle. The impact of the increased first cost for these pollution control devices, plus the increased fuel cost, and much higher service and maintenance costs should cause fleet operators to examine the facts presented herein about the family of electric multistop fleet delivery vehicles available now. The potential for cost and energy savings are real and substantial. They can now make great contributions to combat inflation and conserve fossil fuels by the more efficient use of electric energy that can be stored in the vehicle batteries during off peak generating periods.

Such reserves are: (1) fields too far offshore, or (2) in too great a water depth, or (3) too small an estimated reserve to justify the tremendous capital investment of pipelines, onshore liquefaction, storage, and loading terminals. Another such problem area is the associated gas reserves in offshore oil producing wells that must be either flared or re-injected at a significant cost in money and energy production. Global Marine Development Inc. has performed reserves and site oceanographic analyses along with initial engineering and cost estimating for a floating facility to exploit these marginal offshore gas reserves. By constructing the liquefaction plant and intermediate storage facilities on a vessel that is installed near the gas reserve until depleted, the capital investment is not attached to one field and the risk not so critically dependent upon the reserves analysis. Although the main component of the system is the vessel, systems integration of the process cycle with the marine systems, the mooring, the product transfer system, operational safety systems and procedures have been the focal point of the development effort. The economics of the floating approach to the liquefaction of small or otherwise economically unfeasible LNG projects have been so impressive that the technology has been applied to a large baseload project. The end result has shown that a complete facility can be constructed in an industrialized area, installed at the operational site, and started up in as much as one to two years shorter time period than is possible by any other means, at an enormous saving in initial capital investment. The facility at Brunei, with its 2.6 mile loading system, the construction and cost problems experienced by Sonatrack, and the projected schedules of time and costs by Pertamina for the Indonesian projects as well as the Sarawak project gives impetus for the type of approach mentioned above. ' The Kalingas Project was used as the basis for application and comparison in this discussion because we at Global Marine Development Inc. are currently involved in the design and construction of a floating facility that is planned for installation in the Persian Gulf off the coast of Iran. It will be provided gas from the Kalingas structure. For this reason much of the planning of the principal Kalingas Project and cost data were made available to us in our planning. This, in turn, allowed us to more accurately compare our costs and schedules with an ongoing project. © Copyright 1975.",,"Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost engineering; Cost estimating; Digital storage; Floating liquefied natural gas; Gases; Liquefaction; Natural gasoline plants; Offshore gas fields; Offshore gas wells; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Offshore pipelines; Proven reserves; Reserves to production ratio; Risk assessment; Capital investment; Design and construction; Energy productions; Intermediate storage; Loading terminals; Operational safety; Systems integration; Transfer systems; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059194059

In the point of this disadvantage it could not be applied to minor enterprises and field shops. In order to dissolve these problems, the battery type spot (electrochemical stored energy spot) welding system has been studied. In this system, the storage battery is connected to the primary of welding transformer and comprises the underlying principle that the electrical energy is stored at a low rate during a night, then discharge it at a high rate as required for welding during a day.

Fracture considerations therefore pervade all of man's interests dealing with exploration and production of natural resources, engineering projects under or on the earth's surface, and the prediction, modification, and control of earthquakes. For example, (1) estimates indicate that about 5% of the energy generated in the United States is consumed in fracturing rocks [Lewis, 1966]; (2) in the petroleum industry an understanding of fracture is essential in relation to ‘fracture porosity’ reservoirs, hydraulic fracturing, secondary recovery programs, structural inferences from existing fractures, underground storage of gas, and drilling technology; (3) in certain geothermal projects, fractures serve both as subsurface permeability channels and as surfaces to heat circulating waters; (4) the in situ ‘mining’ of oil shale or of the gasification of coal is primarily a matter of man's ability to fracture the rock mass under controlled conditions; (5) in mining and tunneling operations, fractures influence the stability of the openings as well as the extraction of rock or ore; and (6) recent developments in earthquake research have focused attention on fracture (dilatancy) as the source of a host of premonitory events from which it may someday be possible to predict earthquakes [Nur, 1972; Whitcomb et al., 1973; Scholz et al., 1973]. Accordingly, there is ample mission orientation for even the most basic research designed to gain a better understanding of fracture processes in rock and of the mechanical behavior of rock masses containing fractures.

The quantitative anatomical data required for the analysis have been obtained from X‐radiographs and dissections. It is shown that fluctuations of potential energy and external kinetic energy account for most of the energy cost of hopping; fluctuations of internal kinetic energy are relatively unimportant. Evidence is presented that large savings of energy are effected by elastic storage of energy in the gastrocnemius and plantaris tendons. The elastic mechanism is particularly effective at high speeds and seems to account for the observation of Dawson & Taylor (1973) that oxygen consumption is more or less constant over the whole range of hopping speeds. A mathematical model of hopping is presented. The stresses which occur in hopping are discussed. Force platform records and films have been made of kangaroos and a wallaby hopping. The maximum forces exerted on the ground were about six times body weight. The force exerted on the ground changes direction, throughout the period when the feet are on the ground, so that it is always more or less in line with the centre of mass. Consequently the animal decelerates a little and then accelerates again, during the contact phase. The fluctuations of potential energy which occur in each hop are slightly smaller at high speeds than at low ones. Fluctuations of external kinetic energy increase with speed and account for most of the energy cost of hopping at high speeds. Fluctuations of internal kinetic energy (due to acceleration and deceleration of the limbs) are relatively small. While the feet are on the ground the extensor muscles of the hip do positive work, those of the knee negative work and those of the ankle negative work followed by positive work. The energy cost of hopping is reduced substantially by elastic storage of energy in the Achilles tendon. In the case of a wallaby hopping at moderate speed the calculated saving was 40%. The maximum stresses developed in leg muscles, tendons and the tibia have been calculated and are discussed in relation to the known properties of muscle, tendon and bone. The trunk pitches as the animal hops because the two legs swing forwards and back simultaneously. Appropriate tail movements reduce, but do not eliminate, this effect. A mathematical theory of hopping is presented and used to investigate the merits of different hopping techniques. Dawson & Taylor's (1973) discovery that the rate of oxygen consumption of kangaroos decreases a little, as hopping speed increases, is probably to be explained by the increased role of elastic storage of energy at high speeds.

The three diets were: (a) a standard ration of equal weights of lucerne chaff and pelleted concentrates; (b) a similar ration to (a) plus 7-5 % by weight of lipid (peanut oil and tallow); (c) a greater ration of (a) calculated to be isocaloric for digestible energy with diet (b). At the beginning of the trial a group of 40 lambs (20 rams, 20 wethers) were shorn and five rams and five wethers were selected at random and slaughtered to establish initial body composition. The remaining 30 lambs, 15 rams and 15 wethers aged about 22 weeks and having mean weights of 330 kg (rams) and 312 kg (wethers), were randomly divided within sex into three groups and allocated to the three diets for 92 days. At the end of this period the lambs were again shorn, and then slaughtered and dressed. During the trial, rams gained significantly (P < 0001) more weight than wethers, and lambs on diet (a) gained significantly (P < 001) less weight than those on (b) and (c). Weight gains on the latter two diets were similar. Diet generally had little effect on body composition, although there was a tendency, within sexes, for lambs on diet (b) to have a greater fat content than those on the other diets. Rams had significantly greater carcass weights (P < 001), head percentage (P < 0001) and various m. longissimus dorsi dimensions than wethers, but significantly less fat in all the locations measured, including a lower percentage of chemically extractible fat in the offals and carcasses. Estimations of the energy stored in the wool-free body during the trial indicated that wethers stored significantly more energy in the form of fat than rams (P < 0001), but that rams stored significantly more non-fat energy than wethers (P < 0001). It is concluded that a maximum growth rate exists for the non-fat body, and that it is higher in rams than wethers. Thus the addition of dietary lipid (which increases energy intake with comparatively small increases in weight or volume of feed), is more likely to promote fat deposition in wethers, which have a lower maximum capacity for non-fat storage, than in rams. © 1975, Cambridge University Press.

The last 360 of phase shift has 88 milliradians of bend in a vertical plane and deposits the beam at the injection septum via a Lambertson magnet. Injection is accomplished by launching the beam with several centimeters of radial betatron amplitude in a fast bump provided by a triad of pulsed kicker magnets. Radiation damping reduces the collective amplitude quickly enough to allow injection at a high repetition rate.

Energy conversion by a series of reactions is carried out in the chloroplast, mitochondria, and bacterial membrane systems. Electron transfer agents are spatially arranged in the membrane to vectorially transfer protons, leading to a proton-motive force in the proton electrochemical potential gradient. The proton gradient is hypothesized to be dissipated through a reversible ATPase. The chapter discusses the possible ways for energy storage and exchange that may occur during changes in macromolecular polyelectrolyte conformation. Conformational changes, indicating possible approaches that may suitably worked out; provide some quantitative ways to treat energy conversion in polyelectrolyte systems. The chemical hypothesis attempts to relate electron transfer potential directly to group transfer potential via “high energy” forms of the electron carriers, particularly, the b cytochromes and cytochrome a3 gives a clear discussion of the energetic relationship between the respiratory chain and the ATP synthesizing mechanism of the chemical hypothesis. Polymers can undergo reversible conformational changes in an amorphous or liquid state, or during a transition from the liquid to the crystalline phase. Measuring entropy changes in a complex system can be approached in two ways, one utilizing the temperature dependence of rate constants and the other from knowledge of the statistical probability of polymer configurations. Entropy changes are not the only factor involved in free-energy changes of a polyelectrolyte system interacting with its surroundings.

A double fixation using glutaraldehyde and postfixation in osmic acid was compared with a fixation in glutaraldehyde alone. Because of the lack of contrast obtained in the specimens from the latter fixation, the presence of metal residues within the tissues were readily observable under the electron microscope. The various metal residues found in storage bodies in ovarian tissues from lead‐poisoned quails were analyzed by means of energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectrometrical analysis. Out of a total of eight electron‐dense, metal‐containing inclusions which were analyzed, two contained lead. Other elements found in the inclusions were chlorine, phosphorus, iron and calcium, the latter element not being present in detectable amounts in those inclusions which also contained lead.

Pitot tube error is measured using an alternative optical means of local velocity measurement. Unlike previous research in this field a strict control is kept on the state of degradation of the solutions and Pitot tube error is measured directly whilst the tube is under test. Errors which occurred in total head pressure measurement were found to be negative and in some cases were as high as 40%. Factors which influence the Pitot tube accuracy are identified and a dynamical similarity argument is used to express the error as a function of these. Pitot tube error is attributed to the polymer solutions storing energy viscoelastically at the tube tip. A critical review of explanations previously put forward for Pitot error with reference to the results is included in the discussion. The polymer used was polyox WSR-301.

Much of this work is based on the theories and work of Dr Howard T. Odum at the University of Florida. A theory of energy quality is presented which is an attempt to relate energies of different concentrations in their ability to do work. This theory allows comparison of the systems of man and nature. Another theory is proposed which seeks to describe the ability of a region to compete based on its flows of natural and fossil fuel energies. Economic, natural system, and energy data were compiled for the Miami urban region from 1950-1972. Cross-correlation of this data showed significant levels of correlation between the rate of change of fossil fuel use and the rates of change of population, budget, sales tax, income, building structure, and number of telephones. Calculation of several urban indicators for 1972 showed a fossil fuel energy density of 300 kcal/m2/day in the urbanized area, a per capita energy consumption of 53.8 × 106 kcal/capita/year, a ratio of natural to fossil fuel energies of 0.25, a developed area of 260 miles2 (673.4 km2), and a rate of development of 6.5 miles2 (16.8 km2) per year. An overall model of Miami is presented with flows and storages quantified for 1972. Based on this model a simpler model was simulated on an analog computer. This model consisted of a system of first-order in time, non-linear differential equations which included fossil fuel energy flows, main economic flows, external price functions, building structure, natural energies, and population. This model was simulated for several linearly increasing future price functions and several sets of future energy functions. Natural energies within the region were calculated by determining the land areas associated with various ecosystem types. Estimating the productivities of these systems on a per area basis allowed calculation of total energy flows. The energies associated with winds, tides, waves, and fresh/salt water concentration gradients were also determined. It was found that the ratio of natural to fossil fuel energy changed from 1.77 in 1950 to 0.25 in 1972. © 1975.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13144250646

The silage was either untreated or treated with formaldehyde alone, formaldehyde + formic acid, or formaldehyde + sulphuric acid. After 4 months' storage the six diets were fed to penned Romney wethers for 6 weeks. Mean daily voluntary intakes of digestible organic matter (DOM) in g/kg W0.75were untreated silage 18.2, formaldehyde silage 25.0, formaldehyde + formic acid silage 29.6, formaldehyde + sulphuric acid silage 26.4, early hay 36.2, and late hay 24.2. The generally low intakes are considered to be due to heavy sheep in fat condition Leing used. Organic matter digestibility was unaffected by any of the silage treatments, but early ilay reduced it by 4 percentage units. Apparent nitrogen digestibility was markedly reduced by all three silage treatments and by making hay. The amount of digestible energy (DE) /unit DOM was unaffected hy making either hay or formaldehyde + formic acid silage, but was increased respectively 3.5, 13.5, and 8.5% in untreated, formaldehyde, and formaldehyde + sulphuric acid silage. This resulted in DE intakes being similar for all three treated silages. Untreated and formaldehyde-treated silages had the lowest temperatures after opening, although voluntary intakes on both declined with time. Adding either formic or sulphuric acids to formaldehyde increased stack temperatures on exposure to air but, surprisingly, prevented the decline in intake with time. Wool growth and fibre diameter were lowest for untreated silage, highest for early hay, and intermediate and of similar magnitude for the other treatments. Wool synthesised per unit of DE intake did not differ among the silages, but was higher on hay than on silage diets. © 1975 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11544358566

Seven of the exposures were made at 5.5 MeV using detectors made from both LBL and General Electric Company material. Initial degradation of 60co energy resolution was generally observed after fluences of 3 x 10+9 n/cm2. After fluences of 1010 n/cm2, the detector resolutions were all affected, and replacement would be required in most gamma ray spectrometry; these results are consistent with previous damage studies on germanium detectors. Considerable variability in neutron damage threshold between detectors was observed within this fluence range which must be attributable to a material parameter that is not yet fully determined. This is the major finding in this study. After irradiation, a significant increase in material resistivity was observed as a series resistance in the diodes undepleted region at low biases. The observations were made by capacitance effects and lengthened pulse rise time. Annealing of damage was observed during storage at LN2 temperature after irradiation; resulting, in some cases, in improvement of resolution and in others, further degradation. Drastic resolution degradation was observed on cycling detectors to dry ice temperatures, (200° K) with the loss of the high series resistance and an increase in acceptor concentration. Further cycling to room temperature for periods of hours resulted in improvement of the energy resolution compared with the 200° K value. Nearly complete recovery of initial charge collection and energy resolution was achieved by 100° C anneals for periods of hours indicating the possibility of in situ anneals. No difference was found for the fast neutron damage susceptability between planar high-purity and lithium-drifted germanium detectors.

Anaerobic digestion has been used for many years for sludge stabilization in municipal and domestic sewage treatment systems. The process has been applied in some warm climate countries to produce methane gas as an energy supply; however, the technical and economic feasibility of using anaerobic digestion to produce methane has not been established in cold climate regions. Anaerobic digestion is a complex biological process for which successful operation is dependent upon controlling factors such as the nutrient balance in the feed material, loading rate, retention times, temperature, alkalinity and pH, volatile acid concentration, total solids concentration and the degree of mixing. These factors and their influences are being monitored in a pilot plant in which four digesters are being fed with hog wastes at the University of Manitoba. Digester gas contains from 60 to 70 percent methane and 30 to 40 percent carbon dioxide with small amounts of hydrogen sulfide and traces of additional gases such as hydrogen, ammonia and oxides of nitrogen. Methane is known as a 'permanent gas' because it cannot be liquified by pressure at ordinary temperatures and this property presents a unique storage problem, particularly for use in mobile power units. Procedures for handling, purification and placing the methane into storage must be established for successful production and utilization of the gas on farms. Safety precautions also must be observed during the production and utilization of the gas, since methane is explosive when combined with air in ratios ranging from 5 to 15%.",,"methane; manure; therapy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016780502

In addition to nutrition, other environmental or endogenous factors may also be important, such as slower growth due to altitude or genetically determined slower rates of growth.

Physiol., Med. Sch., Birmingham, United Kingdom","Hall, K., Dept. Physiol., Med. Sch., Birmingham, United Kingdom","Lipids in the uterine endometrium of mice during early pregnancy were investigated by histochemical techniques. Three groups of animals were studied: (1) on days 1-8 inclusive of the first pregnancy, (2) on days 1-9 after mating at the post partum oestrus and suckling seven or eight young from their first pregnancy, and (3) on days 1-6 after delivery of the first litter but with no access to males. Day 1 was that on which a seminal plug appeared in the vagina or (group 3) after birth of a litter during the previous night. In post partum mice, only the areas between the former implantation sites were studied. Epithelial lipids are sparse during the first 24 h. On day 2 and early day 3 in nulliparous mice, and for a longer period in post partum mice, the presence of lipid in epithelium and stroma seems mainly a degenerative phenomenon associated with cell breakdown and consequent tissue disruption. During late day 3 and on day 4 the increase in lipid droplets giving staining reactions characteristic for triglycerides may represent the storage in this form of fatty acids no longer needed for phospholipid synthesis or as energy sources, once the intense mitotic proliferation of these cells dies down. Triglycerides also predominated in the necks of the glands, but in the deeper parts, the sparse droplets often gave staining reactions for acidic lipids. In differentiating decidual cells during day 5 and early day 6 in nulliparous mice, histochemical reactions suggest that fatty acids accumulate. Some of these are probably utilized in synthesis of the increasing amounts of phospholipids which were particularly prominent later on day 6 and during day 7, while others appeared to be temporarily stored during that period as triglycerides. The phased deposition and removal of triglyceride proceeds centrifugally through the decidua and is slightly in advance of glycogen deposition and removal in the same cells; its time course correlated well with that which other workers have described from chemical assay.

Energy storage in the form of water stored in a higher reservoir for later release to a lower reservoir to generate electric power is a practical and proved concept. In areas where stored energy is needed, but where no suitable sites are available for conventional pumped storage with both the upper and lower reservoirs above ground, underground pumped storage can be the answer. The feasibility of using underground caverns for the lower reservior in areas that have suitable rock formations is examined here. Included in this discussion are the size and type of underground configurations that are required and can be developed. The rock characteristics necessary are reviewed, as are the size and depth of the underground caverns that are required to store the water and to house the power plant. Equipment availability and its limitations are also considered. The studies are generally based on a 2000-MW underground pumped-storage project designed for a total head of 3200 ft and the reversible unit plant with two drops of 1600 ft each.

From a series of runs performed with different impact velocities, the effective damping was computed as well as the dynamic hardness. Comparison with a periodic test method proved to be fairly good. In particular the same results on specific losses were obtained by both methods, as long as the impact kinetic energy did not exceed 170 mJ.

The often recommended sodium sulfate decahydrate and its mixtures were shown to have undesirable melting properties, causing a reduction in storage capacity upon repeated cycling. Materials more suitable at present are paraffin waxes for solar heating and paraffin waxes and tetrahydrofuran hydrate for off-peak air conditioning. Sensible heat storage has the economic advantage of not requiring heat transfer surfaces between storage and collection and between storage and delivery. Latent heat storage provides operational advantages of smaller temperature swings and lower, more efficient solar collector temperature, smaller size and lower weight per unit of storage capacity. The optimization of the thermal energy storage subsystem is dependent on the collection and delivery characteristics of the system. Parametric designs for two latent heat materials (sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate and a paraffin wax) and for a sensible heat material (a 1:1 mixture of water and ethylene glycol) were compared as to cost, performance, and space requirements. The conditions of equal cost for latent heat and sensible heat storage systems were determined as functions of latent heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and the temperature swing allowed in the sensible heat storage tank. The comparative designs include the cost of the heat exchanger required for latent heat storage and the operating penalty due to storage temperature swings inherent in sensible heat storage. © 1975.","Coolness storage; Energy storage; Heat of fusion storage; Latent heat storage; Off-peak air conditioning; Phase change materials; Sensible heat storage; Solar heating; Thermal energy storage","HEAT TRANSFER - Liquids; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016601083

The present investigation suggests, for conditions encountered in the UK, that the aspect ratio (i.e. height-to-radius) for least heat losses from bare or fully insulated hot-oil tanks should be approximately 0·4. If the cylindrical walls of the tank are to be insulated, the roof remaining bare, then the optimal aspect ratio should be appropriately greater. However, when designing a tank, the running cost is only one of several considerations-although an increasingly important one as fuel costs inflate-the capital investment in the tank and site also radically affect the choice. The economically most favourable aspect ratio, i.e. that leading to the least total financial expenditure over the lifetime of the tank, is considerably in excess of the optimal aspect ratio corresponding to minimum rate of energy loss.

A set of three differential equations describes the steady states and the time-dependent changes of the metabolite concentrations under blood storage conditions. For a given parameter combination there are in general three stationary points of the system, one of which is unstable. At a low ATP-need the ATP-level is relatively constant for variations in the rate constant of the ATP-consuming processes. Above a critical level of the energy consumption the system breaks down. An important role of the 2.3P2G-bypass of the erythrocytes is its action as an ""energy buffer"", wasting ATP in case of ATP-overproduction and producing ATP in case of underproduction. A parameter combination consistent with the data on the isolated enzymes was found which gives a good agreement of theoretical predictions with the measured metabolite concentrations.

Accordingly, large area (1·27 mm2), high-field AlnSi Schottky barrier junctions surrounded by a p-n junction guard-ring have been fabricated in unpassivated, SiO2 passivated, and Al2O3 passivated configurations. The fabrication procedure is described and data pertaining to forward and reverse characteristics, yield and storage characteristics are presented. The Schottky barrier height is characterized by four independent measurements with excellent agreement between the various measurements. The barrier height is in the 0·710-0·760 V range and the typical ideality factor is ≤1·05. The devices exhibit ideal Schottky barrier behavior at least over the -50-100°C temperature range. The current gain of Schottky barriers with different Al layer thicknesses is measured under static electron bombardment over the 1-30 keV energy range. From these measurements, the average energy required to create a hole-electron pair is determined to be 3·44±0·2 eV. Using the gain-energy characteristic, it is possible to identify an optimum accelerating potential for each target. This optimum accelerating potential is in good agreement with that obtained theoretically from consideration of target losses. No junction instability is observed due to electron irradiation for beam current densities up to 0·314 A/cm2 and target current densities exceeding 1000 A/cm2. Further, no significant device degradation is observed for target dissipated power densities exceeding 50 kW/cm2. Under pulse mode dynamic testing, output pulses of 13·1 A with a measured risetime of 0·72 nsec into the 10 Ω optimum load are obtained. When the output risetime is corrected for beam resetime (∼0·60 nsec), an output/risetime of 13·1 A/0·40 nsec is obtained. This is within a factor of 2 of the theoretical output capability of an optimized target; the difference is due to the capacitance of the guard-ring. The amplifier pulse mode efficiency is 85 per cent. The low pass bandwidth is 875 MHz, and the Pf2 figure is 82 W-GHz2. In addition, small-signal transconductance and power gains of 4·35 ℧ and 40 dB, respectively, are achieved. No output pulse distortion or pulse height deterioration is noted for pulse widths up to 130 nsec having 13·0 A amplitude under prolonged bombardment of our devices. This indicates that if any insulator charging is occurring, it does not result in any deleterious effects on the target performance. © 1975.",,"SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016522043

Such phase shifts are a major source of phase errors in surface-wave devices employing etched grooves or deposited stripes on the substrate surface. An improved equivalent network, in which this stored energy is represented as a simple shunt susceptence, is presented for a Rayleigh wave normally incident on a step discontinuity on the substrate surface. With this network second-order effects observed at the fundamental frequency of a uniform array of shallow grooves can now be predicted. The presence of stored energy also exerts a profound influence on the wideband harmonic response of the array. In particular, a strong response is predicted at even harmonics of a grating the groove width of which is half the grating period, in contradiction with simpler theories. The validity of this prediction is verified by measurements at the second harmonic, with excellent agreement between theory and experiment.

By considering a real-world case of two interconnected reservoirs in the South Island of New Zealand where decisions must be made each month about the quantities of water to release for hydroelectric power generation, the practical problems of applying an optimizing technique are illustrated. The technique used is deterministic dynamic programming coupled with a multivariate stream-flow simulation model. The hydro power generating plants are operated in conjunction with thermal generating plants to provide a specified energy load for each month; the object in operation is to minimize the expected present value of the thermal generating costs; a real-time operating policy which specifies a planned release for each month as a function of the quantities of water stored at the beginning of each month is developed. The study illustrates important advantages of this particular dynamic programming approach over other optimizing techniques; in particular good account is taken of the stochastic nature of the inflows. These occur at four places in the river basin, show considerable seasonal variability, and substantial spatial and temporal intercorrelations.

They combine heat collection with long-term storage and can provide sufficient heat for the entire year. We consider the absorption of radiation as it passes through the water, and we derive equations for the resulting temperature range of the pond during year round operation, taking into account the heat that can be stored in the ground underneath the pond. Assuming a heating demand of 25000 Btu/degree day (Fahrenheit), characteristic of a 2000 ft2 house with fair insulation, and using records of the U.S. Weather Bureau, we carry out detailed calculations for several different locations and climates. We find that solar ponds can supply adequate heating, even in regions near the arctic circle. In midlatitudes the pond should be, roughly speaking, comparable in surface area and volume to the space it is to heat. Under some circumstances, the most economical system will employ a heat pump in conjunction with the solar pond. Cost estimates based on present technology and construction methods indicate that solar ponds may be competitive with conventional heating. © 1975.",,"SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; SOLAR PONDS; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016496038

Examples are cited to illustrate the friction which develops when nations compete severely for limited resources. The focus of this friction as severe economic competition at this point in time intensifies the power of the few who are in a position to control limited resources. Special definitions of national defense and national security are provided to focus on the need for world economic cooperation. A comparison of the relative power of the United States and the balance of the world is made—first, on the basis of petroleum alone and then based on the addition of petroleum‐related fossil fuels, coal, and oil shale, to illustrate the strength that might be achieved through diversification. It is proposed to optimize the value of oil shale desposits by combining their hydrocarbon content and mineral values to make production of oil shale competitive with petroleum. It is suggested that such optimization might make numerous other marginal natural resources competitive with the cheap, convenient sources which have become the subject of international friction. The cost and possible consequences of national energy independence are cited, supporting the need for world cooperation. The environmental problem is bracketed by comparing the burning of coal in the eastern United States with delays in completion of the Alaskan pipeline.

They were larger than normal but otherwise ultra‐structurally normal; they contained increased storage pools of adenine nucleotides and heparin‐neutralizing activity and took up serotonin at an increased rate. They aggregated normally with ADP and collagen but failed to aggregate with bovine factor VIII and Ristocetin. Some change in shape occurred with ADP, and the reduction in adenylate energy change after addition of ADP to platelet‐rich plasma was smaller than normal. Platelet coagulant activities including contact product forming activity, intrinsic factor‐Xa forming activity and platelet factor 3 activity were normal or increased, but collagen‐induced coagulant activity was absent whether tested in washed platelet suspensions or platelet‐rich plasma. Platelet washing experiments showed decreased binding of factors V and VIII to hereditary giant platelets and no detectable factor XI in washed platelet suspensions. It is concluded that (1) the hereditary giant platelets studied lacked a binding mechanism for factors V, VIII and XI; (2) the normal development of collagen‐induced coagulant activity apparently depends upon the binding of factor XI to the platelet membrane; and (3) the defective prothrombin consumption observed in these patients may have resulted from the failure of their platelets to bind factor XI.

These energies are usually of order one electron volt. One consequence of energy storage in both the electric and magnetic field is that the junction can oscillate at a fundamental frequency ω=2eV/hn where n is an integer. The dynamics of these subharmonic oscillations have been studied for a model in which the magnetic and electric energies are represented as being stored in an inductance and a capacitance respectively. The model was studied numerically for various biasing conditions, and the behavior compared to experimental data. A simple analytic approximation was developed that gives physical insight into the mechanism that creates the subharmonic oscillations. By use of an electrical analog model, we demonstrated that these subharmonic oscillations can phase lock with an externally applied signal.

The preferred conceptual design choices include: large, thin-walled solenoids, 1.8 K cooling, TiNb in aluminum composite conductors at 5 tesla, bedrock structural support for both axial and radial forces, and a three-phase Graetz (ac/dc) bridge converter interface to the power grid. Preliminary estimates show that capital costs are given by kW = 40 + 125 (P/1000)-1/3 (t/2)2/3 where Pis the average power in MW and t is the discharge (peaking) time in hours. A typical operating loss is 10∼ 15% of the stored energy. The concept is technically feasible requiring only present day technology.

We report on designs and experiments in one of these areas with 2 to 300 kJ units, and on the analysis and plans for an installation that is to provide 250 MJ of plasma compression energy for the theta-pinch controlled thermonuclear fusion test reactor. We point out those elements of inductive storage that need further development before a theta-pinch fusion reactor can become economically competitive.

Since the solar arrays are the highest cost items in the systems, it is important to know the price level at which they would make the system competitive, so that the development effort can be directed towards this 'cost goal'. This paper outlines the methodology for such cost analyses, and carries them through for 4 typical systems. It is seem that the 'cost goal' depend sensitively on the amount of available solar energy, the price of competitive energy, and on the costs of associated subsystems, such as storage and power conditioning, and on encapsulation and installation. It is seen that a large market is available for a cost goal in the $15 to $45/m2 range. Knowing the cost goals, the economic impacts of potential large scale introduction of photovoltaic solar energy utilization can be analyzed, as done in a few examples. © 1975.",,"SOLAR CELLS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016470662

Calculations of the year-average energy available from wind generators involves a factor which relates the cube of the mean annual wind (A) to the mean of the cubes of the instantaneous wind velocities (B). B A is 2·7. Allowance is made for a number of efficiency factors. The practical equation for electricity obtained after conversion to hydrogen, passage and reconversion to electricity, is: Pelec≈2 × 10-4 v3MW, for a rotor of 100 m in a location where the mean annual wind is v k.p.h. Thus, for v = 30, Pelec {reversed tilde equals} 5 MW per rotor. Below latitude 35, v = 30 is available over a front of about 3000 km on the sea. In many regions of the world, v = 25 (Pelec = 3·1 MW) is available at sea. For the total energy consumption (including those now provided by oil and natural gas) for 106 people, about 2500 rotors located in a wind of 25-30 k.p.h. would suffice. The practicality of wind rotors of 100 m or equivalent radius need proving. Designs are proposed. Electrolysis of seawater evolves chlorine and its reconversion to oxygen is not a difficulty, but an extra cost. Hydrogen transfer up to 4000 km would be economic. Environmental considerations are optimal. The sea is the best location. Undersea storage is preferable. A projected cost of electricity at 1000 miles from the rotor is 8 mils kWh-1. The concept of large sea-borne rotors in high velocity wind belts with long distance hydrogen transmission offers a more readily attainable (and more environmentally acceptable) prospect than atomic or solar, possibilities. © 1975.","Energy sources; Wind belts; Wind energy; Wind energy means; Wind pattern factor; Wind rotors","POWER GENERATION; availability; economics; wind; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016464201

To quantifiably address questions concerning the expected changes in temperature in both the reservoir itself and in its downstream releases a mathematical simulation of water temperature has been carried out on ;the project for existing and modified configurations. Adding to the complexity of the problem is the fact that the dam to be raised is located upstream of two other dams, one large and one small. For this reason it was necessary that temperature behaviour be simulated for the three serial projects with the output from one used as input to the next. Two mathematical models were used. The first, used on the two larger dams, simulates the vertical distribution of temperature, while the second, used on the smaller reservoir and downstream, simulates horizontal temperature gradients. The result of the work was to show that the proposed modification in the dam had measurable impact on the system's temperature behaviour but the maximum change was only about 2SUPC at the downstream-most point. The changes do not appear significant from an environmental point of view. (A)",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016455887

Since in comparison to blood far more of these latter solutions are given intravenously, a thorough knowledge of plasma volume expanders is essential. The first use of such expanders in human patients was by Hogan in 1915. He used colloidal gelatin and noted an improvement in blood pressure of patients in shock. In 1945, Gronwall and Ingelman advocated the use of dextran in shock. The requirements for an acceptable plasma substitute are: a satisfactory colloidal osmotic pressure, constant composition at reasonable cost, a viscosity suitable for intravenous administration, stability in prolonged storage at variable temperatures, and sterilization by autoclaving. Such substances must be either fully excreted or metabolized, and must cause no early or late tissue damage. They must be non-antigenic and pyrogen free. They must cause no change in the blood such as haemolysis, R.B.C, agglutination, increased sedimentation rate and no impairment of haemostasis. The presently available plasma expanders include blood derivatives (plasma, albumin), modified protein (gelatin, oxypolygelatin), polymerized carbohydrates ( dextran ) and plastics ( polyvinyl pyrrolidone-PVP ). All these substances expand plasma volume, decrease haematocrit and plasma proteins, increase sedimentation rate and blood pressure. Dextran, PVP and gelatin do not alter hepatic function. Dextran and gelatin have no deleterious effects on renal function. Features of the clinically used plasma expanders are: 1. Fresh Frozen Plasma Fresh frozen plasma contains all clotting factors except platelets. The risk of the transmission of hepatitis is present as it is with whole blood. 2. Plasma Protein Fractions Plasma protein fractions are free of hepatitis virus, but may cause arteriolar dilatation and hypotension. 3. Serum Albumin Serum albumin is a concentrated blood protein fraction. It is salt poor, stable and does not transmit the virus of hepatitis. Since it has a high oncotic pressure it is necessary to give significant quantities of clear fluids with it. It is expensive, scarce, and dilutes the clotting factors. It is, however, a first choice for emergency treatment of shock. 4. Dextran The dextrans may be of medium or low molecular weight. They are inexpensive and readily available, and do not transmit the virus of hepatitis. In large amounts they cause a coagulation defect and may be antigenic. The main advantage of low molecular weight dextran is that it abolishes red blood cell sludging in the micro-circulation in low flow states. 5. P.V.P. This was developed in Germany in World War II. It is no longer acceptable as an expander because it is stored indefinitely in tissues. Crystalloid Solutions The most commonly administered plasma expanders are the clear (crystaloid) intravenous solutions. These are blood substitutes that temporarily expand plasma volume, supply water, electrolytes and energy substrate for the needs of the fasting or hypovolaemic patient. Lactated Ringer's solution has become widely accepted for fluid replacement because it contains electrolytes in plasma concentrations. However, it is hypo-osmolar and contains no readily available energy substrate. The effects of Ringer's solution with and without dextrose and 5 per cent dextrose in water have been compared during and after operation. Plasma concentrations of electrolytes were little different in patients receiving Ringer's solution or dextrose 5 per cent in water at the rate of 300 ml/hour. Patients receiving 5 per cent dextrose, either in water or in Ringer's solution, gave evidence of greater glucose metabolism and less lipid utilization than did those patients receiving Ringer's Solution alone. © 1975 Canadian Anesthesiologists.",,"albumin; dextran; electrolyte; gelatin; glucose; lactic acid; plasma substitute; povidone; protein; sodium chloride; blood volume; drug comparison; drug therapy; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; gelatin derivative; hemagglutination; hematocrit; hemolysis; hemostasis; intravenous drug administration; plasma; therapy; Blood Proteins; Dextrans; Gelatin; Human; Injections, Intravenous; Isotonic Solutions; Molecular Weight; Osmolar Concentration; Plasma Substitutes; Povidone; Serum Albumin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016434186

It waa through the economic theories of the period that an understanding of the concept of feedback emerged. © 1975 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"STEAM ENGINES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016431524

This technique replaces endogenous metabolic substrates with exogenous substrates alone or together with metabolic inhibitors. Retention of stored norepinephrine was metabolically dependent upon: (1) glycolysis in the presence of glucose and antimycin A or 2,4-dinitrophenool, or anaerobic glycolysis, and (2) respiratory metabolism in the presence of pyruvate. Both pathways are known to supply adenosine triphosphate which was apparently utilized for the active reuptake of a mobile pool of norepinephrine. In the presence of pyruvate, the retention of a more stable pool of norepinephrine was markedly inhibited by the metabolic inhibitors antimycin A and 2,4-dinitrophenol, but slightly inhibited by oligomycin and atractyloside. The spectrum of inhibition suggests a non-mitochondrial (possibly vesicular) site of energy conservation.

Toroid shaped electrodes positioned at known distances detected the presence of slightly charged particles as they moved along an effective travel zone of approximately 13 cm (5 in.) diameter. Particles with charges on the order of 10-10 coulombs induced transient currents in the pico ampere range onto the sensing electrodes. Electrometer amplification and storage oscilloscope recording permitted peak to peak time measurements of successive induction signals from all electrodes in order to determine time displacement data for airborne particles. Using this electrostatic induction method, particle transit times measured experimentally agreed with theoretically calculated times to within 2%. Induction current signal strength was found to increase linearly with particle charge. A 500 V charging potential provided sufficient particle charge throughout the study. Signal strength decreased approximately linearly as the electrode diameter was made larger, and it increased slightly as electrode surface area was increased. The induction principle provides the design basis for instrumentation used for determining aerodynamic drag properties from terminal velocity measurements for agricultural particulates such as fertilizer and seeds and for measuring the net free charge residing on such particulates by a non contact method.The research paper theoretically analyzes the effects which this altered condition of surface energy has upon the evaporation rate from the droplet, and the ability of the spherical liquid mass to structurally maintain a state of hydrodynamic (mechanical) stability. A free-body analysis of an evaporating charged droplet at static equilibrium is developed to determine the critical droplet charge-to-mass ratio which theoretically causes the onset of hydrodynamic instability and subsequent surface rupture.

These factors determine the variability exhibited by different muscles with respect to oxidative rancidity. One such factor which is intimately concerned with the above phenomenon is the level of constituent polyunsaturated fatty acids of the intramuscular lipids. In the case of the intramuscular triglyceride fraction, the level of constituent polyunsaturated fatty acids can be modified by dietary means. An experiment is described in which the effect of different diets on the tendency of minced frozen porcine muscle to undergo oxidation was investigated. The particular diets used varied in energy and protein levels and were typical of the kinds of diets used to improve the growth rates and commercial carcase quality of pigs. The results obtained indicated that the particular diets used had little effect on the fatty acid content of the porcine muscle triglycerides and none on that of the phospholipids. It was in the latter fraction that oxidation was mainly exhibited. The major factor influencing the susceptibility of minced frozen porcine muscle to undergo oxidative rancidity, within the dietary limits of the experiment described, was found to be the ultimate (24 h post mortem) pH level of the muscle concerned.

The discovery of an analogous participation of phosphate in muscle glycolysis connected the metabolic generation of energy-rich phosphate bonds fed into a common transmitter, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), with the production of mechanical energy through the finding that the phosphoryl group of creatine phosphate transferred to ATP could supply the energy for muscle contraction. In this way, a functional applicability of the energy of the phosphate bond was first shown. This observation was soon followed by the recognition that the phosphoanhydride bond of ATP provided the driving force in biosynthetic reactions; in this type of bond, metabolic energy apparently collects before it is transmitted for functional and biosynthetic use. The storage of energy in ATP was first detected in anaerobic energy-yielding reactions but soon was also found in respiratory and photosynthetic energy production. However, the mechanism by which energy derived from metabolites was converted into phosphate-bond energy in the latter processes appeared to differ from that of anaerobic energy transmission. Whereas phosphorylated compounds mediate the latter in homogeneous solutions, aerobic phosphorylation and photophosphorylation in prokaryotes seem to require special submembranous structures; and in eukaryotes, energy conversion is a function of special organelles, the mitochondria and chloroplasts. The evolutionary aspects of the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes are of considerable interest. In conclusion, the relevance of an apparent prokaryotic origin of the energy-transforming organelles in the eukaryotes will be commented on.",,"adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphate; creatine; cytochrome; flavoprotein; fructose phosphate; glyceric acid; myosin subfragment; nucleotide; phosphate; pyridine derivative; pyruvic acid derivative; article; biochemistry; cell membrane potential; electron microscopy; energy metabolism; evolution; fermentation; glycolysis; history; history of medicine; metabolism; mitochondrion; muscle contraction; oxidative phosphorylation; photosynthetic phosphorylation; thermodynamics; ultrastructure; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adenosinetriphosphatase; Biochemistry; Creatine; Cytochromes; Energy Metabolism; Evolution; Fermentation; Flavoproteins; Fructosephosphates; Glyceric Acids; Glycolysis; History of Medicine, 20th Cent.; Membrane Potentials; Microscopy, Electron; Mitochondria; Muscle Contraction; Myosin Subfragments; Nucleotides; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Phosphates; Photophosphorylation; Pyridines; Pyruvates; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016416758

There are two different, partly complementary means of building such a model. One approach is to construct, using empirical physical science methods, an isomorphic model, in which each and every component (variable) of the system is an element in the model. The other approach is to build, using a systems synthesis methodology, a homomorphic model, in which several components of the system are grouped to form a single element in the model. The latter method is adopted in this paper because of its suitability for modelling at the level of the whole soil system. As regards forming the basis of a homorphic model of the whole soil system, existing concepts of soil genesis have limitations: either they are very complex isomorphic models, the implementation of which presents virtually insurmountable problems; or they are homomorphs but too general to be used in their present form. And the concepts make no reference to the functional boundaries of soil system units. Indeed, such a unit has not yet been satisfactorily defined; the nearest to it is the soil catena, which is considered at length in the paper. Some of these problems are resolved by the concept of soil landscape systems which, synoptically, is as follows. A basic functional of the soil system, it is proposed, is a three-dimensional body of soil known as a soil landscape system or a ""valley basin"", that (1) is bounded by the soil surface, valley watershed and weathering front at the base of the soil; (2) forms part of a more extensive valley basin network; and (3) functions as an open system. The flux of solids, colloids and solutes within and across the landscape is shown to be organized within the framework of these soil system units, and is discussed in terms of inputs, outputs and storages of the soil skeleton (clastic sediment) subsystem, the soil plasma subsystem and the soil solution subsystem. The value if the soil landscape system concept as a homomorphic model is stated. Five main advantages are outlined which relate to the five main features of the model: it has clearly and comprehensively defined basic system elements; it has functionally defined, three-dimensional system boundaries; the relationships between elements can be established from empirical hypotheses; there is transport and conservation of matter and energy as in the very successful models of hydrological systems and ecosystems; change of the system through time can be directly studied by computer simulation and not indirectly by statistical extrapolation from empirically derived behaviour patterns. The model, it is hoped, should provide a rational physical basis for simulating soil systems. © 1975.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002597951

The dry matter yield did not vary during the drying period, but the colour intensity of the fruit increased continuously. Early cessation of irrigation accelerated the drying rate and intensified fruit colour, but lowered the total dry matter yield. Removal of seeds, placenta parts and stalk after harvest increased fruit colour intensity but lowered yields. Leaving fruit to dry in the sun before harvest resulted in a considerable saving in transport and storage volume, as well in the amount of energy required otherwise to dry the fruit in the dehydration plant.

The idea has wide appeal because, if practical, it might solve all the problems of atmospheric contamination at once. Unfortunately, hydrogen is expensive, and will remain so. Although hydrogen derived from coal will be cheaper than electrolytic hydrogen, it will be far more economic to convert it to synthetic gas than to distribute it as hydrogen. The transportation and distribution costs of hydrogen would be lower than those for the equivalent amount of electric energy used as residential heat, but not enough lower to pay for the conversion costs of that energy into hydrogen. Costs for electrolytic hydrogen, pipeline distribution, and hydrogen-air fuel cells to generate power at local residences, are too high to compete with the conventional electric power business. Even is costs were favorable, domestic safety questions would require a thorough re-study before hydrogen could be employed for residential use. For automobile use, the functional problems are so formidable as to preclude serious consideration: on-board storage of hydrogen requires at least several times the volume and weight of an equivalent amount of gasoline; safety problems abound in design, operation, garaging, maintenance, and fueling; fuel distribution would have to be either high pressure gas or cryogenic liquid, and only the former is conceivably acceptable. Rather than a current panacea, hydrogen should be viewed as a fearsomely expensive, last-resort sort of fuel to fall back on only when fossil fuel supplies are exhausted. Even then, a portable derivative of hydrogen, such as methanol or ammonia, may be preferred to hydrogen itself.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847805764

If the limiting fragmentation hypothesis continues to be valid at energies above 2*102 GeV and if the scaling hypothesis is applicable above 2*103 GeV, in particular if kaon production continues at the same rate, then it is necessary to assume that the relative flux of heavy nuclei in the primary cosmic ray beam increases somewhat with energy.

Univ., Lausanne, Switzerland","In ten normal male subjects, the influence of amino acid and carbohydrate infusions on the plasma concentrations of glucose, free fatty acids, inorganic phosphate, insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone was studied. The molar insulin:glucagon ratio was calculated. Three different solutions were used: A mixture of 13 amino acids (50 g/l), group I; solution (1) plus sorbitol (50 g/l) plus =xylitol (50 g/l), group II; and solution (1) plus glucose (100 g/l), group III. According to Unger, the relative concentrations of insulin and glucagon control the hepatic glucose balance and the organism's energy requirement. The insulin:glucagon ratio is inversely correlated with increased glucose production of the liver. A high ratio indicates glucose storage and increased protein synthesis, whereas a low one is a sign of increased gluconeogenesis from amino acids. The data are in agreement with the clinical observation that, in parenteral nutrition, amino acids should be given together with carbohydrates to produce an anabolic effect. The insulin:glucagon ratio remained unchanged in group I and showed a rise from 6.4 to 14.8 in group II. In group III, a marked increase in the ratio was observed with a maximum of 46 after 60 min. Thus, in normal subjects, the combination of amino acids and glucose has a stronger effect on glucose storage and protein synthesis than the combination of amino acids and sorbitol and xylitol.

This model allows information, (the smallest unit defined by Δf x Δt = 1/2 and f(o) x t(o) = 1/2 (Barrett), to be transmitted linearly in either a modified or unmodified form through a substructure which functions as a information storage and detection device independent of absolute energy amounts in the physical stimulus. Whittaker's interpolation theory provides the basis for a description of the unit's functioning, a representation which is also basic to information theory.

Extraterrestrial disposal of the total waste constituents and of only the transuranic elements were considered. However, space disposal of the transuranics only is believed to be the most practical scheme, primarily because of the very high space transport cost per unit of weight.

This technology is considered to include the space shuttle and the space tug, advanced vehicles that use existing engineering technology. The safety aspects for space disposal primarily include safety during launch and control of the extraterrestrial destination of the waste constituents. The potential for an abort that could cause a release of radionuclides during any one space launching is modestly high; however, relatively small amounts of waste constituents are associated with each launch; and package integrity is high even in an abort.

The accumulation of both government- and commerically generated wastes is estimated at some 200 million gal of high-level waste, 400 million ft**3 of low-level waste, and 85 million ft**3 of alpha wastes by the year 2000. Cost projections are made for high-level waste management (exclusive of ultimate disposal), for low-level waste burial, and for alpha waste burial. These cost estimates indicate some 7 billion to be committed for waste management by the year 2000. In addition, the cost for ultimate disposal of high-level wastes could exceed 1 billion by the year 2000, depending on the government surcharge for handling these wastes.

This pattern of accumulation and degradation occurred when growth was limited by glucose or a component of yeast extract. These data suggest that the polysaccharide may be serving as a carbon and energy storage compound for sporulation. A somewhat similar pattern of accumulation and degradation of poly β hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) was shown earlier by Kominek and Halvorson to occur in B. cereus. When cells were grown in a medium buffered strongly at pH 7.4 however, very little accumulation of PHB occurred. It was found that polysaccharide accumulates in cells grown in both the strong and weakly buffered media. Perhaps polysaccharide is the major carbon and energy storage compound when cells are grown under conditions preventing significant accumulation of PHB. The lack of polysaccharide accumulation during the exponential phase of growth may be an indication that the needed biosynthetic enzymes are controlled by catabolite repression during growth. The polysaccharide was purified and found to consist of glucose.

Local electric erase is observed only for smectic liquid crystals having a nematic phase or incipient nematic range. Better contrast and a wider range of laser writing speeds are obtained when dopants are added which are soluble in the isotropic phase and insoluble in the smectic phase. Enhanced contrast (higher scattering center density) obtained by adding certain dopants is considered to result from enhanced nucleation in the bulk and stabilization of singularities resulting therefrom by reduction of the associated core and strain energies. © 1974 American Institute of Physics.",,"DATA STORAGE, OPTICAL; DISPLAY DEVICES; CRYSTALS, LIQUID",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016116853

Examined in detail is the case in which a straight wall passes under the edge of a metal film deposited in either tension or compression. Using a simple form for the stress field generated at such a boundary, we show that the domain-wall energy is substantially perturbed in the immediate vicinity of the edge. This gives rise to either an attractive or repulsive interaction, depending on the signs of the stress and of the magnetostriction coefficients. The predictions of the model are examined by observing experimentally the interaction of straight domain walls and bubbles with metal stripes under compression. Comparison of the predicted and observed forces required to pull the domain walls away from the metal edges verifies the model calculations over almost two decades of metal stress. The use of a space layer to reduce the stress in the magnetic material is found to significantly lower the bubble-metallization interaction, thereby permitting improved device performance. © 1974 American Institute of Physics.",,"MAGNETIC MATERIALS; DATA STORAGE, MAGNETIC",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016101977

Metabolic and ionic requirements for the intra‐axonal transport of dopamine β‐hydroxylase (DBH) were investigated in the cat hypogastric nerve‐inferior mesenteric ganglion preparation in vitro by monitoring the enzyme accumulation above a crush, 2‐2·5 cm distal to the ganglion. 2. DBH accumulation in the proximal segment immediately above the crush increased linearly up to 6 h, during incubation in normal Krebs solution at 37° C. The rate of transport of the enzyme was about 4 mm/h. 3. Removal of the ganglion, electrical stimulation or reserpine pretreatment (1–6 days before the experiment) did not modify the rate of DBH accumulation. 4. Anoxia and glucose deprivation, singly, did not affect accumulation of DBH; however, the combined treatment of anoxia plus glucose deprivation, or dinitrophenol plus glucose deprivation, very markedly interfered with accumulation. 5. Removal of sodium or potassium from Krebs solution markedly inhibited the transport of DBH. Preincubation of the nerve in a high‐calcium Krebs solution at 4° C, and then reincubation at 37° C, prevented the enzyme accumulation. 6. N‐ethylmaleimide, ouabain and oligomycin markedly inhibited the transport of DBH. 7. The results suggest that transport of DBH, and therefore of noradrenaline storage vesicles, within the hypogastic nerve is dependent on metabolic energy derived from either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. It is also suggested that the sodium‐potassium‐activated ATPase may play an important role in the intra‐axonal transport of storage vesicles. © 1974 The Physiological Society",,"dopamine beta monooxygenase; glucose; noradrenalin; 2,4 dinitrophenol; adenosine triphosphatase; calcium; dopamine beta monooxygenase; glucose; n ethylmaleimide; oligomycin; ouabain; potassium; reserpine; sodium; adenosine triphosphatase; n ethylmaleimide; oligomycin; ouabain; oxygen; potassium; sodium; axoplasm flow; cat; glycolysis; hypogastric nerve; hypoxia; oxidative phosphorylation; theoretical study; animal; article; culture medium; drug effect; electrostimulation; hypogastric plexus; in vitro study; metabolism; nerve crush; nerve fiber transport; oxygen consumption; metabolism; nerve cell; Adenosinetriphosphatase; Animal; Axonal Transport; Calcium; Cats; Culture Media; Dinitrophenols; Dopamine beta-Hydroxylase; Electric Stimulation; Ethylmaleimide; Glucose; Hypogastric Plexus; In Vitro; Metabolism; Nerve Crush; Oligomycins; Ouabain; Oxygen Consumption; Potassium; Reserpine; Sodium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016140476

The action of photoreceptive pigments was inevitable in the case of electron transfer leading to light energy storage in the reaction products. The primitive tetrapyrrolic pigments formed abiogenically (porphin, chlorin) as well as their more complicated biogenic analogs (chlorophylls) are capable to photosensitize electron transfer in systems, having various degree of molecular complexity. The inorganic photosensitizers (titanim dioxide, zinc oxide, etc.). being excited in near UV are able to perform the same reactions as porphyrins -electron transfer from donor to acceptor molecule (including photoreduction of viologens) or water molecule photooxidation (oxygen liberation), coupled with reduction of ferric compounds and quinones. The inorganic photosensitizers are not used in biological evolution; actually the inorganic ions entered into tetrapyrrolic cycle, forming effective photocatalysts. Inclusion of pigments into primary membranes led to elaborated coupling between pigments and enzymatic systems. The involvement of the excited pigments into the biocatalytic electron transfer chain served as prerequisite of effective function of photosynthetic organisms. © 1974 D.

Activation comprises the turning-on of various genes with subsequent synthesis of transfer-, ribosomal and messenger RNAs and their transport into the cytoplasm. The immediate consequence of all these primary reactions is a vigorous synthesis of various enzymes and structural proteins which enable the cell to greatly enhanced metabolic activities. Thus, degradation of storage polymers and the procession of the resulting products through glycolysis, the pentose phosphate shunt and the shikimateprephenate-pathway and cellulose biosynthesis occur. Deinhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle opens the flow of metabolites into fatty acid, phospholipid and steroid biosynthesis, simultaneously providing the respiratory chain with electrons. In spite of functional modifications within the electron transport chain, the enhanced respiration of tissue slices serves as an energy source for the various energy-dependent reactions of the cell such as syntheses and the uptake of solutes. All of these activities accompany a concomitant dedifferentiation process and ultimately lead to renewed redifferentiation of the tissue slice cell. © 1975 The New York Botanical Garden.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000529482

Three basic technological problems in the production of a dense and clean neutron gas were investigated experimentally: 1. (a) measurement of the neutron field in the neutron-gas cavity (flux- and current-densities, anisotropy), 2. (b) attainment of a low residual gas density in the neutron-gas cavity in the presence of strong radiation fields, and 3. (c) shielding of the measuring device from the primary reactor radiation. In our experiments we use a dense neutron gas in ultra-high vacuum to determine the electron-neutrino angular-correlation coefficient a by a precision measurement of the recoil-proton energy spectrum in free-neutron decay (0-751 eV). A neutron density of 1.42 × 107 neutrons/cm3 was achieved in a cavity with residual gas density of &lt;1 × 103 molecules/cm3 giving a flux of 88 protons/s into the energy spectrometer. Aside from the technological problems mentioned, low magnetic and electric fields in the beam tube are also necessary: disturbing fields of less than 1 mV/cm and 1 mOe were achieved. Preliminary results are discussed. Based on the experience obtained from these experimental studies we discuss proposals for n-n scattering and for scattering of charged particles from a neutron-gas target. The feasibility of n-n experiments with existing reactors, as well as the installation of neutron targets in storage rings is discussed. In connection with a 20 A proton beam n-p scattering with luminosity up to 1031/cm2 s can be performed by means of neutron targets produced from a medium-size research reactor. © 1974.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249729107

Sr2+ and Mn2+ are also accumulated; Mg2+ is not. A strongly hypertonic medium (383 mosM), Mg2+, and phosphate are required for maximal Ca2+ uptake. Ca2+ uptake takes precedence over oxidative phosphorylation of ADP for respiratory energy. Once Ca+ is accumulated by the crab mitochondria, it is stable and only very slowly released, even by uncoupling agents. ATP hydrolysis also supports Ca2+ uptake. Respiration-inhibited crab hepatopancreas mitochondria show both high-affinity and low-affinity Ca2+-binding sites, which are inactive in the presence of uncoupling agents. Crab hepatopancreas mitochondria have an enormous capacity for accumulation of Ca2+, up to 5,500 ng-atoms Ca2+ per mg protein, with an equivalent amount of phosphate. Freshly isolated mitochondria contain very large amounts of Ca2+, Mg2+, phosphate, K+, and Na+; their high Ca2+ content is a reflection of the vary large amount of extra-mitochondrial Ca2+ in the whole tissue. Electron microscopy of crab mitochondria loaded with Ca2+ and phosphate showed large electron-dense deposits, presumably of precipitated calcium phosphate. They consisted of bundles of needle-like crystals, whereas Ca2+-loaded rat liver mitochondria show only amorphous deposits of calcium phosphate under similar conditions. The very pronounced capacity of crab hepatopancreas mitochondria for transport of Ca2+ appears to be adapted to a role in the storage and release of Ca2+ during the molting cycle of this crustacean. © 1974, Rockefeller University Press., All rights reserved.",,"adenosine diphosphate; calcium; magnesium; manganese; phosphoric acid; potassium; sodium; strontium; animal; breathing; crab; electron microscopy; hepatopancreas; ion transport; mitochondrion; pancreas; theoretical study; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animal; Antimycin A; Brachyura; Calcium; Calcium Phosphates; Electron Transport; Hydrogen; Liver; Magnesium; Microscopy, Electron; Mitochondria; Mitochondria, Liver; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxygen Consumption; Pancreas; Phosphates; Uncoupling Agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016381419

The minimum state was preserved for more than one year without further change when crystals of enzymes were suspended in buffer at 0°C. At any time during cold storage, the maximum state of specific activity could be regained by dissolving the crystals in buffer containing NaCl and heating the solution at temperatures up to 50°C. Maximum activity was attained by heating at 50°C for 20 min whereas more than 100 hr was required at 25°C.An equilibrium was demonstrated between maximally active and minimally active enzyme molecules. The equilibrium constant was a function of the storage temperatures between 0° and 25°C. The molar enthalpy, ΔH, separating maximally active from minimally active enzyme molecules was 3.75±0.1 kcal/mole, an energy difference consistent with previous findings that the change in specific activity did not result from dissociation of subunits or depolymerization of aggregates.The effect of cold storage of Nicotiana enzyme would seem to offer a molecular basis for explaining the effect of cold temperatures on photosynthetic CO2 fixation by winter wheat leaves which was shown by Sawada and Miyachi (5) to produce an accumulation of ribulose 1-5 diphosphate and diversion of the normal path of photosynthetic CO2 fixation away from phosphoglyceric acid to the appearance of fixed carbon in serine and glycine by the glycolate path. © 1974 Oxford University Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957183812

The blood-gas analysis was performed continuously, using a mass spectrometer to measure dissolved argon, and, periodically, using a gas chromatograph to quantify all argon ingested, including emboli. To quantify the amount of argon lost through the pulmonary circulation, monitoring took place in the right atrium and the aorta. Experimental results show that the amount of argon absorbed at the incision site and transported through the bloodstream may increase the dissolved argon concentration in the right atrium by as much as 150%. The results also indicate that argon may be present as emboli in the bloodstream, but that argon storage in the tissues is insignificant. The argon concentration in the aorta does not noticeably increase; hence the excess argon is exhaled within one circulation through the pulmonary circuit. These observations were substantiated by the use of an ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter to check for the presence of gas emboli at various locations. © 1974 International Federation for Medical & Biological Engineering.","argon; gas transport; Plasma scalpel; surgical instrumentation","argon; blood; blood gas; gas absorption; gas embolism; scalpel; therapy; Animal; Argon; Dogs; Embolism, Air; Energy Transfer; Hepatectomy; Surgical Instruments; Surgical Procedures, Operative",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015962918

Solutions in the form of ground transportation are expensive in terms of land utilization, high development costs, their adverse effect on the environment and ecology, and are 20-30 years in the future. STOL offers a solution, but the high cost of land for downtown STOLports has precluded implementation. The STOL amphibian provides a solution which uses existing waterways situated downtown in every major city. It will relieve ground congestion and alleviate saturated airports. Studies show that such a system meets the ten basic requirements established by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and that it contributes significantly to a reduction in the energy consumed in travel to and from the airports. In terms of facilities, land requirements for the terminal are just 16% of a conventional STOLport. A ramp of 10:1 slope is required, along with appropriate patrol and crash boats. Fuel storage would be in the form of moored barges. Amphibian STOL service generates unique problems: these include freezing of waters in northern climes, floating debris, ground fog on water, and sharing of ""runway"" with marine pleasure boat traffic. Solutions to such problems are at hand, in the form of operational technique or facilities, which are neither costly nor time-consuming to implement.

The results obtained were discussed in the light of available reports in this regard. Archesporium and sporogenous tissues are characterized by rich RNA content. RNA quantity is reduced very much in PMCs and the meiotic derivatives. Young anther wall layers, as they differentiate centripetally, show rich RNA content which is reduced as they grow older, at the periphery of the anther locule. Tapetum since its inception is rich in RNA and maintains this quantity until it disintegrates. It is so even in the tapetal cells differentiated from the connective by dedifferentiation. DNA concentration in the early sporogenous tissue is high, resembling primordial tissues surrounding it. In successive growth phases, DNA quantity is reduced to a faint level in the tissue, but, however, increases in PMCs prior to meiosis. The tapetum remains rich in DNA. The cytoplasm of sporogenous tissue shows faint PAS-positive tinge and at no stage starch was recorded in this, PMCs and haploid spores, but tapetum contains PAS-positive grains until meiosis is over. PAS-positive additional wall is formed around PMCs which persists until the completion of meiosis. Anther wall layers are rich in starch storage. Rich starch storage in endothecium is of specific importance, as it contributes to the differentiation of endothecial thickenings in the mature anther. The insoluble polysaccharides occur in anther tissues in the form of additional PAS-positive thickening around PMCs-a “molecular filter” (Heslop-Harrison, 1964), endothecial thickenings and starch, a primary source of energy. Therefore, they greatly contribute to the histochemical differentiation of anther tissues. © 1974, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

At large strain amplitudes, the dynamic viscoelastic properties were measured by means of a cone-plate rheometer in the angular frequency range 0.135-5.39 sec-1, in the temperature range 90-50°C. Hysteresis loops for this material at a fixed frequency change with temperature. The hysteresis loops for the cholesteric state are elliptical, which is typical linear viscoelastic response, but for the smectic state, they are very much distorted. It has been pointed out that the dynamic behavior of liquid crystals is very strongly affected by their mechanical histories. And even cholesteric liquid crystals show liquid-like flow behavior after many cycles of sinusoidal strain. Although such rheotropic phenomena are very complicated ones, preliminary studies indicate that they are more evident in the cholesteric state than in the smectic state. Data were compared after 10 cycles of sinusoidal strain at a frequency of 0.27 sec-1. The dissipation energy ED for the cholesteric state increases with frequency in a somewhat different way from that for the smectic state. For the smectic state ED0, the extrapolated value of ED at zero frequency, decreases with increasing temperature. © 1974, The Society of Rheology, Japan.

Fluorescent lights, emitting light of lower wavelengths, were most detrimental to color, in comparison to incandescent lights. Upon prolonged storage large bacterial numbers on the surface created a reducing environment and caused the conversion of surface MetMb to reduced Mb, which was responsible for the purple color that developed. Gel electrophoresis indicated that no significant alterations occurred in the structure of myoglobin or hemoglobin (color pigments) upon storage at 5°C for as long as 18 days. Color instability of meat stored under soft white fluorescent light is almost entirely due to the effect of the light, whereas color instability when stored under incandescent light is due to a combination of light energy and bacterial growth.

The details of the simulation of turbulent plane Poiseuille flow are given as an example. Plane Poiseuille flow was chosen because it is a useful model for many applications, and has available reliable and extensive measurements. All nine of the components of the spectral matrix are included, from actual measurements, along with incompressibility, a sheared mean flow, and measured boundary‐layer structure of the turbulence. The results appear to be realistic, and the statistical structure imposed is adequate for a variety of turbulence studies of three‐dimensional flows, in particular turbulent dispersion. Compared with finite‐difference methods for solving the dynamic flow equations, with comparable resolution, the method presented here requires some two orders of magnitude less storage, and some four orders of magnitude less computer time.

The spat were from spatfalls in January, March and June. For the first few months after settlement the neutral lipid (triglyceride) content was greater than the glycogen content. However, in three-to five-month-old spat the glycogen content became greater than that of neutral lipid. In spat settled in June, during the natural spawning season, glycogen increased from 6 % of the dry flesh weight, four days after settlement, to 11 %, in the Winter. Over the same period of time neutral lipid decreased from 17 to 8 % of the dry flesh weight. The changeover from lipid to glycogen storage occurred in November. The winter glycogen percentage in the spat was similar to that in young adults. In the summer the glycogen in young adults increased to a maximum of 29 % of the dry flesh weight (in June), declined during the spawning season but increased again in the autumn. The changeover occurred at a similar time in spat growing under natural conditions in the Menai Strait and under artificial conditions in flow trays. It also occurred at the same time in fast and slow growing spat. The changeover was not associated with sexual maturation but may be related to the different way of life of larvae and adults. Lipid has more advantages as an energy reserve for the free swimming larvae but glycogen reserves are more suited to the sessile, intertidal adults. © 1974, Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.

So queried Donald Kerst, inventor of the betatron, in speaking recently about the current generation of electron accelerators. Indeed, in the past ten years, many synchrotrons and storage rings have been very successfully used as light bulbsto illumine the electronic and optical properties of gases, liquids and solids. Why have researchers gone to the trouble and expense of using synchrotron radiation from these facilities rather than staying at home with discharge lamps and xray tubes? Because the synchrotron radiation has special characteristics that enable investigations to be done that would otherwise be impossible. It produces a highly collimated, continuous spectrum, which includes wavelengths not available from other sources, and it provides a narrow spectral slice of high intensity through monochromatization. These characteristics are obviously desirable for experiments that demand high resolution in space and in energy simultaneously.

A simple isothermal test is recommended to check the validity of experimentally obtained activation energies and Arrhenius frequency factors.

These programs were at that time implemented on a KDF9 computer at the Culham Laboratory. Since then the programs have been rewritten in modified form for the IBM 370/165 machine at Harwell and used to search (both in batch mode and on-line) the text of material supplied by the Council of Europe. The present paper describes current progress with this work. The Agreements, Conventions and Protocols concluded between the Member States of the Council of Europe are a largely self-contained set of documents admirably suited for a small-scale full-text retrieval system. They cover a wide range of subject matter including economic, social, cultural, scientific, legal and administrative topics. The best known and the most important of the Conventions is that concerned with the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. A feature of particular interest is that English and French are the official languages of the organisation and thus the documents are available in both these languages. The total size of the text is some 200,000 words in each language. For searching purposes the computer stores both the text itself and an inverted file to the text which gives the address (in terms of document, sentence and position in the sentence) of each word. The QUEST search language provides facilities for the enquirer to interrogate the text using logical and positional operators. These operators use the address file to determine which documents satisfy the search criterion formulated by the user. This makes possible a wide variety of searching techniques. The QUEST language includes a special facility which enables an enquirer to formulate at the console, and to store for his use, what are termed ""macro"" operators and ""macro"" words. For example, one commonly used ""macro"" searches text for the definition of a word or phrase, another looks for dates contained in the text. Once a macro is defined it may be used in the formulation of other operators or words. This feature of the language offers the user the opportunity of building up his own library of searching algorithms, as simple or as complex as he wishes, which are personal to him. The paper describes the main features of the computer programs as implemented on the IBM 370/165 at Harwell, and includes results of typical search enquiries. © 1974.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49549151633

The total cross section in this model rises like lns near the single-fireball threshold, changes to a ln(lns) behavior until it reaches a maximum at an extremely high energy, and eventually falls to zero. The magnitude of the possible rise is proportional to the triple-Pomeron coupling. For the single-particle inclusive cross section in the pionization region, the contribution from the term proportional to a Pomeron-Reggeon-Reggeon coupling is shown to be as important as the term proportional to the triple-Pomeron coupling. The contribution from the Pomeron-Reggeon-Reggeon term is estimated by extrapolating the required couplings from the scattering data in the intermediate energy region, and it contributes to a rise of about 16 mb. The rise of the inclusive cross section due to the triple-Pomeron term is about 7 mb when the rise of the total cross section is assumed to be 4 mb at CERN Intersecting Storage Rings energy.

When the external concentration was 0.2 mM Cl- the level in the cells was 2.8 mM Cl- and under these conditions the flux across the cell surface was in the region of 10-13equiv Cl-·sec-1·cm-2. It is suggested that this Cl- influx is active and operates against an electrochemical potential gradient estimated to be 117 mV or 2.68 kcal/mole. The uptake of 36Cl was inhibited by low temperatures and there was a net loss of Cl- from the cells with the level decreasing towards the equilibrium value as estimated from K+ distribution. Although the active influx of Cl- was often stimulated by light this was not always the case. Dark storage treatment and regulation of the chlorophyll a/phycocyanin ratios as well as total pigment content of the cells did not clarify the conditions which brought about light stimulation. Moreover, the metabolic inhibitors CCCP and CMU and also the use of anaerobic conditions did not clearly indicate the relationship between the influx mechanism and light-dark metabolism and no firm conclusions could be made about the nature of the energy source. The variation in the degree of light stimulation probably reflects the fact that in this procaryotic organism the photosynthetic and respiratory units are located on the same membrane systems and are in very close proximity to the probable site of the Cl- pump, the plasmalemma. © 1974 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250420173

The model consists of differential equations. One, in the Pearl-Verhulst idiom, specifies organisms which can serve only as food resources for consumers of higher trophic status. A ‘storage’ equation describes ingestion and assimilation of food by a consumer. Another equation derived with the storage equation describes growth and attrition (i.e., metabolic and mortality costs) in terms of energy. Further, consumers may prey upon each other in addition to the resources and the equations are shown to be adequate for describing food webs. The model is essentially one of energy flow and deals with biomass, instead of numerical, dynamics. Coded in a computer language (PL/I), the model simulates competition and clarifies aspects of yield and harvest strategies in systems of interacting populations. The model is illustrated with hypothetical populations which have variable turnover rates and the Lake-Trout-Burbot system in Lake Opeongo, Ontario. © 1974 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749960148

We studied the inclusive reaction p+p→x + anything, where x was a π+, K+, or proton. The momenta of the two colliding beams varied from 15.3 to 26.5 GeVc. This was equivalent to a single beam of 500 to 1500 GeVc hitting a target. We measured the dependence of Ed3σdP3 on the transverse and longitudinal momenta of the outgoing particles, P and P. We detected these particles with a spectrometer containing magnets and scintillation and Cerenkov counters. The first two magnets steered particles with the correct P and P down the axis of the spectrometer. The third magnet deflected the particles vertically for momentum analysis. A coincidence of the five scintillation counters indicated an event and the erenkov counters tagged it as a pion, kaon, or proton. The luminosity was measured by the Van der Meer method. We found that when Ed3σdP3 was plotted against X=PPmax, it was energy-independent from 12 to 1500 GeV, especially for π+ data. This supports a type of scaling suggested by Feynman and Yang et al. At small X, the pion cross section has a flat maximum, while the proton cross section decreases slightly. When plotted against P2, the pion and proton cross sections both behave as at lower energies: ∼exp(-4.0P2). The pion cross section has a distinct forward peak exp(-10P2) which is absent in the proton case. The K+π+ ratio is about 10%, with rather poor statistics. © 1974 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30944431843

This is accomplished by the mobilization of the most expendable and efficient form of energy storage, fat. Such a response, accompanied by the progressive adaptation of the central nervous system, as well as the rest of the body, to consume the products of fat so mobilized, permits the conservation of vital protein stores. The mechanisms of such adaptations are incompletely understood, partly because the study of metabolism of individual tissues is restricted in man. Hence, animal models for the fasting adaptation have been sought. The lean mouse has insufficient fat stores to permit prolonged survival. The obob mouse, by contrast, has abundant fat stores and is able to both mobilize fat and conserve protein. Many aspects of the response of such obese mice are analogous to those of man, though the precise mechanism, whereby curtailment of protein mobilization occurs, may be different. Whether the intimate mechanism is identical or not, the ability of this strain of mouse to adapt renders it a useful model for the study of metabolism in prolonged fasting.

The implantable driving unit consists of a motor-driven centrifugal pump and a hydraulic energy storage. The centrifugal pump is operated periodically. During the working phase the pump conveys the driving fluid from the storage to the blood pump. At the same time a spring in the storage is put under tension. During the suction phase the centrifugal pump remains inactive. The fluid is sucked out of the blood pump into the hydraulic storage by the power of the spring. For energy transmission through the intact skin („Transcutor“) two different types of transformers are described. For technical reasons, and to avoid possible physiological stimulation a transmission frequency of 20 kHz to 50 kHz is selected. The energy on the primary side is provided by an impulse generator with a push-pull amplifier. The driving unit is operated either at a preset frequency or triggered by ECG-signal with preset phase delay. The driving system described was developed to test the components in animal experiments and is suitable for taking over partially the work of the heart.

Based on the computed thermal performance, cost estimates are made which show variations in annual cost as functions of collector area and costs of collector and fuel. © 1974.",,"HEATING - Solar; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; AIR CONDITIONING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016341834

In order to reinvestigate the classical concept of specific dynamic action of food, the thermic effect of ingested glucose (50 g) or essential amino acids (50 g) or both was measured in seven healthy male subjects dressed in shorts, by using both direct and indirect calorimetry simultaneously. Experiments were performed under conditions of thermal comfort at 28°. 2. Energy ‘balance’ (heat production minus heat losses) was negative during the control period (mean heat deficit: −16.0 ± 0.8 kJ/m2 per h. 3. Metabolic rate increased 13.6 ± 1.8% after the glucose load, 17.2 ± 1.4% after amino acids, and 17.3 ± 2.9% after both glucose and amino acids: thus there was no additive thermic effect when both nutrients were given together. 4. In contrast to the metabolic rate, heat losses were not significantly altered after nutrient ingestion; consequently, the energy ‘balance’ became rapidly positive. 5.

The mechanism of epimerization involves formation of a carbanion stabilized by resonance with the enolate hybrid. Both hydrolysis and epimerization follow pseudo‐first‐order kinetics, and the appropriate rate constants and energies of activation were calculated. Epimerization was found to occur to a greater extent than previously assumed and must be considered as a major pathway of degradation and inactivation of pilocarpine. The rate of hydroxide‐ion‐catalyzed epimerization increases more rapidly with temperature than does the rate of hydrolysis, a fact that should be considered if ophthalmic solutions of pilocarpine are sterilized by heat.

These results indicate that the great bulk of 32P lethalities in this phage at - 196°C are due to DSB's resulting from nuclear recoil.

One subject was further studied during the same kind of walking and bicycling on the treadmill, and during work consisting in lowering and lifting the body by flexing and extending the legs from a standing or sitting position at varying frequencies, with or without rebound in the deepest position. Workpower (W kcal/min), and the corresponding steady state metabolic rate (E kcal/min, Douglas bag method) were measured. Apparent efficiency (N) was calculated as Δẁ/ΔÈ× 100 %. During load running N was 53.8, 37.6 and 41.2 %, respectively, in the 3 subjects.

These variations in N % were explained in accordance with the possibilities for re‐using the energy, absorbed and stored in the muscles as elastic energy during a phase of negative exercise, in a subsequent phase of positive exercise.

The jumps were performed 1) from a semi‐squatting position, 2) after a natural counter‐movement from a standing position, or 3) in continuation of jumps down from heights of 0.23, 0.40, or 0.69 m. The heights of the jumps were calculated from the registered flight times. The maximum energy level, Eneg, of the jumpers prior to the upward movement in the jump, was considered to be zero in condition 1. In condition 2 it was calculated from the force‐time record of the force‐platform; and in condition 3 it was calculated from the height of the downward jump and the weight of the subject. The maximum energy level after take‐off, Ep0s, was calculated from the height of the jump and the jumper's weight. It was found that the height of the jump and Epos increased with increasing amounts of Eneg, up to a certain level (jumping down from 0.40 m).

Water temperatures in separate exposure were 18, 26, and 33°C. At each water temperature the subjects rested and swam at water velocities of 0.50, 0.75, and 0.95 m.s-1, which were designed to produce around 40, 70, and 100% of maximal aerobic power. Measurements were made of esophageal temperature [T(es)], four skin temperatures, water temperature, heat flow from five local skin surfaces (Hatfield Turner discs), and oxygen uptake (VO2). Calculations were made of mean area weighted skin temperature [T(s)] and heat flow, metabolic rate, and heat storage. Internal body temperature changes after 20 min of swimming were related to water temperature, swimming intensity and body composition. VO2 was proportional to swimming speed during submaximal efforts in any water temperature, but the increase in VO2 per increment in swimming speed became greater as the swimmer approached his maximal effort. VO2 was also greater in 18°C than in 26°C water at any submaximal swimming speed and likewise greater in 26°C than in 33°C water. Increased cost of swimming in cold water was largely attributed to shivering. The convective heat transfer coefficient was calculated from heat flow and skin and water temperature data and was found to be 230 W.m-2.°C-1 at rest in still water, 460 W.m-2.°C-1 at rest in moving water, and 580 W.m-2.°C-1 while swimming, regardless of swimming speed. Core-to-skin conductances were primarily related to internal temperature, although there appeared to be a minor effect of T(s) modifying this relation.",,"body temperature; energy transfer; exercise; heat transfer; normal human; oxygen consumption; sport; swimming; theoretical study; thermoregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016167973

A new implantable storage telemetry transducer is presented which both detects and stores the radiated energy from the radionuclide disintegrations.

As the 32P uptake is dependent on the metabolism of the tumor through the day, the measurements had to be performed on unrestrained rats. The method is based on 2 types of measuring equipment: 2 thermoluminescent dosimeters (CaSO4:Dy), one for the tumor and one for the normal tissue, are fixed in a polyethylene catheter, which is introduced through an implanted catheter (total weight: 1.2 g). The dosimeters can be replaced at will. Phantom measurements show an uncertainty of ±2%; an implanted radiotelemetric temperature transmitter (±0.05°C; weight: 4.5 g) measures continuously the circadian temperature rhythm, which expresses the physiological condition of the animal.

Light absorbancy changes of human platelet concentrates exposed to hypotonic shock were measured in a spectrophotometer: a sudden drop of light absorbancy was followed by a reversal of light absorbancy towards normal (reversal reaction). It was confirmed that the reversal reaction is a complex phenomenon dependent on the integrity of biochemical and enzymatic functions of the platelets. It was suppressed by glycolytic inhibitors and by SH‐blocking agents. Ouabain had no immediate effect, but with prolonged incubation it depressed the reaction. Suspension of the platelets in a protein‐free medium caused a rapid loss of the reversal reaction. Disappearance of the marginal bundle of microtubules by exposure to colchicine did not change the reaction leading to the hypothesis that microfibrils rather than the microtubules may have been responsible for the reversal reaction. The conclusion was derived that the reversal reaction is due to cell volume contraction for which integrity of the platelet contractile protein and energy availability are essential. Platelet storage at 4 C or at 22 C caused a progressive depression of the reversal reaction which was more severe in platelets preserved at 4 C than in those preserved at 22 C, and paralleled the loss of the platelet capacity to survive in vivo. Cryo‐protective agents (DMSO, DMAC and glycerol) partially inhibited the reversal reaction. Freezing with these agents caused a more severe depression of the reaction. The least depression was observed with 5 per cent DMSO. The results demonstrated that the reversal reaction is a valid and accurate in vitro indicator of in vivo platelet viability when the results to be compared are limited to a single method of storage. Usefulness of the reversal reaction is reduced when results obtained with different methods of storage are compared. 1974 AABB",,"4 chloromercuribenzoic acid; chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid; colchicine; dimethyl sulfoxide; dithiothreitol; fluoride sodium; glucose; glycerol; human serum albumin; iodoacetic acid; mersalyl; n ethylmaleimide; n,n dimethylacetamide; ouabain; potassium cyanide; sodium cyanide; sucrose; cryoprotection; glycolysis; normal human; osmotic pressure; osmotic shock; theoretical study; thrombocyte; thrombocyte lifespan; Blood Platelets; Blood Preservation; Cell Survival; Colchicine; Cryoprotective Agents; Female; Human; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hypotonic Solutions; Male; Ouabain; Sulfhydryl Reagents; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016146829

The regulated fuel cycle includes uranium milling, UF6 conversion, fuel fabrication, chemical reprocessing of spent reactor fuel, transportation of nuclear materials, and waste disposal. Management of radioactive waste generated in the nuclear fuel cycle is of particular interest now. A number of policy decisions must be made in the near future and then implemented as regulatory requirements. These decisions must receive public acceptance for safety and protection of environmental values. The main issues pertain to management of high level waste, management of plutonium bearing waste (including the fuel cladding hulls from reprocessed fuel), stabilization and long term control of mill tailings, and the application of the 'as low as practicable' concept of fuel cycle effluents in light of the current status of technology.

The name of the program is SIMSHAC, an acronym for SImulation Model for Solar-Heated-And-Cooled buildings. To use the design program, one has merely to specify the components (that is, each subsystem; for example, collectors, storage units, splitting and mixing valves, house heating and cooling loads, auxiliary heating, auxiliary cooling, heat exchanger, etc.), and the manner in which they are connected and all initial conditions. Program SIMSHAC then writes the program for the specific system to be analyzed. Each subsystem is described by a set of time-dependent differential equations or, possibly, algebraic equations. System state variables include tempera ture, mass flow rate, and enthalpy. The model can handle three types of incident solar radiation data models. These are (1) deterministic (e.g., an algebraic-equation sun model), (2) random simulation (e.g., a model based upon cloud-cover statistics), and (3) actual tabulated input information based upon collected solar data for a specific site. The model has been used for the analysis of five different types of buildings in five locations within the United States. The types include single-family residences, small businesses, three-story apartments, schools, and mobile homes. The locations considered are Atlanta, Georgia; Madison, Wisconsin; Wilmington, Delaware; Mobile, Alabama; and Santa Maria, California. The program has also been used to simulate the solar- heated-and-cooled experimental laboratory presently being built by the National Science Foundation on the campus at Colorado State University. © 1974, Sage Publications.

The prospect of various applications of powerful electron beams for active diagnostics of upper layers of atmosphere, radiation belts and the earth's magnetic field is also reviewed. The proposed development of powerful impulsive devices is dictated by limitations of energy resources in spacecraft together with a need to get a good signal-to-noise ratio for reliable data recording. Compact devices which directly transform electric energy of a low-voltage source (solar batteries, chemical elements, nuclear reactor, etc.), into the energy of a megavolt charge particle beam of high impulsive power appear as reliable means for satisfying these requirements. In this paper, the basic practical schemes of energy transformation procedures are considered and the optimal operation parameters of high-voltage storage and transformer systems are discussed. Proper application of combined high-voltage insulation techniques result in the development of experimental models of heavy-current electron beam accelerators capable of generating beams of 300-500 kV, 3-5 kA, with a pulse duration of 15 × 10-9 sec at a frequency of 10 Hz.

The increased popularity of both steam and hot water generation by electricity is readily apparent. The advantages of this type of heat generation lend themselves to many current applications in the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning field. Sizes of boilers have been increasing through the years, with no apparent end in sight due to the accelerated development of the electrode boiler, which will be covered in detail in the second part of the paper. As compared to the resistance type of boiler, this latter design permits economical projection into much larger boiler sizes. Electric boiler installation is relatively simple since there is no concern with chimneys or fuel storage. Often the boiler room can be eliminated and the mechanical equipment room serve as the required space. Electric boiler operation can be automated to the point where an operator is virtually unnecessary with the many control options available today. Integration of the boiler into heat recovery and solar energy systems has also accelerated the growth of this product. As might be expected, due to the simplicity of boiler construction and accessories, electric boiler maintenance is at a minimum. However, certain areas of additional control must be exercised since unique problems can develop with electric steam and hot water generation. The paper is illustrated with pictures of actual installations and case histories covering the gamut of specification, installation, and successful operation. The future of the electric boiler and its application to contemporary ideas of high-voltage ac is covered together with the misapplications and possible drawbacks of electric steam and hot water generation. © 1974 IEEE.

This is unlike the magnetization distributions assumed by most recording theories. The theories of several other researchers, based on their observations of STS could not explain the results observed in this work. This is due to theoretical energy expressions based on magnetization distributions somewhat different from those observed here. The STS tip angle was found to be proportional to Hc-0.5.

The energy changes cause the superconducting coils to go to a normal state when the current reaches a “dynamic” transition value. The transition currents are experimentally measured. Further, energy and power dissipated in the superconducting coils are calculated thus enabling the effective resistance of the superconducting coil material to be determined. The knowledge of the effective resistance can contribute to the prediction of the efficiency of energy transferl from superconducting storage coils.

The photocatalytic solar energy conversion methods reviewed are classified according to the photosensitizer type. That includes catalysts such as compound salts, compound semi-conductor crystals and photosynthetic dyes. An assessment of these methods concludes that photolysis of water as a solar energy conversion process does not seem feasible at present or for the immediate future.

The device is then cooled to low temperature with the bias still applied, and at the low temperature the biasing condition is changed, in order to induce the device into a non-steady mode that is quasi-stable at the low temperature. The temperature of the device is then raised at a constant rate, and the resulting current vs temperature (I-T) characteristics is found to be rich in structure. By means of a series of systematic experiments the various portions of the I-T characteristic are identified with emission of electrons from interface states and the nitride traps, and surface generation.

The effects of temperature and time of annealing on the various properties are explained in terms of structural changes and relaxation kinetics. © 1974.",,"DATA STORAGE, DIGITAL; GLASS - X-Ray Analysis; ARSENIC SELENIUM ANTIMONY ALLOYS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016047305

They are more efficient and economical than abrasives. However, there is excessive application leading to environmental problems. Besides chemical melting, various methods for deicing exist. Some of these are stationary and mobile thermal melting units, alternate deicing compounds, snow adhesion reducing pavements, electromagnetic energy for ice shattering, and drainage systems designed to capture snowmelt for treatment of control. Salt storage facilities often become a major contributing source of local groundwater and surface water salt contamination. Coverage of salt piles is becoming chloride prevalent. High chloride concentration levels have been found in roadway runoff. The special additives in deicing salts may create more severe pollutional problems than the chloride salts.",,"ROADS AND STREETS - Snow and Ice Control; WATER RESOURCES - Underground; DEICING; WATER QUALITY; Water pollution; environmental health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0016047069

This device operates at low pressure (0.05 Torr), conducting current at a fixed voltage (~500 V) only in the presence of a weak magnetic field (~100 G) which is substantially perpendicular to the electric field between the electrodes. When the magnetic field is removed, ionization ceases and current interruption results. Physical phenomena occurring in this device have been investigated, including the glow-to-arc transition, gas cleanup, and high voltage breakdown. Based on the results of these investigations, switch tubes have been developed and successfully tested at the 2 kA, 100 kV level, with recovery rates in excess of 2 kV/μs. The availability of such devices will make possible many applications including HVDC circuit breakers, ac current limiters, and practical inductive energy storage.

While the crystal, excited by electrons at RT, shows a complex distribution of glow maxima in the temperature region between 300 and 700 °K, it does not seem to show any TL for excitation at about 500 °K or above; in the latter case the crystal becomes densely coloured and shows α and β absorption bands. The comparatively low intense glow peaks occuring below 500 °K may be associated with the trapping states related with the trace impurities. Absence of TL in the coloured crystal has been explained by assuming that, during the process of excitation at or above 450 °K. trapped holes diffuse away from the affected layer and facilitate the formation of α and ß absorption bands.

Off-peak nuclear power would be used to run the electric generator in reverse as a motor to drive the compressor which would fill the air storage cavern. During subsequent peak loads the air would be withdrawn from storage, mixed with fuel, burned, and expanded through the turbine to generate power.

Both phages are substantially less sensitive to the lethal effects of 33P than to 32P. Because 33P has a much lower nuclear-recoil energy, the results suggest that nuclear recoil is an important cause of 32P lethality for each phage. Lethal 32P decays in SP82G at either storage temperature appear to correspond to double-strand breaks in DNA. Marker suicide experiments with temperature-sensitive mutants of SP82G indicate two distinct types of lethal lesion resulting from 32P decays: one causes differential interruption of genetic transfer into the infected cell; the second causes interference with the transfer or expression of all genetic markers equally. Similar radiophosphorus experiments with amber mutants of T7 indicate the occurrence of the same two types of genetic lesion. The existence of the first type provides additional indirect evidence that T7, like SP82G, injects its genome in a unique linear sequence, always starting at the left end of the genetic map. © 1974 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,"phosphorus 32; radioisotope; bacillus subtilis; bacteriophage; escherichia coli; gene expression; genetics; in vitro study; methodology; phosphorus 33; phosphorus 37; radiation death; radioisotope decay; temperature; theoretical study; viral genetics; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteriophages; Coliphages; Comparative Study; DNA Viruses; DNA, Viral; Mutation; Phosphorus Radioisotopes; Radiation Effects; Radiation Genetics; Recombination, Genetic; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015966343

By these means a reduction of the number of excited ions in the primary beam and a good definition of the kinetic energy are obtained, together with a collection and detection probability for the secondary ions, that approaches unity for all scattering angles in a broad energy band. Tire ion beam intensity (105 to 107 ions per second) is only weakly dependent on the kinetic energy down to typically 0.15 eV (lab).

Apart from the direct influence of the residual gas molecules through nuclear and Coulomb scattering on the stored beam lifetimes (of the order of days during which the stored protons should travel the astronomical distance of some light days!) there are also indirect processes which additionally involve adsorption/desorption phenomena on the vacuum chamber wall. The beam of high energy protons creates low energy secondary ions in the residual gas. These ions, generated in the space charge potential of 1 kV (10 A)-1 of proton beam, are accelerated by this potential onto the stainless steel vacuum chamber wall where a variety of adsorption/desorption phenomena may be stimulated. Desorbed molecules are fed back into the residual gas resulting in the possibility of creating an unstable run-away pressure increase which can finally destroy the stored beam. This danger depends on the local parameters of the vacuum system, and most critically, on the state of the vacuum chamber surface. The paper summarises recent observations in this field and describes the results of investigations aimed at producing cleaner surfaces in vacuum chambers. These investigations, which have included high temperature bakeouts, ion bombardment scrubbing by glow discharge, oxidation, etc, will show that under favourable conditions, net negative desorption coefficients can be obtained which turn the Intersecting Storage Rings into a large ion pump. Results, supported and compared with measurements using Auger and Sims surface analysis, are presented mainly from the empirical point of view with the emphasis on practical implications for machines where the surfaces of the vacuum system are subjected to ion bombardment. © 1974.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000371069

The effect of pig slurry, applied to a soil surface, on the composition of the soil atmosphere was investigated using laboratory soil columns. When the effect of slurry was compared with equivalent amounts of glucose, results showed that while both energy sources increased microbial activity, slurry also sealed soil pores, slowing gaseous diffusion rates and delaying the return of the composition of the soil atmosphere to that approaching air. Repeated slurry applications completely sealed the soil surface and oxygen in the soil atmosphere was rapidly depleted. Ethylene, capable of harmfully affecting root‐growth, was produced in the anaerobic soil.

This ″nuclear ash″ must be extracted so the unexpended uranium remaining in the fuel can be used. About once a year, a fraction of a reactor loading - some 30 tons - is removed for reprocessing. This involves a complex chemical operation, which separates out the fission products. The fuel material is leached from the metal with hot acid, and uranium and plutonium are recovered from the solution. Essentially all the fission products are removed by a nitric acid solution; this then constitutes a ″high-level″ waste, emitting intense amounts of radioactivity and a considerable amount of heat. Methods for disposing of the high-level wastes and plutonium are discussed. Past practice has been to store the waste stream underground in steel tanks embedded in thick concrete walls. Under consideration are a reference canister design for waste storage and stable geologic formations such as salt beds for disposal. Also under study is the possibility of transmutation of radioactive nuclides by nuclear bombardment into other forms that are more stable, hence less hazardous. Alternatively, products could be formed that have shorter half-lives, meaning that they undergo radioactive decay in a shorter period of time. To meet interim needs a design study has been undertaken to develop plans for a surface or near-surface facility which will accommodate sealed waste-bearing canisters shipped from chemical reprocessing plants. Retrievable surface storage is the official term for this approach. The facility will be designed so that radioactive wastes can be safely isolated for centuries, if necessary. However, they could be moved for geologic storage (or other form of permanent disposal) when feasible, reducing the burden of continued surveillance and control.Long term disposal of high level radioactive wastes remains one of the unresolved aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle. Responsibility for processing of spent nuclear fuel falls within the realm of private industry, but resolution by the Atomic Energy Commission of a number of vital questions is the key to viability of new commercial plants. This paper describes several privately owned facilities which are being designed to handle this aspect of the nuclear fuel cycle, and discusses present problems with regard to packaging spent fuel for disposal, storage facilities, and removal of decay heat.",,"RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS - Waste Disposal; Nuclear fuels; environmental health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015855610

If natural gas could continue to capture large shares of the energy market, as in the past when supply was not a growth inhibiting factor, annual demand for gas is projected to increase to 34.5 and 46.4 trillion cubic feet in 1980 and 1990, respectively. Annual production levels which could be supported by presently proven reserves and anticipated future reserve additions are estimated to peak in the mid-1970’s and decline to about 18 trillion cubic feet in 1990. When viewed from the perspective of anticipated indigenous supply deficiencies, the acquisition of supplemental sources of gas becomes of paramount importance. Pipeline imports, the only substantive supplemental source presently available, could almost double by 1980 and be about 2 trillion cubic feet annually in 1990. Available volumes of gas from Alaska could be 0.7 trillion cubic feet in 1980 and could increase to 2.3 trillion cubic feet annually by 1990. Actual initial deliveries of gas are inextricably related to construction of an oil pipeline from Prudhoe Bay. Construction delays postpone initial delivery dates for gas as well as oil. Advancements in cryogenic transportation and storage technologies have made the heretofore largely untapped supplies of gas from several countries with limited internal markets available to the United States as LNG. Annual LNG imports could be about 0.3 trillion cubic feet in 1975 and perhaps 2 and 4 trillion cubic feet by 1980 and 1990, respectively. Pipeline quality gas from coal presents the prospect for a supplemental source of gaseous fuel independent of foreign sources and free from balance of payments problems. The first pipeline quality gas from coal may be expected by 1976, and by 1980 perhaps 0.3 trillion cubic feet could be provided annually from this source; in 1990, 3.3 trillion cubic feet might be available. An additional, but presently unqualified, source of synthetic gas will be the conversion of liquid hydrocarbons. In the aggregate, supplemental gas supplies are anticipated to total about 4.6 and 11.5 trillion cubic feet annually by 1980 and 1990, respectively. While demand for gas is anticipated to increase, domestic conventional gas production is projected to peak in the mid-1970’s and decrease somewhat thereafter. As a consequence, a continuing gas supply-demand imbalance is anticipated. © 1973 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"environmental health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015740607

Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities were not impaired by exposure to 3x106 rad of cobalt 60 γ rays, whereas infectivity was completely abolished. At -80°C no decrease in infectivity of the untreated virus nor of surface antigen activity of either the untreated or the irradiated preparations was detectable. From -20° to +37°C the inactivation of both preparations followed first order kinetics, the velocity constants (k) showing very low values, particularly for hemagglutinin activity. At +56°C, inactivation of all virus properties took place in two stages, each following first order kinetics. The inactivation constants of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase properties of untreated and irradiated preparations were overlapping when samples were stored frozen (-80° and -20°C). A significantly increasing rate of inactivation was observed for irradiated virus antigens after storage at temperatures above +4°C.

When suitably preionized by rows of electrically stressed dielectric interfaces, the entire interelectrode volume is filled with a uniform glow discharge for large ranges of capacitor energy, voltage, and gas pressure. The 10.59-μm gain reaches a peak value of 2.8% cm-1 in 2 μsec, and decays exponentially with a 20-μsec time constant in near-optimum laser mixtures of 60 Torr CO2, 180 Torr N2, and 60 Torr He.

Mathematical expressions are developed which relate the small-signal gain to the P and R branch rotational quantum numbers in a linear fashion.

Washington Blvd., Whittier, 90606, Calif, United States","The Imperial Valley is a major rift valley characterized by unusually high heat flow and large quantities of water in storage in the thick fill of alluvium provided by the sediments of the delta of the Colorado River. The inventory of hot water appears to be sufliciently large that if used for water desalination it might add several million acreleet of new water to the resources of the lower Colorado River basin. This distilled water would serve to lower river salinity and provide extra water to help meet the U. S. - Mexico treaty commitments. A major fraction of water desalination costs lie in the cost of energy and are related to desalination technology which is directly related to water chemistry. The discovery of low salinity geothermal waters in the Imperial Valley opened th possibility for a major breakthrough in lowered water desalination costs. We have tried to develop a broad understanding of the origins of the waters of the Imperial Valley and how natural recharge occurs. The chemical composition of the waters of the central portion of Imperial Valley basin waters, while not that of present surface flow of the rivers, nevertheless does have a close affinity to Colorado River water. No sea water seems to be present in the valley although marine sediments appear to occur on basement on West Mesa and on basement to the east in Arizona south of Yuma. Low salinity waters dominate the basin hydrology and waters as saline or more saline than sea water appear to be restricted to the immediate area of the Salton Sea. The isotope work of T. Coplen makes it possible to determine the relative contribution of precipitation runoff from California watersheds and from Colorado River water. Both sources are significant. The Colorado River water in aquifers from 100-400 m appears to have been entrapped from a relatively homogeneous basin which was subject to substantial evaporation. Its original source was snow melt water from the Colorado River. Five types of waters, none of them sea water, were recognized by their salt geochemistry. Bromide/chloride data are particularly effective in resolving different types of water masses. The bromide/chloride data agree with the isotope data and identify rainfall and precipitation runoff from the high mountains to the west. Modern Colorado River water is easily recognized by its salts and two types of ancient Colorado River waters from previous lake stage are proposed on the basis of the bromide/chloride data. One old lake occurring during the pluvial stage associated with the last Ice Age is proposed to account for much of the water in artesian aquifers. Another younger lake stage, possibly with Lake Cahuilla affinities is also suggested. Mountain runoff waters can be distinguished in the subsurface by their relatively lower salinity and high bicarbonate concentration, and their heavy isotopic composition. Revised fluid reserve calculations based on additional porosity data continue to show that the low salinity water resources of the Imperial Valley may exceed two billion acre-feet. The oceanic plate tectonic model is modified in the Imperial Valley by the evidence of a series of complex blocks with the generation of both tensional and compressional features in the valley. Major strike slip faults dominate the tectonic fabric but conjugate features increase complexity by a large degree and a major amount of work will be needed before any geologically sound structural models can be generated. Xenoliths within the obsidians at the volcanoes at the south end of the Salton Sea provide samples of the basement under the Imperial Valley. These xenoliths include partially remelted granitic rocks, fragments of basalt, greenschist, and baked shale and sandstone. This is taken as evidence that the basement in the valley consists in part of partially remelted granite. This would render basement plastic and readily deformed. The source of the heat is suggested to be derived from basalt that comes into the basement and deeper sediments from below. This upward movement of basalt along a spreading zone is the continental equivalent to a sea floor spreading area. In the continental case the insulating blanket of wet sediment retains the heat and appears to produce a major geothermal resource. The geothermal resources of the Imperial Valley are the aggregate of the thermal energy of the large inventory of subsurface water heated by the complex mix of intrusive phenomena. The net result is to generate a polygenetic geothermal resource of very large dimensions. © 1973 Stabilimento Tipografico Francesco Gianni & Figli.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956561157

The first 20 per cent of NE was lost by zero-order kinetics, while degradation of the major part of the remaining NE followed two consecutive first-order processes. Both the zero- and first-order constants showed a temperature dependency and were used to construct Arrhenius temperature plots. The zero- and first-order rate constants yielded energies of activation of 17.2 and 16.3 kcal mole respectively. When stored at 25°, approximately 25 per cent of total NE remained in mouse brain 144 hr after death. The amount of NE remaining 144 hr postmortem increased as the storage temperature decreased. Post-mortem NE degradation kinetics also were studied in rats. The NE degradation kinetics in rat brain were similar to those observed in mice. Although the zero-order degradation rate constant for rats was about one-third that found for mice, no difference was found in the first-order rate constants. Oxidative metabolism of NE in rat brain stopped shortly after death and metabolism proceeded non-oxidatively via normetanephrine.

The sunspot energy deficit and the photospheric faculae both involve energy fluxes comparable with the flare requirement ( {Mathematical expression} 3 × 1029 erg s-1). Both also require a subsurface system of waves or oscillations, perhaps those discussed by Danielson and Savage and by Wilson. The flare model proposed is based on a temporary diversion of this energy carried by Alfvén waves through spots and magnetic elements or micro-pores; the calculated plasma perturbation velocity in the umbra is about 6 km s-1 for a major flare. In the atmosphere the wave energy divides into two parts to produce the cool, stationary optical flare and the particle flare. The first part is dissipated around flux tubes which are mainly horizontal in the chromosphere and which tend to concentrate along the magnetic neutral line (B∥ = 0). Each tube vibrates individually as a taut wire in a viscous fluid, to excite the fluid just outside the tube. The second part of the energy emerges along tubes mainly vertical in the chromosphere and is converted to shock waves in the corona and then to particle energy for the radio and X-ray flare and the blast wave. The model includes white-light faculae, quasi-permanent X-ray and fast-particle emissions, sympathetic flares and surges. An unambiguous test would be provided by observations of plasma motions of a few kilometres per second in spots and micro-pores. © 1973 D.

By having 26 GeV protons in each beam one obtains 52 GeV centre-of-mass energies. In order to achieve similar energies with ordinary particle accelerators, energies of 1500 GeV would be needed. The main problem with such colliding beam devices is to accumulate sufficiently intense circulating beams that useful interaction rates are obtained. The design aim was a luminosity per intersection region of 4 × 1030 cm-2 s-1. This was reached by the end of 1972 and under good experimental conditions. After less than two years operation the ISR have therefore established themselves as an important high energy physics tool.

These types include: (I) Stoichiometric compounds which do not undergo significant changes in local order on crystallization (e.g., As2Se3). (II) Stoichiometric compounds which undergo significant changes in local order on crystallization (e.g., GeTe). (III) Non-stoichiometric alloys which phase separate on crystallization. Previous work on memory switching has been performed primarily on type II and type III chalcogenides. The memory switching process in thin film specimens of a type I chalcogenide, amorphous As2Se3, is examined in this paper. Measurements of the threshold voltage distribution for devices of a given thickness display a sharp peak at some value VO . A plot of VO as a function of film thickness shows the initiation of switching to be field controlled, suggesting a non-thermal initiation mechanism. Microscopic examination of switched devices yields evidence for Joule heating, which is enchanced by self-capacitive energy released during switching subsequent to formation of the low resistance path. From the thickness dependence of VO and measurements of the failure time of devices biased below threshold, a switching mechanism for this material is deduced which incorporates spinodal decomposition of metallic As clusters in an insulating matrix. These clusters then chain under the influence of an applied field and form a low resistance filamentary path. © 1973 American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",,"MINERALOGY; CHALCOGENIDES; DATA STORAGE UNITS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015586951

Questions on how to meet seasonal or off-peak demands, how to utilize underground storage, and how much new supply would be required to eliminate waiting lists for residential customers were typical of the problems confronting this utility. In addition, the cost of service due to inflation and pipeline cost adjustments indicated that this company should perhaps request a general rate increase and required substantial calculations in the PGA (Purchase Gas Adjustment) area. A set of linked models was built for this utility to answer these questions. The models considered the areas of rate, revenue, cost of gas, PGA, and income. Each model could be run independently of the others; however, all could be linked to provide an integrated planning system for the utility. The models were implemented in a conversational mode on a time-shared computer and allowed the model users to interactively vary rate structures, pipeline contract terms and alternative sources of supply over a five-year planning horizon. © 1973 Proceedings - Winter Simulation Conference.

In keeping with the developing industrial scale of the different processes constituting the nuclear fuel cycle in Japan, it is urgently required to consider the organization of basic research in criticality safety, the training of specialists, the establishment of criteria or guide governing criticality safety, and the initiation of a data center and or an experimental facility. © 1973, Atomic Energy Society of Japan.

From the results of infrared spectra, the peak of carbonic band increased with storage time in the order of the aromatics, the asphalts, the asphaltenes and the resins, but it did not change with the saturates even after the 48hr storage. Plots of log ΔE vs. log t, where ΔE is the increment of extinction coefficient at carbonic band by deterioration, gave a straight line for the asphalts and the resins, but not for the aromatics and the asphaltenes. The agreement between the experimental and calculated data of ΔE which was determined from the contents of the fractions was obtained for the asphalts. The molecular size distribution obtained by use of gelpermeation chromatography for the fractions was almost independent on storage time, except for the asphaltenes, while the molecular weight determined by the vapor pressure method slightly decreased with storage time. Therefore, it is considered that polymerized molecule by heat oxidation, as well as oxidized molecule, is fractionated with the solvent of higher cohesive energy, but molecular weight will be more effective in this case. From the result of DTA thermogram, it is known that only a part of the exothermic peak by oxidative decomposition shifted to a higher temperature side, and the structure of ring condensation for the asphaltenes is considered to progress with storage time. © 1973, The Japan Petroleum Institute.

The transport approach to this process of solving the general equations of change with suitable equations of state to describe the flowing material has been largely ignored. No analytic solution is possible, and the non‐steady state flow adds a dimension which makes digital computation discouraging because of the core storage and execution time requirements. The mold filled in this simulation is a disk which hot polymer melt enters through a tubular entrance located at the center of the top plate. The tube is 2.54 cm. long and has a radius of 0.24 cm. The plate separation and outer radius of the disk cavity may be varied. A constant pressure applied at the entrance of the tube causes the flow. The cavity walls are kept at various low temperatures. The reported results are for rigid polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The general transport equations, i.e. continuity, momentum, and energy, for a constant density power law fluid are used to solve the flow problem. Convergence to the differential solutions is guaranteed but since a lower limit was imposed on the time increment by the core storage limit of the computer facilities (27K) and long execution times, all results are semiquantitative for the problem as stated. Using the results obtained it is possible to predict “fill times”. The formation of a frozen polymer skin as the cavity fills may be followed via the velocity profiles. The temperature profiles which reflect cooling and the amount of viscous heat generated provide the basis for studying resin thermal degradation effects. Finally, because so much of the total pressure drop is disispated in the entrance tube, and so much viscous heat is generated there, this study indicates that the design of the gate and runner system is perhaps the most important facet of success in mold filling.

From the moment of its discovery, it was hoped that delayed fluorescence would provide new insights into the mechanism of the early steps of quantum conversion by the photosynthetic apparatus. Luminscence studies have indeed furnished such information. But in addition, current studies indicate that delayed and induced fluorescence may provide sensitive probes of the storage of charge in photosystem II—the oxygen-evolving system of photosynthesis—and even of the state and structure of the photosynthetic membranes, and of the storage of the high energy intermediates that are used to drive photo-phosphorylation. The mechanisms of oxygen evolution and photo-phosphorylation have been among the more intractable and controversial problems in photosynthesis research. The fact that oxygen can cause bacteria to emit light suggested that luminescence might be evoked by other oxidants, such as ferricyanide; but reductants such as hydrosulfite could also be likely candidates. © 1973, ACADEMIC PRESS, INC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981661383

Values found for the Bowen ratio β ranging from near 1 to 4 or more, are used to show that the bulk physiological resistance rST of the forest exhibits a consistent diurnal trend, from near 1·2 s cm−1 in the forenoon (once the trees are dry) to as much as 4 s cm−1 by late afternoon ‐ consistent with independent biological measurements (Robins, personal communication). In contrast, the forest's bulk aerodynamic resistance r generally lies between 0·05 and 0·10 s cm−1. The ratio rST/r alone, of order 20:1, is shown to imply that transpiration from the forest must occur at rates much less dependent, primarily, on net radiation, Rn, than on ambient vapour pressure deficit (v.p.d.), (provided that the latter is not too small, i.e. ≮ 1 mb per 100 W m−2 of Rn, say); and also that the evaporation of intercepted rainfall from the trees must occur at about 5 times the corresponding transpiration rate under the same meteorological conditions. In addition, because lighter winds during fine weather tend to favour larger v.p.d's the observed decrease in transpiration rate with increasing wind speed is much larger than that expected from the accompanying decrease in r alone. Other conclusions are (i) that the storage associated with a 1° C change in air temperature per hour, within the canopy, is 18 W m−2, which is not always negligible, as it is for short vegetation; and (ii) that values derived for the dimensionless excess resistance parameter, B−1, although remarkably small, 2 to 3 for u* ∼ 0·75 m s−1, are commensurate with other bulk aerodynamic resistances in the system: accordingly, the easily‐derived surface resistance parameter, rs, (Monteith 1965; Thom 1972) provides an estimate of rST for the forest within 10 per cent for all β &gt; 0.

Storage modulus and loss factor of both PVCs have been measured over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies in torsion pendulum and flexural vibration tests. A secondary transition of PVC and the glass transition associated with the CPE present in the toughened PVC have been located with fairly good agreement between the five participants. Charpy, falling weight, Izod, tensile and prestressed impact tests have been utilized over a wide range of temperature to study impact properties. The brittle-tough transition temperature range of both PVCs has been located for each test method and the results were discussed. Tensile properties of both PVCs were specially studied in the linear range of deformation, at yield point and at rupture. Yield stress measurements are in good agreement with the generalized Eyring theory proposed by BauwensCrowet. Rupture strains show two transition zones; the first one, associated with a tough-brittle process, has the same activation energy as the secondary transition found by dynamic mechanical measurements; the second one, associated with a tough-tough process, seems to be strongly correlated with thermal dissipation in test pieces. The relaxation modulus of each PVC has been calculated over eight decades of time at several temperatures from 20 to 64°C on the basis of dynamic mechanical, tensile modulus and stress relaxation measurements. The identity of the activation energy measured for the transition zones by means of dynamic mechanical, tensile and impact tests respectively shows that the molecular relaxation processes measured in the linear range of deformation of PVC, have a strong effect on the impact or tensile properties. © 1973, Walter de Gruyter.

As a result of these measurements we found that the maximum achievable luminosity is much higher than predicted by the incoherent beam-beam limit usingδv=0.025. We also found that the maximum achievable luminosity is a strong function of the betatron frequencies.

Typically, joint strengths of about 60 kg/cm2, approaching the bulk strength of Teflon, are obtained for treatments with electron‐beam energies in the range of 5 to 20 keV and intercepted charge densities of about 5 X 10−6 C/cm2. This compares with gold–Teflon joint strengths of about 10 kg/cm2 for untreated material. The increase in joint strength is believed to be primarily due to crosslinking caused by the electron bombardment. Compared to the other known treatments to improve gold–Teflon joints, the present method has the advantage that the charge‐storage properties of the Teflon are not irreversibly degraded. It is possible, for example, to store charge densities up to 3 X 10−8 C/cm2, on 25‐μm films treated with this method, with the same favorable charge‐retention properties and thermally stimulated current characteristics as obtained for untreated Teflon.

In doing so the flux transfer rate is defined and contrasted with magnetic Mach numbers as measures of the reconnection rate. We examine the origin of the reconnection electric field to determine some of the requirements of nonsteady versus steady reconnection. The dependence of various measures of the reconnection rate on electrical conductivity is discussed as well as some experimental features which may relate to previous theory. Finally, we present some approximate scaling between laboratory events and the geomagnetic substorm. We reach three major conclusions: (a) The flux transfer rate as a measure of the reconnection rate is different from a magnetic Mach number. (b) The early reconnection process is quasi‐steady state or “Petschek‐like” and we associate this phase with magnetic energy storage. A later rapid flux transfer event is more energetic and is associated with storm events. The flux transfer event is triggered by a change in resistivity. (c) The laboratory event scales reasonably well to the duration and energy of a substorm. Copyright 1973 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908733630

Most energy storage capacitors are made of Kraft paper and aluminum foil and impregnated with castor oil. A typical capacitor stores ~3000 joules at voltage ratings of 5 kV - 100 kV. Two types of switches are used for capacitor bank switching, ignitrons and pressurized spark gaps. Ignitrons are commercially available, have a wide voltage operating range and are easy to trigger. However, they are limited to ~ 20 kV for most applications and they will prefire. Spark gaps can be designed for reliable operation at almost any voltage level but they are rarely commercially available. Most spark gaps do not operate satisfactorily below 50% of their design voltage and they require a more complicated trigger system than ignitrons. Low inductance coaxial cable has been developed for capacitor bank transmission systems. It is relatively inexpensive and commercially available. Parallel plate transmission lines can be designed to accumulate large amounts of current and conduct it to a concentrated load but careful attention must be given to the containment of the magnetic forces involved. Large numbers of ignitrons can be triggered with a simple trigger circuit that will be described. A circuit is also given to automatically trigger a crowbar ignitron. A pulse forming network circuit is presented which uses inductive voltage addition to generate an 800 kA pulse rising in 100 nsec with a pulse length of 500 nsec.

This pressure increase can be explained by ion induced gas desorption from the vacuum chamber. The pressure P, as a function of the stacked proton current I, can be described in good approximation by P = Po/[1−(kη/S)I], where Po is the pressure without beam, S the pumping speed, η the net gas desorption coefficient in molecules per incident gas ion and k is a constant. This concept shows the existence of a critical current at which the pressure goes to infinity.

High density stacks were made at 26.5 GeV/c from which a part was rebunched with the maximum available RF voltage. The rebunched beam was kept near central orbit while the magnetic field was gradually increased to its maximum value. The major problem was to keep the betatron oscillation frequencies unchanged while changing the magnetic field thus avoiding any blow-up of the beam due to resonances. The corrections of the highly non-linear saturation effects of the main magnet were achieved by a computer controlled tuning of the field by excitation of the poleface windings and sextupole lenses.

When the system elements are modeled as energetic multiports, and their interconnections by power bonds, then the bond graph language is a natural one for describing the entire system. Bond graphs may be written for dynamic systems involving various energy types, such as electrical, mechanical, fluid and thermal; all energy types may be coexistent. Useful modeling elements include multiport storages, dissipators, and junction elements and transducers, as well as sources. Bond graph models of linear multiport systems may be transformed to state-space form by a powerful algorithm based upon operational causality. From the state-space equations, dynamic responses may be obtained by the matrix exponential technique, thereby allowing the direct digital simulation of linear multiport models. The ENPORT program is a realization of the bond graph reduction algorithm. It is a principal purpose of this paper to describe the procedure upon which ENPORT is based, and to present some results. Important features of ENPORT are its choice of physically significant state variables, its use of operational causality to obtain an orderly formulation of system equations, and its ability to handle systems containing static storage subfields. © 1973.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49549164906

A possible general explanation is that diffraction dissociation of a particle into successive channels of increasing multiplicity is characterized by a competition between these channels, a lower one being abruptly closed by the opening up of the next higher one. We show that this explanation works quite well for proton diffraction dissociation in π-p collisions at 16 GeV/c. The reaction is considered as a two-step process, production of a fireball X(π-p→π-X) and decay of X. By analysing the distributions in the mass of X, we find that the competition operates sharply between the decay channels X→πN, 2πN, 3πN, and that it can be explained by pure phase space effect in the fireball decay. These results imply that the phase space effects just mentioned combined with the small momentum tranfer property of the dissociation π-p→π-X are sufficient to account for the smallness of the transverse momenta pT of all second-aries in the reactions considered. We note that the situation would be different at much larger energies, where fireballs of very high mass could be occasionally produced. Irrespective of whether such heavy fireballs would be produced diffractively or not, phase space arguments now imply that their decay will tend to give both higher multiplicities and higher pT of the secondaries. We indicate the possible interest of these considerations for recent observations of large pT secondaries at the CERN Interesting Storage Rings. © 1973.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49549162225

Both phenomena are quantitatively described in proton-proton scattering, in terms of diffractive excitation into high-mass states with a triple-Pomeron coupling. This coupling is then incorporated in a two-component model. In this way we obtain a total inelastic proton-proton cross section which agrees with the data from s=30 to 3000 GeV2. The ""break"" in the elastic differential cross section at small |t| is related to the increase with energy of the inelastic cross section. Predictions, based on the factorizability of the Pomeron, are given for the inclusive spectra, inelastic and elastic cross sections, at Serpukhov and National Accelerator Laboratory energies, for K+p and other reactions. It is shown that a Pomeron with intercept slightly below unity can actually give rise to an increasing cross section and also that a perturbative approach to the Pomeron coupling with only the first few terms may be sufficient at and even far beyond CERN Intersecting Storage Rings energies, while the ""true"" asymptotic behavior appears only much later. © 1973 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35949041529

One is when a sharp vertical border is created that exerts a shielding effect on the adjacent horizontal surface. In this case direction of exposure becomes a prime control of the microclimate. This study investigated the differences in energy balance microclimate in the vicinity of forest edges oriented in the four cardinal directions. The gradient outward from the southerly exposure was also examined. A clearing in a uniform forest stand was utilized as the study site. Exposure to direct beam solar radiation was the most important factor in determining climatic differences. Reflection from an exposed forest edge outweighed the depletion of diffuse sky radiation and gave stations nearer the edge higher totals of global solar radiation. This was counteracted by a higher surface albedo. A more favorable longwave radiation balance, therefore, was largely responsible for greater net radiation near the forest edge. Availability of surface moisture provided by dew and the turbulent wind field combined with net radiation to produce the patterns of latent and sensible heat flux. Diminished vertical humidity and temperature gradients accompanying reduced wind meant that latent and sensible heat fluxes were lower and ground storage higher in the vicinity of the forest edge. The warmest thermal environments were found on the north and east side of the clearing. The shaded south side remained cool and damp throughout the day. The microclimate of the western side of the clearing was intermediate in nature. © 1973.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250165576

In the present paper (Part II), a detailed series of quantitative calculations was first performed which showed that this ratio was not affected by specimen storage and electropolishing procedures subsequent to the quench and hence represented c2v c1v at the ""freeze-out"" temperature (T*). It was then shown that all combinations of the divacancy binding energy (E2vb) and binding entropy (S2vb) which lead to a quenched-in value of c2v c1v equal to 0.06 ± 0.02 for a quench temperature of 1700°C are governed by the linear relationship E2vb = [(0.23 ± 0.03) + 6.17 · 10-2( S2vb k)]eV, where k is Boltzmann's constant.

The existing tracer diffusion data for platinum were re-examined in terms of a monovacancy and divacancy model in an attempt to decompose G2vb into E2vb and S2vb terms, and it was concluded that the available data are not sufficiently accurate to make this decomposition significant. © 1973.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047103338

It is concluded that the evidence for a flat rapidity distribution in the central region is not compelling. Except possibly at the very highest available ISR (CERN Intersecting Storage Rings) energy, the Landau Gaussian gives an excellent description of the rapidity distribution of the nonleading charged secondaries. The calculation of distributions in the variable η=-ln tan(θ2) from given rapidity and transverse momentum distributions is worked out in many interesting cases. The Landau rapidity distribution is cast in a universal (energy dependent) scaling law which agrees well with available data. The angle and energy dependence of charged secondaries near 90 °in the c.m. system in pp collisions agrees well with the theoretical prediction. Finally it is shown that the hydrodynamical model leads to approximate Feynman scaling except for very small values of x=2ps, where large deviations from scaling are predicted. © 1973 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24944535887

All the technology required for implementation is feasible but a great deal of development and refinement is necessary. A pessimistic approach would obviously discourage further thinking about an important and perhaps the most reasonable alternative for the future. We have considered a limited number of alternative energy systems involving hydrogen and have shown that hydrogen could be a viable secondary source of energy derived from nuclear power; for the immediate future, hydrogen could be derived from coal. A hydrogen supply system could have greater flexibility and be competitive with a more conventional all-electric delivery system. Technological improvements could make hydrogen as an energy source an economic reality. The systems examined in this article show how hydrogen can serve as a general-purpose fuel for residential and automotive applications. Aside from being a source of heat and motive power, hydrogen could also supply the electrical needs of the household via fuel cells (19), turbines, or conventional ""total energy systems."" The total cost of energy to a residence supplied with hydrogen fuel depends on the ratio of the requirements for direct fuel use to the requirements for electrical use. A greater direct use of hydrogen as a fuel without conversion to electricity reduces the overall cost of energy supplied to the household because of the greater expense of electrical transmission and distribution. Hydrogen fuel is especially attractive for use in domestic residential applications where the bulk of the energy requirement is for thermal energy. Although a considerable amount of research is required before any hydrogen energy delivery system can be implemented, the necessary developments are within the capability of present-day technology and the system could be made attractive economically. Techniques for producing hydrogen from water by electrolysis, from coal, and directly from thermal energy could be found that are less expensive than those now available; inexpensive fuel cells could be developed, and high-temperature turbines could be used for the efficient conversion of hydrogen (and oxygen) to electricity. The use of hydrogen as an automotive fuel would be a key factor in the development of a hydrogen energy economy, and safe storage techniques for carrying sufficient quantities of hydrogen in automotive systems can certainly be developed. The use of hydrogen in automobiles would significantly reduce urban pollution because the dispersed fossil fuel emissions would be replaced by radioactive wastes generated at large central stations. The conversion of internal or external combustion engines for combustion of hydrogen fuel would probably have less economic impact on the automotive industry than the mass introduction of electric automobiles. However, this is a subject that requires more detailed study. All of the safety aspects of hydrogen utilization will have to be examined, especially the problems of safety in the domestic use and the long distance transport of hydrogen in pipelines at high pressures. It is our opinion that the various energy planning agencies should now begin to outline the mode of implementing hydrogen energy delivery systems in the energy economy. The initial transition to hydrogen energy derived from available fossil fuels such as coal should be considered together with the long range view of all the hydrogen being derived eventually from nuclear energy. By the year 1985 when petroleum imports may be in excess of the domestic supply, these plans could set the stage for the transition period from fossil to a predominantly nuclear energy economy able to supply abundant synthetic fuels such as hydrogen. Synthetic fuels will obviously be more expensive than fuels now derived from petroleum; however, there may be no other viable choice. Thus, it is essential that the analysis and technological feasibility of a hydrogen energy system be considered now. It is of vital importance to the nation to develop some general-purpose fuel that can be produced from a variety of domestic energy sources and reduce our dependence on imported oil.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345994240

If the water-table is kept below the sand surface, evaporation decreases with the coarseness of the sand and with the depth of the water-table. Evaporation from an open water surface was 8% higher than from water-saturated sand, most probably due to higher energy storage in a body of water resulting in a greater temperature gradient between the evaporation surface of the water and the air during the night, as compared to a water-saturated sand. © 1973.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242693514

Changes of the enzyme activities are considered in the light of constant and specific proportion enzymes; in particular, in relation to the alternative systems for the generation of NADPH in the cytosol. Specifically considered are the metabolic transitions in the rat at parturition and weaning; comparison between lactating sheep and rat mammary gland (which manufacture a similar spectrum of fatty acids from different carbon sources) and a comparison between lactating rat mammary gland and rat adipose tissue. Evidence is adduced from enzyme profiles and flux data that the major source and pathway of generation of NADPH differed in the three tissues, an adaptation dependent upon carbon source and over‐all energy requirement of the tissue. Specifically, rat mammary gland has a greater emphasis upon NADPH formation via the pentose phosphate pathway, sheep mammary gland from cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase (combined with glutamate dehydrogenase acting as a transhydrogenase system) and adipose tissue showing participation of both pentose phosphate pathway and ‘malic’ enzyme. The adaptation of mammary tissue to the use of the pentose phosphate pathway or of isocitrate dehydrogenase confers considerable advantage in the ATP yields relative to adipose tissue, where partial generation of NADPH via the ‘malic’ enzyme necessitates an ATP‐consuming reaction. The modification in other satellite systems of lipid synthesis, such as pyruvate carboxylase, citrate cleavage enzyme and glycerol‐1‐phosphate dehydrogenase, is linked to the relative emphasis on different hydrogen‐generating systems, to the source of carbon and to the function of the tissue as a secretory or storage and release tissue.

Biol., Bethesda, Md. 20014, United States","Evaluation of major nutrients in terms of time factors has suggested that some modern diets and daily meal patterns may require consumption of calories that are stored, in order to avoid periodical deficits. This suggestion is centered on availability of calorifers in the plasma, whether from diet or from metabolic sources. Gradually available calorifers from dietary fats (and some starches) seldom lead to irregular storage. Rapidly available calorifers (e.g., sugars) tend to surge into the plasma, evading protective barriers of digestion, absorption, and satiety, and then to urge in again as metabolic fats. When plasma glucose is supplied entirely from cellular gluconeogenesis, its level is regulated at a lower limit; when it is supplied from diet, the level is regulated at an upper limit by uptake and storage mechanisms. These involve enzyme adaptations that promote rapid storage of fat and delay its mobilization; the adaptations are inferred to resemble tachyphylactic responses by cells that are stimulated, by insulin, to take up glucose. Fructose and glucose that is elaborated intracellularly from amino acids evade the insulin barrier. Intervals between carbohydrate containing meals that elicit a fasting state may accelerate the enzyme adaptations so that they are reinforced after every meal. A synergism seems to arise between a rapid availability of calorifers, an increased rate of metabolism, and an adaptation for quick storage of fat. It is inferred that under such conditions, the longer the intervals between meals, the smaller will be the threshold daily caloric intakes for obesity, and this effect would be separate from genetic and endocrine influences. Such long range time factors include consequences of the weaning diet and of prepubertal adaptations that persist into adulthood. An optimal diet for man would supply restricted amounts of protein and energy mainly from fats and slowly available starches in order to maximize both the daily caloric intakes and the intervals between meals that will not lead to obesity. Such a diet would be desirable at least from weaning to puberty, and for children who are not breast fed, there are precautions regarding the formula that warrant attention.",,"amino acid; carbohydrate; fatty acid; fructose; glucose; insulin; lipid; protein; age; biochemistry; caloric intake; caloric restriction; diet; feeding behavior; food intake; metabolism; obesity; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015894015

The chapter considers the evidence for the energy-storage roles of glycogen, polyphosphates and poly-p-hydroxybutyrate, and the current state of knowledge concerning the regulation of their biosynthesis and degradation in the microbial cell. The intracellular location of the enzymes concerned with polymer synthesis and degradation is an intriguing problem. The most detailed work has been carried out with PHB granules, which have PHB synthetase and a factor involved in depolymerase activity associated with the membrane that bounds the granule. The depolymerase system is a complex one that also involves a soluble fraction, underlining the importance of reactions at liquid-solid interfaces in the process and emphasizing that relatively little work has been done to isolate polyphosphate or glycogen granules in their native state in order to examine the possibility of regulation by a membranous system. © 1973, Academic Press Inc.

Last year, the Atomic Energy Commission seriously considered the feasibility of building a permanent waste disposal facility in salt beds under the vicinity of Lyons, Kansas. The Commission was dissuaded from going ahead with a pilot plant, however, by the opposition of the State of Kansas. Since then, the AEC has simply enlarged its temporary program of above ground storage. In this paper, three experts propose an international solution to the radioactive waste disposal dilemma. A safe repository as far from the centers of human civilization could be built in Antarctica. The wastes could be stored for their entire radioactive lifetimes at the ice rock interface of the Antarctic land masses. There they would be effectively segregated from the biosphere for a million years. A comparison of the ice cap approach with other methods which have been suggested for ultimate disposal indicates that it holds promise of being the most practical and safest solution. It thus deserves early and careful consideration by appropriate U.S. and international agencies.",,"environmental health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015795451

A 75% increase was observed at an initial concentration of 1 x 10-10 M LH RH while a progressive increase to 300% over control was measured at a concentration of 1 x 10-6 M of the synthetic neurohormone. Total follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) content was increased 3 fold under similar conditions, a plateau of stimulation being reached at an initial concentration of 1 x 10-9 M LH RH. Chronic treatment with thyroid releasing hormone (TRH) leads to 2 to 2.5 fold stimulation of total thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) content. These data show clearly that synthetic TRH and LH RH, besides stimulating the release of respectively TSH and LH and FSH, lead to a marked stimulation of the synthesis of their trophic hormones. At least in the case of LH and FSH, increased synthesis occurs during the first 24 hr of incubation in presence of the neurohormones. Half maximal (3 to 4 fold) stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation in incubated rat adenohypophyseal tissue is observed at a concentration of 10-10 to 10-9 M of the LH releasing hormone. A 2 fold increase of cyclic AMP accumulation is measured 2 to 6 min after addition of synthetic TRH while addition of a purified fraction of GH RH leads to a rapid and marked (up to 10 fold) increased concentration of cyclic AMP. The rates of release of LH and FSH and of GH follow very closely the observed changes of the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP, both as a function of dose of the neurohormone and time of incubation. Data obtained with theophylline, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, indicate that the changes of cyclic AMP concentration are secondary to increased adenylate cyclase activity in the specific adenohypophyseal cells. Chronic administration of N6 monobutyryl cyclic AMP to anterior pituitary cells in culture leads to 2 fold stimulation of total LH content, thus indicating that the effects of synthetic LH RH on both release and synthesis of LH can be mimicked by cyclic AMP. In short term experiments, the incorporation of [3H]leucine into GH and prolactin (PRL) separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is stimulated 2 fold by the presence of 2 nM N6 monobutyryl cyclic AMP during the preceeding 2 hr of incubation. The cyclic nucleotide, although stimulating both the rate of synthesis and release of GH and PRL, does not affect the overall intracellular transit time of GH and PRL. Measurements of specific activity of the intracellular and released hormones show that newly synthesized GH and PRL are preferentially released under stimulatory conditions. The ribosome associated protein kinase is stimulated by cyclic AMP and by cyclic inosine 5 triphosphate (IMP) at respective Km values of 1 x 10-6 and 1 x 10-5 M. Phosphorylation of ribosomal proteins was stimulated by cyclic AMP in the cell free system and by N6 2' O dibutyryl cyclic AMP in intact cells. As shown by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the radioactivity was mainly preceding with one protein band. The data suggest a possible mechanism by which cyclic AMP could enhance protein synthesis at the translational level in the adenohypophysis. In order to investigate the metabolic requirements for the transport, packaging and storage of secretory products in somatotrophs and mammotrophs, quantitative electron microscope autoradiography was performed on fragments of rat anterior pituitary tissue pulse labelled for 3 min with [3H]leucine leucine and incubated in chase medium for various lengths of time in the presence or absence of KCN, a respiratory inhibitor or of dinitrophenol, an inhibitor of respiratory phosphorylation. Radioactivity accumulates in the Golgi complex within 10 min and is almost exclusively found in the secretory granules after 60 min. The transport of proteins from the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex and from the Golgi apparatus to the secretory granules represent 2 energy dependent steps.",,"bucladesine; cyclic AMP; follitropin; gonadorelin; gonadotropin; growth hormone; luteinizing hormone; prolactin; protein; protein kinase; protirelin; radioisotope; thyrotropin; cyclic AMP; follitropin; gonadorelin; growth hormone; leucine; luteinizing hormone; phosphorus; prolactin; protirelin; thyrotropin; tritium; adenohypophysis; autoradiography; biochemistry; cell culture; electron microscopy; hypophysis; in vitro study; protein synthesis; rat; ribosome; theoretical study; animal; article; autoradiography; cell culture; cytoplasm; drug effect; electron microscopy; female; hypophysis; male; metabolism; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; radioimmunoassay; ribosome; stimulation; Animal; Autoradiography; Cells, Cultured; Cyclic AMP; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Female; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Gonadorelin; Growth Hormone; Leucine; Luteinizing Hormone; Male; Microscopy, Electron; Organoids; Phosphorus Radioisotopes; Pituitary Gland; Prolactin; Protirelin; Radioimmunoassay; Rats; Ribosomes; Stimulation, Chemical; Thyrotropin; Tritium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015791755

The options are interdependent. It is too early to assess disposal in space, and disposal in the oceans remains unsafe for lack of adequate knowledge. Table 3 is a summary of the main ideas for which we have worked out (sometimes uncertain) costs. For the short term, ultimate disposal in deep mines is the best-developed plan. However, the related concept of in situ melt has significant advantages and should be realistically appraised. Further chemical separation with subsequent recycling of the actinides in a LMFBR should be investigated and implemented, for it would be universally beneficial; on the other hand, additional removal of strontium and cesium does not seem attractive. Thus, for the near future we make the following recommendations : 1) Provide temporary storage facilities to ensure that the projected commercial high-level wastes do not become a public hazard. The AEC adopts this view, and has stated an intention to construct such facilities. But because of the capriciousness of man and nature, a workable ultimate disposal scheme must be developed soon. 2) Fund other ultimate disposal schemes at the same rate as the salt mine project - say $1 million a year or more - to sharpen the technological issues, so that a decision can be reached in the next few years. The schemes should include (i) in situ melt, and the variation with a central repository; (ii) burial in mines other than salt mines (including Antarctic rocks and permanent ice); (iii) further chemical separation of actinides and recycling actinides in a LMFBR. 3) Maintain liaison with the developing space shuttle technology to insure that no opportunity is lost. The AEC has a commitment to hold safety foremost in its waste management program, but budget considerations and management priorities have downgraded the program. Past funding levels and management emphasis have yet to produce, after a decade and a half, one operational long-term storage facility - a sign of both commendable caution and inadequate work. If nuclear power is to resolve our energy needs in the coming decades, its benefits should not be delayed for lack of a viable management program for high-level wastes.",,"radioisotope; environmental health; methodology; radioactive waste; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015712151

Rehab., Karolinska Sjukh., Stockholm, Sweden","Cyclonamine (Cy), a low molecular weight derivative of cyclohexadrenolone, produces platelet aggregation in stirred, citrated, EDTA or heparinized PRP. Von Willebrand's disease, 'storage pool disease' and thrombasthenic platelets respond as well as normal platelets to the drug. The phenomenon differs in many aspects from aggregation induced by ADP or by compounds which act through ADP release. Addition of Cy (1 mM) causes immediate and irreversible aggregation, either at 37°C, or room temperature in citrated or EDTA PRP. In heparinized PRP the extent of aggregation is greater but prompt deaggregation supervenes. The electron microscopic study of the process shows that there are no changes in the internal cell morphology, no pseudopodal formation and that the aggregates are composed of 8 to 12 platelets kept together by a thread like substance between the cells. Inhibitors of ADP, serotonin induced aggregation or of the platelet release reaction do not inhibit Cy. Sulfhydryl group inhibitors have a slight effect. Cy induced aggregation requires neither a source of metabolic energy nor calcium. However calcium greatly enhances the rate and extent of aggregation. Fibrinogen appears to augment the action of Cy in platelet suspensions. Platelet factor 3 is not activated during Cy induced aggregation. The compound seems to induce platelet aggregation by similar mechanisms as do the charged polipeptides or polyelectrolytes, e.g. polylysine and polybrene (coating the platelet surface with the subsequent changes of the electric charges carried by the platelet membrane).",,"acetylsalicylic acid; adenosine; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine phosphate; adrenalin; amphetamine; calcium; citrate sodium; edetic acid; etamsylate; heparin; hydroxymercuribenzoic acid; imipramine; n ethylmaleimide; ouabain; para hydroxymercuriphenosulfonate; potassium cyanide; reserpine; russell viper venom; unclassified drug; aminobutyric acid derivative; chlorobenzene; phenol derivative; density; electron microscopy; in vitro study; temperature; theoretical study; thrombocyte; thrombocyte aggregation; article; drug effect; drug screening; human; intraspinal drug administration; long term care; muscle spasm; nerve block; radiography; spinal root; technique; time; Aminobutyric Acids; Chlorobenzenes; Drug Evaluation; Human; Injections, Spinal; Long-Term Care; Methods; Nerve Block; Phenols; Spasm; Spinal Nerve Roots; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015691098

This is achieved by considering a reference electric car of 3150-lb weight similar in body construction, aerodynamics, and rolling resistance to a conventional heat engine car of equal weight, and comparing the performance of the two cars over the same driving modes. The reference electric car is then used as a baseline to evaluate the possible improvements in future electric cars.

The result may be expressed as follows. If an inert symmetrical hot spot of unit dimensions and unit diffusivity is initially at unit dimensionless temperature above its surroundings, the temperature of its centre falls with time, and if this drop in temperature is denoted by ψ0(λ) at dimensionless time λ (Fourier number), where ψ0(λ) can be evaluated by conventional thermal conduction theory, then for a hot spot generating heat according to the Arrhenius law with high activation energy and having an initial dimensionless temperature. θ0 = E RT20 (T0 - T1 where E is the activation energy, R is the universal gas constant, T0 is the initial temperature of the hot spot, and T1 is that of the surroundings, the relation between δc and θ0 is appropriately θ0 dφ dλλ = 1 δc and it links δc and θ0 directly through the cooling characteristic of the equivalent inert hot spot. The effects of shape, initial distribution of temperature, and boundary conditions are embodied in this one term ψ. For a sphere this result gives lnθ0 = δc 4 + ln 4 π - 3 2 ln δc A low and a high value of δc can give the same value of θ0 but only the higher value is relevant here. The treatment is expected to apply to shapes where the position of the maximum temperature can be assumed and to initial temperature differences high enough for the reactivity of the material outside the hot spot to be neglected. The critical condition has been used for evaluating δc as a function of surface heat transfer for pieces or piles of self-heating materials placed in cooling surroundings. There value of δc are relevant to the definition of safe conditions for the industrial processing and storage of such materials when the finally-processed material is hot. The form of the relation between δc and θ0 appears to be significantly dependent on the ""initial"" temperature distribution, i.e. on the processes involved in the formation of the hot spot. © 1973.",,"MATERIALS - Thermal Conductivity; THERMAL EFFECTS; THERMOANALYSIS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015658437

In general, the auxiliary circuit for switching off the load current carrying thyristors is composed of a number of energy storage components and semiconductor switches which are affected by losses. These circuits demonstrate specific advantages under certain conditions. The analysis of a forced commutated inverter with a series LC-resonant circuit is presented in this article. The peak capacitor voltage depends on the quality of the resonant circuit and the ratio of the peak capacitor current vs. the maximum load current. This can cause high stresses on all the components of the inverter circuit. The set of equations for the circuit is established and used for the computation of results. The peaks of stored energy and the losses in the commutation circuit are calculated and given in a normalized form. Design parameters in normalized form are derived therefrom and presented in this article.

When a discontinuity is considered as enclosed by an ideal cavity, representing energy storage in the ‘localized’ modes, Foster's form of the reactance matrix of the discontinuity is recovered. The relationship with the variational method in computing the resonance matrix of the ‘accessible’ modes is illustrated. Green's function of cascaded apertures is obtained by finite network analysis.

Energy levels of trapping centers responsible for Poole-Frenkel current become shallow while their densities remain nearly constant as a function of the Si content.

United States Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center (USAMERDC), Fort Belvoir, Va., has been particularly interested in an improved vehicle mobility for off-highway vehicles, amphibians, and engineer equipment through electrical propulsion. Such drive systems incorporating individual wheel controls provide improved mobility over all types of terrain, simplified supply logistics, and permit a more functional vehicle design and construction. Past experience in industry and in the government has shown that the dc motor propulsion drive is inherently simple to install and to maintain. The de motor is somewhat heavier than comparable ac motors due to motor speed limitations; however, the dc machine, particularly the series field motor, requires relatively simple power controls since the power is processed by the motor's own commutator. Commercial dc traction motors have an inherent high-torque starting characteristic which is mandatory for engineer-type vehicle propulsion applications. In the midspeed range however, presently available dc motor propulsion drives under consideration for the Army have unsatisfactory acceleration performance when compared to conventional mechanical drive systems comprised of a spark or compression ignition engine and a multispeed transmission. In this context, the paper discusses this Center's experimental solid-state controller and the method employed to improve the acceleration or peak power propulsion profile of an electric vehicle drive using dc series field motors. A power processor for shunt field motors is also described which can provide identical propulsion characteristics through storage of kinetic energy in a high-speed flywheel.

Also, simple considerations about the definition of optical information have grown into several groups of processing methods. At first the concept of characteristic spatial frequency bands, which describe essential features of any object, leads to compression of its Fourier terms in order to increase the transfer density of a transmitting system and the storage capacity of the recording media. With the emphasis being put on the informative value of the reference in holography, geometrical compression is applied in particular to the coding of printed texts. The second and third groups of methods apparently deal with opposite approaches. Assuming a given message, one may select some parts of its spectrum for further processing or carry out average signals from the collections it contains. Both cases-sampling and averaging-permit the extraction of a group of data belonging to a set of discrete signals. The following developments are presented: Image replicating at a determined energy level, step-by-step phase sampling grids, study of the displacement law for moving objects by random sampling of disturbed wavefronts and recording of incoherent holograms, on the one hand, and construction of average letters for comparison between manuscripts, average Fourier holograms, and power spectra, on the other hand.

A combined microfluorometric, microspectrophotometric and autoradiographic method was used to determine the glycogen content, measured as the fluorescence intensity after a fluorescent periodic acid‐Schiff reaction (F‐PAS), of erythroblasts in homozygous β‐thalassaemia. F‐PAS‐positive erythroblasts were found most frequently in the G1‐phase of early polychromatic erythroblasts and seem to account for the increased number of cells in this phase of DNA‐synthesis in β‐thalassaemia as compared to normal. The fraction of F‐PAS‐positive G1‐early polychromatic erythroblasts was higher and the glycogen content of F‐PAS‐positive cells was greater in severe as compared to less severe cases, which seems to be of prognostic importance. It is postulated that the accumulation of glycogen represents a storage of unutilized energy in erythroblasts that are blocked in the G1‐phase of the cell cycle. Copyright © 1973, Wiley Blackwell.

Placental and fetal fuel needs are minimal at this stage. After day 12 until term, insulin effectiveness progressively deteriorates, adipose tissue fatty acid formation from glucose declines to 1/3 of control, and maternal fat stores are increasingly mobilized as free fatty acids. These events are closely synchronized with the growth of the feto-placental unit. These results indicate that maternal fat storage is promoted by increases in food intake and plasma insulin at mid-term. Despite continuation of hyperphagia and hyperinsulinism into late gestation, maternal fat storage declines because of diminished tissue responsiveness to insulin. This mechanism is viewed as an adaptation for fetal growth whereby ingested glucose is diverted away from maternal tissues to the fetus. At the same moment, previously stored lipids are mobilized to provide an alternative energy source to the mother. © 1973 by The Endocrine Society.",,"carbon; fatty acid; glucose; insulin; lipid; adaptation; adipose tissue; animal; article; blood; feeding behavior; female; fetus; glucose blood level; metabolism; organ weight; placenta; pregnancy; rat; time; Adaptation, Physiological; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Blood Glucose; Carbon Isotopes; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Fetus; Food Habits; Glucose; Insulin; Lipids; Organ Weight; Placenta; Pregnancy; Rats; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015607674

Serious impairment of learning as well as depression of spontaneous activity, depolarization of the cortical cells, disappearance of the evoked responses, changes in unit activity and alteration of energy metabolism are among the detectable features of this phenomenon called cortical spreading depression (CSD) by its discoverer LEÃ (1944). For reviews on CSD see Marshall(1959); Burést(1962); Ochs (1962). The inhibitory effect of CSD on the incorporation of the labelled amino acids into the proteins of the rat cerebral cortex has been reported (Ruščák1964; Bennett and Edelman, 1969; Křivánek, 1969, 1970) and the distribution of the effect among the crude subcellular fractions was studied by Křivánek(1970). Possible involvement of macromolecules, particularly proteins in memory formation and storage has been claimed. It was tempting to see whether the proteins of some mitochondrial subfractions namely nerve endings particles and pure mitochondria, could reveal a differential susceptibility to the potassium action which, in vivo, induces such profound changes in the brain cortex function.

Structural changes between a disordered and a more ordered state and the concomitant large change in many material properties offer the possibility of using amorphous semiconductors for high-density information storage and high-resolution display devices. The structural changes can be initiated by various forms of energy such as an electrical pulse, a short light pulse, or a brief light exposure. Many materials show good structural reversibility. The sensitivity of an amorphous photo structural film is amplified by several orders of magnitude by first forming a latent image by photonucleation and subsequent dry development by heat or radiation.

Rough approximations based on various types of averaged values of weather and seasonal variables have previously been developed, but the reliability of such methods and results is open to question. The authors have therefore made a rigorous analysis of projected solar heating costs in eight U.S. cities and have optimized the heating system design in each location. The analysis involved the use of a high speed computer and approximately 400,000 hourly observations in eight cities of radiation, temperature, wind, solar altitude, cloud cover, and humidity. Equations for performance of flat plate solar collectors and sensible heat storage systems were developed and programmed with the above weather variables and with eight design parameters comprising house size, collector size, storage size, collector tilt, number of transparent surfaces in collector, hot water demand, insulation on storage unit, and thermal capacity of collector. Capital and operating costs were quantitatively related to heating system design parameters, and the values of all design variables which yielded lowest annual heating cost in each city were then selected. The findings are presented in the form of two tables and ten graphs, showing heating costs as functions of various design and location factors. The relative importance of each factor is discussed, and the overall costs of solar heating are compared with the costs of conventional heat supply in each location. The method for designing the least-cost combination of solar and conventional heat supplies is also shown, and an example of the use of the method is presented. © 1973.",,"DATA PROCESSING; HOUSES - Space Heating; SOLAR RADIATION - Collectors; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015585085

The stored magnetic energy may be represented in terms of a per-unit magnetic energy parameter, having the dimension of seconds, analogous to the representation of stored kinetic energy in terms of the per-unit inertia constant, H. It is found that for most conventional synchronous machines, operating at 60 Hz, the magnitude of the stored magnetic energy is about three decimal orders of magnitude less than the stored kinetic energy. A general power flow diagram for a synchronous machine, showing the roles of both the internal magnetic and kinetic energy storages, is presented. The rate-of-change of stored magnetic energy is determined not only by the rate-of-change of field flux, but also by the deviations in rotor velocity about synchronous speed. Variations in stored magnetic energy occurring during machine rotor oscillations are seen to be decoupled from the variations in electro-magnetic torque described by the machine swing equation.

There was no evidence of “uncoupling” 2 nor of aberrant mitochondrial energy metabolism”3 in the mitochondria of either breed of pig. The difference observed between the two breeds in mitochondrial cytochrome c content, in the State 3 rate of oxidation of succinate and of ascorbate plus tetramethyl‐p‐phenylenediamine (TMPD) and in the maximum time of mitochondrial storage in situ, could be attributed mainly to differences in initial muscle pH values and in the subsequent rates of pH decline post‐mortem. With both breeds of pig intact mitochondria could still be isolated from LD muscle even after prolonged storage as long as the ultimate tissue pH was not below 5.5. Prolonged storage of mitochondria in situ caused a loss of mitochondrial cytochrome c, which was responsible for a decline in the State 3 respiration. The latter could be restored by addition of cytochrome c and ADP. The cytochrome oxidase activity (e.c. 1.9.3.1) was the most stable to post‐mortem ageing both in situ (1 °C) and in vitro (0 °C), and the NAD+‐linked oxidation of pyruvate plus malate, the least stable. The small observed differences in immediate post‐mortem mitochondrial function between SR and markedly SS pigs cannot possibly account for the very large differences in post‐mortem biochemical behaviour and particularly not for the low initial pH and high rate of post‐mortem pH fall, characteristic of SS pigs showing the pale, soft and exudative (PSE) condition.

However, they differed in that at low nitrogen levels the perennating organ (corm) took priority in R. bulbosus with sexual reproduction assuming greater importance at the higher nitrogen levels, whereas in R. repens the main storage organ (the stock) was not especially favoured at low nitrogen levels reflecting perhaps the differences between this structure and the corm in R. bulbosus. In R. repens the greatest response to nitrogen was shown by the stolons although this was due to increased branching and a higher dry weight per unit length at the higher levels of nitrogen (50 and 200 ppm). Primary stolon length was not greatly affected by nitrogen level. Dry weights of flowers and fruits in R. repens were very much lower than in R. bulbosus.It is suggested that in R. bulbosus the emphasis lies first in replacement of the parent at approximately the same site by a daughter from the new corm and secondly in sexual reproductive spread. In R. repens lateral spread by vegetative propagation takes precedence over all else and under low nitrogen conditions branching is sacrificed and energy is diverted to maintaining long primary stolons. These, in turn, have the potential for producing daughter plants at some distance from the parent and this may be of considerable importance in field situations since the daughter may come to occupy more favourable sites than the parent. © 1973 Oxford University Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003031570

Origins and insertions of the relevant muscles (DAVIDS, 1952) and ligaments, the courses of the muscle fibres, the aponeurotic fibres, the ligaments and ligament fibres and the structure of the bony elements and joints as well as their range of movement, are described. Electromyography and cinematography were used to investigate the muscle activities and movements in three functions of the kinetic apparatus: the straining of fine-grained food in water, the pecking of dry coarse-grained food, and drinking. In relatively constant periods of repetitive actions average pictures of the movements and muscle activities were made for straining. For drinking, the shortest scene was taken as a basis for constructing an average picture. The activity of a muscle was quantified relatively by dividing the difference between the minimal and maximal amplitudes in three steps. This method results in average graduated block diagrams, which were prepared for 18 muscles during straining and drinking and combined with the average synchronized movements. These movements concerned the maxilla and the mandible, with reference to the skull and each other, and the distance between the tips of the beak. Straining is described on the basis of an α and a β cycle model and drinking by two other models: the odd and even postphase cycle model. The movements of the quadrate proved to be critical in these models, since these movements determine the position of the fulcrum between the quadrate and the mandible. Five groups of muscles can be distinguished, delivering respectively: 1. power for opening, 2. guiding for opening, 3.’s treamlining’ for the transition from opening to closing, 4. power for closing, 5. guiding for closing. The assumption of coupled kinesis proposed by VON KRIPP (1933a) and BOCK (1964) is partially applicable here to the first part of opening the beak. The closing system can be loaded by the tension of active skull adductors and unloaded by the effect of the quadrate adductors and of the ventrolateral and ventromedial pterygoid muscles on the position of the fulcrum between mandible and quadrate. This can result in very high acceleration of movement. The same is shown for the opening system, i.e., loading by the depressors and unloading by the effect of depressors and protractors on the position of the fulcrum. The system is double-coupled, which makes very rapid, guidable, and repeated movements possible. The models for drinking indicate that the guiding system can lead to two modes of application of the forces of the power muscles. An attempt is made to specify quantitatively the α model in a first approximation. The results of this quantification improve the qualitative α model. A distinction is made between “guiding” and “power” muscles on the basis of the differences in structure and functioning of the skull adductors and quadrate adductors in the α and β models. The differences between the characteristics of these muscles are indicated and partially explained. To this end, for in vivo active pinnate muscles the length-tension diagram for in vitro tetanically activated muscles of HILL (1953) is modified such that the maximum available total contraction force can be realized in slightly lengthened pinnate muscles. In addition, the conclusion reached by Ernst (1963) concerning the absence of storage of elasticity in tetanically activated pinnate muscles, was modified for in vivo active pinnate muscles such that for a very short time during very fast stretching and motoneuronal activity, elastic energy as such is stored and is very briefly available. When the patterns for straining, pecking, drinking, and remaining plural and singular actions are compared, in a first approximation the realization of these actions requires only a few more basic macrovariations than the 4 models mentioned. It is necessary to quantify these basic macrovariations to obtain an insight into the totality of mechanical kinetic demands made by the functioning of the feeding apparatus. © 1973, Brill.

At each storage temperature the tubers were allowed to reach a steady state before transfer to another temperature. In potatoes transferred from +10° to +2°, the sugar at first rose rapidly and then reached a constant value after 30 days. The respiration showed a characteristic pattern, for the first 5-8 days being below the initial value, then rising to a maximum at 14 days and finally returning to the initial value at 28 days. In potatoes transferred from +2° to +10° the sugar declined steadily, the respiration reaching a maximum after 10 days and then slowly falling to a value slightly above the initial value. Quantitative analysis of the results showed that the sum of starch + sugar + CO2 expressed in equivalent anhydrohexose units did not change throughout the various changes in temperature. This work provided a quantitative experimental basis for what had hitherto been an assumption. Starch was the only polysaccharide involved in these carbohydrate changes. No change in the amylose/amylopectin ratio was detected either during the breakdown of starch (temperature change +10° to +2°) or during its synthesis (+2° to + 10°). The increased respiration which accompanied any change in temperature was related quantitatively to the formation of sucrose from starch (+10° to +2°) and starch from sugar (+2° to + 10°). The ATP equivalent of the extra CO2 output was of the same order as that predicted on the basis of known biochemical pathways linking starch and sugar. © 1973.","energy requirements.; potato; Solanaceae; Solanum tuberosum; starch-sugar interconversion; tuber",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000123124

The customary formulas used to estimate the rate of collision loss assume individual fast particles interacting with relatively cold matter. However, it is quite possible that the solar cosmic rays are not imbedded in 106 K coronal material but rather all particles in the storage region are energetic. Collision times are sufficiently short so that the energy spectrum may approach a maxwellian distribution with kT on the order of 30 keV. If this is the case, the rate of collision loss will be greatly reduced. Bremsstrahlung and magnetobremsstrahlung then will be the important energy losses. To account for the presence of appreciable numbers of MeV particles, it is probably necessary to postulate the existence of a non-thermal tail in the stored particle distribution. © 1972 D.

The simulation experiments were based on two sets of data. The first set was based on a 'typical' June with climatological data extracted for the oceanic region slightly northeast of Barbados. The second set used data from the third phase of project BOMEX, for approximately the same area and time of year as the first set. Comparison with observations of three simulated elements (viz., sea surface temperature and wind and humidity at 6 m) which are important in determining the near-interface energy transports shows that: (a) the model is capable of realistic simulations of both 'typical' conditions, and conditions for a specific four-day period; (b) the model is capable of realistically simulating the differences between prevailing values of these parameters in the two cases ('typical' and specific four-day period). The simulated interface fluxes are those of incoming and outgoing short- and long-wave radiation; transmitted radiation at -0.5 m in the ocean, sensible heat transfer into the ocean and air, and latent heat flux of evaporation. Comparison with observational analyses shows that the diurnal variations in net radiation and heat storage in the mixed layer are realistically simulated. The simulated values of evaporation are consistent with other estimates for both 'typical' conditions and specific conditions during this four-day period. The rate of heat storage varies between +51 and -37 percent of the diurnal maximum incoming radiation, and the evaporation varies between +16% and -13% of this term. The non-dimensional transfer coefficients (CD, CT, Cq) computed from the model show general agreement with the coefficients calculated from observations in the simulated region (Pond et al., 1971). The simulated vertical profiles of temperature are in general agreement with observed profiles, except in the uppermost portions of the atmospheric boundary layer where deviations of approximately 1.5 C occur. Simulated vertical profiles of wind speed are generally consistent with observed profiles, with the largest deviations appearing to be of the order of 0.5 m s-1. Simulated vertical profiles of the eddy fluxes of sensible heat, water vapor, and momentum are generally consistent with Bunker's (1970) aircraft-based measurements of these quantities. The time averages of these simulated profiles show regular decreases with height, while simulated profiles for specific hours of the day show intermediate maxima and minima, which are also seen in the measured profiles. The vertically integrated kinetic energy budgets of the modelled atmospheric layer are presented through the four terms of the kinetic energy budget, viz., the upper and the lower boundary drags, dissipation, and potential-to-kinetic conversion. The dominant terms in the atmospheric energy budgets are the production and dissipation terms, with kinetic energy being exported both to the overlying atmospheric layer and to the underlying oceanic layer at rates of about 2 to 6% of the production, respectively. Comparisons between the climatological and BOMEX simulations are presented. The vertically integrated humidity budgets are presented for the two simulation experiments. Under 'typical' conditions, the humidity budget reveals an upper boundary flux of about +29% of the lower boundary flux with the vertically integrated advective flux being -59% of the lower flux. For the specific four-day simulation, the upper boundary flux and advection are about +28 and -70%, respectively, of the lower boundary flux. © 1972 D.

The net uptake of noradrenaline occurring in the presence of ATP as well as the adenosine triphosphatase activity of purified membranes isolated from bovine adrenomedullary storage vesicles reach maximal values at pH 7.4. However, the steep pH-dependent enhancement of the enzymatic activity between pH 5.0 and 6.2 does not correspond to any catecholamine uptake. This indicates that the membrane contains two ATPases of which only a small fraction is involved in the catecholamine transport. 2. In the presence of ATP the uptake of noradrenaline by membrane particles is concentration-dependent, but not the release of noradrenaline occurring in the absence of ATP. A concentration ratio of about 1:140 is reached during ATP-dependent catecholamine uptake. 3. The uptake of noradrenaline in the presence of ATP is to some extent stereospecific; (-)-noradrenaline is taken up preferentially. Both influx and efflux are different for the two isomers. The catecholamine release occurring in the absence of ATP is not stereospecific. The results obtained with the isolated membrane support the concept that the decisive step in catecholamine accumulation is the enzymatic, energy-requiring, process that transports catecholamine across the membrane. © 1972 Springer-Verlag.","Active Transport of Catecholamines; Concentration ratios of isolated Membranes; pH Dependency of Amine Uptake and ATP Hydrolysis; Stereospecificy of Amine Uptake; Storage Mechanism of Catecholamines","adenosine triphosphatase; adenosine triphosphate; carbon; noradrenalin; active transport; adrenal medulla; animal; article; cattle; cell membrane permeability; enzymology; membrane; metabolism; pH; stereoisomerism; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adenosinetriphosphatase; Adrenal Medulla; Animal; Biological Transport, Active; Carbon Isotopes; Cattle; Cell Membrane Permeability; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Membranes; Norepinephrine; Stereoisomerism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015271562

We consider a photoconductor with its space-charge region confined near to the surface contacting the ferroelectric; it is taken to be nondegenerate, trapless, and having uniform constant concentrations of fully ionized shallow donors and acceptors. The ferroelectric is assumed to be a perfect insulator. The metal-photoconductor work function function difference is taken to be zero. Poisson's Equation is solved for the photoconductor at the ferroelectric/photoconductor interface. Calculations indicate. that under illumination the voltage drop across the photoconductor is of the order of 0.53 V when a drive pulse of about 7 V is applied to the device. The center of charge is of the order of 10−8 cm away from the interface even though the space-charge layer is distributed from 0.4 to 0.8 μ from the interface. This suggests that the presence of the space charge in the photoconductor under illumination should not hinder switching of the polarization in the ferroelectric. After switching is completed, the applied voltage 1s removed. Under these conditions, due to the space charge in the photoconductor which results from the compensation charge of the ferroelectric at the interface, there will be a voltage drop in the photoconductor. This voltage drop also appears across the ferroelectric It is shown that, when the polarization in the ferroelectric points toward the ferroelectric/photoconductor interface, the voltage across the photoconductor and the ferroelectric is 0.54 V under illumination and 0.82 V under no illumination. In the case when the polarization points away from the interface, the voltage drop across the photoconductor and the ferroelectric is −0.54 V under illumination and −1.35 V under no illumination. The voltage drop across the ferroelectric when the photoconductor is not illuminated, resulting from the spacecharge layers, produces a field in the ferroelectric in direction and magnitude so as to depolarize the ferroelectric. This mechanism of depolarization becomes increasingly significant as the thickness of the ferroelectric is reduced to very thin films. © 1972, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

Guanethidine and debrisoquin were taken up by a saturable energy-dependent process inhibited by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), desipramine, amphetamine, cocaine and quinidine. Amiloride and guanidine entered by a nonsaturable mechanism not affected by metabolic-inhibitors, 5-HT or drugs which interfere with the 5-HT transport process. Unlike guanethidine, amiloride released 5-HT from loaded platelets and accumulation was partly blocked by reserpine. We suggest that guanethidine and debrisoquin probably utilize the 5-HT transport mechanism while amiloride and guanidine enter the cells by diffusion. However, because amiloride released 5-HT from loaded cells some of the bound amiloride may be related to 5-HT binding sites. Evidence for intracellular binding was obtained in efflux experiments. When platelets loaded with amiloride or guanethidine were resuspended and incubated in drug-free plasma, most drug was retained and efflux was not affected by metabolic inhibitors. When the effects of 5-HT, reserpine and amphetamine were tested for their ability to enhance efflux of guanethidine and amiloride we found that only amphetamine was active. It released guanethidine but not amiloride, thus suggesting that a specific type of binding site may be involved. Clearly accumulation of these drugs by platelets is not by means of a continuous uptake and loss mechanism in the outer membrane. © 1972.",,"amiloride; carbon; cholinergic receptor blocking agent; cocaine; desipramine; dexamphetamine; guanethidine; guanidine derivative; iodoacetic acid; isoquinoline derivative; n ethylmaleimide; ouabain; quinidine; reserpine; serotonin; tritium; article; binding site; human; metabolism; thrombocyte; Amiloride; Binding Sites; Blood Platelets; Carbon Isotopes; Cocaine; Desipramine; Dextroamphetamine; Ethylmaleimide; Guanethidine; Guanidines; Human; Iodoacetates; Isoquinolines; Ouabain; Parasympatholytics; Quinidine; Reserpine; Serotonin; Tritium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015361909

For anaerobic ischemia, the kidneys were stored without additional measures; for aerobic ischemia, the ischemic kidneys were persufflated with gaseous O2 or gas mixtures containing O2 via the renal artery or vein (orthograde and retrograde aerobic ischemia respectively). Prior to preservation, the kidneys were flushed with cell-free perfusates. Changes in the metabolic status characteristic of anaerobic ischemia were a decrease in the tissue levels of ATP, creatine phosphate, glycogen, glucose, and the sum of adenine nucleotides, a transitory increase in ADP and AMP, and an increase in the tissue level of lactate. Hypothermia caused a retardation of the anaerobic alterations; the loss of ATP was slowed down by factors of 2 and 9.5 when the temperatures were lowered from 37° to 26° and 6°C, respectively. In aerobic ischemia with orthograde and retrograde persufflation of 100% O2 (persufflation pressure = PP 60 and 30 mm Hg), deviations from a regular metabolic status developed very slowly. While the ATP-level decreased to 50% of the control value within scarcely 30 min of anaerobic ischemia at 6°C, it was almost 48 h before a similar loss of ATP occurred during orthograde aerobic ischemia at 6°C. Reduction of O2 in the persufflation gas to 40 and 21 vol-% resulted in less adequate preservation of the metabolic status. Increasing PP to 100 mm Hg for orthograde persufflation had no effect. An increase in PP to 60 mm Hg for retrograde persufflation resulted in a further delay in the metabolic deterioration. The long-term preservation of a regular metabolic status or the slow deviation of the metabolic pattern from the normal range during ischemia with O2-persufflation indicates a significantly smaller energy deficit than during storage in anaerobic ischemia. It must be attributed to a sufficient aerobiosis in the aerobically ischemic kidney, during which organogenic substrates brought in by the initial perfusion are utilized. © 1972 Springer-Verlag.","Aerobic Ischemia; Anaerobic Ischemia; Renal Metabolism; Renal O2-Persufflation; Renal Preservation","adenine nucleotide; adenosine phosphate; adenosine triphosphate; creatine phosphate; glucose; glycogen; lactic acid derivative; oxygen; aerobic metabolism; anaerobic growth; animal; article; dog; ischemia; kidney; metabolism; tissue preservation; vascularization; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenosine Monophosphate; Adenosine Triphosphate; Aerobiosis; Anaerobiosis; Animal; Dogs; Glucose; Glycogen; Ischemia; Kidney; Lactates; Oxygen; Phosphocreatine; Tissue Preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015454012

Eyestalk removal (and hence removal of a substance probably produced by it) profoundly influences the carbohydrate level of the major storage organ, the hepatopancreas. The changes taking place storage organ, the hepatopancreas. The changes taking place in hepatopancreatic glycogen are reflected in the blood sugar (glycemic) level. The blood-sugar level is also related to dynamic events taking place in the cuticle during the moult cycle. At the intermoult and postmoult stages, the eyestalk factor directs the sugar supply for energy metabolism, and prevents sugar deposition as glycogen in the hepatopancreas. At the premoult stage, the activity of the eyestalk is suppressed by the moulting gland (the ""Y"" organ), as eyestalk ablation does not alter the blood-sugar value or the hepatopancreatic glycogen-level. After the increase at the freshmoult stage due to eyestalk ablation, the blood-sugar level tends to re-attain its previous low level at the postmoult stage. © 1972 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250464038

The original state of the phosphor may be restored by a suitable post-treatment. The phenomenon can be used to store, process and display information. A survey of the radiation sensitivity and properties of irradiated upconverting phosphors has been made. It is concluded that electrons and ionizing radiation produce defects that reduce the lifetime of the excited state of the sensitizer (Yb+3) and therefore interfere with the radiationless transfer of energy from the sensitizer to the activator, which is the basis of the upconversion phenomenon. © 1972 The Metallurgical of Society of AIME.",,"DATA STORAGE, OPTICAL; IR UPCONVERTING PHOSPHORS; PHOSPHORS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015356315

The structure is represented by a cylindrically symmetric magnetic field of finite length. The field is assumed to be approximately force-free. The stability of the field to a kink perturbation is investigated. Flux ropes are rooted in dense photospheric material. So the ends of the field lines are taken to be fixed on rigid boundaries for all perturbations. An energy perturbation method is used and the boundary conditions give a stabilizing effect. It is shown that for a moderate degree of twisting the fields are stable to a kink perturbation. Thus energy can be stored in cylindrical fields prior to release in a solar flare. © 1972 D.

Three types of single-point moorings, conventional catenary-moored SPM buoys, the newly developed single anchor-leg mooring and turret mooring, have been model tested with directional irregular waves simulating limited fetch, open ocean sea conditions. Model tests simulated loaded and ballasted tankers in the range of 28-190 Mdwt, water depths up to 600 feet, and significant wave heights up to 40 feet. A correlation of the potential energy stored by the mooring when the vessel was offset by wave action suggests that this energy is primarily a function of significant wave height and loaded storage vessel displacement and is independent of water depth and the type of single-point mooring system used.

Construction of the PBF has been essentially completed at the AEC's National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS) in southeastern Idaho. The PBF is a unique test reactor for use in the AEC nuclear safety program. It is designed to study the behavior of reactor fuels under a variety of conditions considerably more severe than those to which fuels would normally be exposed in commercial power reactors. The experimental program and related testing approach concentrates on the postulated fuel rod failure sequence and seeks to define the thresholds for failure, and the mode of failure in fuel rod clusters. This facility was designed to meet the radiographical guidelines of the Federal Radiation Council with respect to personnel working at the NRTS and individuals and population groups living beyond the NRTS site boundary. The radioactive waste systems of the facility are being modified to provide greater control over effluent releases. As a result of these modifications, the doses due to releases are expected to be within the newly proposed radiological guidelines and will produce exposures that will be less than one percent of background radiation doses. No adverse short or long term effects on plant, animal or human populations are anticipated as a consequence of either normal operation of the facility or transportation of fuel to and from the facility. Liquid radioactive wastes will be shipped to an onsite processing plant for treatment. All solid radioactive wastes will be packaged for shipment to a controlled storage area. No adverse short or long term environmental effects are anticipated as a consequence of transportation of these wastes. In assessing and balancing the environmental and technical benefits to be gained from the operation of this facility and completion of the experimental program and the environmental and monetary costs associated with its operation and after considering the foregoing range of alternatives and their environmental impacts, it is concluded that the proposed action should be accomplished.",,"environmental health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041167275

USAMERDC, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, has been particularly interested in an improved vehicle mobility for off-highway vehicles, amphibians and engineer equipment through electrical propulsion. Because electrical propulsion drive systems feature individual wheel controls, the supply logistic and construction of such vehicles can be justified in terms of an improved mobility over all types of terrain. Past experience in industry and in the Government has shown that the dc motor propulsion drive is inherently simple to install and to maintain. The dc motor is somewhat heavier than comparable ac motors due to motor speed limitations; however, the dc machine, particularly the series field motor, requires only a simple solid state power processor since the power is processed by the motor's own commutator. Commercial dc traction motors have an excellent high torque starting characteristic which is mandatory for engineer type vehicle propulsion applications. In the mid-speed range, however, presently available dc motor propulsion drives under consideration for the Army have an unsatisfactory acceleration performance when compared to conventional mechanical drive systems which typically comprise a spark or compression ignition engine and a multispeed transmission. In this context the paper discusses this Center s experimental solid state controller and the method employed to improve the acceleration or peak power propulsion profile of an electric vehicle drive using dc series field motors. A power processor for shunt field motors is also described, also able to provide identical propulsion characteristics through storage of kinetic energy in a high speed flywheel. © 1972 IEEE.",,"Choppers (circuits); Commercial vehicles; DC machinery; DC motors; Diesel engines; Electric drives; Electric propulsion; Ground vehicles; Highway engineering; Ignition systems; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Mechanical drives; Off road vehicles; Propulsion; Traction motors; Vehicles; Acceleration performance; Compression ignition engine; Ground vehicle mobilities; Mechanical drive system; Multi-speed transmissions; Propulsion characteristics; Solid state controllers; Starting characteristic; Electric machine control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019468805

The circuit elements, consisting of an inductor, a transistor switch, a diode, and a filter capacitor may be arranged with appropriate topology to yield a voltage step-up converter, a current step-up converter, or a voltage step-up/current step-up converter. The design of a power converter requires making a number of decisions relating to the parameters of the circuit, including choice of semiconductor elements, filter capacitor, magnetic core material, magnetic path configuration and winding wire size. In the past, converter designs generally have required that several trial combinations of core size and permeability be tested by hand calculations. Experience and intuition were relied on to narrow the range of core size and permeability before starting the trial design computations. Recently, several computer-Aided procedures have been described for use in the design. of the inductor for a single type of converter) This paper presents the results of the development of a series of nine programs which may be used to design the inductor in each of three basic converter forms in which the transistor switch is cont rolled by a regulator employing a constant frequency, constant on-Time, or constant off-Time pulse-width modulator.

Critical loads which can tolerate a temporary loss of power can be satisfied by the availability of a standby power source. Essential loads which require controlled transient power supply voltage must include in the system configuration of the uninterrupted power supply, an active energy storage element. There are three basic ways in which the controlled transient uninterrupted DC power supply can be configured. The special features of the three systems are compared and the most suitable application for each system is indicated.

A brief review of the historical development of some of the concepts of substorm generation, and the relative merits of these concepts, are discussed against the background of the large number of observational data now available. Polar magnetic substorms are generated through the intensification of the ionospheric current in a localized region of the westward electrojet. At this time field‐aligned currents flow, linking the ionospheric electrojet and magnetospheric current systems near the inner edge of the plasma sheet. It is now apparent that the north‐south component of the interplanetary magnetic field regulates the flow of energy from the interplanetary medium into the magnetosphere. The magnetotail acts as a temporary storage reservoir for this energy, which is eventually released in substorms. Convection is the physical mechanism that dominates in the distribution of energy in the nightside magnetosphere. The over‐all picture presented suggests that substorms are a drastic mechanism by which energy stored in the nightside magnetosphere is dissipated.

The effects of temperature, residence time, and oxygen content of the gas blanketing the polymer during storage on degradation of PCHDT were determined. The rate of thermal degradation was measured in terms of the rate of decrease of inherent viscosity and the rate of increase of carboxyl end group concentration. Residence time, temperature, and their interaction all contributed significantly to the degradation. For the conditions investigated, the oxygen content of the blanketing gas had no measurable effect on degradation. Analysis of the kinetic data yielded equations based on a random chain scission mechanism. These equations enabled the prediction of inherent viscosity and carboxyl end group concentration as functions of temperature and residence time and the inherent viscosity and carboxyl end group concentration of the original polymer. The activation energies for decrease in inherent viscosity and increase in carboxyl end group concentration of poly (1,4‐cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) were determined as 38.7 kcal/mole, respectively.

This paper discusses some of the problems peculiar to radiochemicals which should be clearly recognized prior to the application of autoradiographic techniques and the interpretation of the data obtained. Many of the problems described in this paper are concerned with tritium compounds which are particularly valuable and widely used for studies involving high resolution autoradiography. The physical (nuclear) properties of tritium, the low maximum beta energy (18 keV) of the radiation and the high maximum specific activity (29 Ci/mg atom of hydrogen), makes tritium the ideal isotope for determining the precise localization of compounds, drugs and hormones for example, in biological specimens. Refinements in autoradiographic techniques which have been developed in recent years have permitted high sensitivity in the detection of the tracer. While the importance of using compounds of known radiochemical purity for any tracer investigation is widely recognized, it is necessary to ensure that the data obtained is related to the radiochemical tracer compound and is not a consequence of the presence of radiochemical impurities. In this paper are therefore described some of the problems which can arise using impure tracer compounds and their effects on the interpretation of autoradiographs. The methods for the determination of purity, for example chromatographic, isotope dilution analysis, autoradiographic and spectroscopic methods are discussed together with some of the difficulties associated with these analytical techniques. The instability of radiochemicals on storage prior to their use is now a well documented phenomenon; it is a particularly severe problem with compounds used in high resolution autoradiographic studies because of the high molar specific activities which are necessary. Factors which determine the rate of self‐decomposition are discussed, such as the molar specific activity of the compounds, the energy of the radiation and the storage conditions selected for the compound. Current methods for minimizing self‐decomposition of radiochemicals are discussed and illustrated by examples. When using tritium compounds, the integrity of the tritium label is often related to the position of the tritium atom(s) in the tracer compound. However, many of the methods used for the preparation of tritium compounds can yield products in which the specificity of the labelling is uncertain. The importance of the specificity of labelling in such tracers in relation to the interpretation of autoradiographic data is therefore also discussed. 1972 Blackwell Science Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985209716

The degree of elasticity and energy capacity decreased, while mechanical hysteresis increased, due to peeling prior to processing. The processed Sebago variety showed greater mechanical hysteresis than the Red LaSoda variety. The apparent elastic properties of processed potatoes exhibited varied trends due to the peeling method and storage as evidenced by the significant interaction of these two main variables. The results obtained suggest that apparent elastic moduli are not reliable indices of the degree of firmness of the peeled and processed Irish potatoes.

The polymers are corona charged, and trapping takes place near one surface. In an attempt to determine the microscopic nature of the traps, a study is made of a polyolefin series of ten polymers. Charge storage is shown to take place mainly along the chains themselves and through caging between neighboring molecules. In addition, the corona itself may produce changes in the polymers to create primary trapping sites. Charge storage stability is a function of electronegativity of the ions, symmetry along the chains, and packing density. The crystal work consists of a study of impurity-vacancy (I-V) dipoles in doped alkali halides, such as KCl:Sm++, EU++, Yb++, and Ca++. The dipoles are field polarized. Analysis of the thermally stimulated dipolar peaks yields relaxation times, activation energies, and dipole concentrations. Other I-V dipole phenomena that may be studied with these techniques are described. A comparison is made between information obtainable from TSC and the more normal dielectric constant-loss tangent measurements, and we conclude that TSC is a valuable aid in the characterization of insulators. These studies also yield information on the basic electrical conduction mechanisms in insulators. The paper concludes with suggestions for further work and practical applications. © 1972, by The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

Fifteen were fed ad libitum and the others were restricted to half that rate, age for age; daily food intakes were recorded. Sequential estimates of body composition were made on each sheep so that protein and energy gains could be obtained for specified age ranges. In the sheep fed ad libitum, food intake increased several fold in the first few months of life but was relatively constant from 4 months despite large increases in body weight. Thus intake per kg¾ declined progressively as the sheep grew. The data for the well fed and restricted groups were combined within each age range and linear regression was used to relate body growth (protein and energy) to food intake, variates being expressed as multiples of body weight (kg¾). Energy gain was zero when intake was 250-590 kj metabolizable energy/day kg¾, depending on age. Wool growth per unit food intake was constant for each sheep throughout the experiment but was twice as great in some sheep as in others and was higher in the restricted group. Efficiency of energy and protein utilization declined at weaning but otherwise did not vary much with stage of growth. Approximately 40 % of energy storage was in protein during milk feeding; after weaning, the fraction declined from 25 to 10% (30 to 20 % including wool protein) as the sheep grew. © 1972, Cambridge University Press.

The body composition of each sheep (water, fat, protein, energy) was estimated from tritiated water space on 13 occasions during this period. To describe the course of growth in individual sheep in terms of the relationships between the various body components and body weight, a model was set up in which 4 phases of growth were distinguished, viz. the milk-feeding phase, the period of rumen development, and a prefattening followed by a fattening ruminant phase. Each phase was represented by a linear equation. Except for phase 1, mean composition within each phase differed significantly between well-fed animals and those which had been given a restricted diet. Individual animals differed in the body weight at which the final phase commenced; the average weight was ca. 31 kg. Fat storage was zero or negative during the main period of rumen development; otherwise the fat and therefore energy content of weight gain increased from phase to phase. The protein and water content of gain was high in phases 1 and 2 and decreased subsequently. Calculations based on data in the literature indicated that, in phase 4, the composition of weight loss was the same as that of weight gain. It is also suggested that the body weight at which this fattening phase commences is related to mature weight, with animals of large ultimate size starting to fatten at heavier body weights than those of small ultimate size. The application of the results to the determination of nutrient requirements is discussed. © 1972, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974307197

Digestibility decreased by 7 units between the lowest and highest feeding level but was not shown to depend on weight or age. Methane production was lower at 5 months of age than subsequently and, in consequence, metabolizable energy decreased from 3.8 kcal/g digestible organic matter at 5 months of age to 3.6 kcal/g at 10 and 14 months.

The young sheep had higher maintenance requirements and therefore lower overall efficiency than adults would have, but had higher net availability of metabolizable energy.

Two procedures that were investigated, random sampling and regression analysis, meet these objectives. Random sampling theory allows the calculation of sample size for any combination of accuracy limit and probability level, once the population type and parameters have been determined. Groundwater withdrawals in the Arkansas River valley in southeastern Colorado exhibit an approximately log normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1.25. Gross annual withdrawal can be estimated within 15% at the 0.90 probability level from a sample of 225 wells (about one‐fourth the number presently monitored). Random samples of actual data show errors that agree closely with errors predicted by sampling theory. Annual withdrawal can be related to certain independent variables using regression techniques. The independent variables used in this study were (1) annual precipitation, (2) total annual canal diversion, (3) annual electrical energy used by pumps, and (4) change in groundwater storage during the irrigation season. The standard errors of estimate of the four regressions, which used four or five data points each, ranged from 8900 ac ft/yr for the relation between annual withdrawal and change in groundwater storage during the irrigation season to 17,700 ac ft/yr for the relation between annual withdrawal and precipitation.

These include pulse compression, variable delay, storage, pulse recall, and pulse frequency changing. However, none has reached product engineering status due to lens effects, low dynamic range, and the very limited range of available parameters which are all manifestations of the nonellipsoidal YIG geometry. In contrast, within the past four years Rayleigh type acoustic waves propagating in piezoelectric crystals at VHF/UHF frequencies have already led to practical devices, notably, color television filters and pulse compression loops. Nevertheless, delay lines exceeding 100 microseconds and programmable rime-domain filters of dynamic range greater than 50 dB have proved difficult to realize. This paper proposes a new approach to harness practically the known versatility of magnetic materials. Rayleigh type acoustic waves are utilized propagating at VHF/UHF frequencies in epitaxial films of YIG possessing ellipsoidal geometry grown on nonmagnetic single crystal substrates. Here acoustic waveguides can be fabricated readily in low loss media by selective etching techniques and programmability obtained by adjustment of the bias magnetic field. In common with acoustic waves in piezoelectrics, the philosophy is adopted that the wave should be predominantly acoustic with an energy admixture of less than 5 percent (in this case magnetic) for transduction and tapping purposes. Examples of the realization of devices for both frequency time-domain processing are delineated, and areas are highlighted where further research is necessary.

A continuously running frequency source combined with counting, storage, and display devices results in a clock. Time scales are obtained by setting clocks with respect to a convenient origin. The accuracy of a primary frequency standard is a combined theoretical and experimental assessment of the uncertainties of all known possible sources of bias from the idealized definition. Recommended standard measures for the stability are the spectral density of fractional frequency fluctuations (frequency domain) and the two-sample no-dead time Allan variance (time domain). The operation of atomic frequency standards is based on various methods of particle interrogation to observe the transitions, particle confinement to obtain sufficient interaction time, and particle preparation to obtain the desired energy level populations. Passive resonator and active oscillator (maser) modes of operation are discussed; the former has some fundamental advantages. A review of the state of the art and current practice shows that cesium beam resonator standards have the best documented accuracy capability (5 X iO-13) and, in their commercial versions, are presently the best available clocks. There are three concepts related to time: time interval, date, and synchronization. In order to assign dates to events, time scales have to be established. The steadily growing need for a very precise and uniform time scale has resulted in a new internationally coordinated time scale, IAT. Frequency metrology will have increasing impact on both length and voltage metrology in the near future.

The problem is seen in terms of the nutrition of flowering plants, the growing cells of which are essentially heterotrophic, and the solutes of which are progressively acquired and redistributed during ontogeny. This is traced from the zygote in the embryo sac to an established plant body with its evident 'source-sink' relationships and physiological 'division of labour' between organs. The evidence accrued from aseptic cultures which were manipulated to reveal the range of solutes in cells which simulated the normal course of development in situ as they multiplied, vacuolated, enlarged, and eventually matured. The regulatory control exercised by cells in these developmental stages over the total osmotic value and the relative composition of their solutes (organic and inorganic) is both described and interpreted. The reversible changes that may occur (within a regulated osmotic value) in the solutes of established cells as they replace sugars by salts of organic acids, by organic nitrogen compounds, or by alkali halides are both described and related to events that occur in the developed plant body. Particular significance is attached to the consequences of the normal need of land plants to acquire nitrogen from nitrate and of the intervention of reduced nitrogen under circumstances in which the need for non-metabolizable ions (e.g. alkali halides) is, thereby, drastically curtailed. Cells in multiplication require energy to create new structure and do not emphasize the accumulation of solutes in bulk; however, when they enlarge, energy is obligated to the storage of solutes (organic and inorganic) to support their cytoplasm which is being 'spread out thin'. These events involve more than the properties of membranes, or their relations to individual ions or molecules, for they require an understanding of cells as compartmented, metabolic, and osmotic machines, and of their variously obligated energy relationships. Moreover, the subject now needs to be seen as an aspect of the over-all nutrition of cells, organs, and organisms as they grow and develop. © 1972 OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956983494

The chapter elaborates on the several programmes that allow iterative analysis of spectra that follows one of the two basic approaches. Any iterative programme has to be used successively in two modes. First, given the type of spin system (ABC, etc.) and a set of parameters (chemical shifts and coupling constants), which it is hoped approximately the true values, the computer will set up and solve the secular equations, determining the energy levels and coefficients, and hence calculate the frequencies and intensities of the lines in the predicted spectrum: this is the non-iterative mode. The chapter describes the systems without equivalent spins. When a spin system contains magnetically equivalent nuclei, the calculation may be simplified. Firstly, when there is a group of three or more magnetically equivalent spins, the number of distinct energy levels is reduced. Secondly, the solution of the secular equations is broken down into smaller parts. Both these effects, if properly used, will reduce both the computer storage requirements, and also the computing time. Chemical equivalence appears to be more common than magnetic equivalence in well-resolved spectra susceptible to analysis. © 1971, Academic Press Inc.

This follows the lines of an earlier work by Gibson et al. We have extended their investigation to collisions with subthreshold energies using a new computer program particularly suited for low-energy processes. The atomic interaction is approximated by a purely repulsive Born-Mayer potential together with surface forces applied to the boundary of the crystallite. The mechanical equilibrium of vacancy, interstitial, and many Frenkel-pair configurations has been determined. There are 74 lattice sites around a (split) interstitial which are unstable for a vacancy. The formation energy (2.79 eV) of a stable Frenkel pair turns out to be practically independent of the distance between vacancy and interstitial. The effect of subthreshold collisions on point defects has been studied. At low-energy transfers (acirc; 0.3 eV) only vibrations can be excited. The (split) interstitial exhibits several localized modes: (i) an axial vibration, (ii) a twofold degenerate librational mode, and (iii) a twofold degenerate c. m. oscillation perpendicular to the axis. The energy storage in the axial mode is about 20% of the initial energy transfer. Jumps of point defects are induced by energy transfers of acirc; 0.3 eV for interstitials and acirc; 0.6 eV for vacancies. The directional dependence of these energy thresholds has been studied. The cross section for interstitial jumps due to MeV electrons is roughly 10+4 b.

Correlations with contemporary proton intensity increases at energies above 1 MeV are studied. Classical solar flare events such as those frequently observed from 30°W-60°W in solar longitude are not discussed. Categories of unusual events are defined and examples of each type are given. Discussion of these events centers around the emission and propagation of energetic particles from the point of origin on the Sun to the Earth. The results of this study are the following: (1) The differential electron energy spectrum (0.3-12 keV) from solar flares appears to be a constant of the flare process, with the spectral index γ = (-)3.0 ± 0.2. (2) Particle emission from solar flares contains a prompt component, which is injected into the interplanetary medium beyond the Sun and which is responsible for the diffusion characteristics of solar particle events, and a delayed component which is effectively contained in the lower solar atmosphere where it diffuses typically ≲ ± 100° in longitude and gradually escapes into interplanetary space. The delayed component gives rise to the corotating features commonly observed after the impulsive and diffusive onset from the prompt component. This is not the same as the two component model discussed by Lin (1970a) in which ≈40 keV electrons are often observed as a separate phenomenon and frequently precede higher energy particles observed at 1 AU. (3) Storage of electrons > 300 keV and protons > 1 MeV is essential to explain emission and propagation characteristics of solar particle events. In some rare cases the storage mechanism appears to be very efficient, culminating in a catastrophic decay of the trapping region. (4) The events with low proton/electron ratios all occur at least three weeks after the previous relativistic electron producing flare. © 1972 D.

The essential signatures for the growth phase are a gradual development of the polar vortex type current without remarkable current enhancement in the auroral belt (DP 2 field), and the asymmetric growth of the low latitude field-depression in the eveningmidnight-early morning sector (DRT field). After a distinct DP 2 and DRT fields, drastic changes occur in the substorm development and the expansion phase starts. The expansion phase is characterized by a rapid expansion of the auroral electrojet disturbance (AEJ or DP-B field) in the high latitudes, and a rapid recovery of the field-depression near the midnight meridian and the subsequent asymmetric development of the disturbance field in the low latitudes. Considering the close associations of the interplanetary magnetic disturbance field with the magnetospheric field and particle disturbances which have been confirmed by various authors, it may be concluded that the growth phase is the precursory excitation of the magnetospheric background and the energy-storage or the energy-conversion stage in the magnetosphere due to the non-equilibrium magnetospheric convection, while the expansion phase is the energy-diversion stage in the magnetosphere. The disturbance field in the growth phase is a nucleus-like, fundamental element for the substorm breakup and it is essentially different from the expansion phase disturbance in quality and in quantity. © 1972.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344303249

Although difficulties with the expression of boundary conditions in the solid have not yet been solved rigorously, it is proposed to minimize 1 2 P + (w0/T0) G to find the stable steady state. P is the rate of entropy production, G the Gibbs free energy of the solid, w0 the rate of solidification and T0 the lowest temperature of the system. Only the rate w0 as well as the upper and the lower temperatures of the system can be experimentally fixed. This result expresses the competition which exists between the internal production of entropy and the storage of free energy in the solid as non-equilibrium structural components. Coupled with approximate solutions of the chemical and thermal diffusion problems the new condition, when applied to the eutectic solidification problem, leads to relationships between γ and w0 and between ΔT and w0.

Data on the behavior of mud and sand under high pore-fluid pressures support this concept. Extending the analysis of Goguel and Bucher, it is proposed that such pressures in a specific rock formation can initiate a diapir and drive it to the cryptoexplosion stage. As this formation moves laterally and radially inward to supply the diapir core, viscous coupling with overlying strata will cause these strata to move inward too. Both in the focal zone where the diapir forms and in the collar region through which the central uplift must be forced, there are strong inward horizontal confining stresses. To understand the subsequent behavior of this highly compressed vertical column of rock, data on the behavior of compressed metals and rocks are used. When fluid under high pressure surrounds a metal billet in an extrusion container, increased hydrostatic stress induced in the billet makes the metal capable of an increasingly ductile behavior. Extrusion under these conditions is termed hydrostatic extrusion. The movement of the central uplift can be compared to a hydrostatic extrusion process. If a sufficient compressive strain energy is stored in the upward-moving rock column, Luders band phenomena are expected where the compressed column approaches the earth's surface and encounters a zone of sudden, marked relief from the horizontal confining stresses. The large deviatoric stress acts within a very narrow Luders front, which moves downward relative to the rising extruded rock. Luders fronts are a very special category of shock front, and this mechanism can account for the so-called shock deformation textures, characteristic of central uplifts of cryptoexplosion structures. Shatter cones are also explained through penetration of tensile joints into the plastic zone where Liiders bands form. Certain other workers have deduced that the shock front must be associated with meteorite impact, but this deduction is thought to be in error. Violently formed breccias and pseudotachylites are also accounted for in this category of diapir; it forms a consistent internal mechanism for generating cryptoexplosion structures.",,"Billets (metal bars); Digital storage; High energy forming; Hydraulics; Meteor impacts; Rocks; Shock waves; Strain energy; Stress-strain curves; Tensile strength; Textures; Compressed column; Compressive strain; Deformation texture; Deviatoric stress; Hydrostatic extrusions; Hydrostatic stress; Lateral confinement; Pore fluid pressure; Metal extrusion; breccia; diapir; ductile deformation; fluid pressure; penetration test; plastic deformation; rock mechanics; shatter cone; tensile strength; uplift; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042351817

It is concluded that no methods presently in use are acceptable as either realistic models of mating rock joints or as mass production methods for the development of large, highly jointed models of rock masses. A method is described for producing mating tension fractures in a weak, brittle model material using a large guillotine device. Parallel sets of model joints can be produced which are continuous, cross-jointed or offset (stepped) depending upon the chronological order of fracturing. The direct shear properties of these three types are compared and evaluated. The model results are used as a basis for predicting the full-scale (1: 500) displacements accompanying shear failure of a 96-ft long prototype tension joint. Recent numerical modelling of jointed rock masses has been based on assumed values of the shear and normal stiffness of the joints. These components are found to dominate the elastic deformation properties of the intact rock. The results of shear and normal stiffness tests on the model joints are used for a careful assessment of these quantities. The shear stiffness (peak shear stress per unit tangential displacement) is found to be both normal stress and size dependent, and this is confirmed by a survey of shear-test data for joints in rock. There appears to be an inverse proportionality between test dimension and shear stiffness, for a given normal stress. The normal stiffness (normal stress per unit closure) is found to be dependent on the preconsolidation or virgin normal stress level. The problems of simulating the behaviour of jointed rock masses by the finite-element method are reviewed. Two particular drawbacks seem to be the conservation of energy demanded during computation, and the computer storage problems involved in modelling dilatent joints. Both these features are of fundamental importance to rock-mass deformation. A move towards realistic physical modelling is considered essential to an understanding of real processes. © 1972.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037701272

Freshly‐isolated rat liver mitochondria have a respiratory control ratio of 4 with succinate. During storage at 0—4 °C the respiratory control ratio decreased progressively to 1.0 after 90 h fromthe preparation. During storage there was also an increase in the conversion of mitochondrial phos phatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine to their corresponding lysoderivatives. The local anesthetic nupercaine (recently shown to be a powerful inhibitor of phospholipase A2 in a variety of systems) was effective in both stabilizing energy‐linked functions of isolated mitochondria and maintaining the integrity of mitochondrial phospholipid. After 90 h aging at 0—4 °C, the respiratory control ratio of mitochondria treated with 400 μM nupercaine was nearly unchanged and the breakdown of mitochondrial phospholipid markedly reduced. Nupercaine alone can effectively substitute for either EDTA or bovine serum albumin, which are routinely used to improve the stability of isolated mitochondria. As the mitochondrial phospholipase A2 is activated by Ca2+ and free fatty acids, we suggest that the presence of these agents improves mitochondrial stability by preventing activation of the enzyme. We conclude that endogenous phospholipase activity is largely responsible for the damage to aged mitochondria, which results in a loss of their energy‐linked functions. The addition of nupercaine during storage makes it possible to maintain rat liver mitochondria tightly coupled for long periods of time. We also suggest that the use of nupercaine should prove generally useful in preserving the structure and functions of other biological membranes containing phospholipase A2 during their preparation and storage.

The rationale of the light-to-dark experiment is to separate in time the immediate effects of light, especially electron transport, from steps in the phosphorylation reaction itself. It can be used to demonstrate the point of action of given reaction mixture components, and of activators or inhibitors of phosphorylation. In the acid-to-base technique, chloroplasts are found to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate (ADP) without illumination if they are placed at pH 4 for a short time, then transferred to pH 8.5. This result is an evidence confirming phosphorylation of ADP driven by a pH gradient. The technique is called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation because of a “pH jump.” The existence of acid denaturation sets the lower pH limit for effective ATP synthesis. The acid-base transition is observed to cause chloroplasts to emit light, and the energy storage of the pH jump might be somehow translated into chlorophyll activation to the excited state level, followed by fluorescence. © 1972, Elsevier Inc.

Any surplus carbohydrate and fat is rapidly removed from the circulation by deposition in the form of storage compounds (glycogen and triglyceride). As amino acids cannot be stored in major amounts their concentration in blood and tissue rises, and owing to the high Km value of the enzymes initiating the degradation of the amino acids a rise in their concentration automatically increases the rate of degradation. Another regulatory principle is the adaptive changes in enzyme capacity, which is particularly effective for the essential amino acids. On the one hand, they can cause an accelerated decomposition of surplus amino acids; on the other hand, the enzyme capacity can fall to such low values that the essential amino acids are effectively preserved. The rapid removal of surplus carbohydrate is partly due to glycogen synthesis and partly due to the ""glucose fatty acid cycle"". This is not a metabolic cycle but a storage cycle. The section of the cycle leading to the formation of triglyceride from glucose occurs when there is a surplus of carbohydrate, and the release of fatty acid occurs on fasting. The energy loss incurred in the transformation of carbohydrate to triglyceride is less than 7% of the utilizable energy (i.e. of the ATP obtainable). The main direct fuels of tissue oxidation are glucose, fatty acids, ketone bodies, amino acids and lactate. Some tissues (which are listed) depend on glucose as the main fuel; others obtain most of their energy from the oxidation of fatty acids; some can utilize ketone bodies as a major fuel. For many tissues quantitative information on the fuel of respiration is lacking. Relatively little is known about the extent to which amino acids can serve directly as sources of energy in the various tissues. The degradation of the majority of amino acids is initiated by an amino transferase reaction, and systematic measurements of the capacity of various amino transferases in rat tissues, and the variations caused by a high-protein or high-carbohydrate diet, are reported. While the activity of the amino transferases is generally highest in the liver, other organs can also degrade many amino acids rapidly. In the case of the branched-chain amino acids the liver is a minor site. The physiological significance of this phenomenon is discussed. The roles of lactate, ethanol, acetate, and glycerol as fuels of oxidation in various tissues are surveyed, as are the regulatory factors which determine the selection of fuels when a variety of fuels is available. © 1972.",,"alcohol; amino acid; carbohydrate; fatty acid; glucose; glycogen; lactic acid derivative; lipid; protein; animal; biological model; blood; human; kidney; kinetics; liver; mammal; metabolism; muscle; rat; review; spleen; Amino Acids; Animal; Carbohydrates; Ethanol; Fatty Acids; Glucose; Glycogen; Human; Kidney; Kinetics; Lactates; Lipids; Liver; Mammals; Models, Biological; Muscles; Proteins; Rats; Spleen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015448896

To separate any transmutation effect from the known genetic effect of the accompanying beta radiation, 14C-labeled spermatozoa were stored in unlabeled females under conditions of sufficient dilution to give in significant radiation from other labeled sperm cells and seminal fluids. There was also minimal absorption of beta radiation from beta decay within each cell as most ionizations occurred beyond the limits of the thin cylindrical Drosophila sperm cell (0.3μ × 9 μ). Therefore, we were able to label with a dose higher than the lethal limit in a generally labeled experiment. Our highest dosage was obtained by pulse labeling larvae with uniformly labeled [15C]thymidine and produced a total of 600 14C disintegrations per sperm cell or 80 per Y- or X-chromosome euchromatin during a 3-week storage period in unlabeled females. The following genetic tests were conducted: (1) loss of a dominant marker on the Y-chromosome which could result from breakage followed by loss of the chromosome tip to loss of the entire chromosome; (2) sex-linked recessive lethals observed in the F2, F3 and F4. All of these genetic tests were negative in that they showed no significant increase in the mutation rate in progeny from sperm stored for 3 weeks over progeny from unstored sperm cells. In a previous experiment with transmutation of 32P we obtained positive results in the F3, a consequence of F1 females with mosaic gonads. The negative results in the present experiment with 14C could be due to the lower energy of the recoil nuclide or to position within the DNA molecule. That 80 14C disintegrations in the DNA per X- or Y-chromosome did not produce a detectable genetic effect is evidence for the stability of the eukaryote chromosome and the efficiency of its repair systems. © 1972.",,"carbon; DNA; thymidine; animal; article; Drosophila melanogaster; female; larva; lethal gene; male; metabolism; mosaicism; mutation; recessive gene; sex chromosome; spermatozoon; Animal; Carbon Isotopes; DNA; Drosophila melanogaster; Female; Genes, Lethal; Genes, Recessive; Larva; Male; Mosaicism; Mutation; Sex Chromosomes; Spermatozoa; Thymidine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015413070

The effects of ion dose (1012-1014 cm-2) oxide thickness (500-1000 Å), and post implantation annealing treatment on the capacitance-voltage and current-voltage characteristics were studied. A significant flatband voltage shift is observed for ion doses larger than 1013 cm-2. Most of the interface states created by the implantation damage anneal at 400°C (ss ∼ 1010 cm-2 for oxide thickness 750 Å). The carrier transport mechanism of the implanted SiO2 layer is converted from Fowler-Nordheim tunneling conduction to Frenkel-Poole bulk conduction with a trapping energy level 1·2 eV below the oxide conduction band. From these mechanisms the flatband voltage shift due to electrons trapped at assumed localized Au charge storage centers is predicted. This reversible shift is experimentally confirmed by C-V measurements. The time required for a 1 V flatband shift is about 10-3 sec when a field of 107 V/cm is applied. Thus the resulting MOS structure behaves similarly to a floating gate or multilayer device with obvious simplifications in the processing. It is believed that improvements in reducing the charging time and the writing voltage may be realized by the use of thinner oxides in conjunction with lower implantation energies. © 1972.",,"FILMS - Dielectric; CARRIER TRANSPORT; STORAGE EFFECTS; TRANSISTORS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015402726

Recent phase diagram data based on the garnet oxides in pbO-B2O3 fluxes show’ that high orders of compositional and growth temperature control are required for reproducibility but are within the state of the art. Defect control, which is closely related to dislocation formation, seems not to be a limiting problem, attributable largely to the high energy of formation of dislocations in the garnets. Thus, even interfacial or mismatch dislocations do not form in these heteroepitaxial structures.

This model assumes (a) that highly effective uncouplers dissolve in the membrane, whereas less effective uncouplers remain largely in aqueous solution; (b) that a high affinity exists between respiratory chains and ""low energy states""; (c) that maximal respiration requires the presence of only a small number of low-energy states and forms high-energy from low-energy states; (d) that uncouplers act by a bimolecular ""collision"" process without binding. In this model, respiratory chains must be capable of driving energy equivalents into a storage mode, with no effect on respiration rate until the store is almost filled. Results obtained with 2,4-dinitrophenol and S-13 show that the shapes of curves obtained when uncoupler concentration is plotted against respiration rate are the same for both ""stoichiometric"" and classical uncouplers. Mouse liver mitochondria, in the absence of added cations, showed a ""titration"" response to both dinitrophenol and S-13. Differences are: (1) the dinitrophenol titration point (approximately 35 μm) is less dependent on mitochondrial concentration than that of S-13 (approximately 0.09 μm) (for 1 mg of protein/ml); (2) a ""lag"" phase of some 30 sec occurs with S-13 at concentrations (approximately 0.1 μm) giving the same uncoupling effect as 50 μm-dinitrophenol (which shows no lag phase). Cytochrome b reduction level continues to fall upon DNP addition, and the rapid decline in per cent reduction of cytochrome b by a given increment of DNP ceases at approximately 35 μm DNP, the concentration required for maximal respiration rate. Under some circumstances the release of respiration by uncoupler in the presence of azide shows an apparent titration independent of the final rate of respiration. This is true for DNP as well as for the apparent ""stoichiometric"" uncouplers. It is suggested that this does not necessarily identify a more specific uncoupling reaction than that observed in the absence of azide. The apparent release of azide inhibition by uucouplers is attributed to changes in the steady state level of cytochrome reduction on passing from state 3 to the uncoupled state, and to an oligomycin-like effect of azide on the mitochondrial ATPase. © 1972.",,"2,4 dinitrophenol; adenosine diphosphate; antibiotic agent; azide; cytochrome; nitrile; phenylhydrazine derivative; uncoupling protein; animal; article; chemical model; drug effect; in vitro study; kinetics; liver mitochondrion; mathematics; metabolism; mouse; oxygen consumption; polarography; rat; spectrophotometry; Adenosine Diphosphate; Animal; Antibiotics; Azides; Cytochromes; Dinitrophenols; In Vitro; Kinetics; Mathematics; Mice; Mitochondria, Liver; Models, Chemical; Nitriles; Oxygen Consumption; Phenylhydrazines; Polarography; Rats; Spectrophotometry; Uncoupling Agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015373478

This loss of function does not correlate with the small decrease in total ATP occurring. Platelet adenine nucleotides probably exist in two pools, one metabolically active and one inactive, so that only 40% of total ATP actually participates in the energy reactions. The metabolic pool was labelled by incubation of platelet‐rich plasma (PRP) in acidified citric acid‐sodium citrate‐dextrose (ACD) with trace amounts of radioactive adenine. Platelets thus labelled in acidified ACD‐PRP were stored in the same medium for 24 hr at 4°C, and the effect of storage on radioactive ATP and on the release reaction induced by collagen and thrombin was studied. The total amount of ATP decreased by only 10% during storage, whereas the metabolic ATP was reduced by 40–50% with a corresponding formation of hypoxanthine. The reactivity in the release reaction also dropped by 50%. When the acidified ACD‐PRP was stored with 9 him inosine a 20% reduction of metabolic ATP and 25% reduction in release ability occurred. Storage with 8 mM adenosine also counteracted the loss in release ability, but 50% of the ATP radioactivity was lost. Adenosine increased the total ATP level during storage. Thus, the metabolic ATP pool might have been preserved intact under these circumstances, while exchange of radioactive ATP with nonradioactive ATP synthesized from adenosine took place. These results indicate strongly that during storage of platelets the metabolic ATP pool is lost by degradation to hypoxanthine in quantities that might well account for the loss in function.

The system traverses a fuel pin past an area-defining slit in a reproducible and accurate manner. Activity from the examined area is detected by a high resolution solid-state detector. Signals from the detector are amplified and routed to single channel analyzers or to a multichannel analyzer. The use of a four-input multichannel scalar permits storage of four specific energy groups versus position. A scan control module controls the operation of a stepping motor which moves the fuel pin axially past the collimator. Limit switches are used to define the scanned area. The control module also advances the multichannel scalar at selected intervals and determines the rate and direction of scanning. The use of a four-input multichannel scalar allows storage of data in four energy intervals from 512 consecutive points on the scanned element. For a typical pin this means that information is stored from 500 consecutive 27.5-mil increments. The unit is designed to scan fuel lengths of up to 50.2 in. in rods up to 84 in. long and from 0.2 to 1.125 in. in diameter. The collected information can be used to determine the distribution of activity in the fuel rod and to infer the relative distribution of specific isotopes. This information can be used to measure fuel burnup, fuel dimensions and power distribution. Other quantities of interest may be inferred from the obtained information.

The nature of the materials and components is such that under the operational conditions imposed, the behavior is often nonlinear, with the result that the application of the usual techniques of mathematical analysis to predict behavior often results in lengthy computations based on assumptions that are somewhat subjective. Although computer techniques have proven very helpful in many instances, they are often limited in scope through size of available computer storage. The direct approach, that of cut-and-try design, is often not appropriate because of the possibility of release of radioactive materials in the event of a faulty design or a failure of the containment or other materials. In addition, economics, as well as safety, usually precludes construction of a complete operating unit without preliminary analysis. Under these conditions of complex mathematical analysis and expensive construction the use of small scale models is suggested as a method of obtaining data from which realistic predictions may be made. In the design of small scale models the theory of similitude is used in the same way that it has been used in many fields of engineering. It is also pertinent to consider current power reactors in the 400-MW range as models of projected reactors in the 2000-MW range. Direct application of the principles of similitude leads to a series of design conditions that cannot be satisfied simultaneously. In such a situation the application of distorted model theory is mandatory. The application of distorted model theory requires the determination of the prediction factors associated with the pertinent distortion factors derived from the significant parameters that are distorted. Evaluation of the prediction factors as functions of the distortion factors may be accomplished experimentally or analytically, and the remainder of the presentation is devoted to consideration of the applicable methods and procedures for determining the prediction factors. The analytical procedures may be classed as those based on well established laws and those based on fundamental principles. Specific illustrations of the application of the principles includes fuel element containment, distortion of primary containment, performance of containment shells as a result of sudden release of energy within or from external disturbances, and thermal strains resulting from loss of coolant and subsequent sudden cooling. As the numerical examples will illustrate, distorted model theory often enables one to make practical judgments concerning which distortions are significant and which will have a trivial influence upon the results. © 1972.",,"MECHANICS; STRUCTURAL DESIGN; NUCLEAR REACTORS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015283106

The glycogen patterns of most of the organs of Calliphora erythrocephala during embryological development are described. In the early embryonic period no distinct increase or decrease is seen in the glycogen content, but a shift in the localization of the glycogen is found. A glycogen-rich peripheral zone is formed in the yolk mass. After the formation of the first organ rudiments, slight differences in glycogen level and localization appear. Only the pole cells show an unequivocal chemodifferentiation, losing their glycogen completely. 2. During differentiation into functioning organs, three glycogen patterns are found: a) Stores are accumulated and then consumed partially or completely. b) Stores are formed but not consumed during subsequent embryonic life. c) No glycogen is stored and the amount already present is consumed. The possible functions of glycogen are discussed. The glycogen initially stored during oogenesis probably serves as energy supply. The storage of glycogen during the mid- and late embryonic periods provides a large supply on the spot for production of precursors of glucose derivatives. All chitin-synthesizing organs store glycogen and use it partially or completely. Cells that have to produce a large amount of chitin, e.g., pharyngeal and proventricular cells, store relatively most of the glycogen. Cells destined to produce large amounts of mucopolysaccharides, e.g., those of the PMP, store more glycogen than cells which, like the AMP, form smaller amounts of mucopolysaccharides. 3. A glycogen stock could be formed along two pathways: the interconversion of lipids into carbohydrates and/or the de-amination of proteins. © 1971 BRILL.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861106588

We discuss the general properties of those models which are based on factorized approximations to the production amplitudes and are in agreement with some general hypotheses like the Feynman scaling law. First the role of phase space arguments is clarified and the importance of detecting correlations in high energy production experiments as an hint for understanding the underlying dynamics is emphasized. Then two peculiar (and, in a sense, complementary) kinds of correlation in two-particle inclusive distributions are examined: the one coming from multiperipheral dynamics with Lorentz pole exchanges, the other due to ""direct channel"" resonances. Some general properties of inclusive distributions are expressed in terms of quantities which are suitable for direct measurement. © 1971.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0348248451

The production of heat and (internal) work and the changes in the amount of phosphocreatine (PCr), ATP, inorganic phosphate (Pi) and sometimes lactate have been measured from moment to moment during and after tetanic isometric contractions of isolated frog muscles at 0° C. 2. Heat production was measured by thermopiles and a novel apparatus was employed for freezing the muscles rapidly at a chosen instant so as to halt the chemical processes before analysis. 3. Using unpoisoned muscles in oxygen, it was shown that neither oxidative recovery processes nor glycolytic ones led to appreciable restitution of PCr or ATP during 15 sec of contraction. However, clear signs of recovery processes could be seen within a minute. In our preparations artificial ‘ageing’ by storage at low temperature did not interfere with the capacity for glycolysis. 4. Our clearest result was that the break‐down of PCr was not nearly large enough to account for the rapid heat production during the first few sec of contraction. By the end of a 15 sec tetanus as much as 10 mcal/g remained unaccounted for. 5. The source of this heat is not clear. At no time is there any sign of net break‐down of ATP; indeed there appears to be a slight increase of ATP in the stimulated muscle. 6. Break‐down of PCr continues both during relaxation and during the minute following, while the muscle is at rest. Thus during contraction there is heat production without PCr break‐down, while subsequently there is PCr break‐down without heat production. © 1971 The Physiological Society",,"adenosine triphosphate; creatine phosphate; iodoacetic acid; phosphate; aging; animal; article; cold; drug effect; freezing; frogs and toads; glycolysis; heat; in vitro study; metabolism; muscle; muscle contraction; oxidation reduction reaction; thermometer; Adenosine Triphosphate; Aging; Animal; Anura; Cold; Freezing; Glycolysis; Heat; In Vitro; Iodoacetates; Muscle Contraction; Muscles; Oxidation-Reduction; Phosphates; Phosphocreatine; Thermometers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015133960

If the depleted cation is restored, the subunit reverts to an active form in a process that is greatly enhanced by heat. Thermally reactivated subunits retain full activity when rechilled, showing that the inactivation and reactivation processes involve changes, presumably conformational, in the subunit itself. Reactivation follows first-order kinetics with respect to the appearance of active subunits, with an Arrhenius activation energy of 26 kcal./mole between 30 °C and 40 °C. On storage at 0 °C, inactive 30 s subunits gradually lose the ability to be reactivated. Part of this loss is due to the oxidation of one or more sulphydryl groups and is prevented or reversed if a sulphydryl reducing agent is included in the storage or the reactivation medium, respectively. Active and inactive 30 s subunits have the same sedimentation coefficient and there is no direct evidence that they differ in conformation. However, two kinds of indirect evidence are in accord with the existence of conformational differences: (a) under appropriate conditions inactive 30 s subunits form dimers sedimenting at 50 s while active subunits do not, and active 30 s subunits associate more readily with 50 s subunits to form 70 s ribosomes; (b) inactive 30 s subunits undergo sulphydryl oxidation much more rapidly than do active ones. Although differing in certain details, the 30 s inactivation and reactivation processes are generally similar to those previously described for the 50 s subunit. Both subunits can exist in active and inactive forms which are easily and reversibly interconverted, suggesting that the structure of the functional ribosome is flexible and easily altered. The interconversions affect a number of ribosomal activities in parallel. It is possible that many previously described phenomena pertaining to ribosomal activity can be interpreted, at least in part, in terms of ribosomal inactivation and reactivation. © 1971.",,"ammonia; cesium; magnesium; phenylalanine; potassium; ribosome RNA; rubidium; transfer RNA; article; DNA denaturation; Escherichia coli; kinetics; metabolism; nucleic acid renaturation; oxidation reduction reaction; protein binding; protein conformation; Ammonia; Cesium; Escherichia coli; Kinetics; Magnesium; Nucleic Acid Denaturation; Nucleic Acid Renaturation; Oxidation-Reduction; Phenylalanine; Potassium; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; RNA, Ribosomal; RNA, Transfer; Rubidium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015223366

The rapid computational procedure and low computer storage requirements for our model calculations enable us to easily compute thermodynamic quantities for cluster configurations and sizes beyond those previously studied. Polyhedron cluster packings and “approximately spherical” cluster packings are used to generate clusters of various configurations. The Einstein theory is used to study the Helmholtz free energy, vibrational energy, and entropy for the various cluster configurations and for cluster sizes up to ∼ 1000 atoms. The model calculations are compared with the predictions based on the capillarity approximation used in nucleation theory.

V-N2 ase was similar to Mo-N2 ase (from Mo-grown cells) in purification procedure, activity requirements, reactions catalyzed, and biphasic Arrhenius plot. V-N2 ase was less active, less stable to heat and in storage, and had a slightly lower activation energy than Mo-N2 ase. Comparison of V- with Mo-N2 ase revealed differences throughout the N2 ase reaction sequence from initial substrate binding to electron transfer and product release, specifically including 1) decreased affinity for reducible substrates and CO, 2) enhanced allocation of electrons to H3O+ at the expense of substrate reduction, and 3) decrease in the C3H6:C3H8 ratio in acrylonitrile reduction. The similarities of V- and Mo-N2 ase suggest the substitution of V for Mo in N2 ase; the differences provide the first basis for implicating Mo directly in N2 ase catalysis and suggest an active site function for Mo. © 1971.",,"carbon monoxide; article; Azotobacter; culture medium; enzymology; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Azotobacter; Carbon Monoxide; Culture Media",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015211208

This report describes the development of such a test method. Creation of noise requires an energy source. The energy source of rear axle noise is the periodic variation in tooth meshing action of the gears. The frequency of axle noise is always related to tooth mesh frequency. A previous study of rear axle gear dynamics indicated the existence of a nearly vertical resonance of rear axle pinions excited by tooth meshing action. The dynamic resonant amplitude of the motion of the pinions related directly to the in-car noise quality of the gear sets. In general, other resonances within the drive line-axle housing-suspension system can be excited by gear action and produce ""axle"" noise. An indication of the amplitude of the resonant member (or another responsive member within the system) directly relates to the relative noise quality of the gear set. To verify this relationship, the dynamic pinion response of a group of 30 axle assemblies was measured. The in-car noise ratings were obtained by using a jury of three experienced raters. The correlation between the dynamic pinion motion measured in a test stand and the in-car noise ratings was found to be very good, indicating the feasibility of using this method in axle plants. A statistical analysis was made of the data to determine the degree of correlation and the validity of the data. Details of the test stand operation, noise rating method and tests results are included in the report.",,"Automobile suspensions; Digital storage; Drive axles; Gears; Rear axles; Testing; Degree of correlations; Energy source; Noise quality; Noise ratings; Periodic variation; Resonant amplitude; Suspension system; Testing method; Suspensions (components)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072502269

Total-P content decreases, that is, inorganic-P increases and acid soluble-P and phospholipid-P decrease. Nucleic acid-P and phosphoprotein-P show no significant change. The major changes in phosphorus intermediates are degraded irreversibly to inorganic-P. 2) In cells growing in sea-water containing high phosphorus compounds, total-P content, inorganic-P, acid soluble-P and phospholipid-P increase. Nucleic acid-P and phosphoprotein-P do not increase. As the concentration of phosphorus increases in the cells, the oxidation-reduction potential becomes more reductive. Polyphosphoric acids are also found in these cells. It is considered that polyphosphoric acids are one form of energy storage. The white wasting disease like symptom does not develop on the frond. 3) It is a well-known fact that total-P content decreases in the tissue growing in low nutrient sea-water. However, the effects of infection on phosphorus metabolism are entirely different from those of malnutrition in nature. In case of malnutrition, the decrease in tissue phosphorus is due to decreased uptake of phosphorus by the tissue. There is no evidence which indicates that the degradation of organic-P to inorganic compounds increases. 4) From the statistical analysis of data obtained for the past ten years in Matsushima bay, it is difficult to find a specific relationship between N and P concentrations in sea-water and the occurrence of the disease. A good correlation exists, however, between the occurrence of the disease and the neap tide. © 1971, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Glucose-6-14C was scarcely incorporated into glycogen in all groups but oxidized to 14C02. When more than 50% of protein was contained in diet, oxidation of glucose-6-14C decreased remarkably, and at the same time blood glucose pool and the extent of randomization of 14C in glucose were increased. From these observations it was suggested that carp possesses the active and reversible Embden-Meyerhof pathway but that glycogen is not a principal storage depot of energy. In the previous paper it was suggested that metabolic correlations among carbohydrate, protein and lipid in carp are substantially different from those already established in mammals, and that carbohydrate is not a primary requirement for energy supply in carp. Though there have been few detailed studies on individual enzymes involved in glucose metabolism in fish, some studies on the multienzyme systems of glucose metabolism have been reported, and the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, the pentose cycle and the TCA cycle in fish appear to be nearly identical with those in mammals. However, the extent of contribution of glucose metabolism to total energy requirement and the detailed features in glucose metablism of fish are still now obscure. In the present paper, the fate of glucose in carp was investigated with glucose-6-14C as a tracer in order to obtain additional evidences on the energy metabolism of carp reported in the previous paper. © 1971, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

The digestibility coefficient of the organic matter, determined in vitro, was 1·6 units lower on average in the oven‐dried samples; this was due partly to the higher crude fibre content and much lower content of soluble carbohydrates in these samples. There were no significant differences in the total ash and crude protein contents of the samples dried by the two methods. A 500 g sample of fresh grass can be dried in 10 min in the microwave energy apparatus; the moisture content of about 10% obtained after drying guarantees a good grinding and storage ability of the samples.

The time scales of fluorescence (10‐‐9 sec) and steady‐state enzymatic turnover (10–2 sec) indicate that energy storage must be involved. Millisecond delayed singlet emission from chlorophyll allows measurement of metastable energy storage at Photoreaction II. Activation of noncyclic electron transport results in more rapid decay and in increase of emission at 10‐‐3 sec, both effects being inhibited by the poison DCMU. These results can be explained by at least three different models of the reaction center: the oxidized chlorophyll model, the chlorophyll triplet model, and the two‐quantum electron‐hole model.

They occur for 5D excitations only as a consequence of the 5D excitation having reached the CTS through thermally promoted 5D - CTS crossovers.

If the holes are thermally or IR stimulated back to the Eu+2 centers and re-form the Eu+3 CTS, the stored energy is retrieved as Eu+3 line emissions.

A number of batteries were tested, both Pb-acid and Ni-Cd. The best battery was a Ni-Cd aircraft starting battery. It could deliver 14 consecutive 1900W, 10 sec acceleration power pulses. It was calculated that about 180 lb of battery would be required for the particular power plant design envisioned. The high cost and scarcity of Cd militated against the use of a Ni-Cd battery. The next best candidate was a Pb-acid aircraft starting battery designed for high current drains for short time periods. It, too, delivered 14 consecutive 1900W, 10 sec pulses. In addition, it had sufficient energy capacity to provide some low speed range in the event of failure of the “base-load” energy battery. It had a power density of 70 W/lb at an energy density of 2 Whr/lb. About 270 lb of this battery would be required for the “power” battery pack. A Delco-Remy 2HN-11A military battery was tested to yield design data for the power plant. From these data, a battery was designed which would fit into an available lightweight container. Prior to this, a 2HN-11A modified battery was tested to confirm the design. Test results confirmed the designed capacities. Several of the design batteries were built. Each consisted of seven cells containing 11 plates per cell. One of the batteries was tested. It delivered 15 consecutive 2500W acceleration power pulses to 10.5V. It weighed 32 lb; hence, the entire power pack would weigh 256 lb. Since the 11-plate cell performed so well, it was hoped that a 9-plate cell might just deliver adequate power. A 27 lb weight reduction would be realized. However, it could not deliver adequate power when tested. Nothing could be obtained at 2500W. The voltage fell immediately below 10.5. In fact, only 1.8 min were obtained at 1900W. © 1971, by The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

The bank construction cost has been drastically reduced by the module physical arrangement. The second stage capacitor is mounted upside down directly on the first stage capacitor.

While the one commodity study was predicated at meeting oil demand at minimum total cost, (i.e. price plus transportation cost), the multi-commodity model here presents aims at meeting oil, gas and coal demand at minimum social cost, (i.e. price plus cost of transportation, storage and pollution control). The capacitated network flow model used in ref. 1 to represent oil sources, transportation routes and refining centers is here expanded to represent natural gas and coal production centers, while nuclear energy generation nodes are introduced as potential sources of pollution-free energy at all consumption centers. In order to achieve multi-commodity allocation, demands are expressed in energy units with lower limits of demand for each commodity. The regional and commodity price structure and the investments in energy production and transportation capacities are determined, assuming competition between the various oil, gas and coal producing regions which aim at maximizing regional profit on each commodity.

This is generally realized by hexapole magnets that produce a high-beam intensity for a given source emittance because of their focusing properties. The state-selected atoms are introduced into a storage bulb and are stored there for about 1 s in the central region of a resonant microwave cavity.

It is found that an explosive growth of the westward electrojet tends to appear after the interplanetary magnetic field has directed southward for 1-2 hr. Examinations of ground magnetic data indicate that the magnetic variation of a twin vortex mode are enhanced with the southward changes of the interplanetary magnetic field in the pre-explosive phase of the westward electrojet. In the early stage of this phase sudden geomagnetic impulses are often observed in association with tangential discontinuities in the solar wind. An explosive appearance of auroral electrojet often corresponds to changes in direction and/or magnitude depression of the interplanetary magnetic field. Such a typical sequence is also found at the main-phase beginning of magnetic storms. It is suggested that the polar magnetic substorm is a two-stage phenomenon lasting 4-6 hr. The twin current vortices in the polar region develop with the southward interplanetary magnetic field during the pre-breakup phase of 1-2 hr duration.

The elements and topology of the representation provide a conceptual reticulation of the real system into elements drawn from a set of ideal, but physically realizable, lumped-parameter components. The representation is in the form of bond-graph notation. This notation leads to a graphical description of a dynamic system (very much resembling a chemical bond diagram in appearance) that can be manipulated in an algorithmic fashion to produce the system differential equations, a computer simulation algorithm or a topological (circuit) graph of the system. There is no restriction to linearity in the representation. The reticulated structure represents a conceptual separation of the energy storage and dissipative processes within the system and a description of all the energetic interactions of the system. The ideal components used in the model generalize the familiar electric circuit elements-resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers-but, unlike electrical circuit diagrams, a reticulation into several components does not necessarily imply any physical separation in the actual system. Bond-graph notation is utilized because it was found to be particularly well suited for dealing with systems involving multiple energy domains with identifiable couplings between them. The thermodynamic systems of general interest comprise ionic flows, fluid flows, chemical reactions, heat flows, etc. with coupling and transduction between all energy modes. Specific applications dealt with here are electro-chemical phenomena. Case studies are presented for relaxation oscillations and rectification in electrolytic systems with multiple ionic flows, chemical reaction and ion-exchange membranes, coupled with electrical circuitry. © 1971.",,"Electrochemistry; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49649150251

Lab., Argonne, Ill. 60439, United States","The objective of the High Energy Battery Development Program at Argonne National Laboratory is to develop the technology required to construct secondary batteries having the performance capabilities required for pollution free electric automobiles. Batteries for this application should have an energy storage capability of 220 W hr/kg and be able to deliver power at a peak rate of 220 W/kg. Their cost should not exceed about $10/kW hr of energy storage capability. Lithium/sulfur cells using a molten lithium halide containing electrolyte and operating at 360 to 390°C have achieved capacity densities of up to 0.52 A hr/cm2 (above I V) at a current density of 0.52 A/cm2. These results are consistent with the specific energy and specific power goals, but the cycle life (currently hundreds of cycles) and the sulfur electrode performance require further improvement. The cell development program is supported by laboratory studies in various areas. The solubility of cathode materials in various electrolytes and the identity of the soluble species are being studied. Preliminary results indicate that electrolytes containing only fluoride and chloride anions have the lowest solubility for sulfur bearing species. Investigations of various additives to sulfur indicate that thallium may be useful in reducing the vapor pressure and increasing the conductivity of sulfur. A survey of candidate solid electrolytes has led to the investigation of the lithium form of β alumina. Mass transport studies have shown that an improved cycle life of the lithium electrode (hundreds of cycles) can be obtained by using LiF LiCl KCl electrolyte and by minimizing the concentration of various impurities in the cell. The investigation of the corrosion rates of various materials at 375°C has shown that chromium and molybdenum had low corrosion rates in 20 at. % Li in S, and lithium aluminate, beryllia, aluminum nitride, yttria, thoria, y3Al5O12, and MgO x Al2O3 had low corrosion rates in the lithium. Work has begun on the preparation of various forms of some of these materials, with most of the effort on LiAlO2 shapes. Battery design and performance calculations carried out for a 1075 lb Li/S battery in a 4300 lb (curb weight) electric automobile indicate that a range of 88 to 225 miles can be expected under realistic driving conditions, depending on the driving profile and accessory load.",,"environmental health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015179530

Total plasma fatty acids and cholesterol concentrations in human cancer are normal. An in vivo rat assay for fat‐mobilizing substances in the urine and plasma of cancer patients was negative. The mobilization of carcass lipid in human cancer appears to be in response to an energy deficit created by actively synthesizing tumor tissue. There is no significant difference between nonneoplastic surgery and resective surgery for cancer in regard to mobilization of fat for energy substrates.

The InAs array diodes exhibit sufficiently low reverse leakage currents for the diode to be operated in a charge-storage mode with an electron beam scanning at the conventional TV scanning rate of 1/30 s at a diode temperature of 77°K. The measured typical reverse leakage current density near liquid-nitrogen temperature is in the range of 5X 10–10A/cm2 at the reverse bias of 5.5 V with minimum background radiation on the diode. For the low-bias region, a study of the reverse current as a function of temperature indicates that the current transport mechanism is thermal in nature, and that it is dominated by the generation current in the space-charge region of the junction. The target structure is very similar to the silicon diode array vidicon target; the n-type substrate side of the target receives the infrared image, while the array side is scanned by an electron beam. The spectral sensitivity for radiation passing through the n-type substrate of an InAs photodiode is narrow-band in nature and can be greatly increased by the use of a heavily doped n+ -substrate, which causes the absorption edge to shift to the higher energy. Such an infrared vidicon target structure can be very effective, for it automatically eliminates large amounts of unwanted background radiation without use of a lossy filter. InAs charge-storage photodiodes are also proven to be very sensitive high-gain infrared detectors, because of a carrier multiplication gain which results in quantun efficiencies greater than unity. The internal carrier multiplication is an integral part of the charge-storage array diodes in vidicon operation. InAs charge-storage photodiode arrays have been measured with a demountable electron-beam TV system and preliminary test results have been obtained. Measurements of a line array with electron beam reveal a high sensitivity at a wavelength of 3.25 µ. The results indicate that very sensitive infrared imaging systems using a beam readout technique are realizable. © 1971, IEEE.

Arrhenius plots show a point of inflection at about 20 °; at higher temperatures the activation energy is about 13.5 kcal/mole while below this temperature the value increases to 28.5 kcal/mole. Storage at -5 ° or reduction in total cation concentration without alteration of the Na+:K+ ratio causes no significant change in these values, although the specific activity is markedly reduced. Reduction in the sodium concentration alone, however, increases the apparent activation energy at lower temperatures. These results support the hypothesis that two independent processes are involved in ATP hydrolysis, one operating above the critical temperature and one operating below this temperature. Storage, or reduction in the concentrations of both sodium and potassium ions, appears to reduce the number of functional ATPase units, without significantly altering the properties of those which can still hydrolyze ATP. Reduction in the sodium concentration alone, however, may also cause some inhibition of all units. This is more marked at lower temperatures, and may arise from competition by potassium for sodium-binding sites. © 1971.",,"adenosine triphosphatase; phosphorus; potassium; sodium; animal; article; binding site; energy transfer; enzyme activation; enzymology; kidney; rabbit; temperature; Adenosinetriphosphatase; Animal; Binding Sites; Energy Transfer; Enzyme Activation; Kidney; Phosphorus Isotopes; Potassium; Rabbits; Sodium; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015148286

The equationms for the photovoltaic effect reduce then to a simple form and the photoionization cross sections of the impurity levels involved can be expressed in experimental quantities, where a constant factor is also involved, as a function of energy.

More important findings are that: (1) the activation energy seems to be independent of technology and amounts to approximately 12,000°K both in the ""early failures"" and the ""constant failure rate"" periods; (2) a 4·5-10 times increase in failure rate was found, depending on collector voltage limit rating, when the reverse collector voltage was raised from zero to VCB max limit value; (3) hence a modified Arrheniusean regression equation may be used in a temperature range having a lower limit of 50-60°C, below which the activation energy seems to be decreased markedly (this is suspected to be due to altered failure mechanisms), and having an upper limit of 130°C (alloyed Ge), 230°C (Ge mesa) and at least 300°C (Si planar), depending on material and technology; (4) failure cause distributions are heavily altered at ""operating"" tests varying the acceleration factor, since at relatively low temperatures degradation of the collector diode (ICB0, BVCB0 failures) dominate, while at high accelerations the IEB0 and hfe failures will be equally important; (5) the failure rate vs. test time function cannot be transformed linearly by the acceleration factor since, at highly accelerated tests, the duration of the ""early failures"" period does not shorten proportionally to the reciprocal of acceleration factor, but is relatively extended. The long-standing problem of the discrepancy in failure rates gained in operating and storage tests (assuming equal temperatures and voltages) has been cleared. This difference stems from the thermal gradient existing in ""operating"" and missing in storage tests and also caused by erroneous determination of mean junction temperature at the ""operating"" tests, since thermal resistance has a wide spread and depends on temperature too. © 1971.",,"TRANSISTORS--Reliability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015078520

The fourth site conserves the free energy of the reaction between oxygen and cytochrome a3 by binding the water molecules produced at coupling sites II and III during electron transport through the coupling site enzymes. These coupling site enzymes participate directly in the redox reactions of electron transport in the respiratory chain by means of the dithiol-disulfide redox couple. The free energy of electron transport is conserved in an oxidized form of the coupling site enzyme. Analysis of the thermodynamic relationships between the energized and de-energized forms of this enzyme shows that, under the postulates of this hypothesis, the energized form always has a midpoint potential more positive than the de-energized form. In general, the midpoint potential of the de-energized form is comparable to that of the carrier of lower midpoint potential at the coupling site, while the midpoint potential of the energized form is comparable to that of the carrier of higher midpoint potential. The chemical hypothesis thus predicts that an observed shift of midpoint potential of a coupling site enzyme to a more negative potential upon energization of the respiratory chain must be a case of reversed electron transport through the coupling site, and that an apparent midpoint potential is measured rather than the true one as defined by direct equilibration with the normal hydrogen electrode. The anhydride storage potential of the fully energized, oxidized coupling site enzyme, Es**, at sites II and III, derives from two sources: one is the midpoint potential span ΔEm between the electron transport carriers of the coupling site; the other is binding of the water molecule produced in the esterification reaction at the coupling site by the fourth site of energy conservation at cytochrome a3. There is a partially energized, oxidized form of the coupling site enzyme Es at sites II and III which conserves the free energy of electron transport through the site as -TΔS of a strained conformation of the protein. These two species form two redox couples E*/E*s, and E**/ ESH** with the same redox potential, since the free energy of water binding should be the same for the oxidized or reduced form of the coupling site enzyme. One path of energization, starting from the reduced, de-energized coupling site enzyme ESH is the following: ESH ⇌ E*H→ES*→ES**, the interconversion of ESH and ESH* being essentially isergonic. The other path is: ESH ⇌ ESH*→ ESH**→ES**, in which abstraction of the water molecule occurs prior to oxidation. Existence of this pathway predicts that site II can be partially activated to ESH** in oxygen pulse experiments by the rapid oxidation of cytochrome a3, before any electron transport can take place through that site. © 1971.",,"adenine nucleotide; cytochrome; sulfide; thiol derivative; water; article; binding site; chemical model; electron transport; enzymology; metabolism; mitochondrion; oxidative phosphorylation; oxygen consumption; thermodynamics; Adenine Nucleotides; Binding Sites; Cytochromes; Electron Transport; Mitochondria; Models, Chemical; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxygen Consumption; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Sulfides; Thermodynamics; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015072953

The measure of the overall sensitivity which arises naturally is the sum of the magnitudes of the sensitivities to individual elements. For reciprocal realizations the sensitivity magnitude sums over resistances and reactances are separately related to the total power dissipation and the energy storage of the network. To minimize sensitivity. the energy storage must be minimized. Previous results for the energy storage of a one-port are used and extended to discuss further the minimum sensitivity problem. In certain cases it is shown how to find a synthesis having minimum sensitivity at all frequencies. The wider class of networks containing gyrators is also discussed, using an extension of Vratsanos' theorem. In this case the results obtained are weaker, since the properties of the actual realization, and that of the conjugate realization obtained by gyrator coupling reversals. are involved symmetrically. Bounds in terms of total power dissipations and energy storage are found for the sensitivity magnitude sums over resistances and reactances. The general results are illustrated by particular examples. It is shown by example that the sensitivity magnitude sum over resistances in a nonreciprocal network can be lower than the universal value imposed on reciprocal networks. © 1971, IEEE.

The extent of CTS dissociation is measured both by the storage induced by a known CTS excitation dosage and by the slow-rise transients of the D5 emissions at the onset of CTS excitation. Both measurements give an activation energy for CTS dissociation of 900 cm-1 for Y2O2S and 1300 cm-1 for La2O2S, and a rate constant of ∼ 1013.5 sec-1 for both hosts. The steady-state emission intensity undergoes a gradual superlinear transition with excitation intensity. The time constant of the slow-rise transient decreases with excitation intensity. The phosphorescence intensity is smaller than that of the slow-rise transient and increases sublinearly with excitation intensity.

Freshly oxygenated face‐to‐face cuts were used as the sample and control. The sample and control were packaged in mylar polyethylene pouches and cooled moist filtered air was circulated through the pouch for the duration of the experiment. Samples were exposed to the following wavelengths at an energy level of 0.5 mw/cm2: 420.0, 510.0, 550.0, 570.0, 590.0 and 632.8 nm. Experiments were conducted at 34°± 1°F and 41°± 1°F for 2 and 5 days of exposure. The controls were next to the sample but kept in darkness during the exposure period. There was no temperature differential between the sample and control. Oxidized heme pigment content was determined by reflectance spectrophotometry. No wavelength enhanced the formation of oxidized heme pigment more than any other, however illuminated samples contained an average of 5.5% more oxidized heme pigment than did the controls. Oxidized heme pigment content increased with lengthened storage time and increased temperature. The increase in oxidized heme pigment content as a result of illumination may be due to a photochemical activation of a compound such as riboflavin which then may react with oxygenated heme pigments to form oxidized heme pigments.

Only algal-dwelling juveniles exhibit rhythms of oxygen consumption and defecation related to the tidal cycle. Males undergo the moult to maturity in the algal habitat and are, therefore, able to replenish their food reserves before entering upon a nonfeeding reproductive phase in empty barncle tests and erevices. Storage sites are increased at this moult so that males are able to survive on their food reserves for 2 breeding seasons. Females enter the reproductive habitat in the preovigerous stage and cease to feed. Lipid food reserves are largely used up in the formation of eggs and the final stage cuticle. Consequently, after the ovigerous moult, females are required to utilise lipoprotein-containing tissue as an energy source, and are able to survive only for a single breeding season. At the final moult, the posterior end of the male becomes highly thickened, rugose, and supplied with tegumental glands. These modifications are correlated with the need for self protection, and protection of the vulnerable females, against various physical and biological factors in the intertidal zone. There is a large increase in the dry weight of the brood over the period of incubation, and this is due mainly to the development of the exoskeleton at the last marsupial moult. The source of materials for the weight increase is attributable to a combination of factors, of which salt uptake probably plays the major part. © 1971 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002001048

Such conditions can be provided in the presence of actively growing bacteria of the genera Ferrobacillus and Thiobacillus. These common and widely distributed aerobic and obligatory autotrophic organisms obtain the energy required for their growth from the reactions, The activities of these organisms are responsible for the production of highly acid ferruginous mine-waters and can give rise to considerable problems of corrosion of mining equipment1.

This poses a difficult problem in conservation. Some success has been achieved in combating the phenomenon at the British Museum (Natural History) by washing specimens in an aqueous solution of a proprietary disinfectant (personal communication from P.

Nucleation of a reversed spot during cooling through Curie temperature is the recording phenomenon. For the density limitation the following reasons have been considered: (1) exchange interaction at the boundary between heated and cold region during cooling; (2) domain walls after cooling; (3) thermal conductivity. The approximate evaluation of the effect of exchange near Curie temperature has been possible by means of a new formulation of Brown's equation valid at high temperature.

A mechanical scanner was constructed to carry out the dynamic read/write experiment and a refrigeration system was used to provide both the cooling of the GaAs laser and the storage medium. Writing was accomplished by pulsing the laser as the light spot scanned across the film surface. The energy density required to write a 5 μ spot is below 10-2 erg. This is within the capability of GaAs lasers, hence writing time in tens of nanoseconds was easily achieved. Reading is achieved by scanning a cw GaAs laser beam across the film surface and detecting the magneto-optic signal through a cross polarizer by a PMT. Due to the large magneto-optic effect, very high-speed readout is achieved. The high-speed read/write experiment showed the feasibility of a reversible storage system which has the density and speed of an optical store.

The acceleration of 10-100 keV electrons is found to be a property of active regions with a certain stage of development, and is signaled by the emission of ≳ 20 keV X-rays. The emission of electrons into the interplanetary medium may be separate from the acceleration of the electrons. Type III radio emission at long wavelengths appears to indicate the escape of the electrons into the interplanetary medium. The subsequent electron propagation in the interplanetary medium is essentially scatter-free, and the profile of the electron appears to be determined predominantly by transport/storage processes in the solar corona. The emission structure for active region McMath plage 8905 consists of (1) an open cone of ~ 70° extent in solar longitude where electrons have direct access to interplanetary field lines; (2) a cone of propagation of 100° width in solar longitude, surrounding and including the open cone in which impulsive electron events are observed; and (3) an overall ~ 200° extent of solar longitude over which low, non-impulsive fluxes from the active region are observed.

The relevant large and small scale properties of the interplanetary medium are first surveyed, and their use in the development of a quantitative understanding of the cosmic ray propagation processes summarised. Solar cosmic ray events, in general, are classified into two phenomenological categories: (a) prompt events, and (b) delayed events. The properties of both classes of events are summarised. The properties considered are the frequency of occurrence, dependence on parent flare position, the time profile, energy spectra, anisotropies, particle species, velocity dispersions, etc. A single model is presented to explain the various species of delayed event. Thus the halo and core events, energetic storm particle events, EDP events and proton recurrent regions are suggested to be essentially of common origin. The association of flare particle events with electromagnetic phenomena, including optical, X-ray and microwave emissions is summarised. The conditions in a sunspot group, and solar flare that are considered to be conducive to cosmic ray acceleration processes are discussed. Considerable discussion is devoted to physical processes occurring near the Sun. Near Sun particle storage, and diffusion, and secondary injection processes that are triggered by a far distant solar flare are reviewed. In order to explain the considerable differences between aspects of the prompt and delayed events, we propose selective diffusion processes that only occur at early times in a solar flare. The type IV radio emissions at metric wave-lengths are suggested to yield direct evidence for the storage processes that are necessary to explain the properties of the delayed events, and also as yielding direct evidence of secondary injection processes. We conclude by briefly summarising the ionospheric effects of the solar cosmic radiation. © 1970 D. Reidel Publishing Company.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542621592

When investigating unstable flow in open water courses in models with rectified channels, compensation of hydraulic losses occuring at bends in the channel has to be carried out by installing sources of local losses at those positions. These sources also provide the necessary reflection effect of intercepted waves, with the corresponding natural conditions of hydraulic losses. 2. The investigations show that the hydraulic construction of model channels with distorted scales, along with the familiar methods, such as increased roughness and increased discharges, can also be carried out by installing sources of local losses in the channel. There must be a fairly large number of such sources, but there are no precise data regarding the minimum necessary number. 3. The investigations on a pumped storage station buffer reservoir model illustrate the level regimes in the reservoir, providing minimum permissible dead-water levels in the reservoir, to allow normal pumped storage station operating conditions, in addition to means for reducing the levels and establishing the energy gain thus obtained. © 1970 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250494901

This bleaching was accompanied by the generation of a new absorption band at ∼ 1200 nm (∼ 1.0 eV) in the infrared, which, according to its sensitivity to temperature treatment, is not of colloidal origin.

Evidence presented indicates that the anneal in both films is characterized by a two-step process. The first appears to involve a spatial redistribution of the space charge. This is followed, at a somewhat higher temperature, by neutralization of the added space charge induced by the radiation. Observations on the singlelayer insulating films of SiO2 yield activation energies for both processes on the order of 0.3 eV. Experiments on the double-layer films of Al2O3, pyrolytically deposited on SiO2, indicate that the dominant activation energies for both processes lie in the range from 0.6 to 0.7 eV.

Knowledge of the characteristics of such waves can be helpful in the study of shoreline erosion and the design of docks, breakwaters, and other coastal structures. Field tests were conducted in the Portage Waterway on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The project was supported by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Lake Survey, Detroit, Michigan. Unfortunately, actual water waves do not behave or look like the classical trochoid-shaped wave. However, since a two-dimensional profile can be mathematically described as a nonperiodic, real-valued function of time, a useful mathematical model of an actual wave is in terms of its frequency spectrum. Thus, using sampling techniques and the magnitude of the wave train at predetermined instants of time, the frequency spectrum P(w) can be constructed. The impedance discontinuity at a water-air interface yields a very large theoretical reflection coefficient indicating that a strong, sharply defined echo from a water-air interface would make the use of a bottom-mounted sonic probe possible. Several problems, however, arise. First, in a bottom-mounted system, reflection will be strong at the water surface but, except for small scattering surface irregularities, the reflected energy will be directed back to the point of origin only for brief instants at the crest and trough of each wave. The strength of the scattered return depends on surface conditions and the illuminated spot size; conflictingly, a larger spot size implies poorer resolution. Second, the major ""noise"" component is introduced by signal reflection from suspended solids and entrained air in the water. In general, the shorter the wavelength, the smaller the particle size that will cause scatter. However, the attenuation of the water also increases rapidly with frequency. In addition, the rep rate must be high enough to provide the redundancy to compensate for missing echo pulses. A compromise of these factors is required in selecting the operating frequency. Third, pulse duration is also a critical factor. An illuminating pulse may have a minimal reflection during the first part of the pulse duration and a much larger reflection during the later part of the pulse due to a change in the surface configuration during the pulse duration. The 5-degree transducer used in this investigation performed very well and, for the water depth and wave sizes encountered during the tests, represented a satisfactory compromise between a desirable directivity and a minimum loss of information on data retrieval. It appears, by comparison with the information currently being obtained using a bellows wave gage, that the sonic probe should produce more detailed information relative to wave profile. In addition, no calibration is necessary for a sonic probe. Operating voltages and power consumption are such that the system can operate on one or possibly two 12-volt storage batteries and not draw more than 250 ma. It is concluded that the use of a bottom-mounted sonic probe is entirely feasible. © Copyright 1970 Offshore Technology Conference on behalf of American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",,"Digital storage; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Functions; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Particle size; Probes; Shore protection; Spectroscopy; Surface scattering; Surface waters; Water waves; Army Corps of Engineers; Feasibility studies; Impedance discontinuities; Operating frequency; Real-valued functions; Surface configuration; Two-dimensional profiles; Water-air interface; Phase interfaces",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059031402

Gerard and J.L. Worzel of our laboratory have recently suggested pumping cold sea water from 1,000 meters depth through large diameter pipes into a condenser area located on shore to intercept the flow of moisture-saturated trade winds. This air, when cooled, condenses much of its moisture, which will be conducted to storage tanks for use as drinking water, avoiding brine pollution of the sea caused by conventional desalination systems. The deep cold water of the ocean is many times richer in inorganic nutrients necessary to initiate the photosynthetic process than the surface waters of the euphotic zone. The deep sea water, which has been utilized as a source of cold for moisture condensation, will flow into closed-off lagoons near shore, where it will act as a fertilizer to stimulate primary production. A pilot scheme is now under way on the north shore of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where deep water is less than one mile offshore and where we have conclusively established that the waters from the nutrient maximum (700 to 900 meters deep) will create a phytoplankton bloom. This, in turn, could sustain commercial yields of organisms such as shellfish, crustaceans, fish, etc. The cost of pumping could be offset by the production of energy by the Claude process and by other cooling applications, such as air-conditioning, ice-making, cooling of conventional desalination systems, nuclear reactors, etc. © Copyright 1970 Offshore Technology Conference on behalf of American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",,"Air conditioning; Cooling systems; Desalination; Moisture; Nuclear reactors; Nutrients; Offshore oil well production; Potable water; River pollution; Seawater; Surface waters; Artificial upwelling; Cooling applications; Desalination systems; Inorganic nutrients; Large diameter pipes; Moisture condensation; Phytoplankton bloom; Primary production; Offshore technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059011604

A major site for resynthesis of carbohydrate from lactic acid, as well as from breakdown products of protein and lipid, is the liver, which was first shown by Gomori to contain an active and highly specific fructose diphosphatase (FDPase). This chapter discusses the properties of liver FDPase. Rabbit liver and kidney FDPases are inactivated when crude extracts are incubated with ATP. The fact that these effects have been observed only in crude extracts or with relatively crude preparations, and that inactivation by ATP in kidney extracts is stimulated by cyclic AMP suggests that a protein kinase may be involved. © 1970, ACADEMIC PRESS, INC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012730026

An analogous theoretical model attempted to define the input of energy to the human interface via the solar heat load, and the disposal of human net radiation was shown via the channels of latent, sensible, and body heat flux. In spite of an apparent uniform cloud cover, the energy parameters had considerable areal variation in intensity and trend. During the daylight hours seventy percent of the solar radiation was absorbed. An additional thirty-two percent was removed by longwave radiation. Of the net radiation received on the dry surface (forty-seven percent of solar radiation), about eighty percent was disposed via sensible heat flux, and the remainder entered the pavement as storage. Air temperatures taken at shelter height were out of phase with the ongoing energy regime and were deemed of dubious value in urban climatic studies. Urban man received only thirty-seven percent and seventy percent of the values available at the horizontal pavement for solar radiation and net radiation, respectively.

Where available geothermal resources are more than sufficient to carry the minimum system load, they could generally be used to economic advantage for supplying substantially more than the pure base load - sometimes even the whole load - owing to the phenomenon of « scale effect å. Even greater economies can sometimes be derived from the joint use of geothermal power with special plants for carrying the peak loads of short duration. Such special plants could take the form of gas turbines or even diesels or free piston plants. Geothermal steam plants exhausting to atmosphere can also sometimes serve as peaking plants, especially where alternative sources of energy are scarce or costly. As a variant to the installation of separate peaking plants a geothermal steam plant may itself be made capable of carrying short time peak loads by means of fuel fired superheaters. One theoretical way of using at least the bores and a large part of the plant at high plant factor even though the plant as a whole may be supplying non-base load is to introduce thermal storage. The implications of doing this are discussed in the paper, and the order of magnitude of the required storage space is assessed. The practical problems of providing the storage are admittedly formidable and the economics very uncertain, but these questions too are broadly discussed. All these problems are examined in the paper and are illustrated by means of hypothetical examples. © 1971.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49849117571

This paper extends the analysis to include the nonequilibrium case arising from a d.c. steady state conduction current in the semiconductor structure. Application is made to minority carrier small signal transport in both homogeneous and heterogeneous semiconductors at low steady state levels (P « N in n-type sample). Samples containing p-n junctions are not included but the effect of static, built-in electric field on the signal propagation is considered. In an extrinsic sample, it is shown that the nonequilibrium equivalent circuit is identical to the equilibrium case for considering carrier trapping, recombination and generation at the defect or impurity centers if the recombination conductances and capacitances are defined in terms of the steady-state carrier concentrations. The conditions on the properties of the imperfection centers and the frequency range in which trapping, recombination or generation event dominates at the centers are discussed in detail. It is shown that the effective small-signal minority carrier lifetime, τp in n-type semiconductor, is a complex variable due to the charge storage or trapping effect at the centers. In addition, τp is positional dependent due to the spatial variation of the steady state carrier concentrations. The small-signal lifetime, τp, is substantially different from the steady state lifetime τpSS which is commonly used in high-frequency, lumped-model device analysis. For strongly extrinsic samples with low concentration of recombination centers, the usual approximation, τp {reversed tilde equals} τpSS {reversed tilde equals} τp0 = 1/cpNTT, is valid. The lump model approximation to a specimen of length W is rigorously derived for minority carrier transport. It is shown that the commonly used stored-charge lump model is valid only at low frequency and zero recombination when the sample is geometrically divided into two or more lumps. For finite recombination, the effective length of each lump is shorter than at zero recombination and the sum of the length of each lump is less than the physical length of the sample. © 1970.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645482889

In the cathodoluminescence of certain ozygen-dominated phosphors containing rare-earth activators a different mechanism is believed to be applicable. Although hot carriers are generated by electron irradiation, the activator does not act as a major recombination site although it is shown that some carriers are trapped at Eu3+ sites. Recombination is shown to occur at a host site and is usually not radiative; the excited host center acts as an energy donor (as in photoluminescence), subsequently transferring energy to the activator by the usual resonant mechanism. This conclusion is suggested by low temperature experiments showing wide differences in the efficiency of energy storage in YVO4 : Eu3+ and ZnS : Ag and supported by comparisons of the CL and PL emission spectra of YVO4 : Eu3+ (0.05%). The latter experiments show that the excited state of the host just prior to Eu3+ luminescence is the same in CL as in host-excited PL. In general this mechanism is expected to apply whenever the lowest excited state of the host is a bound state such as (WO2-4)*, (MoO2-4)*, (NbO3-4)*. © 1970.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11744296795

This decision was governed mainly by safety and economic criteria that were considered by the Government and RCN. A licensing system exists for the use and disposal of all fissionable and radioactive substances. This system applies to all categories of users, industry, laboratories, research, hospitals etc. It is based on the Nuclear Energy Act, which also regulates waste storage and treatment. Licences are granted by the Minister of Social Affairs and Public Health, sometimes together with or after consultation with other Ministers. A licence imposes a number of special rules, e.g. restrictions on the quantity of radioactive nuclides used, and always on the storage of radioactive materials. Radioactive wastes must be stored and later disposed of by an officially recognized waste disposal service. This service is organized by the Reactor Centre at Petten. In the second part of the paper details are given of new installations built at RCN for treatment of these wastes and their preparation for sea dumping. The installations mainly consist of a baling facility, using a 90 ton press mounted in a controlled area for pressurized suit operations.

Many nuclear power plants are under construction and are planned for the near future throughout Japan because of the rapid increase of energy demand for several decades to come. In view of this, it is expected that radioactive solid wastes from the plants will accumulate year by year and exceed the storage capacity at these sites.

The feasibility of both terrestrial and marine disposal is being investigated under the specific conditions of Japan by the committee on radioactive solid waste management of the Nuclear Safety Research Association. This problem involves many factors concerning waste treatment and packaging techniques, transportation, groundwater, oceanography, fisheries, environmental radiation safety etc. The land burial of the wastes should not be allowed without careful consideration of the small land area and the high population density and also of the utilization of land by future generations. On the other hand, deep sea disposal should not be considered as an easy solution, because of the high utilization of marine products. To establish a national policy for radioactive solid waste management, the present study was concentrated on various weak points to be overcome, and individual technical questions to be investigated in the light of present knowledge.",,"environmental health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014889239

At present approximately 500 people are employed at Kjeller and Halden. Although the quantities of wastes generated are small compared with countries with an extensive nuclear energy program, wastes of varied composition and activity levels are procured from the operation of hot laboratories, pilot plant processing and radioactive materials, reactor operation (2 and 20 MW), and isotope production. The developments in waste management and treatment from 1948 to 1965 was presented at the IAEA Symposium in Vienna, in December 1965. In the last five year period the increased activities on projects concerned with the prototype fuel testing, post irradiation examination, reprocessing pilot plant and isotope production necessitated improvements in waste treatment and disposal. The authorized maximum permissible discharge of low level liquid waste to the River Nitelva was increased to 2 Ci (weighted)/30 d after the installation of an effluent pipeline, which improves the dilution and dispersal of the activity. Safety assessments show that solidified wastes can be disposed of by shallow land burial within the institute site, and permission has been granted to dispose of one thousand drums containing approximately 250 Ci. The plant for waste processing and storage has been modified and improved. Shielding has been reinforced, and new equipment installed for remote operation, decontamination, and ion exchange resin transport and storage. Wastes with contact dose rates of 10 R/h are now satisfactorily processed, compared with the 1 R/h level for which the plant was originally designed. Although the waste treatment plant is relatively simple in design, it has proved to be flexible and reliable in operation. The cost of modifications and new plant equipment amounts to approximately N.kr. 200,000 ($ 28,000), which corresponds to 25% of the initial plant capital cost.",,"environmental health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014888929

Salient features of this bath are 1) ±0.0010C control of the cell temperature in the laboratory, ±t0.020C maximum variation around 28°C in shipment; 2) exposure capacity from over 8 hours at 0°C or 45°C to over 72 hours in moderate temperatures 3) shipping package weight 14.5 kg, size 20.3 × 22.9 × 30.5 cm; and 4) electrical power drain 0.8-0.2 watt. Cell temperature is determined primarily by an ambient-tem-perature-biased on-off heater system. Immunity to external environment is achieved by a unique secondary control, which employs the energy storage capacity of two heat-of-fusion alloys, which are reset simply by exposure to laboratory temperature. Experience with this bath has shown that the average value of cell voltage is reproducible to 0.1 µv within a few hours following shipment. This time delay is significantly shorter than the days-to-weeks for most air baths and the weeks-to-months for cells shipped without temperature control.

It was postulated that these patients might lack the storage, or non‐metabolic, pool of ADP which is selectively released from specialized granules during the platelet release reaction and studies on three affected members of this family were undertaken to test this hypothesis. Citrated platelet‐rich plasma (PRP) was incubated with [8‐14C]adenine for 2 hr at 37°C and the specific activity of platelet nucleotides was determined. The release reaction was then induced by shaking the PRP with collagen fibres. The labelling patterns in the patients' platelets were distinctly abnormal. The specific activities of their platelet ADP following incubation with [14C]adenine were 4–6 times those of similarly treated normal platelets and were similar to those obtained in the normal platelets after they had been depleted of their non‐metabolic (unlabelled) ADP by treatment with collagen. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the patients' platelets contain a normal amount of metabolically active ADP, but are deficient in the storage pool. Similar conclusions were reached for ATP. Incubation of the patients' platelets with collagen was accompanied by a normal disappearance of radioactive ATP and accumulation of radioactive IMP and hypoxanthine. Thus the abnormality in the platelet release reaction in these patients appears to be the result of a diminished storage pool of nucleotides rather than a block in the pathway which may provide the energy for this reaction.

An initial orthogonal basis is determined from the generalized spectrum of short time segments selected from a vocabulary of ten words. The initial basis is optimized by minimizing the complementary error energy. By projecting a spoken word onto the optimum orthogonal basis, a sequence of numbers is generated to represent the word. By correlating the absolute values of the sequence with those of a stored library of words, the spoken word is identified. The percent of correct recognition varies from 71.6 to 96.6 percent for two speakers. Techniques are developed to improve the recognition scores and to reduce the lengthy computer processing time and large storage requirement. First a master template is made for each word by averaging six templates for the particular word. For one speaker the percent of correct recognition increases to 100 percent when incoming words are compared against the master templates. For a second speaker, the recognition rates improve significantly and vary between 93 and 98 percent when the master templates are used. To further improve the recognition process, the feasibility of grouping words into several classes is demonstrated. The classifications are based on the locations of formant regions and the time durations of each spoken word.

The properties of all surveyed candidate materials are temperature-dependent. The transient temperature distribution and the output heat flux q0 are presented as functions of input heat flux qi- and the thickness w of the heat-storing material. The possibility of steady state without complete melting has been predicted and confirmed experimentally. The amplitude of the fluctuation in q0 during the thermal cycle increases with qi- and ω. The stabilization of the thermal cycle generally is achieved in two cycles (simulated orbital periods). Use of a finned system can reduce the go fluctuations, including the temporary q0 overshoots after the completion of melting. Changes of the fin geometry, spacing, and fin materials affect th and tc. These additional degrees of freedom can be utilized for the synchronization of the thermal cycles with the orbiting periods. The theoretically predicted behavior of the system is in good agreement with experimental findings for annular storage volumes of LiH that are radiantly heated on the inside by an electric heater and cooled by radiation to Dowtherm-A-cooled or nitrogen-cooled coils. © 1970 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.",,"HEAT TRANSFER; JSCRA; POWER SUPPLY; SOLAR RADIATION; SPACE VEHICLES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014848298

The intensity of luminescence is strongly dependent upon the number of flashes; luminescence is minimum after a single flash and maximum after a double flash illumination. Ifl/n is the intensity of luminescence measured 0.24 sec after the nth flash, the series ln shows oscillations as a function of n. The series ln is very similar to the series yn, in which y is the amount of oxygen evolved by the nth flash, the term ln corresponding to the term yn+1. To interpret the oscillations of the series yn, different models of system II photochemical centers have been proposed, one by ourselves and the other one by KOK et al. In these models the electron donor Z of photosystem 11 is supposed to have 2 or 4 levels of oxidation, the more oxidized state being the precursor of oxygen. These different oxidation states of the donor Z allow storage of the photic energy in the system. The correlation between the series yn and ln shows that at least one of the oxidized forms of the donor Z is a substrate for the luminescence reaction. Copyright © 1970, Wiley Blackwell.

Although it has both off-line and online capabilities of application this account is concerned mainly with an explanation of the essentials of the technique in the context of off-line optimization studies. A brief description of a successful application study of a practical problem in industry is also included. The technique is explained in a progressive manner by considering an example for which there is a requirement for an optimum schedule of alternative energy sources. As is well known, optimum scheduling using the dynamic programming technique is restricted in practice by limitations in computer storage and computing time to systems with few independent variables. However, in certain classes of multichannel systems some of these variables appear naturally, or by reasonable approximation can be made to appear, in a static section of the system, and it is shown that optimizing their values need consume only little computer time and storage. The remainder of the variables are in the dynamic section and their optimization makes a heavy demand on computational facilities. The Dynostat technique handles both types of variables in a single computer algorithm. An indication of a projected online configuration of Dynostat is presented in a statement of developments of the technique currently under study.

The apparent Km values of the various substrates and activators of the adenylylation of glutamine synthetase were determined. The adenylylating enzyme requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ and ATP for activity. Several other divalent cations and nucleotides were tested and found to be ineffective. In the presence of glutamine the rate of the reaction decreases at ATP concentrations greater than 1 mM. Addition of ADP, CTP, UTP and ITP to the standard assay mixture, containing ATP results likewise in a decrease of the rate of the reaction. Various intermediates of glycolytic pathway and Krebs cycle inhibit the adenylylation reaction. The optimum pH for adenylylation is about 7.6. The activation energy for the adenylylation was estimated from rate measurements. It is 13 kcal/mole in the temperature range from 5° to 32°.

Since 2,3‐DPG is better maintained at the higher pH afforded by citrate‐phosphate‐dextrose (CPD), hemoglobin function was compared during storage in CPD and ACD. Further, hemoglobin function was studied in CPD blood containing adenine and inosine, compounds that provide metabolic energy and thus prolong the shelf‐life of blood, because they also effect the levels of 2,3‐DPG during storage. Hemoglobin function, expressed as the P50 (the P02 at 50 per cent oxygenation, an inverse but direct measure of oxygen affinity) is considerably better maintained during storage in CPD than in ACD. The hemoglobin function or P50 of blood stored in CPD‐adenine is not maintained as well as blood stored in CPD without adenine, but the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curves show only a small difference when compared to the difference between ACD and CPD. Blood stored in CPD‐adenine with inosine, present initially or added at day 25, allows higher P50 values late in storage, thus providing better hemoglobin function for more of the storage period. 1970 AABB",,"acid; adenine; adenosine triphosphate; anticoagulant agent; citric acid; glucose; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; glycerophosphate; hemoglobin; nucleoside; phosphate; article; blood; blood gas analysis; blood storage; erythrocyte; hemoglobin determination; human; male; metabolism; oxygen consumption; transport at the cellular level; Acids; Adenine; Adenosine Triphosphate; Anticoagulants; Biological Transport; Blood Gas Analysis; Blood Preservation; Citrates; Erythrocytes; Glucose; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase; Glycerophosphates; Hemoglobinometry; Hemoglobins; Human; Male; Nucleosides; Oxygen Consumption; Phosphates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014791553

In this period the dry weight of the insect increases by 80 per cent. The materials for growth are obtained during a period of intensive feeding which occurs during the first 4 days after emergence. Analysis of the carbohydrate, lipid, and protein content of the diet and faecal pellets show that the insect ingests sufficient protein to meet its growth requirements. The carbohydrate content of the haemolymph and fat body increases during the period of intensive feeding, but the lipid content of the haemolymph and also of the flight muscle remains low and constant. Only a third of the lipid ingested during this period is stored in the fat body, the remainder is oxidized to provide energy for growth. Between 6 and 8 days after emergence the insect synthesizes lipid from dietary carbohydrate and this is stored in the fat body. Analysis of the fat body lipid shows that the major storage component is triglyceride. Only small amounts of monoglyceride, diglyceride, and free fatty acid are present. A small amount of phospholipid is also present and is probably mainly structural lipid. After maturation the insect utilizes its reserves of lipid through adult life. Studies on the respiration of the whole insect and its tissues show that although the respiration of the whole insect is constant there are changes during development of the individual tissues. Respiratory quotients derived from these figures suggest that the fat body oxidizes lipid throughout development whilst the flight muscle oxidizes a mixture of carbohydrate and lipid at all stages of development. Changes in the diameter of the corpus allatum during development were also measured in an attempt to define the particular stage of development at which the gland secretes the hormone. © 1970.",,"carbohydrate; lipid; animal; article; feeding behavior; growth, development and aging; insect; male; metabolism; oxygen consumption; Animal; Carbohydrates; Feeding Behavior; Insects; Lipids; Male; Oxygen Consumption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014787659

These responses of the cold stored strip to phenylephrine, epinephrine and norepinephrine were prevented by pretreatment with alpha-blocking agents (phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine) but not by treatment with beta-blocking agents (propranolol and MJ 1999). The opposite was observed for the response to isoproterenol. On the other hand, the contraction produced by methacholine, (10-7 M), physostigmine (10-7 M), KCl (10 mM), and Ba (1 mM) was decreased after 3-6 days cold storage. Similarly, the relaxation produced by ATP (10-6 - 10-8 M) and 3',5'-cyclic AMP (10-4 - 10-5 was also decreased after 3-6 days cold storage; the response of fresh preparations to these agents was not prevented by either alpha- or beta-blocking drugs. In low Ca media (0.6 mM) catecholamine-induced relaxation of fresh strip was not changed, but that of ATP and 3',5'-cyclic AMP was decreased. These results indicate that cold storage does not interfere with the inhibitory system related to catecholamine but does with ATP and 3',5'-AMP. Also, prolonged cold storage does affect the membrane system involved in methacholine, KCl, Ba and physostigmine-induced contractions.

However, no data of a controlled evaluation has been published. The difficulty of accurate particulate sampling at a cyclone discharge duct may be the reason. Working with a pilot feed mill, the investigators developed an accurate particulate sampling scheme, tested the effect of solid-air ratio and inlet velocity, and evaluated the fat injection method for reducing cyclone effluent. Accurate sampling required flow-straightening and velocity profile-flattening, without adding appreciable flow resistance. Fat was sprayed on the dried alfalfa prior to grinding. Particulate effluent at the cyclone following, normally 50 – 60 percent of the mill total, was reduced by 96.4 and 99.4 per cent by adding 2 and 4 per cent fat, respectively. The recovered product was 50 per cent higher in protein than the normally collected product. The fat significantly retarded the deterioration loss of carotene (pro-vitamin A), being 20 per cent less after 4 months’ storage with 2 per cent fat. Fat reduced the energy required for pelleting and increased the metabolizable energy. It produced no significant increase in rancidity, pellet fragileness or grinding energy requirements. At the 2 per cent level of fat addition, the cost of the process operation ranges from nothing to $0.80/ton, depending on the usefulness of the carotene preservation factor. Installation and maintenance cost is much less than that of alternate methods for controlling cyclone effluent with alfalfa dehydrators. © 1970 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING; AIR POLLUTION; CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014711713

The device is a resonant bandpass electronic filter with adaptable voltage gain; that is, the voltage gain-frequency transfer characteristic can be “set” to different values of attenuation by the application of an adapt signal and will retain that “setting” after the adapt signal has been removed. Ferroelectric materials are used as the dielectric in a filter structure composed of two capacitors bonded together so that resonant mechanical vibrations established in one (the input resonator) are coupled to the other (the output resonator). Converse and direct piezoelectric effects generate the mechanical vibrations and the output voltages, respectively. Ferroelectric effects in either capacitor provide the analog storage capabilities. The acoustical coupling mechanism employed in the device design results in electrically stable device characteristics. Previous ferroelectric adaptive devices used unstable field effect coupling mechanisms which led to unacceptable device performance. Experimental adaptive resonant filters fabricated with ceramic lead zirconate-lead titanate material compositions are discussed. These filters have electronic Q values near 100 at resonant frequencies in the range 102 to 107 Hz. The voltage gain-frequency characteristic has a maximum value at resonance of about 0 to +10 dB. Application of a voltage adapt pulse (100 to 300 volts) of low energy (mJ) to either side of the filter can adapt the entire gain characteristic by any value between 0 and about -60 dB within an arbitrary switching time (limited to a practical range of roughly 10+3 to 10–4 seconds) as determined by the pulse amplitude. Voltage gain settings are electrically stable and can be reproduced by the same or an equivalent sequence of adapting pulses. © 1970, IEEE.

Since incandescent lamps provide a larger proportion of energy of wavelengths greater than 700 nm, it is concluded that subsequent dark germination is altered by the spectral quality to which the parent plant is exposed.The sensitivity of light germinating seed for photoinduction by red energy also was altered by changing the spectral quality under which they were grown.

The increase in sugar content with decrease in storage temperature and the decrease in sugars with increase in temperature is accounted for in only a minor way by the corresponding decrease or increase in respiratory’activity of the tubers. The maximal possible contribution of respiratory activity to the changes in sugar content varied from less than 1% to 13% depending on the particular storage conditions. The temperature‐dependence of respiratory activity of potato mitochondria was compared to that of whole tubers, and a quantitative comparison was made of the potential respiratory activity of the mitochondria to respiration of the whole tubers. The potential mitochondrial activity is such that respiration of whole tubers would not be limited by this factor at any temperature studied although it is recognized that the effect of mitochondrial activity could be an indirect one. Unlike whole tubers, mitochondria displayed a temperature response typical of an enzymic reaction with an apparent energy of activation of 14,000 cal/mole with succinate as substrate. The temperature‐dependence of potato mitochondrial respiration is typical of that found for other plant mitochondrial systems but differs markedly from that of mitochondria of mammals and poikilotherms.

Net radiation, soil heat flux and evaporation, E, were measured, the last by means of a weighing lysimeter. Sensible heat flux, H, was obtained by difference in the energy balance equation, and H and E used to construct an experimental estimate, β, of the Bowen ratio, β (= H/LE, with L the latent heat of vaporisation). Simultaneous measurements were obtained of differences in temperature, ΔT, and specific humidity, Δq, over a height interval, Δz, above the crop. These were used to calculate the function βc (= cp (ΔT + ΛΔz) (ΛΔq), with cp the specific heat of air at constant pressure and Λ the adiabatic lapse rate). βc was compared with β on a variety of occasions when β ranged from 0.1 to 2.2, and the Richardson number at 42.5 cm above the crop from -0.001 to -0.026. The data conformed well to the assumption that βc = β, implying equality between the eddy diffusivities for heat and water vapour (at least close to the surface and over the range of instabilities examined). A total of 210 hourly comparisons were made between lysimeter evaporation and calculated evaporation, Eb, derived from the energy balance equation with β = βc. Differences between Eb and E were generally within ± 0.1 mm/h. This difference was of the same magnitude as the estimated experimental error, and it is concluded both that Eb was a reliable estimate of E, and that the lysimeter itself was adequately representative of its surroundings. The paper also reports studies over 4 1 2 years of seasonal changes in evaporation and soil water storage in an agricultural system typical of land-use in the Canberra area. © 1970.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004772922

Furthermore, the geochemical methods are classified according with the scale of the required operations: regional reconnaissance, includes mercurimetry, hydrogeochemical survey of surface waters, and isotopic study of water. These data convey information having regard to large thermal anomalies, to drainage, to water storage and supply, respectively; strategic exploration puts more emphasis on springs systems. It possibly includes broad gas surveys, mostly CO2 surveys. Strategic work next to regional reconnaissance aims to closer understanding of the hot spring systems related to selected geological units. It aims specifically to the detection of geochemical anomalies related to leakage manifestations, that is to two-phases convection: tactical exploration would include close investigation of specific hot springs and fumaroles, as well as of their environment. Detailed investigation of free and dissolved gases could be referred to this scale. In principle geochemical thermometry belongs to this group so far as it requires that water samples be available from a specified reservoir. Thus exploration shades towards reservoir studies, through steps like spring water study, geochemical logging on drilling, geochemical monitoring of well head fluids. Specific geochemical methods are discussed. Based on the geochemical distribution of gases, boric acid and ammonia, the occurrence of leakage manifestations (two-phases convection) in some geothermal as well as volcanic areas is reported.

For in this way energy could be transferred to electrons - initiating chemical processes - in steps of more than one quantum of the storage mode. Clearly it would be desirable to devise model experiments that might provide evidence for the existence of such storage modes. Theoretical conditions for their establishment require the excitons excited by light absorption to be strongly scattered in a manner which favours non-linear processes. This suggests the use of amorphous insulating materials in the form of microscopic particles deposited on a metal surface and coated with a thin metal layer. If light absorbed in the absorption bands of this material is stored in storage modes, then transfer of more than one storage mode quantum (which has less energy than the light quantum) at a single step should be observable in terms of photoelectric emission.

The model is that of a microwave radiation field contained within a plasma dielectric sphere, resonant at a frequency much greater than the electron-molecule collision frequency. Calculations are made of the energy stored in the microwave field, the electron temperature, the rate of energy loss due to ionization, and the effects of recombination. It is concluded (a) that a self-consistent set of conditions can be obtained only when the neutral density within the sphere is much lower than atmospheric, and (b) that the microwave field strength required is of the order of 109V/m. Under these conditions the radiation pressure becomes comparable to that of the atmosphere; the second case investigated is when these two become equal.

This geometry results in an electric field configuration having an extremely short penetration distance into the plasma. When the behavior of this probe is studied in extended negative glow and back-diffusion type plasmas, the floating mode current-voltage characteristic curve is seen to be quite different from that of the usual double probe in that no effects of the electrons are observed. The behavior of the periodic probe is controlled by the ion inertia established in the diffusion region which lies just in front of the probe. The important parameter of the characteristic curve is the slope near zero applied voltage difference which can be related in a simple manner to the flux of plasma diffusing to the probe and to the diffusion drift energy of the ions as they reach the probe. The electrons make no contribution to this slope for low applied voltage differences. This probe thus provides a very sensitive method for measuring the diffusive flux of plasma to a containing wall. © 1970 The American Institute of Physics.",,"ACCELERATORS; MEASUREMENTS; PLASMAS; STORAGE RINGS; PLASMA PROBES; RIC",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014610893

Theoretical predictions regarding annealing processes were made by considering a structural defect model which assumes fixed and rotatable components of anisotropy with different activation energies. The predictions were verified experimentally under various annealing conditions. An extrapolation method to estimate the lifetime at operating temperature was established by adopting the Arrhenius equation. Activation energies were determined by using the rate of decay of output voltage under a worst-case DRO memory test as a criterion. Three activation energies were evaluated: (1) 1.3 eV for the zero applied field case, (2) 2.4 eV for a 36 Oe hard-axis field applied, and (3) 0.8 eV for fringing fields off the ends of a solenoid applying the 36-Oe hard-axis fields. The shelf life was extrapolated to be 2×106 years at 40°C. The dynamic test evaluated the lifetime under environmental conditions using a 256-bit experimental plane which was exercised, sensed, and data recorded at 150°C and the memory lifetime at operating temperature was determined by extrapolating the above results using the lowest activation energy projection. Therefore, memory working lifetime in DRO mode is estimated to be &gt;100 years at 50°C with no dropouts, and &gt;350 years at 50°C with a 5% dropout occurrence. © 1969 The American Institute of Physics.",,"COMPUTERS, MEMORIES; DATA STORAGE; ECT; MAGNETIC MATERIALS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014476710

The results show that various types of commercial PVC exhibit a melting range which starts at about 150 °C and extends into the thermal decomposition region. A heat of fusion of 750 cal/mole was calculated from the melting energy and the change in density upon melting. A similar melting range starting at 180 °C was found in PVC polymerized at -30 °C. Once melted, this primary cristallinity does not reappear after annealing. It can be restored by dissolution and subsequent careful precipitation. Annealing above the glass transition produces secondary crystallinity which melts just above the annealing temperature and has a heat of fusion of only about 200 cal/mole. The secondary crystallinity is not formed unless the primary crystallinity has at least partly been eliminated by prior heating. Secondary crystallinity was also found in plasticized PVC. For compounds containing 30 parts of DOP per 100 parts of PVC, storage at room temperature means annealing above the glass transition. Consequently, secondary crystallinity is formed during storage at room temperature, which accounts for the stiffening of plasticized compounds in the course of time. © 1969 Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag.",,"CALORIMETERS; POLYMERS; POLYMERS, THERMAL PROPERTIES; POLYVINYL CHLORIDE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014595985

The delayed light emission from chloroplasts in the presence and absence of electron acceptors has been measured from 1 to 20 msec after the center of repeating flashes of exciting light. 2. The emission from chloroplasts to which neither hydrogen acceptors nor phosphorylation cofactors had been added showed a very slow dark decay compared to the dark decay of the emission from whole leaves. 3. Activation of noncyclic electron transport by either K3Fe(CN)6, NADP+ + ferredoxin, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, or methylviologen (pseudo-cyclic) resulted in increased intensity of emission at 1 msec and in more rapid dark decay of the emission, so that the shape of decay curves from activated chloroplasts approached that from whole leaves. 4. Activation of cyclic electron transport by phenazine methosulfate had no effect on the delayed emission of chloroplasts, whereas activation by pyocyanine had an effect similar to that of the noncyclic cofactors, but reduced in magnitude. 5. Inclusion of ADP or of ADP + P1 reduced the emission without markedly changing the kinetics of dark decay. 6. Inclusion of ascorbate had an effect similar to that of the noncyclic cofactors. 7. These results lend support to the previous conclusion that delayed light emission is dependent on that part of photosynthesis which Duysens has termed Photoreaction II. The intensity of emission is interpreted as reflecting energy storage by Photoreaction II. According to this interpretation, activation of noncyclic electron transport results both in more rapid utilization of energy stored by the photoreaction, and in an increase in energy stored by the photoreaction at dark times somewhat shorter than the turnover time of the multienzyme system. The increase in energy storage does not persist beyond times about equal to the enzymatic turnover time, presumably because the additional stored energy is rapidly utilized by the activated electron transport system. Nevertheless, the increase in energy storage at Photoreaction II is directly opposed to the assumption that utilization of energy by the electron transport chain would result in less energy storage by the photoreaction at all times after excitation. © 1969.",,"adenine nucleotide; antibiotic agent; ascorbic acid; ferredoxin; ferricyanide; herbicide; indophenol; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; oxygen; phenazine derivative; phosphate; pigment; article; chemical phenomena; chloroplast; darkness; electron transport; kinetics; light; luminescence; medicinal plant; metabolism; oxidative phosphorylation; photosynthesis; plant; stimulation; time; Adenine Nucleotides; Antibiotics; Ascorbic Acid; Chloroplasts; Darkness; Depression, Chemical; Electron Transport; Ferredoxins; Ferricyanides; Herbicides; Indophenol; Kinetics; Light; Luminescence; NAD; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxygen; Phenazines; Phosphates; Photosynthesis; Pigments; Plants; Plants, Medicinal; Stimulation, Chemical; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014667948

Analysis of high pressure gaseous storage (compatible with deep submergence hulls) shows significant fuel storage volume advantages over storage of cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen. A unique hybrid fuel storage system, using LOX and high pressure hydrogen at LOX temperature shows reduced displacement, compared to both gaseous and pure cryogenic systems, for modest endurance periods.

The recorder uses a new technique to permit slave operation from the energy source to initiate the display sweep. This permits variable cycle timing of the energy input without concern for the recorder mechanism. The plot is made by galvanometers on direct write type oscillograph paper for viewing the section as the survey progresses. From one to four galvanometers can be used to record the seismic data.

A crystal oscillator provides the stable time base for the timing line generation and synchronous motor drive as well. A magazine is provided for receiving the exposed section and is always used when film sections are made. The plot is made on 10 inch wide paper using 9 inches of the surface for the data.

The broad function performed by the atmosphere-ocean system is that of storing and redistributing the energy received from the sun. Considering the differences between the seasons in a hemisphere, the change in atmospheric-energy storage is relatively small because of the small mass of the atmosphere and the large heating excess or deficit involved. Intense insolation in the summer hemisphere along with small heat storage in the soil results in a large thermal contrast between a continent and the neighboring ocean whose temperature is fairly constant. This heating contrast, augmented by latent heat release and radiation, drives the monsoon circulations. A continual degradation of kinetic energy takes place through surface friction and viscous stresses within the atmosphere. Thus, the atmospheric circulation can be maintained only through a corresponding release of kinetic energy in the form of the direct solenoidal circulations, which transfer heat upward at the same time. © 1969, Academic Press Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012690757

For shallow earthquakes, it is expected that the crustal deformation accompanied by the strain accumulation may be observed by frequent surveys of geodetic nets in the area concerned. Although it is quite difficult at the present stage to find geodetic data which clarified the period of duration of the preseismic crustal deformation, the writer looked for following three examples which might have the possibility of suggesting the preseismic duration. Name Year and Mag. Assumed duration T Nankaido Earthquake 1946 M 8.1 92 years Kitamino Earthquake 1961 M 7.0 12 years Omi Earthquake 1967 M 5.0 0.3 years Considering that these three data show a linear relation between M and log T, the writer calculated the coefficient of log T = bM+a by using method of least squares as follows; log T = bM+a = 0.79 M-4.44. (1) Further he checked this equation by applying it to some examples which suggest the durations of preseismic deformations in somewhat insufficient features comparing the above mentioned data, and found considerable consistency (Table I and Fig. 5). If the earthquake may occur when the linear strain per unit length of the rock of the earth's upper layer attained to some limiting value and Eq. (1) is concluded, then we may have the following equation; eT = const. (2) where e is the velocity of strain accumulation per unit length per year. This shows that the small earthquake will be caused by quicker accumulation of strain than large one, which is favourable condition for the purpose of earthquake prediction. © 1969, The Geodetic Society of Japan.

Providing that a change in heat storage in the leaf and the energy fixed in photosynthesis are both nil, foliage Bowen ratio (βf) is expressed as follows:[formula omitted], case 1 and [formula omitted], case 2 where Df is the foliage exchange velocity (or leaf-air transfer coefficient) between the leaf surface and the surrounding air, φa the slope (mmHg/°C) at air temperature of the saturation vapour pressure vs. temperature curve, d the saturation deficit (mmHg) and ΔTf the difference in temperature between leaf and air. From the above equations, it is seen that for daytime conditions (larger positive ΔTf), increasing Df and decreasing Ds lead to increasing the foliage Bowen ratio. The above relations indicate also that the value of Bowen ratio for the leaf of case 1 is twice as much as that for the leaf of case 2. A hyperbolic relation between stomatal exchange velocity and radiation flux was used in model computations. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the value of foliage Bowen ratio increases or decreases with (1+Df/Ds), depending on the sign of the temperature difference. Fig. 2 shows that the dependence of the total latent heat transfer from the leaf on net radiation (Sf) is largely affected by relative humidity in the air. In a relatively dry air, the percentage of the latent heat flux to net radiation decreases gradually with increasing net radiation. This result was found to be in good agreement with results obtained in a corn field (UCHIJIMA, UDAGAWA et al. 1969). The percentage decreases with increasing relative humidity in the air and becomes independent of net radiation in a saturated air. Fig. 3 indicates the increase in foliage Bowen ration with relative humidity in the air. This fact is due to the suppression of transpiration by increase in humidity. The following equation is derived to relate the relative humidity at the leaf surface (foliage relative humidity Rf) to the microclimate of the leaf and the stomatal exchange velocity. [formula omitte], where Ra is the relative humidity in the air and e(Ta) the saturation vapour pressure (mmHg) at the air temperature. Curves in Fig. 4 were calculated for leaves of case 2 in a canopy where the air temperature was assumed to be 25°C and the foliage exhange velocity 0.5 and 1.0 cm/sec, respectively. The decrease of the foliage relative humidity in a range of net radiation less than 0.15 ly/min is thought to be caused by the closure of stomata due to low radiation intensity. In a range of net radiation higher than about 0.15 ly/min, the foliage relative humidity decreases monotonically with increasing net radiation. In a sufficiently moist air (Ra=90-100 %), the foliage relative humidity is 65 to 95 per cent, always less than that in the surrounding air. The foliage relative humidity of the leaf is 55 to 70 per cent, in relatively dry air (Ra=50 %) showing that the foliage humdity is higher than that in the air. © 1969, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

Graham, N., CSIRO, Ian Clunies Ross Animal Research Laboratory, NSW, 2150, Australia","Energy, carbon, and nitrogen balances were determined in adult wether sheep given a diet of lucerne hay and whole oats at several planes of nutrition between fasting and ad libitum. Four sheep were studied when their weight was c. 30 kg (10% fat) and later when they weighed c. 75 kg (33% fat); another four were studied at c. 70 kg (30% fat) and later at c. 45 kg (16% fat). The most obvious effect of fatness was loss of appetite. Voluntary food intake began to decline when body weight approached 60 kg and was half of the maximal amount when the sheep weighed 70 kg or more; one very fat sheep ate only 100-200 g food/day for several weeks. In addition, environmental changes such as transfer from a pen to a cage or respiration chamber often caused temporary inappetence when the sheep were in fat condition but seldom when they were lean. Fasting metabolic rate increased with body weight in accordance with the relationship generally applicable to adult sheep except when the sheep were in the anorectic phase of obesity, at which time their metabolic rate was 30-40% above normal. The digestibility of the diet was not dependent on the fatness of the sheep, nor was the relationship between metabolizable and digestible energy. At each level of feeding, the heaviest sheep produced most heat, but differences were less than at fasting; oxidation of fat, rather than protein, was responsible. When daily heat production and metabolizable energy were both expressed as multiples of the fasting energy loss, all sheep conformed to one relationship; the same held for the relation between energy balance and metabolizable energy. Net efficiency (change of energy balance divided by change of metabolizable energy intake) was 78% for maintenance and 55% for production, irrespective of body condition. Gross efficiency (energy storage divided by gross energy intake) was strongly influenced by body condition. When fed ad libitum, thin sheep achieved an efficiency of c. 26% and fat sheep reached 21% whereas anorectic very fat sheep never exceeded 10%. Thin, fat, and very fat sheep required 400, 500, and 650 g dry matter/day respectively for maintenance (zero gross efficiency). © 1969 CSIRO.

These methods of unloading the fan are substantiated by the results of tests.

A change in the composition of both diets occurred after 2 years, when the protein quality of the high protein diet was improved and the energy content of both diets was increased. Vitamin A determinations were carried out on 245 piglet livers and 32 pairs of kidneys and lungs at birth from 47 sows. The livers, kidneys and lungs of 16 sows were also analysed for vitamin A after approximately 4 years on experiment. Vitamin A was detected at birth with antimony trichloride in the liver of the piglet, but not in the kidney or lung. The sow's kidney was found to contain only small amounts and lung tissue only traces. A dietary vitamin A level of 4800 i.u./kg during the breeding life of healthy sows, or 8600 i.u./day during gestation, was adequate from the point of view of both a constant storage in piglet livers at birth over eight to ten parities and a relatively high concentration remaining in sow livers after that period. This conclusion is in line with recommendations of the Agricultural Research Council (1966). As a consequence of differences in both the condition of the sows and in their responses in the two periods, the results for each period are presented separately. In the first 2-year period, when the sows received a relatively low intake of dietary protein during gestation (between 248 and 317 g protein/sow/day), and a low energy intake; that is, when protein was used for energy production, the liver vitamin A storage of the piglet at birth was increased by raising either the daily protein intake during gestation to 352 g, or the food intake from 1.8 to 2.3 kg/sow/day. Liver vitamin A and N concentrations were negatively correlated with liver weight, but increasing dietary protein concentration raised liver weight and its vitamin A content. Liver vitamin A per piglet was not affected by litter size. A conclusion may not be drawn concerning the contribution of dietary energy to the differences in response between periods, because in addition to dietary changes other differences occurred between periods. Nevertheless, in the second 2-year period, when energy intake during gestation was adequate for normal growth and development, a difference of 150 g in protein intake/sow/day (363 g against 208 g) had no effect on liver weight or its vitamin A content. Furthermore, there was no significant treatment effect on total protein or albumin concentrations in the serum of the sow. © 1969, Cambridge University Press.

The advantages of this method are: (a) no heat flux measurements are needed; (6) no liquid temperature need be measured; (c) theoretically assumed boundary conditions can be experimentally realised; (d) absence of convection can be experimentally verified.

The storage ring injector is a 50 MeV FFAG electron synchrotron. The bunched beam from the synchrotron is injected into the storage ring in a single turn. Radio-frequency capture is accomplished by using the signal from the bunched beam as the master oscillator during capture. Using this method, high capture efficiency is achieved. A useful consequence of the method of radio-frequency capture is the damping of the coherent synchrotron oscillation instability. The beam may be accelerated, or decelerated, to any energy within the capability of the ring - 10 MeV to 240 MeV. The vacuum system operates at a pressure in the mid 10–10range allowing lifetimes of many hours for low intensity beams. During the first year of operation several interesting effects have been observed. Among these were photo etching of metal from the vacuum chamber by synchrotron radiation and enhanced beam loss due to scattering from ions trapped in the electron beam. The beam also exhibits a transverse coherent instability that violates the Courant-Sessler criteria for stability.

Quantization to three or four levels is the minimum step of demodulator complexity beyond hard decisions. A simple extension of binary decoding is described which achieves a large part of the maximum improvement theoretically available with unquantized demodulation. The usual decoding process is modified only to the extent that two decoding operations are performed, rather than one. Also, storage is needed to compare the two resulting words to select the preferred one. With four-level demodulation, an improvement of more than one decibel is demonstrated even for small code word lengths over a nonfading phase shift keyed (PSK) coherent channel with white Gaussian noise.

Endocrine changes during late pregnancy might have stimulated metabolism of the pesticide. Very little HEOD was eliminated from pregnant heifers between contamination and parturition. Dietary treatments fed postpartum were: 1) medium energy (three groups), 2) high energy, and 3) high energy-alfalfa pellets (which depressed milk fat). Residue decline in milk fat was similar for all treatments, with levels decreasing to one-half the initial level by three weeks, and to one-third by five weeks. After lactation began, pesticide in shoulder fat declined exponentially at 8.1 to 12.7 per week. About 2.5% of the daily intake was excreted as unchanged HEOD in the feces during contamination, and traces in urine. The presence of HEOD in feces 30 days after contamination ceased indicates metabolic origin and recycling. © 1969, American Dairy Science Association.

Eimeria acervulina, E. necatrix, and E. meleagrimitis sporozoites were examined for carbohydrates by cytochemical methods during dormancy, after excystation, and after penetration of cells. The only carbohydrate found was amylopectin, a homogeneous polymer of glucose. It was distributed in 3 regions: (a) in front of the anterior refractile globule, (b) around the nucleus, and (c) behind the posterior refractile globule. The relative amounts decreased after excystation and penetration of cells until only small amounts remained around the nucleus. The quantity of amylopectin decreased following excystation from 30.0‐36.7 to 9.4‐13.3 μg glucose/106 oocysts. Over a 6 yr period of storage at 4 C, there was a decrease in the quantity of amylopectin in dormant sporozoites of E. acervulina from 33.3 μg glucose/106 oocysts at 3 mos to 1.5 μg at 6 years. Coincidentally, 3 month‐ and 1 year‐old oocysts of E. acervulina produced patent infections in chicks with a dosage of 5 × 104 oocysts, but only a few of the oocysts that had been stored for 2 years were infective; a dosage of 2 × 106 oocysts was necessary to produce a patent infection. Oocysts which had been stored 6 years did not produce a patent infection. It was concluded that amylopectin is the energy source for excystation and subsequent penetration of cells. Small amounts of amylopectin are used during dormancy and, when the content in the sporozoite falls below a certain level, the sporozoites lack sufficient energy to infect cells.

At low rates, deformation by flow of the adhesive appears to determine the peel behavior and the peel force is strongly rate dependent. At high rates, little or no viscous deformation of the adhesive occurs and the peel force is independent of rate. At intermediate pulling rates, cyclical instability of made of failure involving alternate storage and dissipation of elastic energy in the backing, results in the phenomenon of “slip‐stick” peeling, in which failure is jerky and regular. Results have been obtained which show how the pulling rates at which transitions from one mode of peel to another occur, and the peel force values for a given type of failure, depend upon such factors as molecular weight of adhesive, thickness of backing film, and angle of peeling.

The metabolism of the developing cercaria was studied by exposing infected snails to 14C-glucose and thereafter determining the distribution of 14C in the emerging cercariae. In one experiment, the radioactivity in the cercariae increased to a high peak on day 6 after 14C exposure, declined rapidly to day 12, and less rapidly to day 30. In a second experiment, increase and decrease were more moderate and the peak was reached on day 13. Protein, nucleic acid, lipid, and glycogen fractions were labeled with 14C. Radioactivity was highest during the first few days after infection and declined rapidly thereafter in most fractions, but the nucleic acid fraction retained a relatively high level of radioactivity for 19 days. When 14C-labeled cercariae were maintained free-living overnight, most of the radioactivity of the glycogen fraction disappeared. Free-living cercariae metabolized exogenous glucose to a very slight degree shortly after emergence, but activity increased after 18 hours of free-living existence and deletion of endogenous glycogen. Pyruvate was utilized very rapidly under both conditions resulting in production of CO2 from all three carbons and incorporation of a small fraction of the pyruvate carbon into the principal macromolecules. α-Ketoglutarate and acetate, and, to a small extent, glutamate, glutamine, and some of the intermediates of the citric acid cycle were also catabolized. The metabolic activity of the schistosomule appeared to differ considerably from that of the cercaria-the most pronounced difference being a great reduction in the level of pyruvate catabolism. We concluded that the developing cercaria is primarily engaged in synthesis and storage of glycogen. The free-living cercaria is geared to the production of energy either from its stores of glycogen or from an exogenous substrate such as pyruvate. The schistosomule loses its adaptation to rapid production of energy and, presumably, is again primarily engaged in synthesis. © 1969.","Carbon-14; Cercaria; Citric acidcycle intermediates; CO2 production; Glucose; Glutamate; Glycogen content; Glycogen utilization; Metabolism; Pyruvate; Radioisotope labeling; Schistosoma mansoni; Schistosomule; Synthesis of macromolecules","carbon dioxide; glucose; glutamic acid derivative; glycogen; pyruvic acid derivative; animal; article; biosynthesis; citric acid cycle; metabolism; mouse; rat; Schistosoma; snail; Animal; Carbon Dioxide; Citric Acid Cycle; Glucose; Glutamates; Glycogen; Mice; Pyruvates; Rats; Schistosoma; Snails",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014565312

In conventional systems the active devices (tubes, transistors) that generate these pulses must handle the peak RF power. In this paper a new method of generating RF pulses is described in which the active devices need handle only the average power. The key element in this new method is a magnetic coupling network that consists of a balanced interconnection of four nonlinear inductors. This coupling network is termed the variable mutual coupling network (VMCN). High-power RF pulses are generated by ac charging of a high-Q circuit called the RF storage tank. This storage tank is coupled to the load by'means of the VMCN. During charging the VMCN is balanced such that no mutual coupling exists between the storage tank and the load. When the storage tank is fully charged, control currents are applied to the VMCN causing an unbalance to occur because of the nonlinear B-H characteristics of the inductors, and thereby introducing a mutual coupling between the storage tank and the load. The energy in the storage tank is thus transferred to the load in the form of an RF pulse. © 1969, IEEE.

The model accommodates both quasistatic and dynamic effects. Key parameters in the theory relate to wall energy, material inhomogeneity, and the variation of wall contour, shape, and width with the application of transverse fields. The model assumes an abrupt creep threshold, a creep distance per cycle of transverse: Field which is typically a fraction of the wall width, and a creep distance per cycle of transverse field which is linear in the magnitude of the transverse field in the neighborhood of the threshold fields. A mechanical analog of the simple linearized theory has been constructed to demonstrate creep properties. In the model energetic binding of a wall to film inhomogeneities is replaced by mechanical friction, the energy storage properties of the walls by elastic bodies, and the driving fields by mechanical forces.

A brief description is given of other types of hydrogen- oxygen cell, for example the ion-exchange membrane type used in the Gemini flights. Great efforts are now being made all over the world to adapt the fuel cell for use with conventional hydrocarbon fuels and air; the many difficulties that must be overcome before a unit suitable for ordinary commercial use can be achieved will be enumerated. The experience built up in the field of fuel cells is now being applied to the development of lightweight electrochemical storage systems, the need for which is becoming of paramount importance, especially for the propulsion of city traffic. © 1969.",,"ANO; ELCAA; FUEL CELLS; HYDROCARBONS; ION EXCHANGERS; PAST; SPACE FLIGHT",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014543652

In both trials, concentrations dropped to one-half their initial levels after four weeks of decontamination and to one-third after six weeks. Dieldrin in whole milk did not change when milk fat was decreased by pelleted hay. Adipose in cows fed thyroprotein contained higher levels of dieldrin than the controls.

During a period of 26 months of air-dry storage of Hawaiian and Puerto Rico latosols, one soil showed an increase in activity to 108·5 per cent and others a decrease to as little as 36 per cent. Urease activity found in 6-12 years stored, air-dry agricultural soils correlated with the organic matter content rather than with the numbers of microorganisms. In samples from the 60-years-old Hilgard soil collection, urease activity reflected both the organic carbon content and the numbers of organisms present. Measurable urease activities were detected in 8715 and 9550-years-old, radiocarbon dated, Alaska permafrost samples. No activity was detected in a 32,000-years-old sample. No urease activity was present in two high-salinity soils. Urease activity was detected in an alkali soil and in an acid soil, but highest activity was usually found in neutral soils. A high-energy electron-beam irradiation dosage of 4 Mrad increased urease activity in some soils, but decreased activity in two others. Doses of 8 Mrad decreased urease activity below their native levels in all soils. Evidently, an intracellular urease component becomes more accessible to substrate upon death of organisms. This effect is observable because of the strong resistance of soil urease to radiation inactivation. Urea-amended Dublin soil, subjected to incubation at 80 per cent relative humidity showed a measurable urease activity. It appears that an extracellular component of soil urease becomes associated with inorganic and organic soil colloidal particles and retains its activity for extended periods of time. A new method for urease activity determination in soils was devised, based on the detection of 14CO2 release from 14C-urea-amended soils. © 1969.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002136614

There are several advantages for a low-temperature beam addressable memory. First, the memory medium, an EuO film, gives large magneto-optic effects which result in a fast readout rate. Second, at a low operating temperature, the specific heat of the material is small since the lattice and electronic specific heats are proportional to T3 and T, respectively. Thus, thermowriting requires much less energy at low temperature than at room temperature. Third, because of the low-energy requirement for the read-write transducer, injection lasers with fast switching speeds can be used. Fourth, the films that were investigated can sustain small-area magnetization reversals. Using injection lasers as transducers and EuO films as memory-storage elements, reading and writing experiments were carried out. Bits of &lt;3 μ in diameter were written with a 10-mW laser in 10 nsec by using thermal writing. The laser energy required to write such a bit is 10-3 erg; and since no substantial magnetic spread was observed in a thin film of EuO, the density of packing is essentially limited by optics. High-speed reading experiments were also carried out. Since the magneto-optic conversion efficiency is very high, a good S/N ratio for detection was achieved by a 1-mW laser pulse of a few nanoseconds duration. © 1968 The American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36849111603

However, when an external bias magnetic field is applied along the easy direction of one of the films, only two states of the coupled system have minimum energy. It can be shown that these two stable states are not collinear in magnetization orientations and the resulting switching characteristic is quite different from that of a uniaxial coupled film device. A new associative memory device based on the above-mentioned switching characteristics is presented in this paper. Nondestructive content interrogation is feasible on this device by applying a current on the strip line intervening between two magnetic layers. When the polarity of the interrogation current mismatches the state of the device, a signal is induced in a detection strip line orthogonal to the interrogation line and located on top of both magnetic films. On the other hand, when the current polarity matches the device state, none or very little flux change is experienced by the detection line. The mismatch signal is always of one polarity independent of the device state. A device sample with electroplated magnetic and conductive layers and photoetched strip lines has been fabricated. The scheme of two storage cells per bit is adopted to cancel capacitive noise. Two 2-bit (4 cells) words have been successfully operated in a parallel by bit content search mode.

Significantly, extreme cleaning of the contact surfaces was not necessary. Systematic studies were not undertaken until 1932, when Holm and Meissner2 investigated PbSingle Bond signPb, SnSingle Bond signSn, and SnSingle Bond signPb contacts at various temperatures and magnetic fields. Their contact supercurrents reached fractions of an ampere. By deliberately depositing insulating layers on Ta contact surfaces, Dietrich3 in 1952 found strong evidence for small supercurrents through thin (≃15 Å) layers of this kind. In a theoretical study in 1962, Josephson 4 found that such currents can result from a special kind of weak coupling between the two wave functions representing the superelectrons in the two contact member. Josephson weak coupling may also take place via a normal conducting layer; in fact Meissner, in 1958 had shown experimentally that interposed normal layers up to 3000 Å (and also ferromagnetic layers up to 100 Å) do not prevent an otherwise superconducting contact from passing small supercurrents. The authors recently found that in a changing magnetic field, these currents oscillate like those through insulating layers. 5 The magnitude of the critical current and its response to an external magnetic field usually places a superconductive pressure contact into one of several distinct empirical groups. While weak-coupling currents through nearly uniform layers are quenched by fields of a few gauss, metallic microbridges (formed by asperities on the contact surfaces) sustain small supercurrents in the fields of 1000 G and higher.6 ""Intermediate coupling"" is generally characterized by critical currents which are larger (≥100 mA) and less field sensitive than those from weak coupling. Some oxidized PbSingle Bond signPb contacts showed thus far unexplained hysteretic current peaks (up to 500 mA) near 40 G. ""Strong coupling"" may be defined as the case when a contact behaves like a single, but not necessarily like a singly connected, superconductor. Strong coupling may be attained by applying an extreme contact force which leads, at least in spots, to cold-welding. While this method is satisfactory for making permanent connections, it is not feasible for switches.7 The authors show, however, that large ""strong coupling"" currents (≈240 A) can be carried by releasable contacts with moderately clean surfaces under moderate force (≃10 kg). In comparison to other superconductive ""switches, "" those with pressure contacts offer the advantage of virtually infinite resistance and, thus, loss-free operation in the ""open"" mode. At the same time, the possibly undesirable heat flow across the contact is also interrupted. Remote operation by a superconductive relay mechanism has been demonstrated. Applications of strong coupling contacts in energy storage systems, for transient magnetic fields, and in low-loss high-frequency circuitry are predicted. Weak-coupling pressure contacts compete with analogous junction devices made by thin-film techniques. Here, the main advantage of the pressure contact is seen in its adjustability and in its superior coupling to microwave and ir electromagnetic fields. © 1968 The American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36849101024

Incorporated 14C-leucine does not exchange with an excess of soluble-12C-leucine. Incorporation into protein is partly dependent on the addition of a high speed supernatant fraction which incorporates leucine into a product with the properties of aminoacyl RNA. Addition of polyuridylic acid to microsomes isolated from fresh disks stimulates the incorporation of phenylalanine into protein nine-fold but has no effect on leucine incorporation. Polyuridylic acid - stimulated incorporation is not inhibited by chloramphenicol. Preincubation of fresh microsomes with trypsin does not increase their activity. These results suggest that the low activity of fresh microsomes may be due to a lack of messenger RNA. The mitochondrial fraction shows a rise and fall in leucine-incorporating ability during aging similar to that shown by the microsomal fraction. Studies with inhibitors suggest that about 25% of this incorporation is due to the mitochondria themselves, the rest being attributable to large microsomes.

The event is divided into three parts: the ordinary diffusive component, the halo, and the core. The core corotates with the interplanetary field, and therefore it and the surrounding halo are interpreted as spatial features which are connected by the interplanetary magnetic field lines to the vicinity of the flare region. Upper limits to the interplanetary transverse diffusion coefficient for 4-20 meV protons at 1 AU are derived from the width of the halo. These are at least two orders of magnitude less than the parallel diffusion coefficient for the same energy particles. It is argued that the observed flux variations cannot be explained by an impulsive point source injection for any physically reasonable diffusion model. Instead, since the interplanetary transverse-diffusion coefficient is small for these low-energy particles, the observed spatial features are interpreted as the projection to 1 AU by the interplanetary field lines of an extensive injection profile at the sun.

This occurred before the flare-associated shockwave arrived at the earth, so that the space was filled with energetic particles ejected from the flare. Satellite measurements have shown that in such a case <20 MeV protons are stored within the range of the sector boundary and with decreasing energy the particles tend to accumulate towards and behind the Eastern boundary limit; low-energy particles, such as <50 keV electrons, are stored exclusively behind this Eastern limit. The boundary crossing caused a short-lived geomagnetic disturbance, a PCA enhancement in lower latitudes, a two-phase ionospheric disturbance, and a transient cosmic-ray decrease on neutron monitors looking westward immediately after the sector boundary passed the earth.

The sample with least cross-linking was also studied after extraction of its sol fraction (56.5%). The frequency and temperature ranges were 0.05-600 cps and -42 to 102°; the creep experiments extended to durations of 5 days. The creep data were converted to the corresponding dynamic viscoelastic functions at very low frequencies. All data were combined by reduction to 25° with shift factors calculated from earlier viscosity measurements by Plazek on an uncross-linked sa nple of similar molecular weight. Only the region of secondary (low frequency) loss was encompassed, the primary transition zone lying at higher reduced frequencies. The equilibrium compliances, Je, were obtained by fitting the creep data to a modification of the empirical equation of Thirion and Chasset. The compliance corresponding to the entanglement network was obtained by difference between the equilibrium compliance and the integral over the retardation spectrum in the secondary loss region: log JeN = -6.47, corresponding to an entanglement spacing of 220 chain atoms. With increasing cross-linking, the secondary (low frequency) maximum in the loss tangent decreased in magnitude and shifted to higher frequencies, as observed for several other rubbers. From swelling and sol extraction measurements, and the assumption that both cross-linking and chain scission by high-energy electrons were proportional to the radiation dose, the parameters needed to compare the ratio.JeN/Je with a recent theory of Langley were obtained. The agreement was satisfactory, indicating that the low-frequency loss mechanism might be attributed to the relaxation of untrapped entanglements on floating structures loosely attached to the three-dimensional network. An approximate extension of this theory is qualitatively successful in explaining the frequency dependence of the storage compliance at intermediate frequencies. © 1968, American Chemical Society.

Data from captives are employed in discussions of energetic variations related to (1) food, the source of nutritive input, (2) fat, the major form of caloric storage in birds, and (3) caloric expenditure. Metabolizable energy is partitioned by phase of the annual cycle into existence energy, including the costs of thermoregulation, and productive energy, including expenditures for nocturnal activity (Zugunruhe) and molt. Costs of vernal migration in field birds are compared with costs of nocturnal activity in captives to show that energetic estimates in each situation are compatible. This conclusion is supported by a metabolic estimate made for field birds that is within 6% of the estimated metabolism of captives under similar conditions. Data and statistics from seven additional species of buntings are used to examine several bioenergetic principles for homoiotherms.

Their activities range from exploration and development of petroleum reservoirs, tar sands and oil shales, to diversification in energy associated industries such as those producing coal or nuclear fuel. In light of these developments, the public image of an “oil company” is changing from strictly a petroleum alignment to one that is concerned with the nation’s overall energy requirements and uses. Petroleum engineers are well trained to exploit conventional petroleum reservoirs; however, the development of the additional sources of energy now will require engineers with a different type of training. In order to provide for these new technical manpower needs, a program has been developed at Oklahoma State University that integrates all of the energy related aspects of the various classical engineering fields into one discipline. This new concept in education, called Energy Resources Engineering, encompasses training in the production, processing, conversion, transportation, storage and utilization of energy. It is the purpose of this paper to review the development of the program in Energy Resources Engineering at OSU and to present a discussion of experiences gained during its first two years of operation.

Smith. The model of the first simple theory consists of two Maxwell elements (system 1 and 2) connected in parallel and the following criteria for fracture are introduced. (1) Fracture occurs first at the system 1, and then at the system 2 where the whole load is applied. (2) Fracture of the system 1 occurs either when the spring reaches the critical strain ε11c(in the case of large strain rate) or the dashpot does so to ε12c(in the case of small strain rate). For the deformation of constant rate R, the following results are obtained, which explain the experimental behaviors well at least qualitatively. [formula ommited] at larger strain rates [formula ommited] at smaller strain rates where σ, ε, G and τ follow the ordinary use and suffices 1 and 2 mean system 1 and 2 respectively and the suffix b does so “at break”. Next the above model theory is so extended to the generalized Maxwell bodies as to read that the stress of deformation at constant rate is expressed by the equation [formula ommited] In this case the storage energy Wstand the dissipation energy Wdisof deformation are calculated after Landel, and the following criterion is introduced, that is, the sample breaks either when the elastic part with its own modulus G0(the instantaneous modulus) reaches the critical strain ε1cor the viscous part with its steady flow viscosity η0reaches the critical strain ε2c. The results are given as [formula ommited] at larger strain rates [formula ommited] at smaller strain rates where G′ and η′ are dynamic modulus and viscosity respectively. Considering the dependence of G′ and η′ on shear rate and temperature, the failure envelope can be explained with these equations. © 1968, The Society of Materials Science, Japan.

Since a continuously operating energy source is also desired to assure reignition in the event of flame-out, a spark ignition system is used. Problems of timing, moisture, and storage have been encountered. To solve a wet spark plug problem, a pulse form converter was added to the circuitry to increase the voltage output slope sharply. To overcome the tendency for spark gap breakdown voltage requirements to increase during aging in storage, a diode was added between the exciter and the pulse-forming circuit. With such improvements the system weight grew, yet spark energy remained marginal. Two new 150-mjoule/spark, 100- spark/sec systems with different waveform characteristics have been developed.

A Pm-147 oxide capsule was used as the heat source in a nominal 20-mlb NH3 thruster. The radioisojet mechanical design features were found to be quite similar to those for the thermal storage resistance jet. This permitted a parallel development and test program where the electrically heated thruster was constructed to the same physical dimensions as the radioisotope version. Initial and final testing of the electrically heated thruster was performed at General Electric Company. An interim 2-week continuous test program was performed at Mound Laboratory using both heater versions. Thrust, propellant mass flow, and temperature profiles were measured during these tests. The nominal 60-w (thermal) source produced core temperatures in excess of 1650°F at measured thrust levels up to 22 mlb. The corresponding specific impulse values were found to be greater than 230 sec for single-pulse operation having on-times up to 5 sec with thruster initially at nonflow steady state. A specific impulse of 152 sec steady state was demonstrated for continuous flow operation at 13 mlb thrust. There was excellent agreement in measured thrust and specific impulse for the electrically heated and radioisotope- heated thrusters at a rated power input of 60 w. Data correlated very closely also as a function of duty cycle and propellant flow rate over the range from zero to 100% on-time (i.e., continuous flow). Discrepancies in measured core temperatures between the two thrusters were attributed to location of sensing elements with respect to the heat source. Application of the radioisojet to a number of missions has been considered. Long-life, low-thrust applications, for which the power penalty must be borne by the auxiliary propulsion system, are attractive in terms of weight, reliability, and cost. © 1968 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003220416

The supplied energy is thus not completely thermalized but stored in a highly ordered fashion.

S. Atomic Energy Commission, continues to be active in developing, de-signing, and building nuclear reactors. The Nondestructive Testing Group has been instrumental in the support of these programs by providing services in the inspection of the reactor components. Nuclear counting systems are applied in many phases of the testing program. Radiation transmission measurements, utilizing many different radiation sources, are applied to the determination of material thickness, density, and composition. Beta-backscatter techniques are used in the measurement of coating thickness for many coating and substrate materials. Radiation counting techniques are used for the determination of reactor element fuel loadings. For all of these systems, the digital count information must be related through the use of appropriate standards to the physical characteristics of the material under inspection. The calibration data obtained from the standards can be expressed by means of empirical equations of elementary form. With the advent of the relatively inexpensive programmable electronic desk calculators, the direct, on-line conversion, reduction, and display of the test data became possible. The nuclear counting systems used in the nondestructive testing program employ conventional digital counters and record-ers. The primary counters are Beckman/ Berkeley EPUT Meters, driving digital printers and/or piper-tape punch units. Wang Laboratories undertook the design and manufacture of an electronic calculating system capable of direct connection to the existing counting equipment. The calculating system is a slave to the data acquisition equipment, providing the calculating ability, but exercising no control over the operation of the system. The electronic calculator is provided with electrical interfacing which allows direct input from the EPUT Meter and direct output to a printer/punch. The unit contains 320 steps of programming capability, provision for 160 programming steps from the auxiliary programmer, a total of 16 storage registers in addition to the normal display and adder registers, and a wide range of operational commands. A keyboard unit for the manual control of the system also allows its operation as an off-line calculator. In normal operation, the hard-wired program or an auxiliary program is selected. All necessary constants are entered manually. The system is placed under program control and proceeds automatically. At the end of the counting period, the digital data from the EPUT Meter are read into the calculator, the calculator resets and releases the counter for the next counting period, the program completes the solution of the equation, and displays the final results on the control keyboard and writes the results on the printer/punch. Solutions to equations of the following forms have been obtained under program control: Y = A + BX + CX2 + DX3 +. … (1) Y = exp(A + BX + CX2 + DX3 + …), (2)Y=A+BlnX+ C(ln X)2 + D(ln X)3 +. … (3)-… Y = exp(A + B ln X + C(lnX)2+ D(ln X)3 + …). (4) Many other basic equations, including trigonometric equations, can be solved with the system. Most of the solutions are performed in less than two seconds. The advent of small programmable calculators has made possible the direct incorporation of a data processing system into a data acquisition system at reasonable cost. The use of these systems for the on-line processing of test data provides the operator with direct presentation of the results in meaningful units, rather than as raw data. The test operator thus has an increased awareness of the significance of the measurement being performed.

The system enjoyed a highly successful flight in the spring of 1967 and another flight is currently scheduled for the fall of 1967. The system was comprised of four large-area beryllium-window proportional counters, an analog pulse-height-to-time converter, a digital data assembler and a complete PCM multiplexer. The system was capable of analyzing x-ray events at average input rates in excess of 50,000 events per second. The pulse-height-to-time converter, in conjunction with a portion of the digital data assembler, formed a 64-channel pulse-height analyzer and provided an energy resolution of 0.5 keV per channel over the 3–30 keV energy range of the detectors. The data assembler, using a non-linear, lump digital decoding technique, compiled and stored a complete spectrum on board the rocket. Channel address accumulators were completely buffered so that while one spectrum was being time multiplexed to telemetry, another was being accumulated. This technique gives rise to very short dead-time periods and enabled the detector and pulse-height converter to operate in random-access fashion at high input rates. The PCM multiplexer portion of the system time multiplexed all of the spectral information, along with absolute rate data, and applicable timing and I.D. information into a serial Non-Return-to-Zero-Level (NRZL) formatted binary output with sufficient drive to directly modulate an FM transmitter. The multiplexer operated from a single, stable 20 kHz oscillator. The timing was such that a complete spectrum, along with rate and timing data, was transmitted each 4.75 milliseconds. A complete frame of 20 spectra, rate and timing signals and all necessary I.D.'s were sent every 0.1 second. An economical demultiplexer was designed and built for the processing of pre-flight calibration data and for field checkout. This unit accepted the serial wavetrain from the flight instrument and completely demultiplexed it so that the data could be coupled to a standard laboratory pulse-height analyzer for storage, visual display and complete print-out capability. The demultiplexer processed all of the data in a completely digital fashion from the same 20 kHz clock that was in the flight package, so that no D-A and A-D conversion errors were introduced by the demultiplexer or laboratory PHA.

This resulted, at an early stage, in adaptation of the guyed towers, characterized by low weight and cost, the design of which, in 110-, 220-, and 400-kV lines, is continuously developed. Switching stations have been simplified, shunt reactors and series capacitors installed, and remote control of voltage at power stations adopted.

The alternators are represented by a linearized set of Park's equations in a form suitable for investigating the effects of voltage regulator action. Dynamic optimization of the large-order model system based on iterative control solutions presents considerable difficulties, and a method for simplifying the overall problem by decomposition for a multilevel multicriteria piecewise optimization of a set of independent subdivisions is investigated.

When the thermal conductivity of the liquid is small, the functions describing these spectra take on particularly simple forms. In addition to the unshifted Rayleigh line, caused by scattering from isobaric density fluctuations, the spectrum for a nonrelaxing liquid is just the response of a resonant system driven by thermal energy. For a relaxing liquid, the spectral distribution function has a somewhat more complicated form, but its interpretation is still quite straightforward. The use of electric circuit equivalents illustrates the principal features of the response spectrum. These results are formal ones, but while they are useful in understanding the scattering process, they are not particularly suited for the analysis of experimental results. For this purpose, approximations are developed that enable one to relate the outâ€ standing characteristics of the spectrum (for example, the positions and halfâ€ widths of shifted lines) to fundamental relaxation parameters, such as the longitudinal storage and loss moduli. © 1968, Acoustical Society of America.

The complex modulus is a two-component quantity, which has a real part associated with the elastic or energy storage characteristics of the material and an imaginary part associated with its viscous or energy dissipation characteristics.

On the other hand, the determination of energy dissipation from stress-strain hysteresis curves does not depend on any assumption concerning material behavior, because the area enclosed by the curve gives a direct measure of the energy dissipated in a single cycle of deformation. The dissipation characteristics obtained by the two methods are compared and used to illustrate the degree of validity and some limitations of linear viscoelasticity theory. © 1968.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49949125478

Although extremely high doses (2 Mrad or more) produced immediate, detectable damage to chloroplast ultrastructure, 1 Mrad, despite its lethality, produced little or no immediate detectable damage to chloroplast ultrastructure. The 1 Mrad dose greatly retards the normal physiological deterioration of chloroplast structure that occurs in non-γ-irradiated leaf tips in darkness. The 1 Mrad dose also preserves the capacity of the leaf tissue to emit glow curves upon warming in darkness after illumination at - 196 °C, but prevents the normal emission of delayed light at room temperature after illumination. This indicates normal capacity to put energy from the photoreaction into electron traps in the photosynthetic pigment system exclusive of subsequent enzyme reactions. It indicates, further, an absence of normal energy storage in the photosynthetic system coupled to the enzymatic reactions of electron transport. The 2 Mrad dose, which produces immediate ultrastructural damage, also destroys subsequently even the capacity to emit glow curves. At the ultrastructural level, responses of other cellular organelles to the lethal doses were similar to the responses of chloroplasts. The effects of 1 Mrad on maintaining ultrastructure in darkness, which have parallel effects on chlorophyll retention, also have parallel effects on retention of insoluble nitrogen. © 1968 Pergamon Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49949124206

Little fundamental difference between the two cases was observed. In both cases the graft conversion curve is trapped radical type and the overall activation energies are 9.7 and 8.4 kcal/mol for 0.947‐density PE and 0.916‐density PE, respectively. Percent grafting is proportional to the square root of the dose rate (= total dose). The retarding effect of oxygen at irradiation or storage after irradiation on the grafting scarcely appears when the irradiation temperature or storage temperature is below 15°C. For thinner film and lower density of PE this effect appears clearly at the higher temperature. Therefore, it may be concluded that the low‐temperature grafting of butadiene onto PE preirradiated in air is initiated predominantly by nonoxidized radical (allyl radical) trapped in PE and that the grafting reaction occurs in the semicrystalline part of PE.

This prospectus bases on the following hypotheses: 1. (1) The earth's outer shell, particularly the rigid lithosphere, is irregularly fractured, and the hypothesis of continental accretion is accepted; 2. (2) the earth's outer shell is heterogeneous, multilayered, and has low thermal conductivity, and there are lateral temperature variations in these layers; 3. (3) the hypothesis of mantle-wide, regular and cyclic thermal convection in the earth is rejected, and the asthenosphere-wide convection hypothesis is preferred; 4. (4) the generation of thermal energy in the earth is, or has been in excess of the energy removed by the surface heat flow; and 5. (5) the temperature at the earth's surface is approximately constant in time, and the earth's outer shell has never been ""totally"" molten since its formation. The outer shell refers to the uppermost 700 km layer of the earth with the upper 60 km as the lithosphere and the rest the asthenosphere. The thermoelasticity of the earth is briefly reviewed, and the thermoelastic energy storage in the outer shell is estimated as of the order of 1035 ergs or higher, which is in conformity with the amount of excess thermal energy that may be accumulated in the earth during a geologic epoch. As the thermoelastic energy accumulates, the stress levels of the multiple layers in the outer shell rise accordingly, with differential expansion following. Within a geologic epoch, the stress difference in the lithosphere would reach its critical value, meanwhile the accumulated energy would also produce melting in the upper asthenosphere and then induce drastic changes in physical conditions to the surroundings. Because of the rigid, fractured and multilayered nature of the outer shell, catastrophic failures would occur before the upper asthenosphere was totally molten. These gigantic failures represent the major release of the disequilibrium energy in the earth and would occur repeatedly as the excess thermal energy continues to accumulate; so that all the basic geological phenomena are episodically induced. The immediate effect of the failure would be the excitation of polar wandering and a short-lived wobbling of the figure axis about the rotation axis, which might consequently produce torsion on the earth. The failure would also produce a torque on the earth which would force the lithosphere blocks to slide slowly over the asthenosphere relative with each other and thus result continental drift, orogenesis, epeirogenesis and other related phenomena. In the meantime, intense extrusion and intrusion of molten materials from the upper asthenosphere might immediately follow, which would ""seal off"" old geofractures and thus enlarge the continents. The after-failure tectonic activity would last a long time and a large amount of energy would thus be consumed. As the accumulated disequilibrium energy in the earth was greatly released, the earth would gradually return to its relatively quiescent period but, in the meantime, new energy accumulation would proceed for the next diastrophism. By and large, this dynamical prospectus may serve to interpret almost all the major geological puzzles observed. © 1968.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345465567

There is a requirement for Pi, but not for any added cofactor except ADP. α-Glycerol phosphate, acetyl carnitine, various citric acid cycle intermediates, and amino acids are oxidized more slowly than pyruvate + malate. A highly active acetyl CoA-carnitine transferase is present in these mitochondria, but acetyl CoA synthetase is absent. Homogenates of Prodenia flight muscle can completely and rapidly oxidize glucose, trehalose, glycogen, and phosphorylated hexoses. The enzyme trehalase appears to be localized mainly in particles lighter than mitochondria; its activity can be enhanced some fifteenfold by repeated freezing and thawing and by sonication. The glycogen reserves of newly emerged moths are too small to sustain flight for a significant period of time.

Cells were treated with various mutagens and plated immediately onto selective and nonselective growth medium or else they were subject before plating to liquid holding in buffer for various lengths of time. In respiratory competent cells liquid holding caused a decrease in lethality and in conversion frequencies. Respiratory deficient cells, unable to use a non-fermentable substrate as an energy source, behaved different. Untreated cells started to die in buffer after two days of storage, and moreover, there was a considerable increase in potential convertants i.e. cells giving rise to gene convertants when plated on selective growth media. Respiratory deficient cells treated with various chemical mutagens were still more sensitive to liquid holding. After low, sublethal doses cells started to die after one day of liquid holding already and when plated on media selective for convertants, showed an increasing frequency of gene convertants. Addition of very low concentrations of glucose to the liquid holding buffer post-poned the lethal and convertogenic effects. Higher concentrations of glucose completely abolished sensitivity to liquid holding-induced lethality and genetic alterations. The results are interpreted to mean that in respiratory deficient cells no repair activities are possible to an accumulation of spontaneous lethal damage and genetic alterations which are expressed as gene conversion when an energy source becomes available. Such a repairless condition causes an increased sensitivity to genetically active agents, and provides a useful system to detect genetic effects of slowly reacting agents. © 1968 Springer-Verlag.",,"alkylating agent; DNA; glucose; mutagenic agent; nitrite; nitroso derivative; sulfonic acid derivative; article; breathing; drug effect; extrachromosomal inheritance; metabolism; mitosis; mutation; Saccharomyces; time; Alkylating Agents; DNA; Extrachromosomal Inheritance; Glucose; Mitosis; Mutagens; Mutation; Nitrites; Nitroso Compounds; Respiration; Saccharomyces; Sulfonic Acids; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014399972

The ""heavy"" fraction is completely uncoupled: although electron transport is possible in the light, neither illumination nor an acidbase transition can cause either ATP formation, or activation of ATPase. The ""light"" fraction is competent in both reactions, activated in either fashion. The loss of energy coupling in ""heavy"" particles is correlated with a loss of osmotic response (swelling or shrinking in response to graded sucrose concentrations) and with a loss in the ability to store succinate in a space inaccessible to inulin. When ""light"" particles are shrunken by exposure to sucrose, their ability to store succinate, and the amount of ATP formed after an acid-base transition, are both decreased more markedly than are other functions. Chloroplasts uncoupled by EDTA retain their osmotic properties and their ability to store succinate, so the effect of this treatment is not perceptibly due to an alteration of membrane properties. These data are interpreted as illustrating the need for an intact, osmotically sound graua membrane as a necessary but not a sufficient prerequisite for energy coupling.

This decreased rate may be caused by a reduction of the activity of myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase, which in turn may be causally related to the depression of cardiac function. In considering the efficiency of the failing heart, the translation of myocardial tension into useful circulatory work must also be considered. In this case, efficiency could be reduced by geometric factors such as ventricular size and shape and wall thickness or asynchrony of contraction.

A significant reduction was produced in heart rate, left ventricular isometric tension development (dp/dt) and pressure-time per minute, whereas left ventricular end-diastolic pressure rose. Cardiac output and left ventricular mean systolic pressure and mechanical work did not change consistently. Myocardial oxygen consumption was influenced by left ventricular external work and pressure-time per min., the latter having the predominant effect. Myocardial oxygen consumption was not closely related to the consistent reduction of dp/dt, presumably because of wide variations in stroke volume. Coronary blood flow was reduced in 5 of 8 patients, changes in coronary diastolic vascular resistance in most cases favoring the preservation of an autoregulatory mechanism. A constant or reduced coronary arteriovenous oxygen extraction in 6 of 9 patients suggested that changes in perfusion rather than in extraction accommodated the altered myocardial oxygen needs. Propranolol appeared to have no direct action on vasomotor tone but probably reduced extravascular compression resistance. Myocardial efficiency did not change consistently. External efficiency was generally reduced, but internal efficiency rose in 3 patients. When a reduction in efficiency indexes resulted from decreased cardiac work but increased coronary flow and myocardial oxygen consumption, the overstressed myocardium may have benefited. Total myocardial substrate oxygen extraction ratios exceeded 100 per cent under control conditions and after beta blockade; therefore the respective energy contributions of carbohydrates and fatty acids were obscure, and conversion and storage seemed likely. The NAD+/NADH redox potential gradient was consistently changed to a more positive value. Arterial levels of inorganic phosphate and creatine phosphokinase activity rose, and the myocardial balance of creatine phosphokinase became positive after propranolol. The antianginal action of propranolol may be related to the following mechanisms: (1) myocardial work is reduced, thus lessening the disparity between oxygen demand and supply; (2) a relative or absolute improvement in coronary perfusion and myocardial oxygen delivery may result, subject to arteriolosclerotic limitations; (3) changes in myocardial intermediary metabolism and enzyme systems favor lessened cellular hypoxia and enhanced aerobiosis. © 1968.",,"carbohydrate; creatine kinase; fatty acid; fructose bisphosphate aldolase; phosphate; propranolol; adult; aged; angina pectoris; article; blood; blood pressure; coronary artery disease; drug effect; female; heart catheterization; heart muscle; heart output; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; male; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; oxygen consumption; Adult; Aged; Angina Pectoris; Blood Pressure; Carbohydrates; Cardiac Output; Coronary Disease; Creatine Kinase; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase; Heart Catheterization; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Human; Male; Middle Age; Myocardium; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen Consumption; Phosphates; Propranolol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014298507

Emphasis was placed on deriving readily-used relationships for practical situations. The static tests were conducted at a temperature of 40° F, simulating cold storage conditions and at 90°F simulating field conditions. Apples were subjected to loads of 2-7 lb for 100 and 24 h respectively. The resulting bruise volume and permanent deformation were noted. Mechanical properties, such as yield point and elastic modulus (expressed in terms of Poisson's ratio), were determined using a 1 4 in dia plunger with a compression testing device. The differences between the 40°F properties and those at 90°F were noted. These differences were used to predict the effects of dead loads at 90°F using the results for 40°F. For the impact tests the fruit, on a 3 ft simple pendulum, was dropped from the desired height and allowed to strike a heavy steel block, which was assumed to be a rigid surface. This test was conducted at 40 and 90°F. The mechanical properties were determined using the 1 4 in plunger. Impact load was expressed in terms of energy absorbed and momentum absorced. The criterion for damage was the volume of bruise, as related to load. The maximum allowable load can then be determined using an acceptable value for allowable bruise volume. An analysis of apples in bulk quantities was carried out using the data from static tests to predict the optimum design characteristics of bulk bins for reducing bruising of apples as handled in practice. © 1968.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005326348

The wall temperature variation is not specified in advance, but rather, is dynamically determined by a balance of the heat-transfer rate and the energy storage. In the analytical formulation, the commonly used quasi-steady assumption is lifted in favor of the local application of the energy equation, the solution of which leads to an eigenvalue problem in which the eigenvalues are complex (real and imaginary parts). The series expansion properties of the corresponding complex eigenfunctions, which are essential to the solution, are verified. Numerical results are obtained for the time and space dependence of the wall and bulk temperatures and of the Nusselt number. These results identify conditions under which the wall temperature variations are negligible and the instantaneous Nusselt number is virtually time-independent. In addition, numerical information on the overall performance of the duct as a heat exchanger is provided by means of the ratio of the outgoing to the incoming energy flux. It is shown that for a wide range of operating conditions, the overall performance can be described by a single curve. For comparison purposes, results for the overall performance are also derived using the quasi-steady model. Quasi-steady results are evaluated for both spatially uniform and spatially varying heat-transfer coefficients. It was found that, for a range of operating conditions, the quasi-steady model is able to give accurate performance predictions, especially where it is used in conjunction with spatially varying heat-transfer coefficients. © 1968.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001612012

In recent years developments in computers and minimization algorithms have made it possible to determine the displacement state that satisfies the variational principle without direct recourse to the solution of a system of equations. In this paper an unconstrained minimization approach is applied to a problem in finite-element structural analysis and is shown numerically to be competitive with conventional methods. Adopting an energyminimization viewpoint, important storage advantages of the conjugate-gradient method are extended by eliminating the need for an assembled stiffness matrix. The convergence of conjugate direction methods in quadratic problems is shown to be greatly influenced by scale effects. This problem is studied using the eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix and a practical solution is proposed which by a special scaling transformation can improve the ratio of the maximum to the minimum eigenvalue by several orders of magnitude. This transformation is applied with considerable success to a plate-bending problem. © 1968 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000203990

Single crystal rods of 4-79 moly-Permalloy were swaged in the [111] and [001] orientations, as were crystals of the following orientations subjected to plane strain compression: (001) [100], (001) [110], (110) [001], (110) [1̄12], (110) [1̄10], (111) [1̄12], (112) [1̄10] and (112) [1̄1̄1]. Magnetic torque measurements show that all crystals developed a uniaxial anisotropy upon deformation, with the easy magnetic direction in good agreement with our previous theoretical deductions. In the [001] swaged crystal, deviation of the observed easy axis from the calculated value was rationalized in terms of unequal participation of the expected slip systems. In all cases of plane strain compression, the induced anisotropy constant rose to a maximum value, and then decreased, as the thickness reduction was increased. In one experiment, crystals of a 2%Mo-76% Ni-22%Fe alloy received a long-range-ordering treatment at 475°C for 190 h prior to plane strain compression in the (110) [1̄12] orientation. The anisotropy energy reached a maximum value of 460 000 erg/cm3, the highest value of slip-induced anisotropy thus far reported in Fe-Ni alloys. As for the anisotropy decrease at large reductions, reorientation of slip-induced atom pairs as a result of lattice rotation, is undoubtedly a factor. However, this explanation is not valid for the (110) [1̄12] orientation, which remained stable even after 98% reduction. A more widely applicable mechanism is advanced, whereby the decrease in anisotropy is attributed to randomization of the atom pairs through slip across antiphase ordered domain boundaries, both those grown-in and those created by intersecting slip. Additional observations have been made of the crystallographic texture and magnetic squareness in cold-formed polycrystalline Permalloy tapes, which are currently used as magnetic memory elements in storage devices. The results are satisfactorily explained in terms of slip-induced directional-order theory. Implications of seeded single crystals to these results are discussed. © 1967 The American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36849103691

This effect is not the recognized statistical one (which only concerns the nucleation of fracture), but derives from the strain-energy in the system and concerns the stability of slow-growing cracks after nucleation. Recent experimental observations, in which this effect was noted, are cited and a theory proposed to account for them. This theory is based on the fact that a highly unstable equilibrium exists between the respective rates of strain-energy release and energy demand. When the system is over-stocked with strain-energy, any sudden drop in energy demand creates an excess of energy released. This then takes the form of kinetic energy capable of doing work against the remaining resistance, in turn, resulting in a lower fracture load and reduced ductility. Specimen size enters these considerations only in so far as it governs the amount of stored energy; consequently the effect is most pronounced in flexure. Although the effect was so far observed in materials with moderate ductility, it is speculated that fine techniques might reveal its presence both ""ideally"" brittle and ""ideally"" ductile materials. © 1967 P.

The relative intensity of delayed singlet emission from chlorophyll was measured from 10-3 sec to 102 sec after cessation of illumination in the wild-type and two non-photosynthetic mutants of a green alga, Scenedesmus obliquus. 2. Mutant 11, in which the oxygen-evolving, short-wavelength photoreaction (photoreaction II) was blocked, emitted very low intensities of delayed light compared with the wild-type. When the emission was averaged from 0.75 to 4.2 msec from the center of a flash of exciting light, the wild-type emitted 250 times the intensity emitted by mutant 11. 3. Mutant 8, in which the pyridine nucleotide-reducing, long-wavelength photoreaction (photoreaction I) was blocked, emitted delayed light with different decay kinetics from those of the wild-type. In the millisecond time range, mutant 8 emitted higher intensities of delayed light, and the emission decayed very slowly. In the second time range, mutant 8 emitted lower intensities than the wild-type, and the decay was rapid. 4. On the basis of the two-photoreaction hypothesis, and of the earlier evidence from photosynthetic bacteria which indicates that functional reaction centers are required in order for delayed light to be emitted, the weak emission from mutant 11 implies that nearly all delayed light from normal plants is due to energy storage by photoreaction II. 5. The altered decay kinetics of mutant 8 (higher intensity, slower decay) in the msec time range are shown to be consistent with the Hill and Bendall hypothesis of two photoreactions linked by an electron-transport chain. Lack of function of photoreaction I would result in a completely reduced electron-transport chain which could not accept reducing equivalents from photoreaction II. 6. The altered decay kinetics of mutant 8 in the second time range are shown to be inconsistent with any modification of the Hill and Bendall hypothesis which does not provide a pathway for reducing equivalents to migrate from photoreaction I to photoreaction II. A comparison of this long-term delayed light in the wild-type and mutant 8 implies the presence of a slow charge migration (1-50 sec) in the wild-type from photoreaction I to photoreaction II, which in turn results in long-term light emission by photoreaction II. 7. Two modifications of the Hill and Bendall hypothesis, both of which provide for appropriate charge migration, are discussed. The present data may be accounted for either by the addition of a second electron-transport chain or by a single inhomogeneous pigment system which harvests energy from two spatially separated reaction centers. The latter hypothesis also accounts for a number of previously published observations. © 1967.",,"chlorophyll; alga; article; electron transport; energy transfer; kinetics; light; metabolism; mutation; photosynthesis; Algae; Chlorophyll; Electron Transport; Energy Transfer; Kinetics; Light; Mutation; Photosynthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0014193462

The computing system selected for this study is a prototype of the SOLOMON parallel processing system (cited as SOLOMON II) which was developed at the Westinghouse Defense and Space Center, Baltimore, Maryland. Emphasis is placed on the problem of numerical weather prediction mainly because of the large data storage and manipulation required, plus the extensive numerical analysis that is involved. The mathematical basis for numerical weather forecasting lies in the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. From these principles, research meteorologists have devised equations which express the physical laws governing the atmosphere. These basic equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and are well suited for solution by the SOLOMON II system. The computational method is to replace the region of interest by a grid system and replace the continuous equations by their finite difference approximations. In this representation, the programmer can take maximum advantage of mode control, neighboring connections, variable geometry, and simultaneous operation of a network of processing elements. Another topic discussed is the numerical solution of elliptic partial differential equations by the parallel processing network. It is felt by the authors that a parallel processing system of this type will offer a significant increase in computational speed over that of a sequentially organized computing system in the field of fluid dynamics as well as in other scientific fields. © 1967, ACM.

This scheme, referred to as the Iranian Gas Trunkline, or IGAT Project, will consist of a 680 miles pipeline system originating at the Southern Oil Fields, passing across the Zagros mountains to Esfahan and Saveh, where there will be a spur to Tehran, crossing the Alborz Range, and finally terminating at the frontier at Astara. En route, the line would also supply gas to about 150 villages for power generation for agricultural purposes. There will be a gathering system from a number of oil fields which will collect high and medium pressure associated gas, obtained as a result of crude oil production, remove heavy hydrocarbons, treat for water and acid components, and transport dry gas to a central point where it will be compressed for transportation to the North. The IGAT Project will have a capacity to supply gas commencing with export of about 600 million SCF/D in 1970, rising to about 1000 million SCF/D in 1974, and remaining at that level at constant delivery per day thereafter. Gas consumption for Iran including main line compressors will be at a daily average of 200 million SCF/D in 1970, rising gradually to 650 million SCF/D in 1979. The implementation of the project is to be carried out in two phases. During the first phase which takes about 4 years (1966-1970) proper equipment and facilities will be installed to meet the gas requirements up to 1974 for (a) export and (b) for major internal industrial and commercial consumption. This phase of the project is aimed at January 1970 as the target for its completion, and April of the same year as the deadline. The second phase of implementation will consist of additional horsepower installation in the gathering fields and the main line, extending the gathering system to the adjacent fields for meeting higher gas demands, providing underground storage facilities to cope with the peak requirements for Iranian towns, and extending the distribution network for supplying gas for domestic purposes. The total installed cost of the facilities of the first phase of IGAT Project is estimated at the equivalent of about $350 million. The salient parts of the project as brought out in the paper are as follows: (1) Features of main pipeline, problems of construction in crossing the Zagros and the Alborz ranges. The bulk of the pipeline in the mountainous area is carried through the central Zagros at an altitude of 1800-2200 metres. The most difficult part of this route is Dinar Mountain, the section about 100 kms from Gach Saran where the altitude changes from 500 metres to 2200 metres in a distance of about 25 kms, with steep sides rising almost vertically. The terrain of this particular section is extremely rough, with a pronounced quantity of steep grades, side hills, and rock. (2) The role of dome gases in feeding and/or balancing the system. Solution of peak demands and seasonal and daily fluctuations and possible solutions to storage problems. (3) Effect of gas utilisation on development of other sources of energy in Iran.

Therefore we can damp undesirable vibrations of some machines or tools by using them as structural materials in place of metals. But unfortunately high material damping often seems incompatible with high stiffness or small temperature coefficients of stiffness or damping itself. It is the aim of this paper to study experimentally such interrelations between internal loss and stiffness for many practical polymers. The temperature dependence of complex dynamic Young's moduli of twelve thermoplastic resins and three thermosetting resins, of which the latter the dynamic viscoelastic properties have hitherto been but scantily reported, has been measured of dozens of cps and in the temperature range of -30∼+100°C. It has been shown that the loss tangents of these polymers are approximately proportional to the temperature coefficients of storage moduli. The proportion factor K(T) for amorphous polymers in the glass transition region depends roughly on activation energy of relaxation time and absolute temperature. A method of calculating approximate values of activation energy from measurement of K(T) at a fixed frequency has been studied about an example of NBS polyisobuthylene measured by Ferry et al. Experimental results on the explicit relations between the storage modulus and the loss tangent are given for many polymers and commented on briefly from the standpoint of structural damping. © 1967, The Society of Materials Science, Japan.

Materials which are useful for thermal energy storage fall into this category. The method has several unique features. The basic principle involved consists of raising the surface temperature of a solid specimen at a uniform rate. After the initial transients have died out, the diffusivity can be determined from temperature measurements alone. The advantages of the method are: (a) Heat flux measurements are not needed; (b) materials can be tested right up to the melting point, since the specimens can be encapsulated, and softening can be tolerated; (c) large temperature ranges can be tested quickly; (d) precision and accuracy are good. The method has been extended to the liquid range, and results will be published as Part II. Results of measurements are reported for alumina and lithium fluoride.

The results indicate that the seasonal pattern of evaporation is governed by heat storage changes, and that these changes are closely associated with atmospheric energy export from the lake. This finding provides a physical basis for the simple empirical relationships between monthly evaporation and island‐to‐mainland temperature differentials that are developed from the water budget evaporation data. Substantial atmospheric energy export, a concomitant of heat storage changes, reduces the energy available for evaporation. Therefore, evaporation from a large deep lake is less than that from a large shallow lake under comparable climatic conditions. The analysis also provides speculative reasoning and evidence to indicate that evaporation from a large deep lake is closely related to the radiant heat transfer to the sky.

The digital beam deflector produces a range of quantized beam output positions by the use of an assembly of electro-optic polarization switches coupled through birefringent elements. The analogue light deflector produces a continuously variable range of beam output positions by electro-optic variation of the refractive index of a deflecting element. In each case the number of resolvable output positions is determined by the diffraction angle of the light beam, the amount of background light generated, and the aberrations of the system. Electro-optic beam deflectors may in future be applied to data reading and storage in computers, as well as in information displays, optical printers, and in multiple switching arrays. Using the electro-optic materials at present available, the maximum number of resolvable output positions in a two-dimensional deflector system is of the order of 106/cm2. Limitations of switching speed arise through power dissipation in the electro-optic material and the large reactive energy storage in the switches. However, using existing materials and those which should be available in the near future, switching speeds in excess of 106 random addresses per second should be possible in deflectors of this capacity. © 1967, The Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers.

This was attributed to the cost of alternating between energy storage and oxidation of reserves: Activity differences were not a cause. Overall, the net energy value of the food decreased as frequency of feeding decreased. Prediction from chemical composition or digestibility was not reliable. Measurement of hour by hour changes in metabolism indicated that there was an intense phase of fermentation and lipogenesis immediately after feeding. With 3-hourly or daily feeding, the oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and methane production increased respectively by 0-7, 2-5, and O.3 1/hr/lOOg food eaten in the first hour: With the highest level of feeding, these represent increases up to 2.4-fold and an R.Q. of 1.15. With feeding every fourth day the responses were very much less, indicating depressed rumen activity; blood urea levels were also relatively low. © 1967 CSIRO.

To allow beam bumping to either side of the equilibrium orbit, each pulse is independent in polarity and magnitude. Two pulses per machine cycle are provided, but the system is being expanded to five. The system consists of the beam bumper magnet time-sharing two independent energy storage subsystems each containing two series ignitrons, one for each polarity and two crowbar ignitrons, one for each polarity. A logic system automatically triggers the crowbar associated with a given subsystem. An early crowbar trigger can be used which shunts the coil well before peak current occurs reducing the peak current on a given pulse. Each subsystem contains a 2 A, 14 kV power supply and 450 µF of capacitance. The beam bumper magnet has a 4-turn coil which may be connected either in parallel or series. The inductance for one turn is 1.6 µH. The beam may be targeted or extracted in less than 20 µs or as long as several hundred µs, depending on the choice of C and L.

There was very little difference in enzymic activity between myosin B isolated from prerigor, rigor (24 hr post‐mortem) or post‐rigor (312 hr post‐mortem) muscle stored at either 2° or 16°C except that the specific activity of myosin B prepared from muscle stored for 12–24, hr post‐mortem was higher than activity of myosin B prepared immediately after death. This increase cannot be explained in terms of rigor shortening, but suggests that a change in myosin conformation or in the nature of the actin‐myosin interaction occurs in post‐mortem muscle. If an actin‐myosin interaction occurs during rigor mortis and if this association remains unchanged during extraction of myosin B, then the very low Mg++‐modified myosin B enzymic activities obtained at Γ/2 = 0.19 and 0.52 indicate that this interaction is not irreversible. Extraction in the absence of ATP produced a myosin B whose ATPase activity was markedly inhibited by trace amounts of Mg++. This may be due to the absence of a‐actinin in these myosin B preparations. No consistent differences in activation energies were found either at Γ/2 = 0.19 or 0.52 among the NTPase reactions of myosin B samples prepared from muscle after various times of post‐mortem storage.

For example, a charged capacitor, short-circuited by an ideal conductor, loses all of its initial stored energy. This can be explained as a limiting case problem, which could not be physically carried out in any experiment, where the dissipated energy has the indeterminate form (0· ∞). This paper gives a pedagogical treatment of this problem, bringing out the distinctions between the mathematical and physical problems. Energy is not necessarily “radiated” during this transient, as is sometimes claimed. For specially chosen geometry of the structure, the true radiation can be made vanishingly small. Furthermore, when radiation is present it can be accurately represented in circuit terms by introducing a circuit resistor to represent the radiation resistance of the structure acting as an antenna.

Three alternate approaches to the development of an implantable system capable of meeting this power requirement are presented and evaluated. The biologic fuel cell is attractive in principle, but significant advances in technology are essential to the development of a practical device. Rechargeable battery systems may not meet reliability requirements and are heavier than desired. The recommended approach consists of a miniature Rankine cycle reciprocating engine powered by a radioisotope energy source and containing a thermal energy storage cell to accommodate peak loads. An important consideration in totally implanted systems is the additional endogenous heat produced by the energy source. To evaluate this problem, an experimental model is described utilizing electrically energized heat exchangers implanted in dogs. Investigations to date suggest that the body should be able to dissipate this amount of heat, using normal physiologic mechanisms.

The need for a fast, reliable switch for the control of such systems is pointed out. A new inductive energy storage switching system that fulfills this need is described. The new system utilizesan ignitron bridge circuit and a capacitor to invert from the unidirectional current of an inductive source to an alternating voltage of triangular waveform. The alternating voltage is used to charge and periodically recharge a small capacitor. This capacitor in its turn supplies energy to the load. Thus, by the use of two capacitors, whose maximum stored energy is very small compared to the total energy to be transferred, the stored energy may be transferred to the load in discrete parcels. The disassociation of storage and load circuit allows the transfer of all stored energy to the load, with the exception of the usual resistive energy loss imparted by circuit elements, a quantity that can be kept small. Therefore, the energy efficiency is higher than here to fore attained by inductive energy storage systems. The above-described switching system does not depend upon moving contacts or mechanical devices. The system results in significant reductions in initial cost per joule of energy stored as compared to the cost of capacitive energy storage systems. The inherent low energy efficiency of earlier inductive energy storage systems is discussed and it is pointed out that the theoretical energy efficiency of the bridge scheme is much higher. Current relations in the circuit during charge and during transfer are described. A small-scale prototype has been constructed and operated successfully. Oscillograms of currents and voltages in this circuit are shown. Optimization of circuit parameters is discussed briefly.

Particular examples are abnormalities which may be seen in the storage and mobilisation of lipid and in the relative contribution of glucose and fatty acid to energy needs. The concept of a Glucose Fatty Acid Cycle is reviewed and forms the basis for recent studies which are outlined. An essential feature of the Cycle is the proposal that the normal relationship between glucose and fatty acid metabolism is reciprocal and not dependent; and that the augmented release of fatty acids for oxidation in muscle and other tissues in diabetes is not primarily due to defective glucose metabolism. The release and oxidation of fatty acids may depend upon lipolysis which may be directly regulated by hormone action and not dependent upon glucose metabolism. It can also depend upon esterification of fatty acids which may involve the metabolism of glucose to glycerol phosphate. Evidence is presented that lipid mobilization in the alloxan-diabetic rat which may be insensitive to inhibition by insulin action is primarily dependent upon activation of lipolysis. Although the concentration of glycerol phosphate is diminished in muscle in this form of diabetes this is not a consequence of diminished glucose uptake and it is moreover associated with an increased rate of esterification of fatty acids. In adipose tissue the concentration of glycerol phosphate is not reduced, even though glucose uptake is diminished, and the rate of esterification of fatty acid is accelerated. The concentration of triglyceride in muscle is increased in alloxan-diabetes in the rat and this may be attributed to increased mobilisation of fatty acids from adipose tissue associated with increased esterification to triglyceride in muscle. An increased rate of glucose uptake may be an important factor leading to triglyceride storage in adipose tissue and possibly in muscle when insulin acts on these tissues in the normal animal.

Thee important electrical parameters of these devices were measured before, during, and after irradiation at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's 22-Mev Cyclotron. The results obtained from the MOS field-effect study show that their degradation processes include that of charge storage in the silicon dioxide insulating layer and radiation-induced changes in surface states. MOS transistors have been found to degrade at orders of magnitude less integrated proton flux than many bipolar and junction field-effect transistors; therefore, for space applications in radiation fields such as Van Allen Belts and solar particle events, these devices may be subject to serious radiation damage. The junction field-effect transistor desplays a large initial spread in device irradiation response. However, it appears to possess a high degree of resistance to proton irradiation. The integrated circuits tested were of the monolithic type and under proton irradiation displayed a large reduction of minority carrier lifetime in the base region of the circuit transistors. Other less important defects are reduction of free carrier concentration and reduction in mobility. Important electrical parameters that are affected by radiation are imput threshold voltages, output low level voltages, leakages currents, and transient characteristics.

Apophosphorylase b was crystallized in the presence of Mg2+, adenosine 5'-phosphate (AMP), and 2-mercaptoethanol. It could regain full activity by incubation with PLP, following an uptake of ca. 1.2 moles of cofactor/ 125, 000 g of protein. Reconstitution in the presence of a large excess of PLP or other aldehydes, related or unrelated to PLP, caused marked inhibition of the enzymatic activity, that could be reversed by treatment with l-cysteine and gel filtration through Sephadex G-25. The reconstituted enzyme was indistinguishable from native phosphorylase b in its PLP content, heat stability, sedimentation properties, and its rate of resolution. Apophosphorylase b was considerably more labile than the holoenzyme at high temperatures, and upon storage. It behaved as a typical associating-dissociating system, whose state of aggregation was much more sensitive to changes in chemical or physical environment: apophosphorylase b existed predominantly as a tetramer at 0°, a dimer at 23°, and a monomer at 35°. High ionic strength favored aggregation. The rate of reconstitution of apophosphorylase b increased greatly with temperature; an energy of activation of 22.3 kcal/mole was calculated for this process. AMP did not affect reconstitution of apophosphorylase b, in marked contrast to the process of resolution which was blocked by this nucleotide. However, apophosphorylase b did retain its ability to interact with AMP since the nucleotide promoted aggregation and crystallization of the apoenzyme and protected it from denaturation on storage. The site phosphorylated by phosphorylase b kinase during the conversion of phosphorylase b to a was not affected by resolution, since both incorporation of phosphate and appearance of phosphorylase a activity (measured after reconstitution with PLP) occurred at the same rate with the apo- and the holoenzyme. It was concluded that although the AMP-binding site and the sites involved in the b to a conversion were not noticeably affected by resolution, removal of PLP resulted in a less organized protein structure as indicated by a total loss of enzymatic activity, a considerable decrease in stability, and an increased tendency to undergo changes in quaternary structure. © 1966, American Chemical Society.

These tests were done under four conditions: spontaneous breathing with 50 per cent N2O + 50 per cent O2 unless apnoea became imminent (chloroform-usual, cyclopropane-occasional, Innovar-briefly); controlled breathing with 50 per cent N2O + 50 per cent O2; controlled breathing with 85 per cent N2O + 15 per cent O2; and controlled breathing with 50 per cent N2O + 47.5 per cent O2 + 2.5 per cent CO2. Anaesthesia was induced in all experiments with 20 mg./kg. thiopental. Cyclopropane was administered with 70 per cent oxygen in a closed-circle system with an absorber under the first two conditions only. The remaining inhalation agents were administered in a non-rebreathing system. Thiopental and Innovar were administered intravenously by drip infusion for one hour. Blood assays of histamine, serotonin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were carried out at the beginning and end of each test along with measurements of the pH, {Mathematical expression}, haematocrit, SGOT, SGPT, lactate, pyruvate, blood water, sugar, potassium, and inorganic phosphorus. Volume of blood withdrawn for the tests was replaced with 0.9 per cent saline. During each test, mean arterial blood pressure was measured directly from the femoral artery; breathing rate and volume were monitored with a respirometer during spontaneous breathing or regulated at 350 to 400 ml./kg./min. during controlled breathing; heart rate and rhythm were monitored and recorded from E.C.G. (lead 2), and urine excretion was monitored and recorded by gravity drainage with a catheter attached to a calibrated trap bottle. All data were analyzed statistically. The following effects were noted: 1. Thiopental usually caused a rise in the catecholamines, but no hypotension or oliguria; 2. Innovar usually caused a rise in blood sugar, hypotension and oliguria; elevation of catecholamines was inconsistent; 3. Diethyl ether caused metabolic acidosis, haemoconcentration, water loss, hyperglycaemia, excess lactate, elevation of catecholamines and oliguria, but no hypotension; 4. Cyclopropane caused hypercapnoea (during spontaneous respiration) and oliguria, but no hypotension; catecholamines rose slightly; 5. Chloroform caused slight hyperglycaemia and oliguria; 6. Trichlorethylene caused ollguria and a rise in serotonin when CO2 was administered; 7. Fluroxene caused hyperglycaemia and elevated lactate and pyruvate during spontaneous breathing, a rise in the catecholamines during mild hypoxia, and oliguria; 8. Halothane, halothane-ether azeotrope, and methoxyflurane caused hypotension and oliguria, but no consistent metabolic changes. It was evident that diethyl ether caused the most obvious metabolic disturbances, and these were usually accompanied by a rise in the catecholamines. There were virtually no consistent or appreciable changes in the histamine or serotonin assays. Theoretically, it is possible that alterations in the latter two biogenic amines might have occurred to a greater extent than the reported values indicate, since it is possible that they were released and then were taken up rapidly by the tissues or receptors of the effector organs or broken down metabolically. For that matter, catecholamines released into the blood during anaesthesia with some agents (the halogenated agents and cyclopropane) may have had the same fate, whereas with diethyl ether they remained in the bloodstream. However, it is unlikely that this occurred, for if it had, there might have been less likelihood of hypotension, at least with the more potent halogenated anaesthetics. It is important to keep in mind also that when considering the percentage changes in these biogenic amines one takes a distorted view, particularly with respect to the catecholamine values, because the assay method involves technical errors of such a magnitude that when the amount measured is near zero, or near the lower limit of detectability (as was observed with many of the control values of epinephrine), it is difficult to accept as significant those changes that appear large during an experiment. The complex phosphorylase systems which regulate carbohydrate fat and pro tein metabolism, and of which we know too little at present, the storage and functional eompa~h~ents where the biogenic amines remain hidden from biochemical assay, and whose diverse actions and interactions have yet to be clearly explained, and the several cellular ions of which potassium is poorly represented in the blood serum, hold many secrets that make it virtually impossible currently to present a clear picture of mechanisms involved in the alteration in energy metabolism in response to general anaesthesia. To explain the marked difference in response of the organism to diethyl-ether anaesthesia as compared to most other general anaesthetics therefore requires far more sophisticated knowledge than we now have. We must therefore resort to guessing on the basis of the small bits of information that can with difficulty be elicited. © 1966 Canadian Anesthesiologists.",,"adrenalin; anesthetic agent; benperidol; chloroform; cyclopropane derivative; ether derivative; fentanyl; halothane; histamine; methoxyflurane; noradrenalin; serotonin; thiopental; trichloroethylene; anesthesia; animal; anoxia; article; blood; breathing; dog; Anesthesia; Anesthetics; Animal; Anoxia; Benperidol; Chloroform; Cyclopropanes; Dogs; Epinephrine; Ethers; Ethyl Ethers; Fentanyl; Halothane; Histamine; Methoxyflurane; Norepinephrine; Respiration; Serotonin; Thiopental; Trichloroethylene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0013883983

High organ specificity (leaves, unpollinated styles, pollen) was observed, along with a high content of free tryptophane and proline in the pollen. In unpollinated styles slow protein synthesis takes place during the first 24 hour period after their removal from the plant. After cross pollination a slight decrease in net protein content is seen which is due to the presence of penetrating pollen tubes. An increase noted in the concentration of amide containing groups can be linked to protein and amino acid degradation. In the first 12 - 18 hrs. after self pollination protein synthesis stops abruptly, to be resumed again slowly after 20 hrs. This change does not correspond to an alteration in free amino acid concentration. In pollinated styles the amount of free amino acids from protein degradation is much higher than the actual increase of amino acid concentration, especially after selfing. This must mean that the amino acids resulting from protein hydrolysis are used up as an energy supplying substrate. There is evidence for the existence of two different amino acid pools in the style: a storage pool to serve as source of oxygen for respiration, and another small pool which provides amino acids for protein synthesis. In a style penetrated by growing pollen tubes evidence of compartmenting and metabolic channeling has been obtained, thus variation in the free amino acid pool is the physiological expression of pollen tube growth. The striking increase of the tryptophane concentration, especially after outbreeding, seems to be linked to the metabolism of growth hormones of the indole group. The specific influence of incompatible pollen tubes on the amino acid pools is discussed in connection with recent theories on the physiological mechanism of gametophytic incompatibility and the formation of allosteric molecules as genetic regulators of inhibitor synthesis. © 1966 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047675243

The depth of thermocline (D) of lakes which is observed mainly under mid-summer conditions is shown to change with the fetch size of lakes (l). A similar relation is also obtained between the annual heat budget of lakes (ΣQ) and the fetch size. It is approximated by [formula omitted] Total evaporation from deep lakes over the first half pariod of the year (in which heat flux in lakes is downward) decreases with increasing the fetch size and is expressed by [formula omitted] On the other hand, total lake evaporation over the second half period (in which heat flux is upward) increases with the fetch size as follows: [formula omitted] The proportional constants in the above relations are shown to vary largely with the intensity of the energy influx to the water surface. It is concluded from the results mentioned above that the these constants depend upon latitude and climate at lake sites. In a shallow and small water body, the rate of change of heat storage in water layer is negligibly small compared with other heat balance items. In this case, the evaporation can be assessed approximately on a routine basis by the bulk-aerodynamic method or the combinatiom method. However, in a deep and large water body, the rate of change of heat storage is very large and gives a significant influence on lake evaporation. The author wishes to express his thanks to Dr. E.

All specimens showed an attenuation of the thickness of the aortic wall as well as a decrease in the number of layers of elastic membranes from the arch to the bifurcation. The attenuation was less prominent in the older and heavier animals. The reduction in the number of elastic membranes at the lower end indicates a reduced requirement for the storage of ventricular energy by the elastic constituents for blood propulsion. Gravitational forces may be instrumental in maintaining blood flow to the lower extremities without additional expenditure of energy of ventricular origin.

The power conditioning systems discussed in recent engineering papers have generally been planned for unmanned craft or were for optimizations of specific electrical loads of modest demand levels, and used conventional battery, solar cell/battery, or fuel cell energy sources. Therefore, an advanced design to supply a greater (by an order-of-magnitude) electrical demand from a radioisotope-dynamic generator drive system, and which meets manned spacecraft design criteria, represents a significant and unique contribution to aerospace electrical design. This paper identifies and discusses (l) the unique electrical design criteria and constraints associated with the radioisotope Brayton cycle drive system, (2) the tradeoff considerations which were necessary to optimize the total system with respect to speed, frequency, and efficiency, (3) the rationale for the selection of the alternator and the frequency converters, and (4) the distribution system design criteria which were established to assure flexibility, efficiency, maintainability, and safe emergency operations.

This is due, in large part, to the tendency of these engines to undergo frequent and severe electrical arcing. The unusual ruggedness and efficiency requirements for such power systems are in direct conflict with the requirement for an extremely light weight. This paper describes a six-stage nondissipatively-regulated modular conversion system in which the use of an unconventional method for accomplishing dc-to-dc conversion, current-feedback base drive for the power transistors, and a relatively high (10 kc/s) intermediate conversion frequency results in an efficient and lightweight power-conditioning system with excellent protection characteristics. In this modular 2000-volt 1600-watt system, voltage conversion is accomplished by means of multiple-winding energy-storage transformers, each containing a core with an air gap. These transformers are caused to absorb energy from the source on one half cycle and to discharge energy into the output filter and load on the succeeding half cycle. This configuration makes possible a converter in which no semiconductor element is subjected to an immediate or abrupt transient as a result of a short circuit across the high-voltage output; protection schemes need not be elaborate. This “energy-pumping” conversion technique, in which the special energy-storage transformers perform multiple functions involving not only voltage conversion but also filtering, nondissipative regulation, and system protection, results in a system which is physically very simple.

Global cloudcover information is provided by sensors mounted on a 3-axis stabilized, earth-oriented spacecraft. Electrical power for the spacecraft and sensors is provided by a solar-conversion energy-storage subsystem. This paper describes the evolution of the power supply subsystems designed for use on the Nimbus spacecraft. The original design, generated during the period 19611963, used dissipative regulation techniques and simple battery protection circuits. Battery overcharge protection was provided by ground control of special spacecraft loads. This type of system was successfully flown on Nimbus 1 in August 1964 and on Nimbus 2 in May 1966. The second generation design, currently being fabricated for test and evaluation, is intended for operational flight use in late 1967. The system concept, based on research and development effort in the period 1962-65, incorporates nondissipative regulation techniques and automatic battery overcharge control. A new concept, intended for use in a third generation Nimbus power system, is presently being explored. Recent advances in power conditioning technology will allow substantial gains in terms of extended spacecraft life or increased load capability. The new technology, called maximum power point tracking, assures more optimum source-to-load energy transfer. Thus, the increase in available solar cell energy caused by periodic, large, low-temperature excursions of the Nimbus solar array can be fully utilized. The implementation of the tracker technique into the Nimbus multiple storage module concept provides a flexible and unique system wherein the number of storage modules may be easily adjusted to satisfy mission requirements. © 1966 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84935408891

At the heart of the system are two inter-connected small computers (ASI 210 and 2100). These machines have fast operation times and both have 8192 words of core memory.

To establish the limits of present state-of-the-art equipment for precision gamma-ray spectrometry, an extensive evaluation has been made of amplifiers, threshold amplifiers, gain stabilizers, and 4096-channel ADC's.

For each moisture level a survival dose curve was constructed. The percentage survival of the seedlings after 4-weeks growth in a Knop's nutrient solution was used as a criterion of radiation damage. A definitely higher potency of the semi-chronic γ-ray treatment of dry seeds (watercontents respectively: 4·60 and 6·65%) could be observed by germinating them immediately after irradiation as well as with a 3-week storage period prior to germination. However with moist seeds (water-contents respectively: 14·24 and 16·93%) the same total amount of damage for both radiation sources could be observed, by germinating them immediately as well as with a 3-week storage period. Thus the differential effect immediate as well as after storage with dry seeds really represents a difference in the potency of the two sources. As with dry seeds the indirect action of both radiations is at work, the cause of this differential action should be sought in a possible quenching effect of excited molecules either because of the higher dose rate of acute X-rays, or simply because of the higher LET-value of 90 kVp X-rays (100 ionpairs/μ) over Co60 γ-gays (8 ionpairs/μ).

Propellant mass flow rate also was measured, and the results were combined with the thrust data to determine over-all efficiencies (η0 = T2/2m˙P) and specific impulses (Isp = T/m˙g). The over-all efficiencies, so measured, were typically significantly lower than the energy efficiencies measured calorimetrically, since a large fraction of the injected propellant was not utilized in the discharge. Adjustment of η0 and Isp, taking into account the unused mass, gave rise to significantly higher η0 but at undesirably high Isp. Additional steps taken to improve the engine system performance are discussed. © 1966 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243561048

Luminescence and energy storage, in the form of trapped electrons and holes, are produced during irradiation. After irradiation phosphorescence is observed at 425 mμ and stimulation with light gives an emission quite similar to that during irradiation with bands at 302, 370, and 425 mμ. It is suggested that the luminescence produced during irradiation is predominantly from recombination. In stimulation the 425-mμ band characteristic of thallium grows and decays slower than the 302- and 370-mμ bands characteristic of the KI host. It is suggested that the phosphorescence is the result of the direct recombination of If and Tl°, and that the same process is occurring during stimulation and irradiation. In addition it is observed that 370-mμ emission produced during irradiation decreases in intensity with increasing temperature and that the 425-mμ emission intensity increases. It is suggested that 370-mμ emission decreases because of a radiationless transition and that 425-mμ emission increases because of the increase of recombinations at thallium sites.

A study of these formulas has been made and the two most likely to give accurate predictions have been tested against measured values of energy on an inclined surface. Using the assumptions made in these formulas good agreement is found for some conditions though for short period values, such as daily totals, gross errors are indicated.

Freezing is, however, far from being a perfect method, particularly with respect to the texture of tissue. The behavior of food during freezing is influenced by its physical, chemical, and morphological characteristics, and these must be thoroughly understood as a prerequisite to improving the freezing process. Water (and ice) should receive special attention not only because of its great abundance but also because of its important role in determining the native quality of food. Furthermore, it can be shown that the water to ice transformation is associated with most of the detrimental effects that occur during freezing. Changes in volume and concentration of nonaqueous constituents (and eutectic formation) occur solely as a result of the water to ice transformation, and these changes are thought to have detrimental effects on food quality. In addition, the rate at which the water to ice transformation occurs influences the size and location of the ice crystals and the degree to which water is dislocated during freezing. These factors are also believed to influence food quality. During frozen storage, foods deteriorate at a rate which is dependent on the temperature and the product. Chemical changes and recrystallization appear to be major causes of damage. Thawing is inherently slower than freezing (for products which transmit heat energy primarily by conduction). Thawing is also carried out by unskilled personnel and under a temperature differential which is frequently smaller that that used for freezing. Thawing is therefore potentially more detrimental to quality than freezing. © 1966.",,"ice; food preservation; freezing; review; Food Preservation; Freezing; Ice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0013968404

Afferent and efferent pH and blood gas analyses indicate that, despite mild induced systemic respiratory alkalosis by ventilation with 100 per cent oxygen during a series of hepatectomies, relative anoxia and metabolic acidosis within the organ resulted. In all probability, these changes were produced by evisceration and angulation of the small bowel to facilitate the dissections and spasm and torsion of the afferent blood supplies during the dissections. These changes were further reflected by significant decreases in indices of functional viability and metabolic potential as measured by high energy phosphate (ATP) concentrations and oxygen consumption of the whole organ system during procurement. Functional whole organ capability during perfusion, after storage or transplantation, requires the application of metabolic energy for the performance of work. Bile formation, specifically, requires osmotic work. Liver chemical free energy or that thermodynamically capable of performing work is released from carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds and conserved in the form of high energy phosphate bonds. The high in vivo metabolic rate of hepatic tissue renders the whole organ particularly vulnerable to ischemia and cellular anoxia during procurement. Extracellular and presumably intracellular acidosis occurs; the latter inhibits glycogen breakdown to form high energy phosphates [18]. The tendencies for an organ to deteriorate from the outset during procurement should be taken into consideration and further measures developed to combat this progression prior to immediate and delayed efforts at perfusion, storage, or transplantation. Hypothermia, hyperbaric oxygenation, and metabolic blockade prior to and during procurement are possible avenues of approach. © 1966.",,"animal; article; blood gas analysis; liver; liver circulation; liver resection; liver transplantation; metabolism; oxygen consumption; perfusion; pH; swine; tissue preservation; Animal; Blood Gas Analysis; Hepatectomy; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Liver; Liver Circulation; Liver Transplantation; Oxygen Consumption; Perfusion; Swine; Tissue Preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0013950201

Such a device is essential to the Franck-Rosenberg theory, but not to the Duysens-Witt-Kok (DWK) model, which needs to assume only that the reactions occur in series. If there is no energy switch, an incident quantum absorbed at any time by any particular pigment molecule stands a chance of ending up in the reactive site of either primary reaction. The “separate packages” model is a special case of this general picture. Without an energy switch, a series model requires a storage device to insure that a quantum will not be wasted if it arrives at the site of one reaction while the photosynthetic unit is set up to perform the other. Such a storage device can be appended to the DWK model. Alternatively, this model can be augmented by an energy switch. This gives what is commonly known as the “spillover model,” a confusing name which we suggest be abandoned. As a clear-cut-though perhaps technically unfeasible-test of the energy switch hypothesis, we imagine a quantum injector, a hypothetical source of flashing light which delivers a single quantum to every photosynthetic unit with each flash. We aim this useful figment at an (equally hypothetical) photosynthetic system all of whose units are set up to perform the same primary reaction. If there is an energy switch, we can now prepare a “synchronous” photosynthetic apparatus in which each photosynthetic unit is undergoing the same reaction at the same time. © 1966, The Biophysical Society.

The acetate is oxidized more rapidly than glucose, because the latter is stored as glycogen first. The CO2 from the respiration is fixed partly by the exoskeleton and pyruvic acid (but to a lower degree), and partly expired. The quantity of expired CO2 is much larger in eyesfalkless animals than in intact animals, (hough the labelling of the CO2 with carbon-14 is the same in both cases. Much more carbon-H from acetate is incorporated in the fatly acids than from glucose. Glucose is stored as glycogen and is gradually taken into circulation again from this source. In intact animals storage of glycogen takes place both in the hepatopancreas and in the muscles. In eyestalkless animals glycogen is stored mainly in the hepatopancreas. Probably glycogen is the principal form of energy storage and the glucose from this source the most important substrate for the production of energy by the Embden-Meyerhof way and TC.A-cycle.

Conductors, semiconductors, and dielectrics can be tested in the demountable. The principal features of this technique are 1) use of a flood electron gun to place the target surface at some fixed voltage, and 2) the use of an amplitude modulated probing electron beam and a narrow-band amplifier centered at the probing beam modulating frequency, to measure the collected probing current at the target. Secondary emission measurements on semiconductors are described for primary energies from zero through first crossover to approximately 50 eV above maximum. Modification of the system to enable measurements up to 10 kilovolts is also explained.

The average of the midday exchange coefficients at the top of the crop was 4,400 cm2 sec-1. Below 100 cm, the sensible heat flux was found to be downward. The latent heat flux was used to determine the transpiration per unit leaf area from each level within the crop. The calculated values ranged from 0 to 3.8 · 10-6 g cm-2 sec-1. The transpiration rate was expressed as a function of three micrometeorological parameters: net-radiation absorption, saturation-water vapor-pressure deficit of the air, and a leaf-to-air transfer coefficient; and two plant parameters: leaf wetness and leaf-area density. It was found that four of the parameters varied with time and height within the crop. The fifth parameter, leaf density, varied only with height. Each of the parameters took part in regulating the transpiration rate. The calculated values of the leaf-wetness parameter ranged from 0.07 · 10-4 to 2.77 · 10-4 cal. cm-2 (leaf area) sec-1 mbar-1. For the entire crop, 46% of the net radiation was used for transpiration, 13% for soil evaporation, 32% for sensible heat flux, and 6% for soil heat flux. Measurements indicated that 16% of the net radiation reached the ground under the dense crop. © 1966.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002456802

Insulin would seem to be the primary hormone of energy storage, favouring both the deposition and the retention of the major energy store: fat in adipose tissue. While it may still be true, that both these effects - storage and retention - are the result of just one primary action - increased glucose transport - a separate effect directly resulting in decreased fatty acid mobilization may be an important aspect of this control, as well. We consider the availability for study of isolated adipose tissue cells, which still appear to be fully responsive to insulin, a major advance, holding the promise of arriving some day at a true understanding of the intimate mechanism of insulin action. When considering the regulation of fat release from adipose tissue, it would seem that closer scrutiny of the controlling importance of blood and plasma flow through the tissue might well be warranted. Adipose tissue is no longer considered a static tissue; it is recognized as what it is: the major site of active regulation of energy storage and mobilization, one of the primary control mechanisms responsible for the survival of any given organism. Although general recognition of the important role played by adipose tissue has abruptly increased during the past ten years, it remains for the future to provide us with a detailed understanding of many aspects of the control systems which are operative in each instance. © 1965 Springer-Verlag.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250570683

After storage at cold temperatures, enzymic activity is lost, inhomogeneous material can be detected in the ultracentrifuge, and a shift and increase of absorbance of enzyme-bound pyridoxal phosphate occur to shorter wavelengths. Inactivation may be reversed upon rewarming. While the initial rate of cold inactivation of phosphorylase b has been shown to follow first-order kinetics at all protein concentrations, the entire course of inactivation can be described by the first-order law only at low protein concentrations. Inactivation is effectively slowed by glycogen, pyridoxal phosphate, AMP, ATP, organic solvents, and buffer at pH 6.8, and is accelerated at pH 6.0 in the presence or cysteine and NaCl. An Arrhenius plot of phosphorylase b activities at pH 6.0 shows a marked discontinuity at approximately 13°, with activation energies of 17,000 and 46,000 calories for the upper and lower limbs, respectively.

In this experiment, a variation of viscoelastic property of process cheese with various moisture content and temperature was measured by means of three kinds of rheometer, i.e. a cone-plate viscometer, a compression tester and a dynamic viscoelastometer. The static viscosity η measured by the cone-plate viscometer decreased logarithmically with increase of moisture content in the range from 35 to 42 percent and the activation energy ranging from 8.6 to 8.3Kcal/mol. On the other hand, the elasticity and internal friction changed from 7×106 to 2×106 dyne/cm2 and from 0.65 to 0.80 at 20°C respectively with the variation of moisture content. When the compression-recovery cycles were repeated on the specimen, the elasticity of cheese increased gradually and reached a plateau region. Consequently, the process cheese has rheologically the behaviour of work hardening. The dynamic viscoelasticity of casein networks in cheese texture with change of moisture content ranging from 36 to 42 percent was obtained; dynamic viscosity ηd=(1.8∼2)×104 poise and dynamic elasticity E′=(8∼6.4)×106 dyne/cm2 respectively. These values also change with the temperature of storage after processing of cheese. Process cheese becomes harder by storage at lower temperature in the lower content of moisture. From the X-ray diffraction analysis of process cheese and paracasein, it was found that the variation of elasticity with moisture content was attributed to the change of network structure formed by casein micelles. © 1965, The Society of Materials Science, Japan.

Physical properties of each fraction were evaluated in terms of isotacticity, viscosity average molecular weight, density, melting point, tensile stress-strain curve, infrared spectrum, x-ray diffraction and tensile storage and loss moduli. The tacticity of lower temperature fractions increases with extracting temperature, while the viscosity average molecular weight stays almost constant. The stereoregularity of each fraction was estimated qualitatively by using Fiory-Coleman's theory on sequence propagation probability and isotacticity, and it is concluded that each fraction is of block polymer nature composing of isotactic and atactic sequences. The drastic change of tensile storage modulus was observed at about 70% crystallinity and is explained in term of Fujino's theory of simple mechanical mixture of island-matrix mixing. It is concluded that the change could be explained in term of phase conversion from crystalline islands in amorphous matrix to amorphous islands in crystalline matrix due to hexagonal close-packing of crystalline phase at about 70% crystallsinity.

In a liquid system, a small portion of the propellant is often burned in a separate gas generator or bled off from the combustion chamber and used to drive turbopumps and other auxiliary systems. In the case of solid propulsion systems, designers have considered hot gas bled off from the combustion chamber for thrust vector control. With the continuing need for weight conservation in missile design to optimize performance, weight comparisons must be made before finalizing designs. Therefore, when the designer considers utilizing primary storage for secondary use, it will serve him well to in-vestigate the weight tradeoff.

The dissipated energy was calculated from the temperature rise during adiabatic compression.

The ratio of dissipated energy to the total work done on the specimen at various strains was also very similar for all orientations except for the aluminium ⟨100⟩ crystals. The aluminium ⟨100⟩ crystals dissipated a much larger fraction of the mechanical work. Because the total dissipated energy as a function of shear strain is not orientation dependent, it is suggested that the orientation dependence of work-hardening must be related to the orientation dependence of energy storage.

Emission from enzyme intermediates in this reaction continues for several seconds, and if the mixture is frozen just after initiation of the reaction, this presumptive emission may be delayed until the system is warmed again. Light is then emitted in a fashion analogous to thermo‐luminescent emission, with a maximum intensity at — 10°C. The experiments described here show that the total amount of light which is emitted under these conditions no longer depends so much upon aldehyde, a relatively high quantum yield being obtained both with and without aldehyde. It is further shown that bioluminescence may be activated by light, populating it is believed, the same state which is responsible for the emission in the case of the FMNH2‐induced emission. The light‐induced reaction does not depend on flavin in the enzyme preparations, nor does the activation spectrum resemble that of a flavoprotein. Activation may be carried out in the solid state at temperatures down to at least — 100°C, and so does not involve the diffusion of large molecules. It is proposed that energy storage takes place by charge separation, and that the excited state from which emission takes place is associated with charge recombination.

Development toward large orbits and low magnetic fields has brought the problem of radiation loss under control and has stimulated design planning for very high energies. The magnets can be powered at high cycling rates (60 cps) by resonant electrical circuits. The most valuable feature is the long duty cycle available for experiments, of up to 20% of total time. Photons emerge tangentially in sharply collimated beams from targets at the edge of the orbit. Emergent beams of electrons can be ejected with high efficiency, having small energy spread and excellent collimation. Future developments should bring higher beam intensities as well as higher energies. Positrons can be accelerated in the same orbit, with reversed magnetic fields and a suitable source. The AG magnet system should distribute the damping due to synchrotron radiation between radial, vertical and synchronous modes, as in a storage ring. In principle, particles could be injected in each cycle and stored to develop high-intensity circulating beams.

For the external proton beam, the basic method of extraction is similar to other proton synchrotrons in that an energy-loss target is used to displace the circulating beam. However, the design of the ZGS is such that the necessity for plunging extraction magnets into the aperture has been eliminated. Further, the design of these nonplunging magnets is such that they are operable at a fixed field and thus eliminate the need for complicated pulsing and timing systems. Measurements using various techniques, including scintillators and TV storage systems, poloroid film, secondary emission detectors, and radioactive foil analyses have been made. For beams from internal targets, it is desirable to produce beams with various production angles, as well as being able to achieve zero degree production. It was found possible to establish three secondary beam channels looking at a common target point near the end of an octant. This point is in a nearly field-free region so that the channel angle becomes the production angle for both positive and negative particles. It is of interest that the construction of the ZGS is such that there is practically no fringe field beyond the octant edges. Furthermore, it was found possible to run targets into the octant along the inner vacuum chamber sidewalls without interfering with the injected beam. Orbits to the field-free point have been calculated such that a range of momenta and production angles is transmitted through the three secondary beam channels.

The scheme consists basically of using ignitron tubes to switch energy stored in a capacitor bank to the pulsed magnet and back to the capacitor bank with relatively small losses, and using a dc supply to recharge the capacitor bank between pulses. Two capacitor banks, one charged to a positive polarity and the other to a negative polarity, with their associated ignitron tubes, are connected to one magnet to permit energizing the magnet with a field in either direction as desired on a pulse-to-pulse basis. The two capacitor banks can be charged to different voltages, thus permitting the deflection of two different energy beam pulses. The current pulse through the magnet is a one-cycole sine wave of the resonant frequency of the capacitance of the energy storage bank and the inductance of the magnet, with the timing of the pulse arranged such that the beam passes through the magnet at the peak of the sine wave.

A gradual rise in solar radiation and terrestrial temperatures over billions of years must take place, as a necessary consequence of stellar evolution with constant mass. It will be culminating in a steep heat peak 1-6 billion years from now. The hypothesis of a decrease of the gravitational constant in inverse proportion to the ""expansion age"" of the universe cannot be reconciled with palaeoclimatic data except when the time scale is assumed to be unacceptably long. The ""astronomical"" chronology of the Quaternary, or that based on the variation of the orbital elements of the Earth, is without sufficient foundation. Apparent synchronization of two unrelated sets of fluctuating data can be achieved by slight adjustments in the relative time intervals of one of them; the apparently perfect coincidence so obtained may be completely spurious, when only the succession of events is given, without a knowledge of the actual intervals of time. The climatic heat balance of the Earth as a whole, including convective transport and storage, has been analyzed and the results applied to the correlation of glaciation with global insolation. Extreme variations of the Earth's orbital elements are unable to account for the amplitude of the glacial-interglacial fluctuations. The "" astronomical"" theory of Quaternary climatic change is thus inadequate quantitatively, as well as unconvincing chronologically. Variations in global cloudiness can account quantitatively for the palaeoclimatic fluctuations, but the ad hoc character of the hypothesis, and the difficulty of accounting for the recurrence of the glacial epochs, make it rather unattractive. Volcanic dust as a cause must be excluded de facto, as it is not present now in sufficient quantities to explain the low global temperature, as compared with the Tertiary. The interplay of nuclear reactions (hydrogen burning to helium) and gas diffusion in the Sun's interior necessarily leads to disturbances which can account for the recurrent deterioration of the global climate after intervals of a few hundred million years, if the Kramers source of opacity is significant, or if the content of elements heavier than helium in and around the Sun's core is not less than 1-2%. This yields a plausible model to account for the long-range major palaeoclimatic fluctuations, as being caused by the variation in the Sun's radiative output. The fluctuations during one ice age, or the successive advances and retreats of the glaciers on Earth, could be a kind of ""flickering"" of solar radiation as conditioned by the peripheral convective region of the Sun, but a unique theory of it cannot yet be offered. Much of what follows depends on the consideration of the evolution of unmixed gaseous stellar models with nuclear energy generation. With the advent of electronic computers, much solid work has been done in this direction, especially the brilliant achievements of Martin Schwarzschild and his school. The start was made by the writer's pioneering work (Öpik, 1938a,b). Yet the best electronic results are no better than their basic assumptions; the admissible span in the results is so wide that the former handmade calculations are still within the probable or plausible limits of assumptions. A revision of the climatic theory on the basis of the new models would not lead to significantly new results. Also, only in the author's work has gas diffusion in the central regions of the Sun been allowed for, and found to be of decisive importance. Therefore, as well as for the sake of uniformity, the climatic problems as analyzed here are viewed against the background of the writer's own work on stellar models. © 1965.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645868032

Virtually all endogenous activity could be removed by freezing the spermatozoa in tris buffer prior to incubating the sperm cells in a reaction mixture fortified with added substrates. Honey bee spermatozoa contain high titres of the pyridine nucleotide diaphorases, NADH2 dehydrogenase, and NADPH2 dehydrogenase. The Krebs cycle is highly functional in the washed sperm cells, as evidenced by the active utilization of three intermediates of this energy-yielding pathway. A high titre of succinate dehydrogenase is present, whereas malate dehydrogenase is less active. The activities of both NADP- and NAD-linked isocitrate dehydrogenases are demonstrable, the former enzyme being the more active of the two. Glycolysis is very well developed in the spermatozoa as reflected by the presence of a very high level of α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, as well as lactate and alcohol dehydrogenases. A highly active α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase flavoprotein is also present. Glutamate dehydrogenase is present at an intermediate activity level. No utilization of β-hydroxybutyrate occurred and glucose-6-phosphate was only slightly oxidized by the spermatozoa. The results with specific inhibitors demonstrated that the dehydrogenases of honey bee spermatozoa were generally typical in their responses with the exception of succinate dehydrogenase which was not inhibited by iodoacetate. The significance of the demonstrated dehydrogenases is discussed especially with reference to metabolic pathways which may be stressed during the long term storage of the spermatozoa in the spermatheca. © 1965.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942538122

Nach neuzeitlichen Mastperioden und Schlachtung entsprechender Masthähnchen bzw. Mastkälber wurden die Fettsäuren von C‐10 bis C‐22:6 mit Hilfe der Gaschromatographie quantitativ bestimmt. Die Ergebnisse lassen sich folgendermaßen zusammenfassen: Die Speicherung exogener Fettsäuren (Futterfettsäuren) ist auch bei Verfütterung neuzeitlicher Rationen mit ausgewogenem Energie‐Rohprotein‐Verhältnis möglich. Diese Speicherung erfolgt in den einzelnen Organlipiden mit unterschiedlicher Intensität. Die mittelkettigen Fettsäuren Caprin‐ und Laurinsäure besitzen eine spezielle Wirkung, da nach ihrer Verabfolgung nicht nur die Fettsäuren gleicher sondern auch größerer Kettenlänge gespeichert werden. Dieser zunächst kurz als “Kettenverlängerung” exogener mittelkettiger Fettsäuren bezeichnete Effekt wurde hier erstmalig beobachtet. Es wurde der Versuch unternommen, ihn auf Grund der bisher bekannten biochemischen Mechanismen zu deuten. Da die exogenen Fettsäuren darüber hinaus bestimmte körpereigene in den Organlipiden ersetzen, ist eindeutig ein über die Speicherung hinausgehender Effekt von Futterfetten auf das Fettsäuremuster der Körperlipide bewiesen. Bei beiden untersuchten Tierarten treten die durch Futterfette am Fettsäuremuster der Organlipide induzierten Veränderungen im gleichen Sinne, jedoch mit unterschiedlicher Intensität auf. The influence of dietary fat on the fatty acid and organ lipids in farm animals After a short introduction dealing with fat supplements in the nutrition of farm livestock, the author discusses the influence of tricaprin, trilaurin, tripalmitin and tristearin added to a ration adjusted for crude protein and energy (control fat = triacetin) on the fatty acid content of different organ lipids. Using broiler poultry and calves fed by modern fattening methods the fatty acids of the C‐10 to the C‐22:6 series were estimated quantitatively by gas chromatography and the results were as follows: The storage of exogenous fatty acids (dietary fat) is equally possible when modern rations with adjusted energy ratios and crude protein levels are used. The reserves are formed of different lipids in varying quantity. The middle chain fatty acids, from tricaprin and trilaurin, have a special effect, since after their administration there is increased storage not only of fatty acids of the same chain length but those of greater length. This phenomenon, provisionally designated as “chain lengthening”, of exogenous middle length fatty acids is described for the first time. An experiment was undertaken to determine the hitherto unknown biochemical mechanism responsible. Since the exogenous fatty acids replace the animal's own fatty acids in the organ lipids this is irrefutable proof that dietary fats exert an effect beyond the mere formation of reserves and in fact alter the fatty acid content of the organ lipids themselves. In the animal species studied, the modifications induced by different dietary fats on the fatty acid pattern of the organ lipids are of a similar nature but vary in intensity. Recherches sur I'incidence des graisses alimentaires sur la teneur en acides gras des lipides organiques chez les animaux de la ferme Après une brève introduction illustrant la situation des additifs gras aux aliments des animaux de la ferme, il est question de l'incidence du tricaprin, du trilaurin, de la tripalmitine et de la tristéarine qui ont été affouragés dans des rations équilibrées de protéines brutes et de produits énergétiques en tant que graisses de référence (contrôle = triacétine), sur la teneur en acides gras de différents lipides organiques. Après des périodes modernes d'engraissement et abattage des poulets ou des veaux correspondants, on déterminait la teneur en acides gras de C‐10 à C‐22 : 6 en recourant à la chromatographie gazeuse. Les résultats peuvent être résumés comme il suit: La formation de réserves d'acides gras exogènes (acides gras d'affouragement) est également possible en affourageant des rations modernes comportant un équilibre en produits énergétiques et en protéines brutes. Ces réserves sont constituées par les différents lipides organiques avec des différences d'intensité. Les acides gras pourvus d'une liaison centrale, acides caprinique et laurinique, sont doués d'un effet particulier car, après leur administration, on n'assiste pas seulement à la formation de réserves en acides gras de chaîne identique, mais aussi de chaînes beaucoup plus longues. Cet effet, qui pour le moment est désigné brièvement comme «allongement de la chaîne» des acides gras exogènes à liaison centrale, a été observé ici pour la première fois. On a tenté d'expliquer ce phénomène en faisant appel mécanismes biochimiques connus jusqu'à présent. Etant donné que les acides gras exogènes remplacent de surcroît certains acides gras propres dans les lipides organiques, il est irréfutablement prouvé que les graisses fourragées ont un effet dépassant la formation de réserves et qui va jusqu'à influencer la teneur en acides gras des lipides du corps. Chez les deux espèces animales examinées, les modifications induites par les graisses fourragées sur la teneur en acides gras des lipides organiques sont de sens identique, mais d'intensités différentes. Estudios acerca de la influencia de grasas forrajeras sobre el tipo de ácido graso de los lípidos de órganos en los animales agrícolas útiles Tras una breve introducción en la situación de la adición de grasas en la alimentación de los animales útiles, se informa sobre la influencia de tricaprina, trilaurina, tripalmitina y triestearina, que se administraron con una ración equilibrada con relación a proteina bruta y contenido energético en calidad de grasas modelo (control = triacetina), sobre el tipo de ácido graso de diversos lípidos de órganos. A continuación de modernos periodos de cebo y del sacrificio de los correspondientes pollos y terneras de engorde, respectivamente, se valoraron cuantiativamente los ácidos grasos de C‐10 hasta C‐22:6 con ayuda de la cromatografía gaseosa. Los resultados se pueden resumir del modo siguiente: El almacenamiento de ácidos grasos exógenos (ácidos grasos forrajeros) también resulta posible con la administración de raciones modernas con relación energía‐proteína bruta equilibrada. Este almacenamiento se produce en los distintos lípidos de órganos con intensidad diferente. Los ácidos grasos de cadena mediana ácido caproico y ácido laurílico poseen una acción especial, pues tras su administración no solo se almacenan los ácidos grasos de su misma longitud de cadena, sino también de mayor. Aquí se observó por vez primera este fenómeno, calificado por el momento como “alargamiento de eslabones” de los ácidos grasos exógenos de cadena mediana. El efecto se intentó interpretar con arreglo a los mecanismos bioquímicos conocidos hasta la fecha. Puesto que los ácidos grasos exógenos también sustituyen otros ciertos propios del organismo, queda demostrado con claridad un efecto jue alcanza más allá del almacenamiento de las grasas forrajeras sobre el modelo de ácido graso los lípidos de órganos. En las especies animales examinadas aparecen las alteraciones inducidas por grasas forrajeras en el modelo de ácido graso de los lípidos de órganos en el mismo sentido, ahora que con intensidad diferente. © 1965 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",,"fatty acid; animal; article; cattle; domestic animal; fat intake; food; metabolism; Animal; Animals, Domestic; Cattle; Dietary Fats; Fatty Acids; Food",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0013798180

The method having the most flexibility uses a servo-mechanism and an energy-storage device. For this system a linear torsion spring is attached to the device being counterbalanced and is used for the energy-storage element. A strain gage gives a voltage indicating the counterbalance torque being applied by this spring. The reference voltage is proportional to the counterbalance torque required and comes from a resolver.

Analog computers are versatile and simple equipment, of low to moderate cost, with which ground‐water development schemes can be rapidly and accurately tested and the relative merits of alternate choices of development can be appraised. The electric analog computer used by the Illinois State Water Survey consists of an analog model and excitation‐response apparatus, i.e., waveform generator, pulse generator and oscilloscope. Analog models are regular arrays of resistors and capacitors and are scaled‐down versions of aquifers and confining beds where present. Resistors are inversely proportional to the coefficients of transmissibility and vertical permeability aquifers and the coefficients of leakage of confining beds. Capacitors store electrostatic energy in a manner analogous to the storage of water in the aquifer. The behavior of the electrical network is described by an equation which has the same form as the finite‐difference equation for nonsteady state two or three‐dimensional flow of ground water. Electrical units (voltage, coulombs, amperes and seconds) and corresponding hydraulic units (feet, gallons, gallons per day and days) are connected by 4 scale factors. Excitation‐response equipment force electrical energy in the proper time phase into the analog model and measure energy levels within the energy‐dissipative resistor‐capacitor network. Oscilloscope traces, i.e., time‐voltage graphs, are analogous to time‐drawdown or time‐recovery graphs and describe drawdown or recovery conditions after a step function‐type change in discharge. A catalog of time‐voltage graphs provides data for construction of a series of water‐level change maps. Close agreement of water‐level declines determined with an analog computer and analytical methods for 3 selected idealized aquifer situations is noted with satisfaction. An electric analog model for the East St. Louis area was assembled. The sand and gravel aquifer in the East St. Louis area has an average thickness of 120 feet, an average width of 7 miles and an average length of 30 miles. The analog model for the aquifer consists of a regular array of 2800 resistors and 1350 capacitors. The scale of the model is 1 inch equals 2000 feet. Values of resistors range in magnitude from 2.2 megohms to 33,000 ohms; capacitors are 2500 micromicrofarads. The effects of the Mississippi River were simulated by terminating the portion of the electrical network along the river in an open circuit. Resistors large in magnitude were connected to terminals along the edge of the aquifer and to ground to simulate small amounts of sub‐surface flow through bluffs. The accuracy and reliability of the electric analog computer was established by comparing past records of water‐level declines and values of water‐level declines determined with the analog computer. The electric analog computer was used to evaluate the practical sustained yields of existing pumping centers, to predict the effects of a selected scheme of development and to deter‐mine the potential yield of the aquifer under assumed pump‐ing conditions. An electric analog model for the Champaign‐Urbana area was assembled. The sand and gravel aquifers in the Champaign‐Urbana area are contained in the Mahomet buried bedrock valley which extends across the central part of Illinois from the Indiana border to the Illinois River Valley. The Mahomet buried bedrock valley averages about 12 miles wide in the Champaign‐Urbana area and is largely filled with glacial drift ranging in thickness from 50 to 440 feet. Sand and gravel are encountered within the glac‐ial drift at depths between 60 and 120 feet (upper aquifer), 140 and 170 feet (middle aquifer) and below a depth of 200 feet (lower aquifer). The upper aquifer is thin and discontinuous; the middle aquifer has an average thickness of 43 feet; and the lower aquifer often exceeds 100 feet thick. Till averaging 120 feet thick (upper confining bed) overlies the middle aquifer; about 30 feet of till (lower confining bed) separates the middle and lower aquifers. The analog model for the complex aquifer system consists of a regular array of 7500 resistors and capacitors. The scale of the model is 1 inch equals 1 mile. Values of resistors range from 1 to 68,000 ohms; values of capacitors range from 10e6 to lo‐' farads. The analog model consists of 2 horizontal arrays of resis‐tors and capacitors (lower and middle aquifers) and 1 hori‐zontal ground wire array (water table) interconnected by two vertical arrays of resistors (lower and upper confining beds). The accuracy and reliability of the electric analog computer are being assessed. The computer will be used to predict the effects of future ground‐water development and the practical sustained yields of existing pumping centers in the Champaign‐Urbana area.

It was shown that the coefficient b was independent of charging fields up to 2/3 of the formation field and that the residual current increased with temperature. The activation energy was 2.5 kcal/mole. Furthermore, it was shown that, if the external resistor was removed and the cell was left with open terminals, the internal residual current continued to flow until the build-up field modified the flow. If the oxide film were illuminated during discharging, two different photoeffects were recorded: the transient effects due to wavelengths of 320 mµ to about 600 mµ and the stationary photocurrent mostly due to wavelengths shorter than 300 mµ. Several models are discussed which lead to an inverse time law. Preference was given to the idea that a net positive space charge arises within the oxide during charging; that this space charge causes two internal fields of opposite directions and that the residual discharge current is the difference of two currents flowing in the opposing fields, thus neutralizing the space charge.

While the animals were on a constant low ration to cause loss of condition, the observations were continued under both thermoneutral and cold conditions, and glucose and ketone levels in the blood were also measured.The digestibility and metabolizability of the gross energy of the food were not affected by body condition. However, as the sheep lost weight, the net availability of metabolizable energy at each level of food intake declined. The change of efficiency was not apparent when comparisons were made at equivalent levels of energy storage.In the weight range 21-59 kg, the fasting heat production varied directly with body weight at a rate of 10 kcal/24 hr/kg. Prediction of fasting metabolism from body weight is discussed.Changes of energy utilization were largely accounted for by changes of fat metabolism. When the sheep were emaciated, oxidation of protein during fasting was somewhat greater than when they were fat, but nitrogen supplied by the food was used more efficiently.Under cold stress, the heat production of the sheep increased to a high level, which did not vary with body weight until homeostasis failed when the animals were extremely emaciated. The apparent digestibility of the food (at the lowest intake) decreased by 0-47 unit/°C fall of ambient temperature. While the sheep were on the submaintenance ration, the levels of blood glucose and ketones remained at the higher end of the “normal” range under thermoneutral conditions and were somewhat elevated under cold conditions.

In average rock at an initial temperature of 400°c, a mean power output of about 13 megawatts per square kilometre of fissure would be produced throughout the 20-year period. In slabs and cubes with dimensions (thickness) ranging from about 40 to 60 metres, extraction efficiencies of between 80% and 90% are obtainable with a 20-year drawoff period.The mean power output ranges from about 330 to 370 megawatts per cubic kilometre of rock.For a given efficiency, the permissible dimensions vary as the square root of the drawoff period, and the power output per unit volume varies inversely as the square root of the period Application of this theory to the Wairakei production area, New Zealand, taking account only of the observed spacing of surface faults, indicates that if the relation between the heat storage volume and projected drawoff rate is such that a life of between 100 and 200 years can be expected (and evidence to date suggests that at least this life is probable), much of the stored heat can be extracted with high efficiency. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945593636

Age designation of such mixed waters is meaningless.A recent publication of the International Atomic Energy Agency states that the absence of tritium in ground water indicates an age greater than 50 years, which therefore excludes the possibility of full-scale utilization of the water. Presumably the authors deduce that no recharge is occurring in such an area. The publication further states that the presence of bomb-produced tritium in a ground-water body indicates recent recharge and the consequent feasibility of utilization. These misleading statements fail to take into account that all aquifers in humid to semi-arid environments contain post-bomb recharge just below the water table and that movement of water even in highly permeable aquifers is so slow that generally ground water that occurs more than about 30 meters below the water table and down gradient from the intake area is older than 50 years.Even in arid regions where present-day recharge and tritium content of ground water are negligible, large quantities of ground water are frequently available from storage.The use of the tritium content of water is not now, nor will it ever be, a substitute for detailed geologic and hydrologic investigations of aquifers by adequately trained hydrologists. At most it can be only a supplementary tool, useful principally to veritfy, quantify, or supplement conclusions reached by less spectacular but more meaningful geohydrologic studies. © 1964 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941442574

It was found that the charge image on the target is not only established by transmitted secondary electrons but that the backward conduction of secondary electrons through the layer also contributes to the amplifying mechanism. Free electrons created by the incident primary electron which are normally not observed as emitted secondary electrons can be conducted through the voids of the low-density layer to the target signal plate under the action of an electric field. This mechanism leads to an efficient conversion of photo-electrons with several kev energy into a large number of positive charge centers on the surface of the layer which are accessible to a low-energy reading beam. The secondary electron conduction (SEC) effect provides, therefore, high target gain while solid-state time lag does not occur. The high resistivity of such layers, many orders of magnitude greater than that of insulators in bulk form, is advantageous for long-time integration and storage. The target has a large storage capacity useful not only to provide a wide dynamic range, but also to accommodate the more intense signals required for low contrast image detection. The capacity is small enough, however, to eliminate discharge lag. Compatibility of the SEC target with standard photosurfaces, such as S-11, S-20, and various ultraviolet sensitive types, has been demonstrated in sealed-off tubes. The performance of SEC vidicon tubes is reported, and it is concluded that the SEC target offers the potential of overcoming several limitations found in present day camera tubes.

As we have recently reported: (i) reduced ferredoxin is the strongest chemically defined reductant that has been isolated so far from the photosynthetic apparatus of green plants (it has a redox potential about 100 mv more electronegative than that of reduced pyridine nucleotides); (ii) photoreduction of ferredoxin is accompanied by photophosphorylation (ATP formation). These findings point to the photoreduction of ferredoxin by chloroplasts as the final step in the primary conversion of radiant energy into chemical energy. All the subsequent reactions of photosynthesis in isolated chloroplasts which lead to CO2 assimilation are concerned with storage of chemical energy and are, on present evidence, independent of light. They involve, apart from the consumption of ATP, a utilization of the photochemically reduced ferredoxin. A notable feature of the photochemical activity of isolated chloroplasts is the evolution of oxygen. Although photoreduction of ferredoxin has been experimentally separated from oxygen evolution, the two events must be coupled if ferredoxin is indeed the final physiological electron acceptor in the photochemical reactions of chloroplasts. Evidence for this has now been obtained with illuminated chloroplasts supplied with ""substrate"" amounts of ferredoxin as the sole electron acceptor. Photoreduction of ferredoxin was accompanied by oxygen evolution. A consistent stoichiometry of 4 ferredoxins reduced to 1 O2 evolved was observed with different concentrations of added ferredoxin, confirming previous results that one electron is required to reduce one molecule of ferredoxin. Oxygen evolution was measured polarographically with a platinum electrode modeled after that of Hagihara, and photoreduction of ferredoxin was measured spectrophotometrically at 420 mμ. It now appears that under physiological conditions photoproduction of oxygen by chloroplasts always requires ferredoxin. However, chloroplasts will also produce oxygen, in what is known as a Hill reaction, when ferredoxin is replaced by one of a number of nonphysiological electron acceptors.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37049234196

A comparison of the 1960 and 1961 results leads to the following conclusions: (1) A significant flux of low-energy protons is continually present in the primary radiation in the years of high solar activity. (2) This flux decreases with the declining level of solar activity as the galactic cosmic-ray flux increases. It is, therfeore, suggested that it is of solar origin. (3) The time dependence of the observed proton flux suggests the following alternatives: (a) The particles are produced or released more or less continuously by the sun and do not originate only in the large flare events; or (b) The particles are produced in individual large solar flares and subsequently stored over long periods of time.

Although there is a complete suppression of sugar accumulation, evidence is presented that the starch removed appears as substances, probably end‐products of anaerobic glycolysis, that are volatile at the temperatures used to determine percent dry weight. The decreases in starch‐bound phosphorus are balanced by a corresponding increase in inorganic phosphorus in both air‐stored and nitrogen‐stored potatoes. The decrease in the phytic acid phosphorus in air‐stored tubers can be accounted for largely as an increase in the fraction containing phosphoproteins, nucleic acids, and phospholipids, whereas the corresponding loss of phytic acid phosphorus in nitrogen‐stored tubers appears largely in the fraction containing nucleotide coenzymes and hexose phosphates. The significance of these findings is discussed in terms of the requirements for high‐energy phosphate derived from the respiratory process and needed for biosynthesis.

It was only around the middle of the 18th Century that man became gradually aware of the beauty of the mountains, and approximately at the same time science started to take an interest in glaciers. Most of the questions raised in this field have been solved since. However, even in our times it is not sufficiently well known that glaciers, which are responsible for the characteristics of the regime of alpine rivers, are interesting not only from the point of view of physical geography, but are also of great importance for the economy and technical development of alpine countries. Torrents which are fed by the melted ice, carry great quantities of water at periods when other streams frequently run dry. Nevertheless, in the terms of hydraulic power economy, it would be an over simplification to consider glaciers as reservoirs. It must not be forgotten, that in the Alps precipitation is highest during the summer months, and consequently that rivers carry more water during that season than during any other period of the year. The presence of glaciers adds to the extreme situation, and therefore the equalisation of seasonal differences in the runoff of glaciers necessary for power economy requires more storage capacity than is needed for catchment areas without glaciers. On the other hand, there are also arid zones in the Alps, where conditions are entirely different. I am thinking of the deep valleys, running east to west, which are screened from rain by high mountain ranges, as for instance in the Wallis, the Vintschgau, parts of Western Tyrol and the Engadine. In these valleys it is particularly the slopes open to the south and exposed to constant insolation which show the typical characteristics and vegetation of arid zones. Precipitation during the growing season is often far less than the 600mm which is considered as the minimum needed for most types of cultivation, so much so that artificial irrigation has been practised for many generations. Whenever possible, the aqueducts, often very primitive, are fed by the glacier runoff of the large mountain massifs which never run dry. In some parts of the Wallis and in the South and West Tyrol, the water had to be conducted long distances and across difficult terrain; the construction of these primitive aqueducts was therefore a truly difficult task, as financial and technical resources available for that purpose were very inadequate. This additional water-supply produced by glaciers in summer has a very definite effect on the large rivers rising in the Alps and flowing down in all directions, to name a few of them, the Rhine, the Inn, the Drave, the Rhône, the Adige etc. Not a single one of them has a low water level record in summer equal to that of the Weser or the Elbe and many other rivers of Central Europe which are not fed by glaciers. This low water level in summer has naturally a very detrimental effect on the navigation of rivers, and also on their capacity to replenish ground-water resources. The abundance of glacier runoff assures a fairly steady supply of water to the first mentioned rivers even in their lower courses, a fact which is of special importance for hydraulic economy in general and for hydraulic energy economy in particular. The rich potential of hydraulic energy in Jugoslavia, for instance, suffers from the fact that the quantity of water carried by the karst-rivers is considerably smaller in summer than it is in winter. The river Drave with its tributaries fed by glacier runoff from the Alps in Carynthia and East Tyrol, is practically the only river in Jugoslavia used to a considerable extent for the production of hydraulic power. It carries even more water in summer than during other seasons. This river, which serves to equalise the seasonal production of energy is therefore most valuable for the power economy of the country. Short-term changes in the size of glaciers which are the subject of our present symposium, are causing the development of glacier lakes of which there exist several types. Most dangerous are those in larger valleys, caused by the tongue of a side glacier forming a dam, for instance here in the Ötztal Alps, at the Gurgler and at the Rofener Eissee near Vent. Other lakes develop in the basins left behind by the tongues of former glaciers. Water suddenly released from glacier lakes due to a breach of the ice or moraine dam, has frequently been the cause of terrible catastrophes. Attempts have therefore been made to protect the valleys against floods by the construction of flood reservoirs suitably situated below the glacier. An example of this type is the reservoir dam which the Austrian torrent-control authorities constructed in the Martellvalley (South Tyrol) in 1898/99 to prevent damage from an eventual breach in the banks of a glacier lake which had developed. Nowadays the large reservoirs constructed for hydro-electric power provide even greater protection. Reservoirs for power plants in the Alps, which are created by the construction of large dams, require the existence of basins hollowed out by former glaciers during a long geological period. Outside of the glaciated areas, such basins can generally be created only by artificially blocking up a river-valley. This type of reservoir can be easily distinguished from that described above by its entirely different outline. It must finally be remembered that the large load of sediment carried by glacial rivers has its economic and technical problems. Although it will probably take centuries to fill up the largest hydro-electric reservoirs, or even to considerably reduce their storage capacity, there are many smaller lakes in which this development will take no more than decades. Deposits of mud, for instance in the reservoir of the Margaritze, in the “Tauernfraftwerke” area had, after a mere decade accumulated to the extent that the power-plant administration had to install a floating suction dredger to remove at least part of the sediment. In this connection it was, however, important not to overload the river downstream with mud to such a degree as to cause damage to the fish population. Careful observation was needed to find out to what extent the river was able to cope with the artificial inflow of mud, and to follow the dispersion of the peak values of the suspesion load. Nowadays waters destined for the generation of hydro-electric power are collected at the highest possible altitudes. An interesting example of the application of modern methods of this type is the collection of the runoff from beneath the Brandner Ferner in the Silvretta from where it is conveyed to the Lünersee. As a water intake on the surface was impossible due to the difficult terrain, a tunnel had to be driven through the rock bed of the glacier and there, immediately underneath it, in an ice cave, the water flows into a cage consisting of strong steel girders. This cage retains the large bolders, while the water from the bottom of the glacier runs off into the tunnel. © 1963 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954884561

The paper first attempts to show what forms of characterization such a circuit might reasonably be expected to give in a voltage-to-frequency conversion. A more rigorous argument follows where it is shown that the voltage waveform out of such a network is a linear function of both the signal voltage and the diode current, the current thing treated as an impulse discharge from some effective capacity. The sum equation, thus derived, can be solved using a remarkable theorem about the Möbius function of number theory to give the exact form of the desired impulse response of the linear network, As an example of the application and practical limitations of the approach, a network for a fractional root converter is derived and discussed in terms of a completed square-root converter. © 1963 IEEE.

In the potato tuber discs (and similar materials) this transition is characterized by: A) a several fold increase of oxygen uptake; b) an increase of the capacity of dissimilating to CO2 the carbon 1 of glucose; c) a decrease of the sensibility of oxygen uptake to the uncoupler 2,4 dinitrophenol (DNP); d) an increase of the capacity of ion and sugar uptake; e) the development of marked capacity of protein synthesis; f) and increase of the activity (as determined in homogenates) of several enzymes involved in the directs oxidation of glucose-6-P or — possibly — in the reoxidation of the TPN reduced by the pentose phosphate pathway reactions. The two latter responses appear with some delay respect the activation of oxygen uptake, which suggested (Marrè et al.) that they are probably rather a consequence than a primary cause of the activation of respiration. The present researches are aimed to a better understanding of the role played by the activity of oxidative enzymes and by high energy phosphate acceptor availability during the activation of metabolism in potato tuber slices. The importance of these factors was investigated by measuring the QO2 under different O2 pressure conditions, and by following the respiratory effects induced by DNP supplied at various concentration and at various incubation times. The results obtained can be summarized as follows: I. - Changes induced by varying O2 pressure. a) Lowering O2 pressure from 20% (air) to 5% does not affect the QO2 of freshly prepared slices, showing a low respiration rate, while it consistently depresses (by 40–50%) the QO2 of slices preincubated in air for periods longer than 8 hours, in which the process of respiratory activation is already well developped. At any stage of aging of the slices, no difference in QO2 is observed when air is substituted with pure oxygen. The rate of respiratory activation of the discs is highly sensitive to O2 partial pressure during incubation. At 20% O2 (air) the system involved in activation is practically satured, no further increase of the activation rate being observed at higher O2 (100%). With 5% O2, however, the rate of activation (measured after bringing again the slices in 20% oxygen) appears markedly depressed. b) The increase, upon incubation, of the dissimilation of carbon 1 of glucose to CO2 is also strongly depressed by 5% O2. This suggests that the progressive increase of the capacity of the oxidative system during aging makes limiting — at a given moment — the rate of diffusion of oxygen in the tissues. c) The increase during incubation of the capacity of active uptake of solutes such as the Rb+ ion and glucose is not significantly depressed by the low (5%) oxygen pressures. This seems to be in relation with the early development of this aspect of the activation process during the first period of activation, when the respiratory rate is low and lowering O2 pressure does not affect QO2. On the other hand, the lack of sensibility of ion and glucose uptake to low oxygen in the aged slices could indicate that the high energy phoshate level required for this process is lower than that for other processes, such as protein synthesis. d) Protein synthesis activation (measured as radioactivity incorporation into proteins in slices fed with glucose-6-C14) is severely inhibited (by about 60%) by 5% O2. This suggests a close correlation between respiratory activity and protein synthesis, on one hand, and between protein synthesis and the activation process occurring during aging, on the other. II. - Changes induced by DNP at different O2 pressures. a) As already shown in other laboratories, DNP at an appropriate concentration (in our case around 3 × 10-5M, at pH 5) markedly stimulates O2 uptake in the fresh slices, and this effect gradually disappears, parallely with the respiratory activation, when DNP is supplied to slices preincubated in distilled water for increasing periods of time. When slices were incubated from the beginning with the DNP concentration giving maximal respiratory response (3 × 10-5M at pH 5), the respiratory increase due the incubation was completely suppressed and the control slices incubated in water reached, after a few hours (3–5), QO2 values, higher than those of the DNP treated slices. With DNP concentration between 10-5M and 3 × 10-5M the initial rate of respiration was still higher than in the controls; this positive difference very slowly disappeared with the increase of incubation time, until, after about 36 h (when respiratory activation in the controls approached its maximum) the two curves became practically identical. A large fraction of the DNP induced increase of QO2 can be readily reversed by washing the slices and removing the inhibitor. When this is done, the rate of respiration observed for the slices preincubated (up to 10 hours) in DNP concentration giving maximal positive respiratory response falled down to values close to those of the fresh slices; while in the case of lower DNP concentration the level of respiration is almost unaffected by washing off the inhibitor. These results confirm the hypothesis that lack of phosphate acceptors is strongly limiting respiration in the « fresh » slices, and that this type of control is slowly losing its importance during the « aging » process: Which appears to be a consequence of both the increased activity of ATP utilizing systems and the appearance of some physiological (facultative) uncoupling mechanism. b) Immediately after preparation, when O2 uptake is very low, the respiration of both the slices in 20% and in 5% O2 is stimulated by DNP at approximately the same extent. However, when slices incubated in air for 7–8 hours, (still showing a significant, although reduced, respiratory response to DNP), are brought to 5% O2, the effect of DNP is completely suppressed. Conversely, the QO2 of slices incubated for the same period with 5% O2 (which inhibits respiratory activation, see I), do not respond to DNP when the O2 pressure is mainteined low, while they show a clear response when O2 in the gas phase is rised to 20%. The fact that in the « partially aged » (that is, incubated for a 7–9 h. period) slices lowering O2 to 5% simultaneously inhibits O2 uptake and completely suppresses the DNP effect, suggests that the respiratory fraction sensitive to O2 pressure is involved in (mitochondrial) oxidative phosphorylation. The simplest interpretation is in fact that in low O2 the ADP level rises, and that oxidative activity, instead of phosphate acceptor level, becomes the main factor limiting respiration. Conclusions. — When correleted with the previous data on the metabolic activation of potato tuber discs during incubation (cf also Romberger and Norton the present results suggest that the activation process in potato tuber slices comprehends two distinct phases. In the former, the rise of respiration appears to be a consequence of a release from lack of high energy phosphate acceptors. In the second (somewhat delayed) phase the increased activity of some key respiratory enzymes furtherly enlarges the oxidative capacity of the tissues. The inhibition of this phase of activation together with that of protein synthesis by both DNP or low oxygen tension suggests that enzyme synthesis, rather than enzyme activation, is responsible for the previously reported increase of respiratory enzyme activities. © 1963, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936665419

Rough estimates are given of thermodynamic limitations on stability and bit storage density and observations made on additional constraints self-replicative ability might entail. Reasonable storage stability requirement is bit configurational energy >20 kT (~0.5 ev or 10~12 erg) to prevent thermal degradation of information; significant diminution requires low temperature storage. Bit linear dimension is ~10 Å (much smaller goes below molecular size, much larger exceeds known bionic bit size), corresponding to storage density upper limit~l021 bits/cc. Self-replication by diffusion of “building blocks” from solution and short-range chemical forces (e.g., template model) implies one-or two-dimensional structure by accessibility arguments; one dimensional favored over two dimensional to permit separation of copy and model via higher solution entropy of one dimensional. Static storage is more stable in three-dimensional packing via steric considerations, resonance stabilization, or internal H bonding. One thus expects a) three-dimensional bionic packing during inert storage, b) one-dimensional “unrolled” actively replicating form, c) rather close approach to ultimate storage density in inert form, d) higher configurational binding energy per bit for self-replicating systems than required for inert storage. These expectations seem to be reasonably well realized in nature. COPYRIGHT © 1963—THE INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS, INC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84915285204

It is shown that, with models depending on mixed conductive-convective heat transfer from a magma chamber, the observed heat flows reauire either a contact area of several hundred square kilometres for the conductive transfer link, or very small separations between a chamber of circulating magma and the convective hot water system. None of the models is entirely satisfactory, and the possibility of heat transfer by magmatic steam is reconsidered in the light of the new isotope evidence, which indicates that most of the water discharged is of surface origin. It is suggested that it would be possible for this surface water to penetrate to and become absorbed by heated rock or magma at great depths and pressures, and for it to be ejected from the rock by subsequent heating, or to escape under reduced pressure to provide a very efficient high-temperature heat-transfer medium that would mix with ground water near the surface. The power potential of the various models is estimated by calculating the mechanical energy that could be obtained from an ideal heat engine taking heat from the rock or water and discharging the heat into a sink at a fixed temperature of 30°C. The results are plotted as graphs of available power per unit mass flow against temperature for saturated steam and water up to the critical temperature, and energy content per unit volume against temperature for steam, water, and rock. In nearly all cases, most of the stored energy is in the rock. The total energy content of the conductive and convective zones of the models discussed is estimated from their probable dimensions, and is found to be of the order of 106 to 108 megawatt years for the larger models. At the power drawoff rates of 250 to 350 megawatts involved in the Wairakei and Larderello power projects, these quantities of energy, if effectively drawn upon, would last at least several thousand years, and even the smallest probable model would supply these stations for some hundreds of years. If any of these models is in fact applicable to the areas concerned, it is unlikely that anv appreciable impression on the storage will be made over several decades; and neither the Wairakei nor the Larderello areas are yet showing any sign of exhaustion of their heat supply, though there are indications that the water supply may become a limiting factor. Eventually, both these and other hydrothermal power projects may gain great advantages from control of the water supply and circulation by injection of recharge water. © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909507144

A mechanism is suggested for introducing primary ions in the geomagnetic cavity and storing them in a zone between geocentric distances ∼7-12 Earth radii. Many will be lost directly into the ionosphere above the poles, others will be lost after an hour or so at high latitudes near local midnight. The flux in the third zone might reach 1010 electrons cm-2 sec-1, mostly of energy {equal to or succeeds} 100 eV. Magnetospheric motions caused by the solar ion stream give rise to electric fields which may accelerate some primary ions and store them in a 'second' (outer) trapping zone. The same 'dynamo' motions, through hydromagnetic instability, give rise to small-scale vortex cells mainly in and near the auroral zones. The instability cells have small dimensions ({equal to or precedes}20 km in the ionosphere) across the field but are very elongated (∼105 km). They rotate about their axes and develop helical twists; being in a region of shear they are torn apart so that 'strands' of magnetic force become threaded transversely across the main field. These narrow strands tend to short circuit the electric potential fields, causing currents to discharge into the auroral zones. This electrical mechanism may explain the dumping, sometimes accompanied by acceleration, of primary ions. The same magnetic field distortion may also explain the dumping of higher energy ions by changing their magnetic moments. The two dumping mechanisms are thus closely connected but may operate independently. © 1963.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50549210108

The environment determines the design of the heat sink mechanism. The type of fuel is chosen according to the application and the availability and cost of the fuel. The space systems are suitable for low-powered (less than 1 kw), long-lived, earth-orbit missions, making storage batteries unnecessary. They are independent of radiation belts and solar transients and are suitable for lunar missions, where power is needed during the long lunar night; for probes into the dense atmosphere of Venus; and in general, for missions away from the sun. The terrestrial systems fill a need for dependable power at remote, hard-to-reach locations on land and at sea. There are hundreds of serious gaps in the worldwide network of weather-observing stations; many of these gaps are in polar regions which are accessible for only a brief period each year. Yet weather data from the polar regions are needed for long-range weather prediction. The unattended arctic and antarctic stations powered by strontium-90 are helping to fill these gaps. Eventually, networks of automatic stations may transmit their data to computation centers, which in turn may issue area weather maps. The cost of radioisotopes and generators is still high (about $3000 per electrical watt for 10 years, at present prices of strontium-90), but the cost is decreasing as more generators are built and more fuel is used.

Frequency detection is achieved optically by hyperfine filtering and transmission monitoring. Atom-wall collisions which perturb the F=2 and F= 1 hyperfine levels unequally result in a transition frequency shifted from the free-atom value by about -85 cps. This shift compares favorably with atomicbeam hyperfine measurements of Goldenberg, Kleppner, and Ramsey for Cs atoms contained in hydrocarbon storage boxes. The large Rb87 shifts observed by Alley using a coherent pulse technique are not compatible with these results. Temperature-dependent studies in the region 0° to 72°C reveal that the hyperfine frequency increases approaching the free atom value as the temperature is raised, a decrease in the Rb residence time on the surface being indicated for an increase in temperature. From this information an adsorption energy of 0.1 eV and an average adsorption time of 5×10-11 sec are derived, the latter corresponding to 50 Rb oscillations in the potential well of the hydrocarbon surface. At 72°C the transition frequency is a maximum, and a further increase in temperature up to 105°C produces a frequency decrease, a behavior which correlates with the melting range of the polydisperse hydrocarbon used. This result is interpreted to mean that the adsorption energy and hence the dwell time increase as the polymer becomes more amorphous and is consistent with the idea that the amorphous state contains voids which provide a larger area of contact for a Rb atom than does the crystalline state.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242846982

Lithium metal precipitation was observed by electron paramagnetic resonance in small samples of similar composition. The results of auxiliary measurements of optical absorption, electrical conductivity and diffusion, nuclear magnetic resonance, and x-ray lattice parameter were used to interpret the data. Expansion was primarily related to the introduction of vacancies into the LiH crystal lattice to accommodate the products of radiation damage and tritium decay, to permit the formation of bcc Li metal, and to produce cavities in the crystals at high temperatures. Radiation damage was quickly reversed at the lowest temperatures, and the primary defects observed were interstitial He3 atoms and F centers. Warming to room temperature caused aggregation of the F centers and introduced vacancies which destroyed the interstitials Periodic warming for observation further increased the net expansion to allow the formation of bcc Li metal. At higher storage temperatures, vacancy diffusion stabilized a portion of the defects produced by radiation damage with the net result that increased expansion, increased Li formation, and H2 molecular species were observed in the crystals. The expansion rates in the temperature range of increasing radiation damage gave an activation energy consistent with that obtained for vacancy diffusion. An intercomparison of expansion and bcc Li formation at 23°C gave results consistent with the radiation-damage yield and with the formation of Li metal by a diffusion-controlled process. Above a 300°C minimum a second increase in expansion related to cavitation was observed. © 1962 The American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5744242704

At -178°C the greem luminescence and the photoconductivity are both stimulated by the infrared radiation peaking sharply at 1.2 μ. At 30°C, infrared irradiation produces the customary quenching of the luminescence but an enhancement of the photoconductivity. The spectral response of these consists of two bands peaking at 0.8 and at 1.3 μ. At intermediate temperatures, the total infrared response is very complex and this has been shown to be due to the simultaneous presence of quenching and stimulation. The infrared sensitivity can be resolved in terms of two basic electronic transitions. The first is from a deep copper storage center to the conduction band and produces the low-temperature stimulation. The second, of the type first described by Schön and Klasens, produces quenching and is from the valence band to an empty copper luminescent center. Filled cobalt traps are found to play an essential role in this quenching process.

The interaction energy between a movable wall in one film and a stationary wall or a linear imperfection in a second adjacent film is calculated using simple models. The equilibrium position of the movable wall as a function of an externally applied field is then determined. Means for electrically modifying the degree of interaction are investigated. Experimental results are presented illustrating the aforementioned interactions. The nucleation of long narrow domains in one film is achieved by the use of a domain wall, a scratch imperfection, or a film edge in a second adjacent film.

All tumors studied except melanoma also showed decreased UDPG1 pyrophosphorylase levels. Activities for ATP- and UTP-regenerating enzymes—namely, pyruvate kinase and nucleoside disphospho-kinase—in tumors were close to those found in normal tissues, thus providing sufficient quantities of cofactors (ATP and UTP) and energy for the polymerization process. UDPG was not diverted to UDPGA in tumors because of the absence of UDPG dehydrogenase.

The knowledge on transport number within plant canopy has been insufficient for understanding the energy and material exchanges between plant leaves and air layer, whereas the informations about the net radiation within plant canopy are being gathered by means of observation and semi-empirical theory. The author intends in this paper to present a preliminary method for evaluating the transport number within the plant canopy and to present the some features about the build-up of heat, water vapour and momentum fluxes within the plant canopy. In general, the vertical transport of heat within the plant canopy is approximated by [formula ommitted] Integrating the above equation with respectto Z, the following equation is obtained [formula ommitted] By assuming the equality of turbulent conductivity and turbulent diffusivity, and the equality of integral constant and storage heat, the transport number within the plant canopy can be determined by [formula ommitted] In order to take some clue in investigation of micro-climate within the plant canopy, above equation was applied on the micro-meteorological observational data at the paddy plant field and the young forest published by Franceschini (1959) and Baumgartner (1956), respectively. These results are set out in Figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It appeared that the vertical distribution of transport number within the plant canopy(paddy rice)had the different sort of shape between the daytime and the nighttime. The main reason for such discrepancy in vertical distributions seems to be thermal stratification observed in the lower plant layer. In day-time, the transport number decreased in proportion to decrease of height in the upper plant layer ranged from plant canopy surface to 50cm. height(corresponding to the zero-plane displacement at this paddy field). In the lower plant layer, the transport number shows the contrary diurnal course with maximum in night-time and minimum in daytime. As shown in Fig. 3, this characteristic diurnal course in transport number may result from diurnal course of thermal stratification (Δθ0∼50) in lower plant layer. The values of transport number in the lower plant layer is well supported with that in wheat field obtained by Penman. Long (1960). © 1962, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

The enzyme was found to be very sensitive to ionizing energy when irradiated in pH 7 buffer. This sensitivity was shown by a relatively low D, value (9 × 104 rad) and a rapid loss of enzyme activity during post‐irradiation storage. The results of combined treatment of the enzyme, in buffer, by heat and radiation showed that treatment order was important. Heating prior to irradiation produced inactivation proportional to the sum of the separate treatments, whereas the reverse order produced inactivation greater than that calculated from the effect of each treatment. This is in agreement with the above, where post‐irradiation storage at 0°C may be likened to a mild heat treatment. Addition of 20% pea solids to a. buffered solution of the enzyme afforded a six to ten fold protection with respect to inactivation by heat, and a seventy fold protection against inactivation by ionizing radiation. Combined heat and irradiation treatment of soybean lipoxidase, in the presence of 20% pea solids, showed that, in contrast to the results obtained in buffer, heat prior to irradiation produced greater enzyme inactivation than the reverse order of application of the two types of energy.

The fixed charges in ionic membranes play the same role as “doping” ions in semiconductors, the major difference between the two systems being that in the former the mobile particles are ions while in the latter the particles are electrons and phenomenological particles, “holes.” An important consequence of spatial gradients of fixed charge is the presence of space charge regions which give rise to an intrinsic electric field and potential. These quantities are established first for the single “lattice” thus providing a continuous treatment of the Donnan equilibrium invoked by Teorell-Meyer-Sievers in their treatment of fixed charge membranes. It is shown further that when a positive and negative membrane are juxtaposed, the space charge region in the “junction” so formed provides a mechanism for the storage of electrical energy. Thus while the system is basically a “conductor” the presence of transition regions of fixed charge give rise to the additional property of capacitance. Experimental data are presented on ionic and p-n junctions. The implications of this mechanism for the physical basis of capacitance in biological cells are discussed. © 1962, The Biophysical Society.

It is seen that the MHD generator operates in a manner similar to that of a conventional generator in that the “armature” of the MHD is a hot, high-speed electrically-conducting gas, while the force or torque-required to move a metallic conductor through a field is replaced by a pressure gradient in the gaseous armature. Thus the functions of turbine and generator are combined in a single machine. Because this machine has no moving parts, it can, in principle, accept a working fluid at very high temperature. After a derivation of the basic MHD-generator flow equations a brief synopsis of losses in an MHD generator is given. The nature of these losses is such that the MHD generator is applicable where large amounts of power are involved. In gases, the Hall effect can be very pronounced, and its influence on MHD generator design and performance is pointed out. There follows a brief statement of the state of the art in MHD-generator development at the Avco-Everett Research Laboratory. It is shown that gases produced by conventional heat sources can be made adequate conductors of electricity for use in an MHD if a small amount of easily ionizable impurity called seed is added to the gas. Recent developments in superconducting materials, plus detailed studies of MHD-generator fluid mechanics in a large combustion-driven generator point to early realization of the potential of MHD. Finally, some potential applications of MHD are suggested. These applications lie in the areas of central station power generation, shipboard propulsion, limited duration, high-power units, and energy storage and discharge in some ranges now covered by capacitor and inductive devices.

An approximate break-even point between excessive weight of solar cells for nonoriented systems and weight of the orientation servomechanism system for solar-oriented systems occurs for a power level of 100 watts. Nickel-cadmium batteries have been used for the storage of electrical energy, whether for providing power during shadow periods encountered by low-altitude spacecraft or providing peak power during telemetry for interplanetary flights. The specific weight of such power systems varies from 750 or 1000 lb/kw to 500 1b/kw for orbits from 300 miles (statute) to 22,000 miles (synchronous orbit). Reduction in weight of batteries as well as solar cells needed for battery charging as altitude increases is responsible for this decrease in specific weight because of the decreasing time of shadow encountered by an orbiting spacecraft.

Detector diameters ranged from 3 mm to 2 cm. With the junction edge exposed in air or in vacuum, these detectors were extremely unstable. The use of organic silanes and ordinary waxes as a coating on the exposed junction edge provided stability. For some detectors the treatment with silanes was followed by a decrease in leakage current during subsequent storage. For alpha particles a resolution width (FWHM) of 40-45 kev was obtained for 6 Mev alpha particles in a detector of diameter 3-4 mm. For 2-cm-diameter detectors the resolution width at this energy was 80-100 kev, but reduced to 40 kev for alpha particles at a higher energy of 9 Mev. The peak-to-valley ratio for fission fragments from cf 252 was constant and equal to 1.40 at a detector reverse voltage of 15 volts or higher. The use of boron-10 allows identification of the energies of the products of fission reactions that occur within the detector, although similar detectors may be prepared using ordinary boron.

In satellite and space-vehicle applications where auxiliary electrical power is required for extended periods of time, it has been found that the most feasible power supply currently available consists of silicon solar cells used in conjunction with sealed nickel-cadmium storage batteries. They are capable of thousands of repeated cycles and have an energy output of about 12 watt-hours per pound. Sealed silver-cadmium cells are of interest because of their higher output, 24 watt-hours per potmd, but they are not as far developed, nor do they as yet have the cycle life of nickel-cadmium cells. In the development of hermetically-sealed nickel-cadmium batteries, the following areas have received considerable attention: 1) Hermetic seal, 2) Continuous overcharge capability and low internal cell pressure, 3) Separator, and 4) Cycle life. In the development of hermetically-sealed silver-cadmium cells, four technical problems have received considerable attention: 1) Separator, 2) Improved silver electrode capable of delivering energy at the Ag+II potential, 3) Continuous overcharge capability, and 4) Cycle life. Although other direct-energy conversion systems appear to be promising and are being intensively developed, it is expected that the nickel-cadmium and silver-cadmium storage batteries will continue to be of importance for many years to come.

All of these experiments will require some form of electrical power; and their success or failure will depend upon the development of a suitable, reliable electrical power generation system. The system utilized must be compact, lightweight and rugged. Certain requirements for such an experiment could be met by solar cell arrays. The reliability of solar cells has been well established; however, their usefulness for this mission is inherently limited. Experiments conducted during the lunar nignt require a large storage capacity, if solar energy is to be the spacecrafts only source of power. A radioisotope-fueled thermoelectric generator can fulfill all spacecraft power requirements continuously throughout the lunar day or night without special orientation. A radioisotope, such as Curium-242, may be used as the thermal energy source for a lunar experiment of short duration (90 to 120 days). Curium-242 does not occur in nature, but may be created by the neutron irradiation of Americium-241. This radioisotope requires very little radiation shielding to protect sensitive equipment, because of the low gamma flux associated with its decay. The rigors of the lunar “climate” produce an environment which present-day electronic equipment will not tolerate. By utilizing waste heat from the radioisotope generator, the electronics compartment temperature may be controlled within acceptable limits. All subsystems within the generator may be duplicated to improve its reliability. This duplication, combined with the inherent dependability of static conversion, results in a system with a very high overall reliability. Such a system can be developed for a soft lunar landing experiment within current state-of-the-art capabilities.

The Class C amplifier, the frequency multiplier and the blocking oscillator are all circuits of this type. This approach allows many of the conventional restrictions on analysis procedures to be removed. For instance, in the case of the Class C amplifier, it is not necessary to assume that the plate and grid voltages are sinusoidal and the circuit at steady state. Additional features of computer use are the automatic calculation of efficiencies, plotting of waveforms and calculation of harmonic content; the facility of studying the effects of transients and modulation; the possibility of allowing the circuit parameters to take on any values or vary with time or with the voltages and currents; and the possibility of allowing the circuit associated with the device to be more complicated than usually allowed by other methods. Limitations to this approach lie in the cost of programming the problem, and the cost of running the program on an available computer. Questions of numerical accuracy sometimes arise, but can usually be handled with additional programming or running time. If a translator is available which can accept programs in the form of algebraic equations, the programming cost is often negligible. However, running time costs may be appreciable, particularly in the case of a complicated circuit with many storage elements. Machine limitations may also influence the accuracy of the mathematical model used for the tube or transistor. If the current through the device is a very nonlinear function of several variables, an accurate model may require a large amount of machine storage or a complicated program. However, it has been found fairly easy to get simple models which seem to be as accurate as the usual published characteristics for the devices.

The basic design consists of a delay medium in the form of a long, thin strip with piezoelectric ceramic, thickness-shear mode transducers bonded to the end faces. The strip acts as an elastic waveguide in which the energy contained in an input elastic pulse is propagated by a number of modes with varying amounts of dispersion. By the proper use of absorbing material along the edges of the strip, it is possible to suppress selectively the more dispersive modes and thereby reduce the width of the output pulse to the extent that megacycle bit rates may be used even in lines with delays of the order of 10 msec. Since the medium acts as a waveguide, long delays may be obtained at relatively low loss. A typical design is described in detail for a line which has a delay of 4.2 msec, an insertion loss of 34 db, and a maximum bit rate of 2.5 Mc. In addition to low loss, other advantages associated with the waveguide properties of the delay medium are: 1) the elimination of spurious signals due to beam spreading, and 2) the ability to coil the strip into a tight spiral which, in turn, makes possible compact assemblies with long delay times.

Volume pulses from the same segment of the artery were recorded by amplifying the changes in impedance between the tip of the insulated arterial needle and three interconnected short needles, insulated to their tips, inserted around the artery at the level of the tip of the Cournand needle. Recorded pressure and volume pulses were compared by automatic subtraction, and also by connecting them to the Y and X axes, respectively, of an additional cathode-ray tube; by this last method, each pulse described a loop figure on the screen. In the group of young men the volume pulses exceeded in relative size the pressure pulses of equal amplitude (mean ratio of areas 120:100). Thus, a typical pressure-volume loop was a dextrorotated figure; the volume ordinates were proportionately larger than the pressure ordinates, especially during diastole. This was interpreted as indicating a viscous response (or storage of energy) of the arterial wall during late systole and diastole. In the group of older men the pressure pulses had a longer upstroke time, higher systolic peak, and higher mean level of pressure (in per cent of the pulse pressure) than did the pressure pulses from the younger men. Volume pulses from the older men had identical upstroke times but a more rapid return to the diastolic endvolume than did similar pulses from young men. Thus, the mean level of the volume pulse was significantly lower in the aged, and the mean ratio of areas of volume pulses to pressure pulses of equal amplitude was 91:100. Therefore, pressure-volume loops from elderly men were levorotated figures; the volume ordinates were proportionately smaller than the pressure ordinates, especially during diastole. This was interpreted as a release of energy from the wall during diastole. The asending limb of the loop in older men was frequently composed of periods of increase in pure pressure alternating with periods of increase in pressure and volume, i.e., showed evidence of friction; administration of a ganglionic blocking agent may convert such loops to grossly normal figures. This and other evidences suggest that there is increased parietal tension in the older men, or elevated periarterial tissue pressure, and that this apparent stiffening of the wall may be altered by blocking neurogenic mechanisms. Additional comparative studies on animals of different ages with direct methods of measuring arterial diameter are needed in order to extend the present observations in man. © 1962.",,"aging; AGING/physiology; article; blood pressure; BLOOD PRESSURE/physiology; blood volume; physiology; AGING/physiology; BLOOD PRESSURE/physiology; BLOOD VOLUME; Aging; Blood Pressure; Blood Volume",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50549186591

One method is to distribute the products between immiscible solvents. The purple-colored thionine dye is insoluble in ether; but its reduction products are soluble. Since ferric ions also are insoluble in ether, the two products of the reaction can be separated by extraction with ether during the illumination; some stored light energy thus can be preserved. The ether extract containing the reduction products of thionine can be caused to form a homogeneous mixture with the mother liquor by adding methyl alcohol; the back reaction will then come to completion. A galvanic cell using stored light energy can be made by placing the ether extract (with some methyl alcohol added for increased conductivity) in one compartment and the aqueous mother liquor in the other, and connecting the two compartments with an agar bridge. Potential differences of 0.2434 to 0.3585 volt were measured in this cell, depending on the concentration of the reaction products. Another method of preventing the back reaction is to precipitate ferric ions, e.g., by acetate. However, in this case the reaction cannot be reversed, and thus no direct proof of energy storage can be given.

Labs., Div. of Hughes Aircraft Co., Malibu, Calif., United States","A new type of direct-view halftone storage tube that can selectively erase as well as simultaneously display stored and nonstored information has been developed. Heretofore, incorporation of these features into direct-view halftone storage tubes has proved impractical because of the nature of the secondary-emission effect on which the writing and erasing of stored information depend. In this new tube, this limitation is overcome by the use of a dual-effects target. One effect, secondary emission, charges the storage surface positively, while the other, bombardment-induced conductivity, charges it toward the backing-electrode potential, wihch in this case is negative. Selection of the effect and, consequently, the charging direction, is determined by the incident beam energy. At low energies secondary emission predominates and the target is written on, i.e., charged positively. At high energies, the bombardment-induced conductivity prevails and the target is erased, i.e., the positively charged areas are discharged. The two effects cancel at an appropriate intermediate beam energy, thus permitting presentation of nonstored information without otherwise disturbing the display, by means of that portion of the beam current which passes through the backing electrode and strikes the viewing screen. A 5-inch, direct-view halftone storage tube that utilizes such a dual-effects target is described. At writing speeds between 10,000 and 15,000 inches per second, the stored resolution is 40 to 50 lines per inch. At erase speeds between 30,000 and 40,000 inches per second, the stored resolution is 100 to 120 lines per inch. Stored and nonstored information can be displayed simultaneously; the stored information may be retained for one minute or more. With this selective-erasure, direct-view halftone storage tube, new kinds of displays are feasible. For example, in any application it is now possible to erase selectively immediately preceding the writing beam scan, thereby retaining the stored signals at maximum brightness in any region until just before that region is rescanned by the writing beam. Almost the entire display is constantly maintained at full signal brightness and therefore can be viewed under optimum conditions. In contrast, the brightness of the stored information in both cathode-ray and conventional direct-view halftone storage tubes normally starts to decay immediately after the information is written. © 1961, IEEE.

However, a second type of magnetic-energy degeneracy exists since a domain wall separating two domains has the same energy regardless of the sense (clockwise or counter-clockwise) of rotation of the magnetization M within the wall. Hence, the rotational sense of M in passing through a wall can be used to represent binary information. The two methods of representation are essentially different since different aspects of spatial symmetry are involved. A practical method of utilizing wall-rotation information coding can be effected by means of strips of thin magnetic film and nearby current conductors which are used to generate magnetic fields in specified directions at specified times and places. A shift register consists of a regular up-and-down domain pattern with M perpendicular to the long strip axis; no information is contained in the domain pattern itself, which only serves to separate spatially the information-bearing walls. Shifting is accomplished by two-phase clock pulses on a pair of shifting windings. Read-out requires the use of the operation of conditional erase, accomplished as follows: if two walls of the same sense are brought together they form a double wall which can subsequently be separated into two walls; if the walls are of the opposite sense they will destroy one another upon being brought together. Thus, erasure occurs on condition that two walls have opposite sense. Read-out then consists of conditional erase between a data wall and a wall of known sense read-in for the purpose of read-out. By introducing junctions between strips, fan-out can be achieved by moving a wall from a single to a double strip. Furthermore, if data walls from two independent converging strips are juxtaposed in a third strip, the logical operations AND or OR can be performed by appropriate use of the operations of conditional erase and the additional operation of unconditional erase; unconditional erase erases two walls regardless of sense. Finally, a method of complementing information can be conceived by considering the details of flux closure within a domain wall.

In this type of control, only part of the total energy delivered by the source is available at the motor to do useful work. The balance of the energy is converted into heat by the series resistance and is lost. A more desirable approach to speed control, as presented in this report, is to insert a switch rather than a resistor in series with the motor's supply. Here the switch would be opened and closed at regular intervals which would represent infinite or zero series resistance, respectively. In either state, the switch would present no energy losses to the circuit. The motor speed varies with the percentage of time the switch remains closed. The latter system has the advantage that for a given speed setting, variations in load will not cause fluctuations in speed due to IR drop in any series resistor. The transistorized switching circuit described in detail in this report represents an efficient method of switching the motor supply current for good speed control. The laboratory model, which gave very satisfactory performance, was designed to control 20 amperes at 24 volts, or approximately a one-half horsepower motor.

Thus, effective rationing requires a satisfactory feeding standard and information on the over-all nutritive value of the particular forage (s) to be fed. A limitation in either the feeding guide employed or the appraisal of the nutritive value of the forage naturally is reflected accordingly in the amount of concentrates fed. Recent attempts have been made to develop rapid and inexpensive, but indirect, methods for the assessment of the nutritive value of forage in programs which have become known as forage testing. The ultimate aim in the use of a forage-testing program is that of determining the kind and amount of concentrates that should be included in the ration of the individual cow as dictated by the feeding standard. Although forage-testing schemes in their present form and manner of application provide an estimate of the TDN value per unit weight of forage, they do not provide an estimate of the more influential determinant of the total energy intake, the expected forage intake. As a consequence of this limitation, and others which have been detailed in the text, it is concluded that forage-testing schemes contribute very little information of genuine value to the daily rationing and the improvement in milk yield of the individual cow. This is particularly true when the shortcomings of forage testing are considered in relation to the limitations of existing feeding standards and certain commonly encountered defects in practical feeding. Existing energy-feeding standards are both inadequate and ineffectively used in dairy farming practice. Some of the apparent shortcomings of present-day energy standards are indicated by the following conditions: (a) The data on which the standards are based were obtained with low-producing cows, (b) though the degree of effect varies from, ration to ration, increasing inputs of feed result in an ever-decreasing nutritive value (e.g., TDN) per unit of feed ingested and an increasing rate of body-tissue gain, (c) as a consequence, increasing inputs of energy above the existing feeding-standard allowances result in increasing outputs of milk, though at an ever-decreasing rate, (d) the milk-yielding potential of the dairy cow is increasing gradually and many more very high producers exist now than ever before; thus, existing energy standards are much too low for many cows now and are becoming progressively less adequate with passing time, even for the national average herd, (e) current feeding standards take very little, or no, account of the effects on production of dry-period feeding and the consequent storage, and subsequent utilization, of body tissue as a source of milk energy, (f) the TDN values recorded in tables of feed values and used in conjunction with feeding standards for the purpose of rationing have been determined usually at about the maintenance level of intake, and (g) in view of this [(f) above], and the depressing effect of increasing planes of nutrition on the milk-producing values of the ration [(b) above], it is obvious that the dietary energy requirement per unit of milk produced increases with increasing level of feed intake or, conversely, with increasing output of milk, per unit of time. In view of the limitations of existing feeding standards, a tentative energy standard is presented here in which the TDN allowances are graduated in terms of milk output per day. This attempt to develop a more versatile feeding guide, which accounts for the level-of-in-take effect, is based in part upon theoretical considerations and in part on directly determined requirements. In this standard the following amounts (lb.) of TDN above the maintenance allowance are recommended for the production of 1 lb. of 4% FCM, when the ranges in daily milk yield (lb.) are as follows: 0 to 10, 0.30; 11 to 20, 0.31; 21 to 30, 0.32; 31 to 40, 0.33; 41 to 50, 0.35; 51 to 60, 0.37; 61 to 70, 0.40; 71 to 80, 0.43; 81 to 90, 0.47; and 91 to 100, 0.53. Body tissue gain or utilization modifies the dietary requirement for energy. For example, the utilization of 100 lb. of body tissue could provide sufficient energy to support the production of approximately 400 lb. of 4% FCM. As a consequence, the utilization of body tissue, which (when it occurs) usually occurs during the first 75 days of lactation, would reduce the dietary requirement correspondingly during this period of time. The lack of, or ineffective, use of existing feeding standards contributes to other defects in feeding practice. Some cows receive insufficient amounts of energy at all times. Other cows receive a sufficient total amount of feed per year, but it is distributed ineffectively. A common expression of this defect is that of providing too little feed early in lactation and too much feed late in the lactation period. Associated with this is the failure to make effective use of the tissue gained during the dry period. Feeding plans followed in practice during early lactation demand that too large a proportion of the energy needed for milk production be provided by the catabolism of body tissue. Some degree of tissue utilization is inevitable for those cows whose milk-producing potential exceeds the limits of their appetite or stomach capacity. Also, this process is a necessity if the high-producing cow is to realize her maximum yield. Nevertheless, the alternate gaining of body tissue and its subsequent use to support lactation is inefficient energetically and should be restricted to a minimum. The finding by dairy-cattle geneticists that short-period lactation records reflect the total lactation-period yield suggests that feed inputs during the dry period and early lactation have a cumulative effect on the yield of milk throughout the lactation period. As a consequence, it is essential that the input of energy be so distributed that the output of milk reach the maximum level as soon as possible after calving, in order to attain the maximum yield for the total lactation period. A related time-distribution of input defect inherent in the application of all feeding standards needs to be remedied. This one is concerned with the fact that milk output dictates what the feed input should be, with a considerable time lag. In view of the shortcomings of forage-testing schemes and existing feeding standards, and the common defects in practical feeding, a simple feeding plan is proposed as a remedy. The main features of this plan are (a) the ad libitum feeding of high-quality forage, (b) accustoming the cow to a large intake of concentrates gradually, beginning a few weeks before the end of gestation, (c) after calving, allowing the cow to set her own pace on her intake of concentrates under the careful scrutiny of the dairyman and until she attains her maximum appetite or milk yield, (d) after this stage, determining by astute experimentation the lowest level of concentrates which is without effect upon the milk yield. This plan obviates the need for energy-feeding standards and tables of feed value and provides for the effective distribution of feed during the lactation cycle. However, it requires the measurement of the milk output and close attention to the individual cow. © 1961, American Dairy Science Association.

The altered metabolic state involved in this deposition of fat is characterized by a reduction in glycogen content of the pectoral muscles and liver and a suppression of the diurnal glycogen cycle in these organs. There is also a marked increase in the fat content of these tissues so that the total mobilizable energy in them is considerably greater than in the short-day winter birds. The thigh muscles show a similar reduction in glycogen content but only a very slight increase in fat content. This change in the pattern of energy storage may be regarded as one feature of the scheme which produces the metabolic alterations necessary for sustained migratory flight. The wintering population of the Oregon Junco, Junco oreganus montanus, in southeastern Washington responds, although less extensively, to long daily photoperiods. This may be correlated with its more restricted migratory movements. The non-migratory English sparrow, Passer domesticus, when subjected to long daily photoperiods, shows no such alteration in the pattern of energy storage in pectoral muscle and liver; rather there is a tendency toward a lower level of energy storage. Although Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii in mid-winter have much less glycogen in pectoral muscle and liver than the indoor caged birds, the pattern of energy storage may be consistent with that of the latter in experimentally induced migratory state if the restricted flight activity of the latter, the precapture activity of the former, and possible differences in temporal pattern of food intake are taken into consideration. The relatively small amount of glycogen available, and the extensive storage of fat, suggest that there must be very extensive use of fat or fatty acids directly by the pectoral muscles during flight. © 1961.",,"article; bird; BIRDS/metabolism; metabolism; BIRDS/metabolism; Birds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000357668

Ferrite elements for random access storage have been developed which require a fraction of a microsecond for a cycle. Thus the ferrite switching time establishes a maximum switching rate given by the inverse of the total switching time in a cycle. However, operation of elements such as these in a large capacity memory at rates limited only by switching times is usually prevented by: deterioration of magnetic properties due to heating effects, increase in selection line impedance, and long transmission delays. A series of ferrimagnetic oxides have been developed with properties such that the limits on minimum cycle time are appreciably extended. The most important of these properties is the saturation flux density. Over a range of composition, flux densities have been obtained which extend from 100-500 gauss. The lower flux density results in an appreciably lower energy dissipation in the magnetic structure and consequently in higher switching rates for a given temperature rise within the magnetic material. In addition, temperature dependence of those magnetic properties which determine storage applicability is more favorable than with the better known ferrites. Toroids have been fabricated with these materials which are suitable for random access memories. These elements have been operated successfully in free air at repetition frequencies in excess of 2 Mc.

Helium contents of the gases studied are 2.3 and 0.75 per cent. The equilibrium samples were analyzed by means of a mass spectrometer and special helium-analysis apparatus. Loss of helium by solution in the condensed natural gas is a major concern in achieving high over-all efficiency in the separation of helium from natural gas by low-temperature methods. Data relating to helium solubility in condensed liquid phases and the condensation characteristics of the gases are presented and discussed. Equilibrium vaporization coefficients for methane, nitrogen and helium, obtained from experimental-phase equilibrium data, also are given. A sharp increase in demand for helium the last few years, urgently required in the United States' atomic energy and space programs, resulted in a helium shortage early in 1958. A recently completed plant at Keyes, Okla. 4,6,15 has alleviated this condition temporarily, but it is expected that in a few years demand again will exceed supply. As a step toward meeting the nation's helium needs in future years, the U. S. Bureau of Mines Helium Activity of the Dept. of the Interior-the only producer of helium in this country - announced in recent press releases 12-14 a policy for conservation of this gas. Brief discussions of this policy have appeared.5 Long-range plans call for the construction of additional plants to remove helium from natural gas streams not going to fuel markets and to store the helium underground. It is possible that private industry will be interested in building and operating these ""conservation"" plants. ""Crude"" helium produced at these plants would be sold to the Government for storage. To assist industry in evaluating their desired extent of participation in the program, the Bureau of Mines Helium Activity recently placed on open file a report presenting computed phase equilibrium data for the helium-bearing natural gas supplying the Amarillo, Tex., helium plant and experimental phase data for the gas supplying the Keyes, Okla., plant.Helium contents of these gases are 1.8 per cent at Amarillo and 2.1 per cent at Keyes. A later open-file report 19 presented experimental-phase data for a natural gas containing 0.7 per cent helium and is of interest because this helium content is expected to be representative of natural gases to be processed for helium in the conservation program. In view of this, it is becoming increasingly desirable that data be published concerning the low-temperature phase behavior of helium-bearing natural gases at pressure-temperature conditions that might be employed in helium-separation processes. Because only a few copies of the open-file reports were available and because experimental data, much more reliable than the calculated data presented in the open-file report, have been recently obtained for the gas supplying the Amarillo plant, it is considered desirable to publish these data, including more detailed experimental data for a ""helium conservation"" gas than are presented in the supplement.19 Although the technical literature contains many references to the phase behavior of multi-component hydrocarbon mixtures, there are few references to low-temperature phase equilibrium data for natural gas systems containing helium. Brown and Stutzman 3.17 presented vaporization coefficients and phase equilibrium data for a natural gas containing 0.3 per cent helium at 100 psia and at temperatures from 1300 to - 2400 F. These workers disregarded the helium content of the equilibrium liquid phases - an important factor in helium extraction. Davis, et al,7 studied two natural gases containing helium. A third gas studied, also containing helium, was prepared synthetically. Helium content of the gases ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 per cent. These workers presented pressure-temperature data but did not analyze the equilibrium phases. Consequently, phase compositions and equilibrium coefficient data were not determined. The purpose of the present investigation was to obtain analyses of equilibrium liquid and vapor phases at pressures from 100 to 500 psia and temperatures ranging generally from -100° to -250° p for both the gas serving as feet to the Amarillo helium plant during the period of this study and for a ""helium-conservation"" gas [hereinafter designated HC], which was of interest as a representative helium source in the conservation program. Helium contents of the gases as studied are approximately 2.3 and 0.75 per cent, respectively. From these data, solubility of helium in the equilibrium liquid phases, per cent condensed and equilibrium coefficient data for methane, nitrogen and helium were determined. A pressure-temperature diagram for these systems is not presented In this article because the data have not yet been extended to high enough pressures or to sufficiently warm temperatures. It is contemplated that this work will be undertaken later. However, the greatest need, for operational purposes, is for composition data in the pressure and temperature ranges covered in the present study. © 1960 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

A device for the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy is proposed. 2. The device is a two-stage process with the first stage being the conversion of solar to chemical energy and the second stage being the conversion of chemical to electrical energy. 3. The solar energy is stored by means of the photochemical isomerization of trans to cis organic acids. 4. Because of differences in solubility and ionization constants, cis-acid solutions have a higher concentration of hydrogen ions than do trans-acid solutions. 5. Because of the difference in hydrogen ion concentration, electrochemical concentration cells can be constructed from cis and trans acid solutions; and thereby a portion of the chemical energy can be recovered as electrical energy. 6. Concentration cells using cis and trans acids were constructed and potentials approaching the theoretical values of approximately 0.1 volts were measured. 7. These cells possessed internal resistances of order of 1000 ohms. Despite this, the maximum electrical power measured in the various systems, was between 2 and 3 microwatts/cm2 of electrode area. Techniques for reducing the internal resistances are being investigated. 8. The maximum electrochemical efficiencies of the concentration cells are good and while the photochemical efficiencies are not calculated, it is anticipated the overall efficiency of the device will be reasonably good. 9.

Stn., Suginami-ku, Tokyo, Japan","Fat body has been shown to be a main site of storage and utilization of carbohydrates in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, and several sugars are stored in the form of glycogen in this tissue after absorption through alimentary canal. Besides these facts, it has been found that silkworm fat body can synthesize blood protein, and that the turnover rate of fat body protein is high. The present study was undertaken to obtain a further knowledge in glucose utilization of this tissue. Fat body obtained from the fifth instar larvae was incubated in the medium supplied with C14-labeled glucose as described in Table 1, and after the reaction, chemical components were fractionated from reaction mixture according to the diagram in Fig. 1. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2, radioactivity of CO2 occupied about a half of total activity incorporated into all of the fractions obtained, and that of fat about one third of total activity. This fact shows that about a half of glucose is supplied for energy-forming system and the remainder for synthetic system in fat body. Incorporation rate of radio-isotope into CO2 did not change through the reaction, while that into fat declined in a later half of the reaction. As to protein, there was a lag period at the initial phase of the reaction. Contrary to this, radioactivity of free amino acids reached quickly to the constant level at the initial phase. It may be considered from this result that free amino acids are pooled in silkworm fat body, which are later utilized for protein synthesis (Table 1, Fig. 3 and 4). Radioactivity of glycogen reached maximal value in 2-hour reaction period and then declined. The ratio of radioactivity of glycogen to total activity incorporated into all of the fractions changed similarly to that of free amino acids, both of which declining through the reaction. From this fact, glycogen in fat body of the silkworm seems to be interpreted as intermedial metabolic substance rather than as reserve or energy-supplying one (Table 1, Fig. 3 and 4). © 1960, The Japanese Society of Sericultural Science.

This is fed with such information as dry‐ and wet‐bulb temperatures and temperature differences in the vertical (in the form of fine wire thermocouple outputs) and wind speed differences. The psychrometric equation is solved automatically to yield a vapour‐pressure difference and the latent‐heat term is then computed on the basis of an aerodynamic equation. The sensible‐heat term is similarly made available. The net flux of radiation and the soil‐heat flux are also recorded. A determination of each of these four fluxes is made once per minute and the values are integrated and presented on counters which are photographed at desired intervals, the smallest interval so far used being 20 min. Results indicate that for periods of an hour or more the ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ terms in the surface‐heat balance equation so obtained, agree to about 10 per cent except when the heat storage in the first two cm of soil, of which no account is taken, is obviously changing. The only complete 24 hr observational period so far covered indicates a daily balance to a fraction of a mw hr cm−2. Over approximately 80 hr observations, which were not continuous but contained about an equal number of daylight and dark hours, a balance to better than 1 per cent was obtained. A further result, which requires additional confirmation, is that the daily water loss from the centre of an extensive short‐grass area which has an ample water supply may be obtained for all practical purposes by measuring the total net radiation and assuming that all is used in the evaporative process. It becomes obvious that if hourly mean values of the profiles of temperature, humidity and wind are used to compute the evaporation then, in general, the results will be in error by up to about 20 per cent, although daily totals may be more accurate than this. The machine as it stands is not reliable for continuous operation owing to the use of a number of electro‐mechanical devices which are required to work under conditions for which they were not designed. Some improvements will be required before reliable continuous operation becomes possible. Copyright © 1960 Royal Meteorological Society",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979317509

In the former region there is a transition from uncrimping (nonlinear spring) to approximate spring-like or Hookean behavior, and then to viscoelastic or plastic flow. In the latter region the transition is from Hookean extension to maximum plastic flow. The center of each transition region provides the basis of a new and better definition of the Young's modulus and yield points since these points are directly determined by the molecular-flow properties of the fiber. The uncrimping point is also defined on the basis that it is at or near the center of a transition from pure lielical spring to nonlinear spring and then to approximate Hookean behavior. An advantage of defining the parameters in this way is that they may be located through the use of the second and third stress derivatives as obtained by electronic analog computer techniques. Such techniques involve the use of inexpensive standard laboratory-type computer components. Thirty percent stretch and the ultimate tensile points may also be obtained. Voltage analogs of stress, strain, slope, and energy are stored in the computer's memory section at any of these points, or at any other selected stress or strain points. Twenty-one or more parameters may be computed and stored. Adaptations to yarn and fabric tensile tests and a modification to automatically dial in initial fiber length and reverse elongation are also descrihed. Through the use of analog-to-digital converters, these data may be automatically punched on cards or tape for storage or further analysis on a digital computer. © 1960, Sage Publications.

Exogenic forces are fed by solar energy but the source of endogenic forces are not so clearly understood. Earlier theories to account for such energy such as residual heat from an originally molten earth and accumulation of heat from radioactive minerals are in conflict with known facts. There exists a basic difference between the lattice structure of magmatic and highgrade metamorphic rocks on the one hand and sedimentary and low-grade metamorphic rocks on the other; in the former the basic lattice structure is one A1 atom and four O atoms in tetrahedral form, in the latter it is one A1 atom and six O atoms in octahedral form. Similar distinctions are noted for other elemental associations, The bonding properties of A1 and Si in the former class of rocks are covalent, in the latter one finds the bonds between A1 and O to be ionic and between S and O, half ionic. This indicates that the two groups represent different energy states, and that minerals of the first group store energy which is released in being converted to minerals of the second group. In the formation of minerals in the zone of weathering there is an increase in interatomic distances which results in absorption of energy. It follows then that storage of energy occurs in the formation of minerals of the zone of weathering, and that this energy is liberated in the formation of minerals deep in the earth's crust. Examples of known chemical relations and other references to observed phenomena are cited to support this hypothesis. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945615047

Messages are exchanged between the satellite and a ground station operating in the 2-kmc band utilizing both polarization and frequency diversity techniques to provide a continuous transmission circuit regardless of the satellite attitude. Data storage in the satellite is accomplished by the use of newly-developed magnetic tape recorders. Signals in the band near 108 mc provide telemetry and command control functions. The telemetry used is a modified standard FM/FM system, while the command control circuit enables selection of satellite control functions. Power for the satellite electronics is derived from solar energy using solar cells which charge nickel-cadmium batteries. Each of the ground stations consists of radio transmitting and receiving equipment and an automatic-tracking 28-foot-diameter parabolic antenna. Each station will acquire the satellite and track it during a pass over a station. Data from the satellite are transmitted (tape loading) to the ground station upon command. Simultaneously, data for the other, two stations are transmitted to the satellite (tape unloading) from the ground station. Message sorting in the satellite is accomplished by use of the appropriate tape recorders, which in turn are activated by ground commands. In the ground stations, teletype messages on paper tape are converted to a serial pulse train at a 50-kilobit-per-second rate by a paper-tape reader and a magnetic recorder-reproducer. This message-train frequency modulates a 1-kw UHF transmitter and is transmitted to the satellite where the information is deposited. A quadruple-diversity UHF receiving system using low-noise parametric preamplifiers is used to receive the down-traffic from the satellite. The 100-watt VHF ground transmitter provides for the transmission of initial commands to the satellite and a phase lock VHF receiver on the ground provides for beacon acquisition and telemetry reception.

The study is based on a consideration of the availability and characteristics of solar energy, the sources of profit in conventional energy sources, and the type of industry which could participate in the commercialization of solar energy. Solar equipment now being manufactured is of four types-water heaters, batteries, cookers, and toys and novelties. Three types of solar energy equipment now in the development stage are seen to have early commercialization prospects. The largest market during the present century will likely be residential heating and cooling systems.

Problems of coupling to the flux changes and interaction in an array of such films require study of the magnetic-field distribution. In the treatment given, a circular, single-domain, thin film is represented by a very fiat oblate spheroid. The field distribution outside the spheroid is found by assuming that the magnetic properties are characterized by an intrinsic magnetization M constant in magnitude, but varies in direction depending on field and energy considerations.

J., United States","The parametric subharmonic oscillator operates by energy transfer from the pump frequency to the oscillator frequency through a nonlinear energy storage element—in the present case, the nonlinear capacitance of a semiconductor diode. This paper examines both the requirements on the diode for satisfactory performance in this circuit and the limitations on oscillator performance which arise from the nature of the semiconductor diode. The analysis shows that abrupt junction diodes must have a Q of at least four at the oscillation frequency if there is to be any useable energy transfer, and that graded junction diodes must have a Q of six. The time constant governing the rise of the envelope of the subharmonic waveform is a marked function of the stray capacitances; this function is examined in detail. The choice of bias voltage to obtain the fastest possible rise time involves consideration of the stray capacitance, the Q of the available diode, and limitations imposed by excessive pump power requirements. For negligible stray capacitance, it is shown that the subharmonic waveform can rise by a factor e in 1.3 cycles of the subharmonic frequency for an abrupt junction diode, or in 1.9 cycles for a graded junction diode. The principles involved in the design of the semiconductor diode are examined and the choice of materials, impurity distributions, and fabrication techniques are discussed. A new diode encapsulation intended for direct mounting in microstrip transmission line is described. Measurement of appropriate diode parameters is vital to diode research. An equivalent circuit characterization in which the parameters may be directly related to the diode structure is used. Several echniques for the measurement of these parameters are discussed.

As summarised in Fig. 8, if an exogenous utilisable carbon and energy source is present, there will be a synthesis of storage compounds, together with other essential cell components. However, in the absence of an exogenous carbon and energy source, storage compounds are broken down. If the concentration and rate of breakdown of the compounds is sufficiently high, utilisable energy and carbon intermediates accumulate at such a rate that a net synthesis of essential polymers (e.g. proteins, nucleic acids) may occur. More often, the rate of breakdown is only sufficient to prevent or minimise a net breakdown of essential polymers and to provide energy for other purposes essential for the maintenance of the species (adaptation, motility, sporulation etc.). In bacteria, the main energy-storage products are probably the following: (1) Intracellular polysaccharide, probably mainly homoglycans, e.g. glycogen.

The wave function is expanded into a triple orthogonal set in three perimetric coordinates. From the wave equation one obtains an explicit recursion relation for the coefficients in the expansion, and the vanishing of the determinant of these coefficients provides the condition for the energy eigenvalues and for the eigenvectors. The determinant was solved on WEIZAC for Z=1 to 10, using an iteration method. Since the elements of the determinant are integers, and only an average of about 20 per row are nonvanishing, it has been possible to go to an order of 214 before exceeding the capacity of the fast memory of WEIZAC. The nonrelativistic energy eigenvalues obtained for the ground state are lower than any previously published for all Z from 1 to 10. In the case of helium, our nonrelativistic energy value is accurate to within 0.01 cm-1 and is 0.40 cm-1 lower than the value computed by Kinoshita. From the wave functions obtained, the mass-polarization and the relativistic corrections were evaluated for Z=1 to 10. Using the values of the Lamb shift computed by Kabir, Salpeter, and Sucher, we obtain an ionization potential for helium of 198 310.67 cm-1 as against Herzberg's value of 198 310.82±0.15 cm-1. Comparison is also made with the available experimental data for the other values of Z. By the use of our magnetic tape storage, the accuracy of the nonrelativistic energy value for helium could be pushed to about 0.001 cm-1, should future improvements in the experimental values and in the computed radiative corrections warrant it. © 1958 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36149026417

In order to investigate the rate of decay of this energy, rise curves were taken for six phosphors of various luminescent properties and activation after various dark decay periods following excitation to equilibrium and after de-excitation by exposure to infrared light and heat. For all phosphors the trap concentration was found to be of the order of 1015/cc independent of the type of activator. In addition, the rates of decay of stored energy were determined and were found to be similar; from 20% to 60% of the energy remained in the phosphors after 1 week. This slow rate of decay is explained by predominant retrapping in traps of various depths. The areas under curves of phosphorescent emission were compared to the deficiency areas above rise curves taken immediately after the end of decay. For four of the phosphors these two areas are nearly equal to each other. One phosphor, especially activated with Ni and with practically no phosphorescence exhibited, however, a rate of energy decay similar to the phosphorescent phosphors. This means that the decay of stored electrons can take place radiatively and/or nonradiatively and that the rate for both processes is of the same order of magnitude. The areas under curves of visible light stimulated by infrared irradiation were compared with areas above rise curves taken immediately after the end of stimulation. If all stored electrons were released radiatively, these two areas would be equal. For only one phosphor (specially Pb activated ZnS) was this the case. All others exhibited only from 0.6% to 5% radiative recombinations. Thus the light sum under a stimulation curve does not give a true picture of the trap population. © 1958 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36149013784

If the value of the energy storage element is made to vary in the proper way, energy is fed from the source which drives the element (that is, the pump) to the fields of both the resonant circuits. This paper describes the behavior relative to gain, band width, and noise of this type of amplifier. Specifically, it is shown that to increase gain, the Q of one of the resonant circuits, the one commonly called the idling circuit, must be increased or the variation in the variable reactance must be increased. The band width is inversely proportional to this Q and to the voltage gain. Hence, for high gain, the amplifier is normally a narrow band device. One of the most important sources of noise is the thermal noise originating in the idling circuit. However, in principle this source can be reduced indefinitely by making the idling frequency approach the pumping frequency or by artificially cooling the idling circuit. In this fashion very low noise figures should be possible. The parametric principle can also be applied to producing frequency conversion with large conversion gain. The appendix presents the expressions for gain, band width, and noise figure for this application. The behavior of the converter relative to gain, band width, and noise is quite similar to that of the amplifier. © 1958 The American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347208566

In order to utilize the full momentum acceptance of the spectrometer (Δ/p/p ≃ 0.05), we have constructed a 10-channel prototype of a 50-channel scintillation-Cerenkov detection system which will possess a resolution (p/Δ p ∼ 1000) close to the maximum obtainable from the spectrometer. The momentum channels are defined by small scintillation counters which detect ionizing particles, consisting primarily of high-energy pions and electrons. Electrons are distinguished from mesons by Cerenkov counters which back up blocks of 10 scintillators. A coincidence is required (2 τ ≃ 3 + 10−8 μusec) between a scintillation detector and the associated Cerenkov counter. A 256-channel computer-type ferrite core memory (Radiation Counter Laboratories Mark 20), divided into four manually or electronically-selected blocks of 64 channels, is used to store the information from the counter array. The use of this large memory allows storage of correlated information in matrix form from two arrays of counters.

Each transfluxor is set by the coincidence of row and column current pulses to a level determined by the amplitude of the video signal, stores this level, and transmits energy continuously to the cell in proportion to the stored level. Both halftone and on-off control of brightness is possible. Scanning is accomplished by magnetically switching row and column conductors. The array has 1200 elements arranged in 30 rows of 40 each. The picture is uniform, exhibits good halftones, and has a maximum brightness of four foot lamberts. To obtain sufficient voltage from the transfluxor to excite electroluminescence, drive by short, fast-rising pulses is used. Light output data for such pulses were obtained and it was found that a steeper dependence of light output upon voltage, a different color spectrum, and higher efficiency resulted than is obtained with sine-wave drive. a modification using a linear transformer to couple the transfluxor and electroluminescent cell and driven by sine waves to operate as a transfluxor-tuned resonant circuit was demonstrated to be economical in driving and setting power. For some applications, the full storage afforded by a transfluxor at each picture element is not necessary. a system was investigated which uses fewer transfluxors storing only a row of picture information at a time. The demonstration panel has shown that it is possible to display pictures indefinitely, to store latent images without stand-by power, to use selective addressing through digital codes, and for the panel itself to provide much of its own switching. These unique properties can be obtained for alphanumeric, symbolic or pictorial information in displays ranging from a fraction of a square inch to many square feet in area. © 1958, IEEE.

Every rat which, died of tumor contained a very little amount of glycogen in their liver cells. The rate of the glycogen depletion of tumor-bearing animals exceedingly surpassed that of starved rats. It has remained unsolved in the present study whether the observed depletion of liver glycogen occurred in rats as a direct response to the enormous requirement of energy by tumor cells, or whether tumor transplants attacked hormonal glands of the host which control the glycogen storage in the liver. Whatever the causes may be, it is very likely that the glycogen depletion observed in the tumor-bearing rats may be attributable to the tumor transplants in hosts. Contrary to the glycogen depletion, RNA (basophilia digestable by RNase) increased gradually with the prolonged existence of the tumor transplants. The increase in amount of RNA was observed both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. The thickening of the nuclear membrane and the hyperactivity of the nucleolus observed in the tumor animals seem to indicate the active participation of the nucleus in association with the accelerated production of RNA in the liver cells. An increase of net DNA content (Feulgen-Schiff complex) took place in connection with an increase of the nuclear volume in liver cells of tumor-bearing animals during the period of the most active proliferation of the tumor. Its significance -was discussed in relation to the DNA content of the nucleus. Increased mitotic activity and dilatation of the liver sinusoids were also observed in livers of the rats bearing tumor transplants. © 1958, The Japanese Cancer Association.

Within this interval there are observed not only strong anisotropies in the incident radiation, but also relatively large differences in time (≤9 minutes) between the commencements of the intensity increases in different parts of the world. This distribution of time delays is superposed upon the transit-time delay which all particles experience between production and detection. From these experimental results, and the calculations of orbits onnecting the sun and earth at the time of the flare, it is shown that there are broad impact zones on the earth within the first ten minutes of the cosmic-ray intensity increases. Using the recently deduced flare-particle spectrum, cosmic-ray intensities at the top of the atmosphere have been determined for the different impact zones. For this flare event the ""2000 hour"" impact zone becomes as important as the ""0900"" and ""0300"" hour impact zones. These results demonstrate that the first flare particles arriving at the earth were not of low energy, and that the low-energy particles arrived later-the delay being an inverse function of energy. This energy-dependent spread of first arriving particles is called the dispersion effect arising from the mode of particle propagation from the flare source to the earth. These conclusions show that back scattering from disordered magnetic fields beyond the orbit of the earth does not account for the time delays. Various alternatives are considered for production of this distribution of onset times. The most likely process appears to be propagation through magnetic fields by diffusion. Since the impact-zone data for all geomagnetic latitudes, including both polar regions, predict a distant source in the direction of the sun but of order one radian solid angle in the sky, and since sufficient diffusion around the earth to produce the required time delays would destroy the observed impact-zone effects, it is suggested that there may exist a diffusing envelope around the sun which accounts for both the apparent source size and the dispersion effect. Small irregularities in the general solar dipole field are invoked to produce the diffusion. Calculations show that the predicted dispersion effect agrees with the observations, and that other details following from diffusion are satisfied. There is evidence of a dispersion effect for the flare particles of November 19, 1949. The implications of these results for possible uniform magnetic-field distributions between the sun and earth are reviewed, and it is shown from the orbit calculations and the dispersion effect that the predictions are not in agreement with observations. There is a transition period between the time when impact zones are dominant and the time when isotropy sets in. The subsequent storage of the solar cosmic-ray particles is not further considered in this paper, except for the bearing of these observations at early times upon the character of the interplanetary storage magnetic fields. © 1957 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006833404

The figures for germination capacity obtained immediately after treatment indicated that a lethal zone had been reached with final temperatures above 100°C and moisture contents reduced to 0.09 and 0.00 per cent. It was shown that heat drying to as low as 0.66 per cent moisture at a final temperature of 100°C for 3 hours does not injure the germination capacity over a period of seven years, but after 15 years a greater loss in viability appears than in seed treated less severely. Germination energy figures (6‐days’ test) rather than germination capacity are a more reliable guide to optimum temperatures, duration of heating, and moisture content in the drying of seed for long‐period storage. The most favourable treatment in this series was found to be heating the seed gradually to a maximum temperature of 90°C for 3 hours with a reduction of moisture content to 1.62 per cent. Seed thus treated showed 81 per cent germination after 15 years; for the last eight years the bottles were stored in a cold room, after replacing the air in them with nitrogen.

Ranges of pH and temperature investigated were 2.0 through 10.0 and 4°C through 61°C. respectively: formaldehyde was employed at 0.009%. The results are interpretable by first-order kinetics. However, at pH 5 and 6 and also at 55° and 61°C small fractions of the virus population had much lower first-order inactivation rates than the bulk of the virus. Possibilities concerning the nature of the fractions with higher resistance are discussed. 2) Rates of inactivation at various pH levels were determined at 4°C. Below pH 4 the virus was totally destroyed within a few seconds. At pH 5 and 6 infectivity was lost at a rate of about 90% per second and minute, respectively, until only one-millionth of the virus remained. This residual virus was very stable to further inactivation. At pH 6.5 and 10, 90% of the virus was inactivated every 14 hours. The virus showed marked stability only at pH 7 and 7.5. losing little infectivity during a 5-week period. At pH 8 and 9, a 90% reduction of infectivity occurred within a 3- and a 1-week period, respectively. 3) Rates of thermal inactivation were determined at pH 7.5. The time intervals required for the inactivation of 90% of the virus existing at any time were as follows: 18 weeks at 4°; 11 days at 20°; 21 hours at 37°; 7 hours at 43°; 1 hour at 49°; 20 seconds at 55° to a survival of 0.001, 7 minutes thereafter; and 3 seconds at 61°C to a survival of 0.00001, 11 minutes thereafter. Activation energies calculated for loss of infectivity below and above 43°C were 27.200 and 120,600 calories per mole of FMDV. respectively. 4) Virus treated with formaldehyde at a concentration of 0.009% was inactivated at a rate of 90% per day of storage at 4°C. © 1957, SAGE Publications.

Of particular importance at this time, there is included a discussion of means of accomplishing lower inductance and “Q” factor improvement over conventional design. A brief discussion of capacitor fundamentals contributing to the control of discharge waves is presented to illustrate the need for precise determination of circuit characteristics and electrical parameters. Several application problems are discussed, illustrating all of the factors pertinent to the design requirements, and how to obtain them. Since most of these installations represent considerable investment and frequently the need for high reliability, means for protection both against voltage overshoot and isolation in the event of unit failure is also discussed. Thus, the information presented establishes the criteria for selection of large banks of capacitors under the most favorable economic and technical comditions, along with an assurance of reliable performance without excessive unused safety factor dollars. © 1956 IEEE.

Mathematical expressions were given for calculating the forces and torques brought to bear against teeth by an arch wire containing second order bends. 2. It was shown that the effective rotations which could be incorporated into the wire at any one adjustment varied between 1 and 2 degrees. The initial bends contain larger rotations of the bracket members because a certain amount of play must first be overcome before the teeth could be subjected to torques. 3. In any arch wire containing second order bends, the torques created are balanced by a couple. This couple must intrude the teeth at one end of the segment and extrude the teeth at the other end. The direction or sense of the couple is always opposite to the sense of the torques. 4. The torque received by either end tooth is about one-half as great as the torque taken by any one of the other teeth in the segment. 5. For a given span distance, the relative lengths of the bracket and interbracket members have no practical effect on the action of the wire Furthermore, the angles made by the various interbracket members with the slots in the brackets need not be uniform. The bracket members, though, should be fabricated to be parallel to each other. 6. Large forces and torques can be brought into existence through second order bends. Extrusive and intrusive forces as high as 2 pounds and torques as high as 0.5 pound-inch can act on the teeth immediately following the placement of the wire. These large forces and torques diminish quickly, however, because they are associated with very small angles of wire rotation. 7. Wrought-gold wire, because of its lower modulus of elasticity, would exert a milder action than the usual types of stainless steel used. This is not meant to imply, however, that gold is superior to stainless steel in other respects. 8. The second molar should be included in second order bend therapy. The additional span brought into action permits a greater storage of potential energy in the system which would be available for tooth movement. 9. After the crowns have been moved distally and the uprighting of the axes is begun, it becomes essential to apply a continuous auxiliary force, distally directed, to the arch wire or brackets. Such a necessity represents an inherent weakness in second order bend therapy, because it is difficut to supply such a force continuously without the use of intermaxillary elastics. These elastics have a detrimental effect on the opposite arch, as stable anchorage cannot be found inside the oral cavity. © 1956, All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910389339

This polarization can be produced, particularly in photoconductive, fluorescent substances of high dark resistance, by the action of various kinds of radiation in the presence of a dc electric field. It has been found that such polarizations, of more than 10 000 volts/cm, will persist for many days if kept in the dark after field removal. A material so polarized is in many ways a photosensitive electret. Among the substances tested, a [Zn: Cd]S phosphor and anthracene were used most extensively. Measurements are reported on the effect of ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light, gamma and beta rays on the production and removal of polarization. The increase of polarization with time is initially rapid and then shows saturation. It is almost a logarithmic function of the exciting radiation intensity, and a linear function of the polarizing voltage over a wide range. It is found that the equilibrium values of polarization are essentially determined by the applied voltage, and one parameter specific to the substance. Data are given on the long-time storage of polarization. It is shown that this polarization is due to a partial separation by the applied field of free mobile charges produced by the radiation inside the material and their localization in traps. It is not a charge injection-ejection phenomenon at the electrodes since it occurs just as well in samples insulated from the electrodes. In powders at least, the polarization is distributed throughout the entire sample and is not a charge accumulation near the surfaces. A correlation is established between these phenomena and the mechanism assumed for these substances to explain photoconductivity and fluorescence. A phenomenological model is presented which quantitatively describes many of the results of these experiments. This polarization effect provides a new method to detect and study energy storage in crystals. © 1955 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36149006496

Weak pulses of radio-frequency energy condition the nuclear spins to start precessing in phase. After they become completely out of phase, a strong recollection pulse brings about a phase reversal of precession and produces a series of spin echoes in a sequence corresponding to direct or reverse order of input pulses. The echo amplitudes in such a series are given as a function of the number and strength of the input pulses and the conditions for maximum storage capacity in a spin ensemble are determined. The maximum specific storage capacity in liquids is expressed in terms of the thermal noise of the detecting apparatus, the effect of self-diffusion of the molecules, and the relaxation times. The origin of undesired spin echoes arising from the interaction of input pulses is discussed, and means for eliminating these echoes by frequency and magnetic field modulation are discussed and applied. Extensive use is made of a magnetic field modulation technique to destroy undesired echoes, and to permit novel types of recall of serially stored groups of pulses. Whereas Fernbach and Proctor [J. Appl. Phys. 26, 170 (1955)] have demonstrated multiple pulse storage under conditions which reproduce the input pulse shape, the present investigation is concerned with the storage of a maximum number of pulses whose shape is ideally determined by the nuclear spin band width. In practice, the order of 1000 rf pulses can be stored and recalled by this method in a proton sample several cc in volume within a memory time of 10 to 50 milliseconds.

In Venezuela both the Government and Industry feel that conservation is almost synonymous with sound and efficient oil field practice and a realistic attitude has been maintained which recognizes the economic aspects of the problem as well as its physical and technical sides. No serious problem exists regarding conservation of free gas, but a very real conservation problem is created by the production of a large volume of by-product gas associated with oil production. The Industry is acutely aware of the problem and is continually endeavoring to obtain the maximum recovery of oil and to increase gas utilization as rapidly as the country's economy will permit. - Technical Aspects. Sound engineering and efficient reservoir control measures have been voluntarily followed by the Industry and optimum drilling programs have resulted in minimum existence of wasteful production practices. A comparison of Venezuelan withdrawal rates with those of the United States emphasizes the adherence to modern, efficient production principles. Although many Venezuelan oil fields are not suited to water flooding, this technique has been successfully applied in a feto instances. Gas injection facilities have been installed in a much larger number of fields for the purpose of pressure maintenance and a list of existing and projected plants is furnished. The four objectives of pressure maintenance are to increase ultimate recovery, to lengthen the flowing life of oil wells, to conserve and store gas for future use, and to increase efficient recovery rates. Approximately 170 billion cubic feet of gas was utilized in 1953 and natural gasoline plants processed 106 billion cubic feet during the same period. Additional details regarding utilized and processed gas are given. High gathering, compressing, and injection costs result in poor economic prospects for underground gas storage unless such storage is incidental to stimulating oil production. - Legal Aspects. The ownership of mineral rights by the Venezuelan Nation and the comparatively large size of concession blocks result in a minimum number of competitive production operations. By adhering to sound and efficient operating principles, the Industry has avoided the necessity of restrictive legislation and close Government control. The Petroleum Industry and the Government have cooperated in unitizing reservoirs where such action proved essential. - Economic Aspects. A sound oil an&gas conservation policy has benefited both the Industry and the Nation. The increased recovery obtained by good conservation practices leads to a high degree of utilization of production facilities and increased gas utilization provides a cheap source of energy and raw material. These factors have been and continue to be very important in the development of the national economy. - Progress. The increased trends toward gas utilization and additional oil recovery through production stimulation methods are indicative of the progress of conservation in Venezuela. It is estimated that by 1960 over fifty percent of all the produced gas will be utilized. This progress is in line with the over-all industrial and social progress of the Nation. © 1955 Energy Institute.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058243260

Two species of denitrifiers (facultative anaerobes) have also been examined and found to contain cytochromes of the ""c"" type.

The aircraft must be capable of lifting a large payload, a long distance, at high speeds with a minimum expenditure of fuel. To achieve this goal, the designer must utilize a power plant of tremendous power, which roust be small in weight and volume, and it must have a low specific fuel consumption. The selection of the power plant is dependent on several factors. The paramount consideration is performance. This is largely due to the fact that the power requirement is proportional to the cube of the aircraft speed. However, ultimately, the power plant must have good installation and serviceability features, Tor many years, the engine installation was considered only to be the wiring and plumbing of the engine to the airframe, Now,however, in supersonic aircraft, the engine is a means of imparting energy to a complex and sensitive flow system, which begins ahead of the induction inlet and ends behind the exhaust nozzle. The efficiency and the complexity of the flow system configuration is influenced by the vast range of operational conditions such as aircraft speed and altitude and the location of the engine relative to the airframe, The, aircraft must have good supersonic aerodynamic characteristics and, therefore, will have thin wings and a clean fuselage. In comparing weight distribution in jet transports versus reciprocating engine transports, having equal payloads, it is shown that for the jet, the fuel weight is doubled, power plant weight is nearly halved, airframe weight is increased about a fifth and the weight of ether items remains equal. Actually, in some installations, the engine and fuel may constitute 60-6% of the total aircraft weight? therefore, engine installation and fuel storage will be the largest factor in determining aircraft drag, Airframe changes can be made to accommodate the engine and fuel as long as the exterior surfaces are aerodynamically clean. However, if compromises are made in the engine installation to attain this, end, then severe losses in overall aircraft performance may result. It is imperative that paramount importance be placed on the engine installation problems in early design stages of the aircraft or the installation barrier will continue to be a very serious problem. New equipment of increased performance, low weight and satisfactory for high temperature environments is needed now, Further, it is imperative that a thorough overall study of future engine installations be conducted to forecast problems which will eventually arisej many items will be added, many will no longer be required and many more will have to be deleted from the aircraft to retain high performance.",,"Aerodynamic configurations; Airframes; Engines; Fighter aircraft; Fuel storage; Fuels; Fuselages; Structural frames; Supersonic aerodynamics; Supersonic aircraft; Vehicle performance; Aerodynamic characteristics; Aircraft performance; Early design stages; High-temperature environment; Operational conditions; Reciprocating engines; Specific fuel consumption; Weight distributions; Aircraft engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072497349

A general description is given of the main types of photomultipliers and luminescent materials suitable for such work. The crystals most used in practice are thallium-activated halides or organic crystals such as anthracene or naphthalene. To a first approximation the amplitude of the light pulse produced by the absorption of high energy particles is proportional to the energy absorbed, so that a scintillation detector is, in essence, a proportional counter. Deviations from this linearity, however, occur particularly with organic luminophors. A short outline is given of the application of scintillation counting techniques to medical problems, to which they are particularly applicable owing to the very high sensitivity and small physical size of the detector. A description is given of needle scintillation counters for the study of the radioactivity of biopsy specimens; of 4 π counters using a liquid scintillating medium for the study of the radioactivity of samples of blood; and of the application of scintillation counters in the study of the radioactivity of normal and pathological brain tissue. The paper next describes new dosemeters developed by Dr. E H Belcher depending upon the measurement of total luminosity of the crystals exposed to ionizing radiations. They are shown to be sensitive, stable, reasonably independent of wavelength errors, and are an important development in clinical radiation dosimetry.

The characteristic of the strong light emission, mostly in the ultraviolet range, upon stimulation by longer wavelength light after pre-excitation with high-energy radiation, is extensively investigated, as well as the fluorescence and phosphorescence. A practically linear stimulated light response as a function of the roentgen dose over a range from about 10-2 to 104 roentgens is found. Such a measurement of stimulated light can be performed a considerable time after the exposure to the high-energy radiation and still provide a determination of the dose. Both the ordinary phosphorescence and the stimulated light phosphorescence under suitable conditions may decay very slowly and show many other similarities. The measurements show that the amount of energy stored by the crystal which can later be released as emitted light is greater than 3 percent of the energy totally absorbed. After a sufficiently long stimulation by visible light the rate of de-excitation becomes very small; further stimulation with light of shorter wavelengths produces a rise in the amount of stimulated light and an increase in the de-excitation rate. The amount of stored energy which can be stimulated as light decays slowly with storage time. This effect is closely correlated with the coloration well known with pure NaCl crystals; bleaching a crystal results in a reduced stimulation. Most of the experiments were carried out with a radium gamma-ray source, but measurements with x-rays and fast electrons show very similar results. Experiments with fast electrons were performed with doses up to 500 000 rep; saturation then occurs, but after de-excitation (bleaching) the crystal could be re-excited and be used again with no appreciable change in properties. The counting properties of these crystals are rather poor because of small peak heights. A rather complete explanation of these properties can be given by a model assuming a continuous distribution of traps over a small range. The energy released from these traps goes to the activator, from which the energy is emitted as light. © 1953 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037908019

The photolysis (with the fully reversed mercury lamp) and pyrolysis of acetaldehyde have been studied continuously by a mass-speetrometric technique involving the use of isotopic hydrogen. 2. The photolysis of acetaldehyde at 140°C. yields methane and carbon monoxide in a ratio slightly less than unity. The difference is ascribed to ethane simultaneously produced. It is inferred that an amount of hydrogen roughly equivalent to ethane is also formed. 3. The photolysis of acetaldehyde-d4 under similar conditions gives similar results but at a lower rate explicable on the basis of the difference in zero-point energies of the two aldehydes. 4. The photolysis of mixed acetaldehyde and acetaldehyde-d4 yields the expected mixture of products. However, the ratio of H2, HD, and D2 produced (in relatively small yield) indicates that a small fraction of the reaction proceeds concurrently by rearrangement in a single elementary act, which does not add significantly to the total effect. 5. In the pyrolysis of mixtures of acetaldehyde and acetaldehyde-d4 primarily produced free radicals apparently play an important part. Production of methane-d4 and methane-d3 was directly shown by mass-spectrometric techniques and the formation of methane and methane-d may be inferred. By comparison of the yield of methanes with the yield of ethane-d6 it is estimated that the chain length for the Rice-Herzfeld pyrolysis of acetaldehyde is of the order of 1000 at 465°C. under the experimental conditions. 6. The free-radical chain reaction in the pyrolysis of acetaldehyde includes a low-activation-energy, inversion-type isotopic isomerization, which does not affect the steady-state concentration of radicals. 7. The initial rate of pyrolysis of acetaldehyde under the conditions of these experiments is comparable to the results of previous workers on the uninhibited reaction. It was shown that the oxygen present was below a level which could make a significant contribution. 8. Hydroquinone vapor can act as an inhibitor to the pyrolysis, but not in the photolysis, because of the relatively shorter chain lengths in the photolysis. Storage over hydroquinone does not affect the rate of pyrolysis. 9. There is a concurrent pyrolytic split of acetaldehyde into ultimate molecules. This reaction makes a measurable contribution at the lower temperatures of pyrolysis, but becomes of minor importance as the temperature is raised.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947554202

An introduction to integrator theory in general and an analysis of the storage tube operating as an integrator are given.

As these contact speeds cannot be obtained manually, it has never been possible to operate magnetic circuit breakers of this class by manual mechanisms of the type frequently used to operate oil circuit breakers. In every case where medium voltage magnetic circuit breakers were applied, it was necessary, therefore, to install a reliable source of closing power. This requirement constituted a serious application handicap in some locations where a reliable source of closing power (normally storage batteries) is difficult and expensive to install. This paper describes a new type of mechanism for operating magnetic oilless circuit breakers rated 2,300 to 15,000 volts, which has been developed especially for such applications. Energy is manually supplied to this mechanism where it is stored in heavy compression springs until it is released to close the circuit breaker. Unlike previous mechanisms, when this mechanism is released, the springs transfer their energy to a rotating mass which in turn drives the circuit breaker contacts. As this rotating mass accelerates until the circuit breaker contacts meet, its entire energy is available for closing and latching the circuit breaker against the magnetic retarding forces of high current short circuits if the circuit breaker should be closed accidentally on a faulted circuit.

Electrons escaping from these traps give rise to emission when they recombine with luminescence centres but there is a probability that they may be retrapped in empty electron traps before their final recombination with centres. The present theoretical and experimental studies attempt to determine the extent to which retrapping does occur and what effects it will have in modifying the phosphorescence and thermoluminescence characteristics. Theoretical treatment shows that there are marked differences in these characteristics for conditions when the retrapping process is present and for those when it is negligible. Experimental investigations of the characteristics of specimens of zinc sulphide, zinc silicate and strontium silicate phosphors indicate that, except under special conditions, retrapping of electrons is negligible. These results together with other work can be explained theoretically if it is assumed that electron traps operative in the luminescence process are spatially associated with the immediate neighbourhood of the luminescence centres formed by activating impurities.

The upper Pettit section is a relatively thin and uniform oolitic lime except for a thin shale break covering approximately two-thirds of the field and separating the upper Pettit into two porous sections. Geological data indicate the reservoir to be a sealed stratigraphic trap. From the production history, bottom-hole sample analyses, and pressure data, it has been determined that it is a solution gas-drive reservoir. Recoveries under natural production methods are estimated to be 18 to 20 per cent. Recoveries under pressure-maintenance operations, with central injection of 80 per cent of the produced gas, have been estimated to be not over 30 per cent of the original reserves. Experimental water-flooding operations, commenced in March 1946, indicate that a minimum of 37 per cent of the original reserves can be recovered under such operations with no water production and assuming coverage of 100 per cent of the field. It is concluded that water-flooding operations can be economically conducted in fields of 40-to 80-acre well spacing, provided injection capacities are sufficient, provided that a single line-drive pattern as contemplated for the Haynes-ville upper Pettit will give economic results, and provided the field is still producing economically in the primary stage. Increased daily production of large quantities of oil directly attributable to the water-flooding program will occur when the water flood becomes a linear system. The pressure-maintenance program will provide energy for lifting the large quantities of additional oil to be recovered as a direct result of the water-flooding operations. © Drilling and Production Practice 1947.",,"Digital storage; Floods; Infill drilling; Lime; Linear systems; Oil field development; Oil well flooding; Oil wells; Proven reserves; Recovery; Stratigraphy; Water injection; Well spacing; Daily production; Economic results; Geological data; Natural productions; Pressure maintenance; Sample analysis; Solution-gas drive reservoirs; Water production; Injection (oil wells)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058074900

Each of these main groups has been found to be sub‐divided into regular proportions of individual compounds, and in turn, this regularity is reflected in the composition of the wort ultimately produced from the malt. On the other hand, harvest weather and the subsequent treatment and storage of the barley before malting have been found to influence the biological processes of the grain; whereas varieties have been found to differ from one another both biochemically and biologically. It is considered that the biological effects which are of importance for malting can be assessed by the germinative capacity and energy of the grain, and suitable methods for measuring these have been developed. An indication is given how these methods, in conjunction with estimations of moisture and nitrogen content, can be used as guides to obtain the best results in the operations of drying, blending and storage, as well as in the malting process itself. 1947 The Institute of Brewing & Distilling",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978583030

With these objects further studies have been made in the 1945–46 season. The first essential is to obtain more understanding of the nature of “quality” in barley, and from the malting standpoint it would seem that much of “quality” is comprised in the obvious requirement of complete and even germination. Among “sound” barleys, incomplete germination arises from dormancy—in other words the germinative capacity is 100 per cent. in sound barleys, and differences between them arise from the degrees of germinative energy. Evidence suggesting this was obtained last season from a comparative study of the germinative energy of a number of varieties: low dormancy being associated with high quality. These results have been closely confirmed this season, thus suggesting at the same time that the relative degree of dormancy is a fairly constant varietal characteristic. This may assist in the selection and breeding of new races. It has not been possible, in the last season, to obtain conclusive evidence, but the indications are that the effect of nitrogen content is a separate factor in malting quality, unrelated to the dormancy. Dampness, either before or after harvest, may render barleys “unsound”—that is, may lower the germinative capacity. The causes leading to this appear to include premature sprouting of the germ (“pregermination”) and the action of fungi, bacteria, mites and other insect pests. Studies of unsound barleys by the selenite staining method show that this appears capable of measuring the germinative capacity of samples accurately, and more easily and rapidly than by the peeling technique. Death of the barley germ during storage can be followed closely by the selenite staining method and has been found to occur progressively from the root tip upwards. It appears to be related to the degree of development of fungi under the husk. By a suitable choice of samples and of drying treatment, it should be possible to mantain stocks of barley safely for much longer times than are at present customary. 1946 The Institute of Brewing & Distilling",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978570140

Of these methods, the latter two are the most efficient types of operation and, by means of these, the highest recoveries of oil from reservoirs can be obtained. The characteristics of each type of performance are described and illustrated by means of actual field examples. Particular attention is directed to the importance of early identification of the type of drive to be employed as the recovery mechanism in a petroleum reservoir, and it is stressed that the dissolved-gas-drive mechanism is to be avoided whenever possible. The use of geologic and engineering data to make this distinction is illustrated. The proper control of producing rates, and gas and water production as factors of reservoir performance, are discussed; and a number of examples of the application of modern engineering principles to problems of these types are given. The subordinate role played by well spacing in the modern concept of reservoir performance is discussed. The particular point stressed is that well spacing alone is not the controlling influence on recovery efficiency; it is the control of the reservoir as a whole, in such a way that the most efficient mechanism of recovery is properly utilized, that governs the recovery to be obtained. Specifically, in any field, a sufficient number of wells should be drilled so that, when the field as a whole is produced at an efficient rate, the rate of production of individual wells is not excessive; i.e., individual wells should not be produced at such rates that there is an excessive production of free gas or water, or that the rate of depletion of the sand in the neighborhood of the wells is materially greater than in the remainder of the reservoir. © 1944 American Petroleum Institute.

Starting at low temperatures is difficult for two reasons. A cold engine requires higher torque to start it, and the colder the battery the less the amount of current that can be drawn from it. With a 24-v battery, an engine requires to start it at a certain temperature only one-fourth the amount of current it would require if the battery were only 6 v. After an engine has been started, it is necessary to put back the energy taken out plus a little more because battery charging is not 100% efficient. This cannot be done at low temperatures. For efficient charging, the battery temperature should be at least 40 F. For batteries that are used fairly frequently, it is helpful to keep them in well-insulated boxes, or in boxes that have had a piping system rigged up so that warm water can be circulated through the boxes. Another solution, satisfactory for batteries having rubber cases but not for those having composition cases, is to use a suitable heater. If a battery has been parked for days, even a well-insulated box is not enough, so that some sort of heater must be used. One type of heater in successful use is the Coleman No. 520 gasoline burner, which supplies 5000 Btu per hr.

In the largest four-engine aircraft, even four generators of maximum capacity do not furnish ample electric energy.

Less encouraging is the obvious lack of pertinent data upon which to base the operation of forecasting methods which would take into account the influence of the heat absorbed by the snow from the blanketing air‐mass and that of radiation and condensation. Observational facilities must be provided which will give more accurate knowledge of the water in the snow and the conditions of mantle structure under which snow responds to melting influences. The location of these observational points must be in accord with statistical principles of sampling which will consider variations in basin shape, elevation, and aspect. The problem of utilizing water in the form of snow is best conceived of as one of conservation by storage, the great snowfields of the mountainous West being considered as vast reservoirs in which the life‐sustaining waters are impounded as realistically as is in the case of water reserves held behind man‐made dams. In the latter type of conservation the control of release is accomplished through mechanically operated gates and valves; in the former, Nature exercises a thermostatic control of water‐deliveries by integrating the factors which are known to provide heat for melting. A principal source of heat is that contained in an air‐mass moving over a snow‐area. Here heat is transferred to the snow‐surface through a continually renewed contact between snow and air occasioned by an active turbulence in the lower layers. Also, that portion of the Sun's heat‐energy which penetrates the atmospheric envelope contributes appreciable heat to melting processes. ©1941. American Geophysical Union.

This problem is complicated by the complex chemical and physical characteristics, both of the raw materials with which the refiner must work and of his finished products. This paper reviews the refiner's solution to this problem from the viewpoint of the transportation and maintenance engineer, and discusses the trends of the major characteristics of gasoline, namely, volatility, antiknock quality, sulfur content, gum content, and chemical composition. It suggests that the design of future engines will be in the direction of units of smaller size, having higher compression ratios, yielding higher power output and greater fuel economy, and requiring fuels of higher antiknock properties. It seems probable that, in the future, more emphasis will be placed on improving economy as well as on improving performance. It indicates that, although the trend has been toward more volatile fuels, apparently a leveling-off point has been reached. The importance of low gum content and good storage stability is stressed. Sulfur content is becoming less important so far as corrosion problems are concerned, and reduction in sulfur is now largely a question of the economics of producing high-octane fuels.

Although certain variations, observational or real, occur in these energy values with temperature, velocity extrapolations justified within reasonable limits lead to some valuable considerations. 1. Extrapolations to cold storage temperatures show the relatively enhanced importance of unorganized enzyme reactions compared to microbial action or non-enzymically catalyzed reactions. 2. Materials whose constituent ferments have high energies of activation will be aided most by storage at low temperatures. 3. The magnitude of the various changes that occur in a single product will not all be quantitatively altered in the same degree by lowering the temperature, as evidenced by the differences in fruits ripened at low and at ordinary temperatures. 4.

Dry matter consumption is affected by factors inherent in the animal and those inherent in the ration and environment. There is a wide variation in dry matter consumption of cows on the same roughage. The palatability of roughages is not a reliable criterion to use in estimating the amount which cows will consume. The trend toward the use of properly managed pasture, and hays and silage made from grasses and legumes cut at an earlier stage of maturity has resulted in an increase in roughage consumption per 100 pounds of body weight. Most cows will consume about three pounds of hay equivalent per 100 pounds of body weight which is a 50 per cent increase in roughage consumption over the old thumb rule for roughage feeding. The chemical composition has been shown to vary with the stage of maturity, soil conditions and climate. Young plants are characterized by their high protein content, low cellulose and lignin content and a high digestibility of their dry matter. The decreased digestibility of the dry matter with increasing maturity is believed to be associated in some way with lignification although the total amount of lignin does not appear to be the determining factor. The greater use of properly managed pasture before the coefficient of digestibility drops makes the use of this class of roughage profitable. The data indicate that highly digestible roughage exerts a productive energy value about equal to that of concentrates on the dry basis. The use of non-lignified grasses and legumes for winter feeding is very limited. This is due to the low yields and the difficulty encountered in the field curing of such roughages. Fertilization to increase the yield of roughage and its conservation in the silo after wilting make possible the use of highly nutritious roughage throughout the year. The nutritive value of hays cut at the usual stage of maturity depends upon the nutrients conserved during the curing process. As has been pointed out by several investigators, the loss of nutrients during the field curing of hay is rather high during good hay making weather but the loss of nutrients is very large during adverse curing weather. Better methods of conserving roughages are needed because poor hay making weather prevails in many dairy sections. The cost of artificial dehydration of hays appears somewhat high at the present time. Recent experiments indicate that grasses and legumes may be conserved economically in the silo with a loss of only about 10 per cent of the dry matter. In several experiments, however, the loss of dry matter in roughage conserved as silage was rather high. Most investigations indicate, however, that the addition of from one to three per cent of molasses is advisable in the making of grass and legume silage. Inorganic acids may also be used to preserve these crops in the silo but molasses has the additional advantage of preserving the crop and contributing to the nutrition of the animal. Of the inorganic acids, phosphoric acid appears to have a slight advantage in silage making. It is easy to apply and it may contribute to the phosphorus requirement of the animal and to the fertility of the soil. Several investigators have reported that grasses and legumes make excellent silage without any treatment providing the ensiled material has a moisture content of about 70 per cent and the trapped air is expelled by fine cutting. Many of the silage investigations, however, have been conducted either in small containers or in very large silos. In both cases the results may not represent the conditions in the average farm silo of about 50- to 100-ton capacity. In large silos the increased pressure may affect the moisture and carotene content of the silage as well as influence the capacity of the silo. There is very little difference in the dry matter capacity of the average silo for corn, grass or legume silage when the moisture and fineness of cut are about the same, but in large silos, more dry matter can be stored as grass or legume silage. Additional data is needed in regard to the conservation of grasses and legumes in the average farm silo. Roughage protein appears to be well-balanced from the standpoint of the essential amino acids necessary for growth and milk production. The possibility of protein synthesis in the rumen by the rumen flora has been indicated. Although grasses and legumes are probably very low in true fat, the results obtained with alfalfa alone suggest that when a liberal roughage program is followed there is little likelihood of encountering a fat deficiency. The possibility of a fat deficiency or of some factors closely associated with fat should, however, be considered. The conservation of soluble carbohydrates in roughage is of practical importance because unfavorable weather conditions result in their loss in hay making. They may be of importance in maintaining the health of cattle during the barn feeding period. Ketosis has been shown to occur in cows fed rations low in soluble carbohydrates. This is explained on the basis of the new theory of rumen digestion which postulates the conversion of foods which stagnate in the rumen to fatty acids by bacteria. The soluble carbohydrates have a greater chance of escaping bacterial action. Grasses and legumes are excellent sources of carotene when used as pasture but when used as hay, a large amount of the carotene is lost in field curing and during storage. The amount present in field cured hay is sufficient to meet the physiological needs of cattle for growth and reproduction when roughage is fed liberally. The conservation of carotene in roughages is of importance in the production of milk high in vitamin A. Several investigators have reported the preservation of large amounts of carotene in grass and legume silage by the use of either molasses or inorganic acids. The results obtained by the United States Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Dairy Industry, indicate that a preservative is not necessarily needed for the preservation of carotene in grass and legume silages. When green material is placed in the silo, the resultant silage is low in vitamin D inasmuch as this vitamin is formed in the cured plant material during solar radiation. The feeding of four or five pounds of sun-cured roughage per cow daily will meet the physiological needs of the animal for this vitamin during the winter months. Grasses appear to be good sources of vitamin E but whether or not cattle require this factor has not been ascertained. There is no evidence to indicate that the other vitamins in roughage are required in the ration of cattle. Roughages are usually good sources of calcium and cattle have been shown to utilize about 50 per cent of the calcium in the ration when the supply of this element is rather low. There appears to be very little likelihood of a calcium deficiency occurring among cattle when they are allowed plenty of roughage. Phosphorus is the mineral element which is most likely to be deficient in the ration of cattle when they are fed a heavy roughage ration because the phosphorus content of most roughage is low. The phosphorus content of roughage, under certain conditions, may be increased by phosphate fertilization but numerous instances have been recorded to show that the ordinary application of phosphate fertilizers to the soil did not influence the phosphorus content of the plant. The soil type and the moisture conditions are frequently the determining factors which influence the phosphorus content of the plant. In sections where the roughage is low in this element, the addition of a phosphorus supplement to the ration of milking cows is indicated. Roughages grown on soils containing iodine are good sources of this element but on those farms where “big neck” or goiter occur among newborn calves, an iodine supplement should be supplied. All of the other mineral elements required by cattle have been shown to be adequately supplied by roughage with the possible exception of a few localities where iron, copper or cobalt are needed as supplements. The high production of dairy cows on roughage alone as reported by several investigators is of great practical importance and also of scientific interest. In these studies cows fed alfalfa alone appeared to make exceedingly good use of the total digestible nutrients for maintenance and milk production. Kellner, Armsby and Fraps have discounted the digestible nutrients in roughage according to its crude fiber content in arriving at “starch values,” “net energy values,” and “productive energy values.” Apparently the low productive energy value of the digestible nutrients in the roughage studied by the many workers was due to some factor other than the crude fiber content. Alfalfa hay as the sole ration in several experiments, however, did not give results comparable to its total digestible nutrient content. In view of the variations in the productive energy values of alfalfa hay which has been reported in the literature, a grain supplement should probably be fed to cows in medium and high milk production. Rules have been suggested for feeding grain with roughage of good quality. The author wishes to express his appreciation to C. W. Duncan of the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station for reading and criticizing this paper. © 1939, American Dairy Science Association.

Assuming monomolecular reactions, a theory is derived which provides a means of predicting the amount of energy input to the arc necessary to produce a given vitamin D potency in the treated milk. For average milk samples the theory predicts that, if all the provitamin could be quantitatively converted to active vitamin D without subsequent destruction, a potency of the order of 2.0 I. U. per gram would be possible. In actual practice a potency of 1.65 I. U. can be achieved in the bubble-film type of irradiator under the operating conditions here studied. With increasing energy inputs, antirachitic potency increases to a maximum value at about 300 joules per gram and then falls off with irradiation doses in excess of this value. Samples receiving more than 300 joules lose potency on storage about in proportion to the excess radiant energy; those receiving less than 300 joules are stable with respect to vitamin content. This effect is in line with the theory. In the light of the theory, the experimental data show that, if any intermediate compound is formed in the conversion of provitamin to vitamin, the second half of the process (the conversion of the intermediate to vitamin) requires only relatively small amounts of radiant energy. © 1938, American Chemical Society.

It is pointed out that on account of the rather complicated relation that it bears to the flow of energy in an electric circuit serious difficulties are met in its measurement except in the simpler conditions of balanced voltages, in a polyphase circuit, and sinusoidal waves. Two procedures are outlined which though they are not premised on balanced voltages have frequency and wave form limitations. In the latter part of the paper, the relation of the quantity of energy that surges in an a-c circuit in which there is energy storage, to the average flow of energy is considered, and advantages of this conception as a basis for rates are indicated. Finally, it is pointed out that reactive volt-amperes is of the nature of a complementary quantity rather than a specific activity of the electric circuit which when suitably combined with power gives volt-amperes.

Two cells of characteristic structure, appearing at gastrulation one on either side in the mesoderm, contain this mitochondrial cloud. All functional germ cells seem to be lineal descendants of these two primordial germ cells. The cloud disappears during gonad formation, but reappears in oocytes of the next generation. Except during meiosis and fertilization the germ‐cell cycle is traceable from fertilized egg to sexual maturity. Details of meiosis and chromosome number were not ascertained. Capacity for producing germ cells in Sphaerium is traceable from a definite region in the egg to primordial germ cells through a localized cloud of mitochondria in the mature ovum and certain cells of cleavage stages. Mitochondria, therefore, serve as a Keimbahn determinant in the sense that they mark a region of oocyte cytoplasm destined for cytoplasm of primordial germ cells. They are not considered causal factors in production of germ cells, but are probably storage products persisting unused in the egg and in cleavage cells having lower metabolic rates. Disappearance of these mitochondria during gonad formation is explained by their dispersal among a number of cells and by their utilization in furnishing energy and material for production of new cells.

It is necessary that the ignition units give unfailing performance at top speed of the engine without sacrifice of long life of the units. Storage-battery ignition, with a generator as a source of energy, is used almost universally in this Country today, and is asserted to be the cheapest, simplest, easiest to service and most reliable system known for vehicles in which a storage battery is required for starting, lighting and other purposes. The electrical circuit used in the ignition system of automobiles today is almost identical with that designed for the 1912-model Cadillac, which was equipped with the Delco electrical engine-starter, except for refinements and greater reliability. Development has been carried on to adapt the system to the more exacting requirements imposed by the high-compression ratios and at the same time to improve its performance at top speed of the high-speed engine. Essential parts of the battery ignition-system are listed and the required mechanical and electrical properties of a system that will operate satisfactorily on present high-speed high-compression engines are described. The author discusses the exactions imposed on the distributor by engine torsional vibration, the need of an automatic spark-advance mechanism in the distributor, the peculiar conditions in some engines caused by non-homogeneous mixture surrounding the spark-plugs, the difficulties arising from shrinkage of materials used for coil tops, rotors, and distributor caps during their manufacture, the characteristics of the primary and secondary currents, the influence of the high-compression engine on design of the distributor cam and circuit-breaker lever, construction of the ignition coil and the advantage of the high-inductance coil, and other related matters. No attempt is made to predict the future trend in ignition, but belief is expressed that a device that will automatically advance the spark above full-throttle position when operating at low load with partly closed throttle would make possible a better carbureter-setting on part throttle and result in better fuel economy at car speeds between 15 and 50 m.p.h.",,"Automobile manufacture; Electric circuit breakers; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Fuel economy; Ignition systems; Secondary batteries; Spark plugs; Speed; Vibrations (mechanical); Automotive vehicle; Electrical circuit; Electrical engines; High compression ratio; Mechanical and electrical properties; Non-homogeneous mixture; Secondary currents; Torsional vibration; Starting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877536241

How the rate of transmission of this information over a system is limited by the distortion resulting from storage of energy is discussed from the transient viewpoint. The relation between the transient and steady state viewpoints is reviewed. It is shown that when the storage of energy is used to restrict the steady state transmission to a limited range of frequencies the amount of information that can be transmitted is proportional to the product of the width of the frequency‐range by the time it is available. Several illustrations of the application of this principle to practical systems are included. In the case of picture transmission and television the spacial variation of intensity is analyzed by a steady state method analogous to that commonly used for variations with time. © 1928 The Bell System Technical Journal",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980082105

E. Co., Lynn, Mass., United States","ALEXANDER, P., Thomson Research Laboratory, G. E. Co., Lynn, Mass., United States","The subject of this paper is a phenomenon of great interest and very great complexity. The electric arc is a tool of extreme power and flexibility. The electric arc can be used to melt the most refractory substances, cut the armor plates of battleships or weld together the ends of wires no thicker than a human hair. It is a wonderful tool that makes or breaks almost anything. It may unite the most indifferent elements such as nitrogen and oxygen, or break the molecule into its constituent atoms. In this paper we shall discuss only one type of application of the electric arc; namely, the application of the arc to the welding of metals, but even in these limits the field is very wide. The electric arc was discovered by H. Davy who in 1810 was experimenting with the sparking between two horizontally disposed carbon pencils. The density of the current was such that on short circuit the tips of the carbon pencils were heated to incandescence. When the electrodes were separated the electric current continued to flow across the air-gap between the carbon pencils. The air-gap was bridged by some sort of an extremely bright band which under action of the accending currents of hot air was bent upwards and formed a bow or an “arc.” This is the origin of the term, the “electric arc.” For many years the electric arc was used only as a source of light. It was only years later that the electric arc was applied for the purpose of melting and welding metals together. In 1881 de Meritens for the first time used a small carbon arc for melting and welding the lead terminals of storage batteries. The more extensive application of the carbon arc was done by Bernardos. This process was modified by Dr. Zerener of Berlin, Germany, who shortly prior to 1890 invented a process of welding with a flaming arc. In this process two carbon electrodes are disposed to form a “V”. The arc is drawn between the two electrodes and caused to impinge upon the metal to be welded by being forced down by a powerful electromagnet. This arrangement caused the arc to act in a similar manner to the flame of an oxyacetylene flame. The energy developed in this arc is only partly transmitted into the weld and the efficiency of the method is very low. The third type arc welding known now as a metallic arc process was discovered about 1890 by H. Slawianoff. This engineer conceived the idea of producing steel ingots by an electrical casting process. Metal was deposited from a steel rod into a mold, an electric arc being maintained between the rod and the metal of the mold. Means were provided whereby the metal rod could be fed forward as it was consumed and a solenoid arrangement was provided for maintaining the arc length substantially constant. The ingots obtained under such conditions proved to be sound and free from shrinkage pipes. However, the cost of electrical energy in Russia in those days was very high and the process was commercially uneconomical. The information obtained by Slawianoff in this work led to the application by him of the metallic arc to the uniting together of metal plates, the repairing of cracked and broken machines, etc. Thanks to the work of Slawianoff we now possess a method of welding with metallic electrodes which at present is by far the most used of all arc welding processes. © 1928, IEEE.

A physical picture of the action of a non-linear element in producing harmonics is built up, and it is shown that the flow of harmonic currents affects the measured impedance, at the fundamental frequency, of course, in two ways which are designated as the loading and reaction effects. The loading effect is that produced by the superposition of currents without any regard to the production of new frequencies, and the reaction effect, in accordance with energy conservation ideas, is that due to energy storage and dissipation at harmonic frequencies which appear as impedance reactions at the fundamental frequency. The physical picture set up in the above discussion appears to be capable of accounting for the experimental observations mentioned above in a qualitative way at least. In accordance with these ideas, it appears that even when the fundamental current is specified, there is no one definite value which can be assigned as the impedance of a variable element because of its dependence upon the circuit impedance-frequency characteristics. Several measuring methods are reviewed by which the impedance of the variable element may be determined under definite circuit conditions. The above discussion is confined to the effects existing with a sinusoidal applied electromotive force, for simplicity, but the results with complex waves applied are analogous, as indicated by reference to the energy conservation principle. © 1927 by the Amierican Institiute of Electrical Engineers",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84932449251

The current and voltage furnished to the tube by a high potential d.c. source were kept constant and were continuously measured by potentiometers. The heat energy given up to the oil by this ""high potential"" source was compared with that developed by the same quantity of ""low potential"" energy by taking alternate runs wherein the same potentiometers measured the current and voltage supplied from a storage battery to a heating coil immersed in the oil. The data proved with a probable error of about 0.2 percent, that, up to 25,000 volts, all of the energy input into a Coolidge tube is ultimately transformed into heat and that any sources or sinks of energy which may exist have a smaller effect than 0.2 percent. Ionization, photographic and pyrometric methods were used to test for the presence of radiations involving an absorption of energy at the cathode. No appreciable quantity of such energy could be detected. The results of these experiments indicate that all of the input energy must go into the energy of the moving electrons and their fields. It also follows that only a negligible portion of the current in a Coolidge tube is furnished by positive ions which actually reach the cathode, for otherwise the cathode would be heated. © 1926 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36149016268

After discussing the nature of gasoline, the author enumerates the five sources from which motor fuel is derived. The major part of the gasoline is said to be obtained directly by distillation from petroleum; about one-quarter of American gasoline, to be secured by the cracking of heavier petroleum oils; about one-tenth, to be gasoline that is separated from natural gas; from 1 to 2 per cent, to consist of benzol and similar material; and fuel used in some sugar-producing localities, to comprise alcohol made from molasses. Among the service problems arising from the use of gasoline is mentioned the presence, in some cracked distillates that have not been properly refined, of a brown varnish-like resin, the formation of which increases with the age of the liquid and the warmth of the place of storage. Another source of trouble is due to the fact that resinous material tends to collect dirt. If later a blended fuel containing benzol or alcohol is added, the resinous deposit is loosened or dissolved, releasing the dirt, which then collects and clogs screens and small openings. A gasoline engine manufactures considerable quantities of water. In cold weather, condensed water in the cylinders may form ice and freeze the pistons. Sulphur oxides produced by the combustion of the fuel dissolve readily in water, forming sulphuric acid, which has a corrosive effect on the polished surface of the cylinders and the bearing surfaces in the crankcase. The three remedies proposed are (a) prevention of condensation or the collection of liquid water in the engine, (b) removing the water after it has been formed and (c) using a fuel low in sulphur. Although most of the fuels in common use are blends of the materials obtained from the first three sources mentioned above and are generally satisfactory, means of accurately determining their characteristics are not usually available and the service man must use his best judgment in selecting them. If gasoline could be made to conform to a universal standard, so far as the volatility characteristics are concerned, the design, operation and servicing of automobiles would be greatly benefited.

When electricity was applied to starting the internal-combustion engine and to lighting the automobile 15 years later, the popularity of the automobile greatly increased. Now, 5 per cent of the weight and nearly 10 per cent of the selling price of a five-passenger sedan represent electrical apparatus that adds to the comfort and convenience of the public. Inasmuch as practically all transportation of passengers in cities and suburbs during this period has been carried on by electric street-railways, they have reached a high state of development and efficiency, and the experience of the companies with electric motors has established great confidence in their reliability and durability under all conditions of service. Realizing that new conditions have arisen, the public utility companies now look to the motorbus to act as a feeder to their lines and to relieve the pressure of traffic by utilizing boulevards and highways on which rails and trolley wires are not permitted. Beginning with a description of the first application of the electric drive to motorbuses in this Country in an experimental single-deck vehicle operating on Fifth Avenue, New York City, in 1904, the author follows the course of its progress up to the present time. In 1908, 10 electric-drive motorbuses were placed in operation and continued over that route for 6 years, together with similar DeDion coaches equipped with mechanical drive. In 1909, 25 additional mechanically driven motorbuses were ordered because they were available, whereas those of the electric-drive type, although they had proved successful, were not yet in regular production. Having been tried in motorbus service, the electric drive was then extended to railroad passenger cars; later, in connection with Diesel engines, it has been applied to ship propulsion, and, more recently to oil-burning locomotives. In England, out of more than 1300 electric-drive motorbuses built by the Tilling-Stevens organization, 460 were put into service in London by the London General Omnibus Co. and Thomas Tilling, Ltd. A modification of the electric-drive system in which all the electrical energy passes directly through the driving-motors has been recently devised by Prof. Morton Arendt, of Columbia University, and includes a storage-battery. Illustrations and wiring diagrams of this and of numerous other systems are shown, including the Yellow Coach motorbuses in use by the Philadelphia Rural Transit Co., of Philadelphia, the Fageol Motor Co. motorbuses used by the Capitol District Transportation Co., of Albany, N.

Under this theory as elaborated by Steinmetz, Wagner and others, insulation under stress is heated by the transformation of electric energy to thermal energy. Insulations are considered as of the nature of poor conductors and subject to the same characteristics. The transformation of electric to thermal emergy is therefore dependent upon the inherent electrical and thermal conducting properties of the material. This transformation proceeds at a rate proportional to the stress applied, until such a voltage value is reached where the heat is generated in the insulation at a rate faster than it is dissipated to the surrounding medium. Further increase in voltage leads to a rapidly mounting temperature with ultimate insulation failure. A strict interpretation of this theory would indicate that insulation failure is a matter of the insulation resistance—temperature relation. Therefore, as the heat stored in a dielectric during stress is allowed to dissipate, care being taken to prevent injury from the testing electrodes, etc, the orignial properties of the material should be restored. This has been found to be true only to a limited extent. The present paper deals largely with the effect of relatively high-voltage applications on sheet insulation tested between parallel plate electrodes. It is shown that the question of the mechanism of insulation failure can be separated into two parts. First, failure caused by short-time voltage applications as determined by rapidly applied tests, and secondly, failure of insulation under longer periods of stress as determined by the minute or endurance test methods. Peek has found that voltages greatly in excess of the “rapidly applied” 60-cycle puncture voltage may be applied to the insulation without rupture, if the time of application be sufficiently short. All such over voltages injure the insulation, “probably by a mechanical tearing and the effect is cumulative.” In these experiments of short duration, the problem of heat storage in the insulation is eliminated. Raynor has found that the rapidly applied strength of insulation is greatly lowered by the previous application of a high voltage. This decrease in strength, however, is lost, given sufficient rest period between the initial and final voltage application. These results are substantiated in the work of the present paper. The length of rest period is shown to be proportional to the initial test voltage applied. For tests of long duration, the work of this paper has been divided into two parts,—those voltages producing failure with an arbitarry time limit (15 minutes) and those voltages which are able to be applied for an indefinite time without a puncture. According to the pyro-electric theory, the first class deals with those voltages of such value as to produce a slowly mounting temperature rise in the insulation which ultimately reaches a value leading to rapidly decreasing insulation resistance and total loss of dielectric strength. The second class includes those voltages of such value that the rate of transformation of electric to thermal energy is equaled by the rate of dissipation of the heat so formed; thus preventing heat storage in the insulation. According to the thermal theory of breakdown, neither of these voltages should produce permanent injury to the dielectric,—the first, if removed before the stage indicating rapid loss of insulation resistance is reached, and the second, even if applied indefinitely. The present paper shows that the application of voltages of either of the above types leads to deterioration in dielectric strength of fibrous insulation, even aside from such effects that might be traced to corona or mechanical injury to the material. The effect for voltages of the first class is cumulative and expressed by the formula R × T = K where R = number of repetitions of voltages, T the time of each voltage application, and K the time needed to puncture for the same voltage continuously applied. The application of this formula to various insulations, its limitations, etc., are discussed. The work detailed herein concerns the application of a-c. voltages at room temperature. The investigation is being extended to cover both low and high a-c. and d-c. voltages at and above room temperatures. © 1925 by the AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84932431007

The intake, therefore, was close to the requirement. In the same experimental periods the total synthesized protein (milk protein plus positive or minus negative protein balances) was 0.85 to 0.90 of the amount of the crude protein available for increase (protein intake minus the maintenance requirement). It is recognized that this rate of efficiency of production of milk, in relation to the protein intake, applies less definitely to practice than to the conditions of these metabolism experiments. Reduction of the protein intake from the larger to the smaller amounts fed had the effect to reduce, the milk flow. Subsequent increase of protein intake caused a significant increase of milk production with the cow of more pronounced milk-giving tendency (no. 869), but no significant increase with the poorer cow (no. 884), while both cows responded to the increase of protein in the ration by considerable storage of nitrogen in the body. With a low protein intake the utilization of protein for milk production was more efficient than with an intake of protein sufficient to permit of more extensive use for fat and energy production. There is, with the cow, a prominent inclination to produce milk at an individual rate which is determined by inheritance. On account of the ability of the cow to deflect protein from energy production, and to withdraw protein from the tissues, and to use the same, in both cases, for milk production, the immediate effect of reduction of protein intake to reduce the production of milk is only partial in degree, the maximum effect being reached after a period which may extend to a number of weeks. The apparent digestibility of protein by the cow increases prominently with increase in the protein intake, this effect apparently being due to metabolic protein being more nearly a body constant than a variable related directly to the feed. © 1924, American Dairy Science Association.

This scheme is reliable and economical. It is handicapped by the fact that over a considerable range of load some of the auxiliary power must be taken from the main bus or some of the energy generated must be fed to the main bus. This resulted in transfer motor generators, etc., which were additional complications. Still greater economy is possible by bleeding steam from the low-pressure stages of the main unit to heat the feed water. Considerable heat that would otherwise be rejected with the condensing water is reclaimed, thereby allowing of a smaller condenser than would otherwise be required, the performance of the main turbine also being improved due to somewhat relieving the congestion of steam in the low-pressure stages. To utilize fully the advantages of stage bleeding, the auxiliary power must be obtained from the main turbine. In order to insure an uninterrupted supply of auxiliary power to the essential drives it is suggested that an auxiliary generator be connected to and driven by the main turbine, thereby supplying the necessary reliability as long as the main turbine is available for load. Due to the advantages of variable speed drive for circulating pumps, boiler feed pumps, etc., and the necessity of having direct current for excitation, a direct-current generator may be used to advantage. The use of the direct-connected auxiliary generator with stage heating, gives a maximum of flexibility, is especially reliable in that it entirely eliminates all small turbine and gear troubles, and permits of the use of the unit scheme of grouping and supplying auxiliaries, with what appears to be a maximum of economy at no apparent increase in cost. Furthermore, the use of closed heaters with the fresh water storage located within the condenser hot well seems to offer an economical and highly satisfactory solution for the de-aeration of the feed water and to eliminate the possibility of the water picking up further air after leaving the condenser. ©, 1924 by the American Institiute of Electrical Engineers",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933462586

Y., United States","Steinmetz, C.P., Chief Consulting Engineer, General Electric Co., Schenectady, N. Y., United States","Review of the Subject.—Conductivity determinations of insulating materials, and therefore the determinations of the leakage resistance of a cable, condenser or similar structure, have always been more or less unsatisfactory, due to a phenomenon often called “soaking in of the charges.” In general, if a constant direct voltage is impressed upon a circuit, in the first moment large transient currents flow, representing the energy storage and adjustment in the magnetic and dielectric fields of the circuit. These transient currents however vanish very quickly, usually in a very small fraction of a second, and all the currents in the circuit or circuits then become constant. If a constant direct voltage is impressed upon a cable or similar structure, large transient currents also flow momentarily; but after these currents of energy adjustment in the electromagnetic field of the system have vanished, usually after a small fraction of a second, the remaining current is not constant, as in the usual electric circuit, but continues to decrease slowly, for minutes or even hours. If then the cable is discharged by short-circuiting it, after the large initial transient discharge current has passed and the voltage on the cable has become zero—in a small fraction of a second—the current coming out of the cable does not entirely vanish, but a small discharge current continues to flow for many minutes or even hours. Or, if the cable has been discharged by short-circuiting it for a short time, until its terminal voltage has become zero, and the short circuit is taken off, a terminal voltage and an electrostatic charge gradually build up again at the cable, reach a maximum after some minutes, and then gradually decrease again. Various explanations have been proposed of this phenomenon as a hysteresis effect of the dielectric, etc. It is shown in the following, that this phenomenon of the “soaking in of the charges” or the “electrification of the cable” is a true electric circuit transient, has nothing to do with hysteresis effects, but is the result of, and explained by the energy adjustment of a system with constant values of resistance, inductance and capacity, that is, is in no essential different from the usual rapid starting or stopping transient of the ordinary circuit, except that it is many thousands of times slower. This great slowness is due to the fact that the resistance in the transient circuit is the leakage resistance of the cable dielectric, and therefore extremely high, measured not in ohms but in hundreds of megohms. If the dielectric of the cable consists of two or more materials, having different resistivities, or different specific capacities, or both, then the distribution of voltage through the dielectric gradually changes. At the moment of voltage application, the voltage distributes between the component dielectrics in proportion to their specific capacities; gradually however this voltage distribution changes to a distribution proportional to the resistivities of the component dielectrics, and electrostatic charges build up in the interior of the dielectric, at the boundaries between the component dielectrics. The electric quantity has to be conducted through the dielectric, and due to the very high resistivity of the dielectric, this energy readjustment within the dielectric occurs with extreme slowness, giving a transient of a duration of many minutes, but a true electric transient nevertheless, like the usual transients of a duration of milliseconds. In the discharge of the cable, the reverse occurs, and the internal charges gradually disappear by conduction through the dielectric. This phenomenon is discussed in its various aspects, and the equations of the slow transient derived, in the following : It is shown that this slow transient always is impulsive or exponential, and consists of (n—1) terms, if the insulation is composed of n materials. A number of conclusions are derived, some of which may be pertinent with regard to the mechanism of breakdown of insulation. By this slow transient, the energy stored in the cable as condenser increases. Its apparent capacity increases. The conduction current, and therefore the i2 r losses in the dielectric, are much larger with alternating than with direct voltage. The distribution of dielectric stress between the component dielectrics changes and this may give a different dielectric strength for alternating voltage—at which the initial condition of stress distributions is permanent—and for direct voltage. Also, a time lag of insulation breakdown may result, which is not a temperature or deterioration effect. Under certain conditions, there may occur a negative time lag, that is, a condition where the insulation stands higher voltages when slowly and continuously applied than when rapidly applied for a short time. ©, 1923 by the AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84932445428

Normal living is defined as “full activity of an unimpaired physiology, inclusive of the function of locomotion or mobility.” The author’s point of view may be gathered from selections from his conclusions. “If dependence has affected and sealed the fate of one great division of the Kingdom of Life, so that it is and must remain subsidiary to the larger purposes of nature, dependence also has entered upon, probably the major part of the other, the animal world.” “It is thus emphatically true in Nature’s program, that physical salvation is of the few, and is the reward only of righteous living.” “For dependent races of life, there has been no rescue or return.” The thesis seems to approach perilously close to a truism. If progress is defined in terms of mobility, it is hardly likely that specialization in a form of dependency which involves fixation will lead to progress. Dependency which does not involve loss of mobility is apparently not looked upon as unrighteous and is not discussed. The whole animal kingdom is, of course, dependent on the plant kingdom having an unimpaired physiology with respect to the synthesis of organic compounds which involve storage of energy. © 1922 Oxford University Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960585458

The definition of the word ignition should be broad enough to include the complete functioning of the ignition apparatus, beginning from the point where mechanical energy is absorbed to generate current and ending with the completion of the working stroke of the engine. The ignition system includes the mechanical drive to the magneto or generator and the task imposed on the system is by no means completed when a spark has passed over the gap of the spark-plug. Ignition means the complete burning of the charge of gas in the cylinder at top dead-center, at the time the working stroke of the piston commences. The means employed to accomplish this result is the ignition system. In the present-day type of gasoline engine a spark produced by high-voltage electricity is almost universally used for ignition. This high-voltage electricity is produced by a transformer. The transformer ""steps up"" the lower voltage produced from the source of current, which may be permanent magnets or a storage battery. Regardless of the source, the result must be efficient ignition if the maximum power output per gallon of fuel is to be obtained. The whole program of events in an internal-combustion engine cylinder is then considered as having been slowed down, to assist in grasping the idea of what takes place, and three specific ways to make the charge burn faster are stated.
