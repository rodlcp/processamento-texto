The rate-limiting process is the dissolution of hydrogen in the solvent. The following general rate equation is given: d[H2] dt = 1 2ks(a′'-a′) where ks is the rate constant for the absorption of hydrogen by the solvent and a′'-a′ represents a thermodynamic driving force which is determined by the equilibrium solubility of hydrogen in the solvent and the equilibrium absorption plateau pressure of the solid. The rate constant is defined as ks = As exp(- Es RT) where Es is the activation energy for dissolution of hydrogen in the solvent and is equal to 11.0 ± 1.1 kJ (mol H2)-1. The pre-exponential As is a function of the efficiency of the gas-liquid contact. The rate equation should have general utility and can be used with other hydrides suspended in n-undecane as long as the rate-limiting process is unchanged. A new method for the study of fast reactions involving the dissolution of hydrogen in liquids is discussed. The hydrogen absorption and desorption rates are well within the range required for practical applications. © 1984.",,"HYDROGEN - Absorption; HYDROGEN INORGANIC COMPOUNDS; HYDROGEN STORAGE MATERIALS; LANTHANUM NICKEL HYDRIDE; RECHARGEABLE METAL HYDRIDES; INTERMETALLICS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021754603

Kinetic and potential energy, lost at one stage of a stride, is stored temporarily as elastic strain energy and returned later in an elastic recoil. At high speeds, men and kangaroos seem to save in this way more than half the metabolic energy they would otherwise need for locomotion.It is shown by means of a generalized model that muscles and tendons could both be important as elastic energy stores. Analysis of films and force records of kangaroos hopping shows that strain energy stored while the feet are on the ground must be stored mainly distal to the knee. The principal muscles there have short fibres, and most of the storage must be in tendons. Investigation of camels shows that tendons in the feet, distal to the ankle and wrist, are especially important. The scope for elastic storage while the feet are off the groundis also considered.Though the evidence presented in this paper comes mainly from a few species, the conclusions presumably apply to large mammals in general. © 1984 by the American Society of Zoologists.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957209794

S. government have gone through enormous change. Early policy focused mainly on supply technologies and placed considerable emphasis on moving new technology into the marketplace. Subsequent policy provided much greater support for conservation and renewable technologies while continuing to emphasize fullscale demonstration projects. A host of regulatory and tax measures were enacted to overcome barriers to market entry. In recent years, the federal role has been reformulated. Under present policy, the private sector, with few exceptions, is to be relied upon for all demonstration and commercialization work, while federally-sponsored R and D is limited to: i) basic energy science and base-technology research, ii) energy R and D of a long-term, high-risk character, iii) research on the health, safety, and environmental aspects of energy technologies. In this paper we trace the evolution of federal R and D policy in three technology areas and outline a prescription for federal research support for the future.

This causes a temperature increase within the workpiece. The yield stress is a function of strain, strain rate and temperature. Hence, the thermomechanical behaviour of the material should be considered in the mathematical solutions. The finite element method (FEM) is hitherto used to achieve a coupled analysis of plastic deformation and heat transfer. In our paper, an alternative method is presented using the FEM for plastic deformation and the finite difference method (FDM) for calculating the heat transfer.

This requires short bursts of CPU support, but the average utilization is small. Advanced control functions, e. g. optimization, are implemented in some systems but except for a few industries, such advanced features typically use a small amount of the available resources. There are numerous functions that such systems can perform and at a little or no additional cost. In fact, the host computer attached to a distributed control system is a powerful tool to help manage the plant.

One probable setup for a SWSES is shown. In summertime, the solar power station (SES) provides the electrical needs of consumers and facilitates the irrigation (watering) of the agricultural land. At times of seasonal drought (lowering of the water level), the SES makes good the loss of electricity generated from the hydroelectric plant.

In an existing operating boilerhouse, it is also important to carefully analyze the space constraints and to develop a construction approach which will cause the least interference with the ongoing industrial processes and steam generation. When converting to wood fuel in an existing industrial plant setting, it is necessary to provide equipment and adequate storage for receiving, storing, and transferring the fuel, usually in areas already crowded and highly developed.",,"BOILER FIRING - Gas; BOILERS - Design; ENERGY RESOURCES; COMBUSTION TECHNOLOGY; DESIGN-CONCEPT APPROACH; FIRE WOOD; OIL/GAS-FIRED INDUSTRIAL BOILER; WOOD FUEL; WOOD",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021697709

To cope with the recent energy situation there is a growing demand to use these coals as new energy resources by improving their quality. In order to improve their quality, we have been developing a new drying process.

The efficiency also arises with increasing length of the acceleration system and magnitude of overvoltages across the commutator. Approximate analytic dependences are obtained to describe the acceleration process. The possibility of increasing efficiency through utilization of an inductive energy store based on a transformer circuit is considered.",,"ELECTRIC CONDUCTORS - Acceleration; ELECTRIC INDUCTORS; ENERGY STORAGE; MAGNETIC FIELD EFFECTS; SOLIDS - Acceleration; ENERGY CONVERSION EFFICIENCY; INDUCTIVE STORES; ELECTRODYNAMICS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021660314

The heat pumps's major advantage is its ability to heat and cool from one device. Therefore for such applications it will be at its most competitive. Calculations suggest that its payback periods, when compared with electric heating and separate cooling, could be less than two years. Compared with oil heating and electric cooling, payback periods would be longer but may often be acceptable. The major areas of the commercial sector which require simultaneous heating and storage area cooling are: pubs, licensed clubs, restaurants, hotels and butchers' shops. It is believed that demonstration would prove useful in such premises.

As a result, market change stimulated government legislation to improve energy conservation standards for new buildings. Commercial organizations reduced their dependence on sensitive fossil fuels and minimized their total energy demand and consumptions. The second oil crisis precipitated a panic switch from oil to gas for existing boiler systems. The demand for gas soon exceeded the supply. Thus began a period of rapid market change, which allowed the heat pump to penetrate markets hitherto the exclusive reserve of conventional boiler fuels. It also introduced a cost-effective means of integrating the newly available heat pumps into conventional heating systems. Both gas and electricity utilities being load factor dependent to varying degrees, recognized the heat pump as an economic substitution for oil in low temperature space and water heating applications.

The final conclusions indicate that short term active solar space heating is fundamentally uneconomic under current criteria. If a system is to be installed, however, then the results suggest that for the same performance, encapsulated phase change material stores can offer significant savings in volume at a similar cost compared with water stores. Alternatively, for stores of the same volume, and less than 1m**3 , the phase change store gives improved performance at a similar life cycle cost compared with a water store. Stratification in a water store is likely to give only a marginal improvement in performance and therefore only a small expense, if any, should be devoted to enhancing it.",,"BUILDINGS - Solar, Active; CONTROL SYSTEMS - Computer Applications; ECONOMICS - Analysis; HEATING - Solar; MATERIALS - Thermal Properties; MICROPROCESSOR CONTROL; PHASE CHANGE MATERIALS; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; WATER STORES; SOLAR ENERGY",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021653337

Thus, the energy reserve accumulated during the charging process is not adequately used. To remedy this, a combined heat store consisting of water- and sand-based stores is proposed. Is is established that versions of a combined heat store are most suitable for single-slope hothouses. Water is in a tank (140 multiplied by 15 multiplied by 50 cm) and sand on shelves (60 multiplied by 50 multiplied by 15). Each shelf consists of nine compartments filled with sand.

Consequently, it is often too expensive to carry out parametric design studies on such systems. A general technique for linearizing the non-linear element forces using equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients is based on energy dissipation and energy storage-release concepts. The approach is tested for both centrally preloaded squeeze film dampers and for squeeze film dampers without centralizing springs under a combination of unidirectional and unbalance loading. The results predicted by using such equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients agree quite well with those obtained from the full transient solution, even where the unidirectional load exceeds the dynamic load and the damper is operating at high eccentricity. An iterative procedure is proposed which should significantly reduce the computation time.",,"MACHINE VIBRATIONS - Absorption; MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - Linearization; DAMPING COEFFICIENT; ROTOR BEARING SYSTEMS; SQUEEZE FILM DAMPERS; STIFFNESS COEFFICIENT; SHOCK ABSORBERS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021629877

The development of the coal industry in India has undergone a revolutionary change. The rate of growth envisaged after nationalisation was unprecedented compared with most advanced countries of the world. Due mainly to economic considerations, most of the mines taken over from the pre-nationalization period had smaller production capacities (between 0. 1 and 0. 3 Mt/a), with manual handling of coal or small coal handling plants (CHPs). A higher volume of coal was needed to flow between the coal mines and these consuming points. Obviously, this changed situation could only be met with a much faster rate of handling, loading, and transportation. Such a changed situation also demanded a very high degree of planning from the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute Ltd. (CEMPDIL) to meet the challenge of future coal requirements of the country.

In this application, a naturally commutated DC link converter is to be used to provide bidirectional power transmission between an energy storage flywheel and the traction motors of a hybrid vehicle. In order to guard against commutation failure and to control the level of power transmitted, the link current must be adequately controlled. Digital computer simulation of the scheme shows that during flywheel regeneration, with the converter in the inverter mode, the link current is inherently unstable and must be stabilised by the compensating action of the controller. This paper describes a method for link current control by modulation of the thyristor firing angle of the flywheel machine converter.",,"COMPUTER SIMULATION; ELECTRIC CONVERTERS, POWER TYPE; ELECTRIC CONVERTERS, STATIC; ELECTRIC INVERTERS; COMPUTER SIMULATION OF FLYWHEEL SYSTEM; DC LINK CONVERTER; ELECTRIC VEHICLE; ENERGY STORAGE PROPULSION SYSTEMS; FLYWHEEL ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY; THYRISTOR FIRING ANGLE; ELECTRIC TRACTION",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021614741

The three main components of an ATES system are the heat source, the storage aquifer, and the heat sink. Subsystems include the supply and injection wells, pumps, heat exchangers, and piping. A typical duty cycle would be as follows: During a time of surplus heat, water is pumped from the supply well, heated in the heat exchanger using waste heat, and reinjected into the storage aquifer. It then remains stored for weeks or months until there is a net demand for heat. The hot water is then recovered from the aquifer, moved to the heat sink, e. g. , a district heating system, and finally returned to the supply zone of the storage aquifer. After the stored heat is exhausted, the system is ready for another injection-storage-recovery cycle.

The Carnot principle requires that the solar energy be collected at temperatures that are high relative to ambient, and this is usually accomplished by the use of concentrating collectors. The collected energy may or may not be stored depending upon the load requirements and economics. The more common types of solar heat engines use either the Rankine, the Sterling, or the Brayton cycle. This paper discusses the basic components that make up a typical solar thermal energy conversion system - concentrating collectors, thermal storage systems and heat engines.",,"SOLAR RADIATION - Concentrators; OPTICAL AND THERMAL LOSSES; POWER CYCLES; SOLAR FLUX; THERMAL STORAGE; SOLAR POWER PLANTS",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021586246

Historically, the standard method for determining the arc voltage needed for calculating losses is to subtract the stray internal inductance voltage drop from the measured terminal voltage. For the switches under investigation, neither the terminal voltage nor the time rate of change of arc current is sufficiently smooth to do the subtraction; therefore, it is infeasible to calculate the arc voltage with that method. The method presented is to use measured arc current and known circuit parameters to calculate the true arc voltage and the resultant switch loss. Knowledge of switch losses allows the generation of characteristic curves in parameter space. Such curves aid in the experimental studies of the switch opening in inductive energy storage environments.

The medium is initially stratified near the middle of the tank, and the tank wall is at a uniform temperature. Buoyancy driven flows develop first in the lower region, which rapidly diminishes while those in the upper region grow and finally extend to full length because of the heat loss from the wall.

The facility tests batteries developed under Department of Energy programs and from private industry. These include batteries intended for future electric vehicle (EV) propulsion, electric utility load leveling, and solar energy storage. The authors focus on the testing of EV batteries as this application is the most demanding and requires the most versatile test program. Of the spectrum of tests performed at the NBTL, one of the most useful is the mapping of the specific energy available from a battery as a function of the specific power level at which it is discharged. The resulting relationship is defined as a Ragone Plot. The Ragone plot clearly shows which batteries manifest the highest specific energies and which exhibit the most sensitivity to power demands. In addition, the plot can be used to project the expected ranges of an electric vehicle if the battery-power demands of the vehicle are known for the operating conditions of interest.",,"ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS - Load Management; ENERGY STORAGE; SOLAR ENERGY; STORAGE BATTERY VEHICLES; BATTERY PERFORMANCE; CYCLE LIFE; EXTENDED ABSTRACT; NATIONAL BATTERY TEST LABORATORY; POWER LEVEL; RAGONE PLOT; ELECTRIC BATTERIES",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021543890

Liquid hydrogen storage consists not only of cryogenic liquid hydrogen in its elemental form, but also various liquids in which the hydrogen is chemically bonded to non-hydrogen atoms. Examples are ammonia (NH//3) and various organic liquids that can be hydrogenated and dehydrogenated. 'Solid' hydrogen storage consists of metal hydrides, zeolites, cryoadsorbents, and other solids which have the capability of storing atomic or molecular hydrogen under appropriate conditions of temperature or pressure. All of these are reviewed briefly; however, metal hydride technology is emphasized because hydrides appear to be more highly developed and have already advanced into the commercial marketplace.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; HYDROGEN INORGANIC COMPOUNDS; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; LIQUID HYDROGEN; METAL HYDRIDES; HYDROGEN",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021541056

Therefore, end-costs of energy would greatly depend upon the transmission costs of the energetic vector. A possible alternative to electricity predicts the use of hydrogen as a medium for both storage and transportation of energy by a chemical closed-loop cycle based upon the catalytic reversible reaction Cyclohexane reversible reaction Benzene plus 3 H//2. This process, has very interesting characteristics because it allows the energy vector to be transferred in a liquid form at ambient temperature. In the present work a real example of application of the proposed system for transportation of secondary energy was considered. In particular, choosing a large hydroelectric source as a reference, a comparison was made between costs and efficiencies in transferring energy as hydrogen (in its different forms), over distances up to one thousand miles, with respect to transportation of this same energy as electricity.",,"ECONOMICS; ENERGY STORAGE; ENERGY UTILIZATION; CHEMICAL CLOSED-LOOP CYCLE; ENERGY TRANSMISSION; HYDROGEN TRANSMISSION; HYDROGEN",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021539070

The first plant (Plant 1) consists of a tank-type electrolyzer and a liquefier and runs all day at the base-load (or equivalent base-load) power rate.

Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598, United States","In the preceding paper bilayered Au/Ti resistors were found to have excellent electrical stability during storage at room temperature after preannealing at an elevated temperature, which is essential to design logic and memory circuits of Nb/Pb-alloy Josephson junction devices. The resistors could contact directly with the Pb-alloy control lines in which Pb and In atoms which are known to intermix easily with Au atoms are contained. Since Pb and In atoms in the control lines are separated from Au atoms of the resistors by thin Ti layers, thermal stability at the contacts is a major concern for use of the Au/Ti resistor material in the Josephson devices. In the present study, surface morphology change and diffusion mechanism at the resistor/control-line contacts were studied using x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy for square-shaped Au/Ti resistors covered by Pb-In layers. The samples were isothermally annealed at temperatures ranging from 353 to 423 K. The diffusion did not occur immediately after annealing at these temperatures. After the incubation period, the interdiffusion was observed to initiate at the edges of the resistors facing to the center of the cathode. Significant amounts of the In atoms in the Pb-In layers were observed to diffuse into the Au layers of the resistors, forming AuIn2 compounds under the Ti layers. By measuring growth rates of the AuIn2 layers, the diffusion coefficients and the activation energy for the layer growth were determined. Also, by analyzing changes in the In concentration in the Pb-In layers during annealing, interdiffusion coefficients of In atoms in the Pb-In layers were determined using a computer simulation technique. The activation energy was about 1.1 eV. Since these diffusion coefficients were found to be very close to those determined previously in bulk materials, the diffusion kinetics is believed to be controlled by the lattice diffusion. Based on the present results, several methods to reduce the interdiffusion between Pb-alloy and Au/Ti resistors were proposed.",,"GOLD AND ALLOYS; NIOBIUM LEAD ALLOYS; SUPERCONDUCTING DEVICES - Josephson Junctions; TITANIUM AND ALLOYS; BILAYERED GOLD/TITANIUM FILMS; RESISTORS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021513489

In order to predict the electrical stability of the Au/Ti resistors during storage at room temperature, changes in microstructure and electrical resistivity of Ti and Au/Ti films during isothermal annealing at temperatures ranging from 298-473 K were studied using transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and electrical measurements. Growth of Ti grains during annealing was observed in these films. The activation energy for the grain growth was determined to be 1.51 eV. Decreases in the sheet resistance measured at 4.2 K were observed at the early stages of isothermal annealing. By analyzing the annealing temperature dependence of rates of resistance changes, the activation energy of 1.49 eV was obtained. This energy value is very close to that obtained for the grain growth and, therefore, one of the main causes in the resistance decrease is believed to be due to the growth of Ti grains. Based on the present results, a model to predict the electrical resistance change for the Au/Ti films during storage at room temperature was established. The model predicted that change in the resistance can be significantly reduced by preannealing the resistors at an elevated temperature. The prediction was supported by the experiment and an excellent quantitative agreement between measured resistance values and those predicted by the model was obtained. Based on this model, the change was predicted to be -1.5% after about 3 years at room temperature, if the resistors were preannealed at 353 K for 10 h. This resistor stability is satisfactory for designing logic and memory circuits of Josephson devices, and it can be increased simply by preannealing for longer times at 353 K.",,"GOLD AND ALLOYS; NIOBIUM LEAD ALLOYS; SUPERCONDUCTING DEVICES - Josephson Junctions; TITANIUM AND ALLOYS; BILAYERED GOLD/TITANIUM FILMS; RESISTORS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021510567

The experiments employ coplanar samples made of memory-type material. The cell response under single square-pulse excitation is measured and the results are analyzed using techniques developed by Aamodt and Murphy. In general, under all bias conditions, analysis of our results indicates that the sample cools immediately after the switching event occurs. Under low ON-state power conditions, a large jump in microphone signal occurs at the switching transition. This is attributed to the current discharge driven by the large external circuit capacitance. There is a gradual reduction in the mirroring of the capacitive discharge as the ON-state power level is increased, suggesting that the discharge energy is used as a heat of transformation for melting formed (crystalline) regions, as well as for heating the conducting path. For a memory event to occur it is necessary that the ON-state power be large enough to promote crystallization of the filament yet be low enough to avoid melting the conducting filament at the end of the pulse. In order to model the microphone signal and the temperature of the sample during switching, the analysis of Aamodt and Murphy is modified to allow for changes in the thermal conductivities of the sample and substrate.

The photoacoustic signal in intact lichens was similar in its general characteristics to that obtained from intact leaves of higher plants (Poulet et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 724, 433-446, 1983). It included two components interpreted to be due to modulated heat and modulated oxygen evolution. The quantum yield of the oxygen evolution component was maximal in the red spectral region and exhibited the 'red drop' decrease at wavelengths larger than 680 nm, similar to observations in higher plants. In contrast to those however, there was a pronounced decrease in this yield in the region below about 600 nm, indicating that pigments absorbing at shorter wavelengths are inefficient energy transfer agents. Similar results were observed for the quantum yield spectrum of photochemical energy storage. Analysis of oxygen diffusion in the symbiont alga, from the modulation frequency dependence of the ratio of oxygen evolution to photothermal signal component is consistent with an average diffusion path of about 4 μm, compared to a smaller, 1 μm, average diffusion path obtained in green leaves. © 1984 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W.

Replacement of the sacrificial donor with waste material, for example sulphide8, offers a route for improving these systems and, here we describe efficient H 2 photogeneration from a system using aqueous ethanol, as available from low-grade fermentation, as donor.

The chloroplasts were also the primary location of synthesis of fatty acids from acetate and lysophosphatidic acid by glycerophosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15). Neutral lipid made up to 20% of the total glycerolipid in dark-grown heterotrophic cells, 10% in photoautotrophic cells (both 2 weeks after subculture) and less than 1% in leaf cells. The amount of neutral lipid in photoautotrophic cells was maximal 1 week after transfer and declined to less than half that value 4 weeks after transfer. Starch content, however, increased for up to 3 weeks after transfer in parallel with dry weight accumulation. The data suggest that in these cells neutral lipids may serve for temporary storage of fatty acids and glycerol for later membrane synthesis rather than for storage of energy, a function of neutral lipids in seeds. © 1984.","(Soybean cell culture); Glycerolipid; Lipid metabolism; Lipid storage; Neutral lipid; Photoautotrophism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005584067

The concept uses separate pyroelectric surfaces, either vidicons or self-scanning arrays, for each desired frame of data. The pyroelectric surface acts as analog storage of the image until such time as it can be digitized and read into data storage between laser pulses. Each pyro-electric surface is shuttered in sequence by Pockel’s cells, with adjustable shutter “on” times and frame-to-frame timing as short as 100 nanoseconds. This paper constitutes a continuation of the design detail of the shutter and optical system for the IR video camera. A delay in the procurement provided time to rework the shutter design previously reported.1 The revised design reduces the impractically high pulse currents by matching the high voltage pulse generator and line impedance to the Pockel’s cell’s impedance at the desired pulse rise time rather than the reverse, as in the original design. The optical design has been revised to incorporate a kinematic lens mount to facilitate the field replacement of the objective lenses necessitated by the two design applications. Both of these improvements should find application in similar high speed camera design problems. © 1984 SPIE.",,"CAMERAS - Shutters; INFRARED DEVICES; LASERS, CARBON DIOXIDE - Measurements; IR VIDEOGRAPHS; LASER PULSES; POCKEL'S CELLS; PYROELECTRIC SURFACES; SUBMICROSECOND SHUTTERS; VIDICONS; TELEVISION EQUIPMENT",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021696624

Rates of sucrose transfer across the tonoplast were even higher in vitro than in vivo indicating that the sucrose transport system had not suffered damage during isolation of the vacuoles. Sucrose transport is carrier-mediated as shown by substrate saturation of transport and sensitivity to a metabolic inhibitor and to competitive substrates. A number of sugars, in particular maltose and raffinose, decreased uptake of sucrose. Sorbitol was slowly taken up but had no effect on sucrose transport. The SH-reagent p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate inhibited sucrose uptake completely. The apparent Km of the carrier for sucrose uptake was 21 mM. Transport was neither influenced by ATP and pyrophosphate, with or without Mg2+ present, nor by protonophores and valinomycin (with K+ present). Apparently uptake was not energy dependent. Efflux experiments with preloaded vacuoles indicated that sucrose unloading from the isolated vavuoles is mediated by the same carrier which catalyses uptake. The vacuole of mesophyll cells appears to represent an intermediary storage compartment. Uptake of photosynthetic products into the vacuole during the light apparently minimizes osmotic swelling of the small cytosolic compartment of vacuolated leaf cells when photosynthetic productivity exceeds the capacity of the phloem for translocation of sugars. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.","Hordeum (sucrose transport, vacuole); Protoplast; Sucrose (partitioning and transport); Tonoplast; Vacuole",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000184288

Originally developed as an alternative to all-steel vessels, largely because of the difficulties associated with quality assurance and welding on the very thick plates required, PCPVs rapidly became the accepted norm. Their advantages were numerous, not only being more economical than the equivalent steel vessel, but also providing a large measure of radiation protection ('biological shielding') and with a more predictable failure mode, gradual rather than sudden. The applications of PCPVs go beyond the nuclear power industry, however. Energy storage schemes, using compressed gas or hot water storage media, and pressure vessels for coal conversion and hydrocracking processes, are some of the other potential uses for vessels of this nature.",,"CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION - Prestressing; PRESSURE VESSELS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021502474

We investigate the possible influence of the chromomagnetic vacuum fields on high energy hadron-hadron reactions. We suggest that high energy quarks traversing these fields will produce soft gluon and photon radiation analogous to synchrotron radiation from electrons and positrons in a storage ring. We argue that this radiation will lead to polarization phenomena for quarks in spin- and colorspace which in turn can explain the K-factor in the Drell-Yan reaction. We point out that jet production offers another way to study these polarization phenomena. We present then a calculation of the number of ""synchrotron"" photons which should be emitted in p-p collisions at high energies. Thus, we predict a sizable signal of prompt photons of nnergy less than a few hundred MeV with a characteristic frequency distribution. Observation of such photons would give strong support to our naive picture.

Once a compressed-air reservoir has been established, air is withdrawn for energy production during periods of peak demand for electric power, and reinjected during off-peak periods. In this way, excess energy produced during off-peak hours is stored for use during periods of peak demand. In order to plan a CAESA project, information is required, among other parameters, on the pressure fluctuations in the production-injection well as a function of the rate of production-injection and other pertinent reservoir parameters. During the preliminary phases of planning, it is important to obtain estimates of this information, quickly and at low cost. A simplified model is proposed here for this purpose. The model is based on the assumption that the air and the water domains are separated by an abrupt interface. Two simplified geometries are investigated: a one-dimensional vertical column with air injection and pumping at the top, and a partially penetrating well in the center of a cylindrical domain. For each case, the mathematical model was established and solved numerically. Several examples are given to demonstrate the application of the proposed model. © 1984.",,"AQUIFERS; HYDRODYNAMICS; PEAKING POWER; COMPRESSED AIR",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021640725

Generally, the largest portion of energy is dissipated under the conditions in which a polymer is undergoing its glass transition temperature.

Compared with values reported for Zn uptake in free-living algae and fungi, Peltigera had low affinities for Cd and low maximum uptake rates. Intra-, and to a lesser extent extracellular uptake rates were temperature dependent. When lichens were incubated concurrently with Cd and equimolar concentrations of a range of other cations, most were found to reduce both extra- and intracellular Cd uptake, implying that the Cd uptake systems had low specificities. Mg, though not a strong competitor for extracellular Cd uptake, inhibited intracellular Cd uptake to a similar extent to borderline elements, and it is postulated that intracellular Cd uptake occurs by a system which normally transports Mg. Although concurrently-supplied cations reduced Cd-induced inhibitions of photosynthesis, the reductions were not proportional to the effect of the cations on intracellular Cd uptake. This indicated that other cations affected the toxicity of Cd to photosynthesis by some means in addition to reducing Cd uptake. Intracellular Cd uptake was light-stimulated, suggesting that a close relationship existed between metal uptake and metabolism. The rate of intracellular Cd uptake in the dark was probably not directly linked to the supply of respirable reserves, as it was unaffected by prolonged storage in the dark, and was not increased by adding glucose. It is hypothesized that light-stimulated Cd uptake represents active entry into algal cells, but with uptake in the dark it is not clear which symbiont is involved, and whether energy is required. © 1984 Oxford University Press.","Cadmium uptake; Cation competition; Lichen; Light; Temperature","cadmium; lichen; nonhuman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021615210

Reasons for this 'inefficiency' in controls are suggested, and the implications for design of domestic heating systems are discussed.",,"APARTMENT HOUSES - Energy Storage; CONTROL EQUIPMENT; THERMOSTATS; 'ELECTRICAIRE'; HEATING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021457269

Catabolism of carbohydrates to pyruvate and lactate by glycolysis (anaerobic) produces ATP needed during exercise of high intensity and short duration but the energy release is incomplete. The first step in the release of the remaining energy is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA which is also formed from the oxidation of fatty acids particularly during sustained exercise. Acetyl-CoA is next oxidized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle producing the reduced forms of pyridine and flavin nucleotides. The hydrogens of the reduced nucleotides are transported in the form of electrons through the electron transport (respiratory) chain to molecular O2 to form H2O. The resulting free energy change is used to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. Enzymes of fatty acid oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiration are located inside mitochondria. Energy status of cells can be described by the relative concentrations of adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP and AMP) since the nucleotides act as allosteric modifiers of several key enzymes of energy metabolism. Energy is expended to synthesize and store fuel nutrients in utilizable forms (glycogen, triglycerides and proteins) and to maintain the storage forms in a dynamic steady state. The energy cost of such postprandial metabolic processes is defined as the ""thermic"" effect of food. Storage of dietary carbohydrates as adipose tissue triglycerides expends more energy than that of dietary fats. Overfeeding of certain individuals is known to burn more energy over and above that expected from the ""thermic"" effect and the process is referred to as ""luxus consumption.""(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,"adenosine triphosphate; creatine phosphate; enzyme; fatty acid; article; cell; citric acid cycle; energy metabolism; exercise; glycolysis; human; metabolism; mitochondrion; obesity; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative phosphorylation; Adenosine Triphosphate; Cells; Citric Acid Cycle; Energy Metabolism; Enzymes; Exertion; Fatty Acids; Glycolysis; Human; Mitochondria; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Phosphocreatine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021456655

The internal energy of the N2+ ions was selected by threshold photoelectron-photoion coincidence using pulsed synchrotron radiation from the ACO storage ring. The vibrational levels investigated were v″ = 0-4 for the X state, and v′ = 0-6 for the A state. The data for the A state were corrected for the fraction of ions which fluoresced to the X state prior to reaction with Ar. The N2+(X, v″ = 0) state was found to be much less reactive (by a factor ≥ 10) than the other X-state levels, at all three translational energies. The levels N2+(A, v′ ≥ 3) were found to react with cross-sections which depend strongly on the relative translational energy. The data are interpreted in terms of the interaction between vibronic curves as discussed by Bauer, Fisher and Gilmore. This model accounts well for the low reactivity of the N2+(X, 0) level.

This paper addresses some thermal/materials consequences due to such impingement. The LBL/Exxon/SSRL hybrid-wiggler beam line VI [1] now nearing operation will be able to provide up to ∼ 7 kW of total photon power at planned SPEAR operating conditions. The first masks are located at 6.5 m from the source and may receive a peak power density (transverse to the beam) exceeding 20 kW/cm2. Significantly, this heat transfer rate exceeds that radiated from the sun's surface (7 kW/cm2) and is comparable to that if welding torches. Clearly, cooling and configuration are of critical importance. Configurations for the first mask, the movable mask and the pivot mask on this beam line are presented together with considerations of thermal stress fatigue and of heat transfer by conduction to water-cooling circuits. Some preliminary information on the heating of crystals and mirrors is also presented. For the future, many additional intense wiggler/undulator beam lines are contemplated at several storage rings. The design of these beamlines would be enhanced by faster and more accurate computational techniques. LBL is developing a computer code which will be capable of giving photon power densities onto impinged surfaces for a wide range of source and beam line parameters. These include electron beam energy, current, emittance and orbit deviations; wiggler/undulator length, period and magnetic field; photon energy and angular distribution; reflection/absorption at intermediate impinged surfaces; defining apertures and focusing by mirrors. Three-dimensional computer programs for temperature, stress and strain have been available for some years, but ""user friendly"" versions are being sought.

These formulae are used for analysing the spectral and angular patterns of the radiation measured from a distance of 20 m from the undulator origin. The excellent quality of the undulator and the negligible influence on the pattern of the electron beam divergence are confirmed by the satisfactory agreement of the measured radiation field with the computer-generated one. © 1984 Società Italiana di Fisica.","42.55; Lasing processes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249185539

The rates of growth and solution of sodium sulfate decahydrate were found to be controlled by the rates of heat and mass transport between the crystal surface and the bulk solution. The rate of growth of anhydrous sodium sulfate was controlled by the rate of incorporation of ions into the crystal lattice at the crystal surface.

Specimens of clots were prepared by critical point drying and by embedding and sectioning; specimens of films were prepared by embedding and sectioning only. In the fine clots, network junctions appeared to be formed by fiber segments in which two or more protofibrils were gently twisted around each other for distances of the order of 200 nm and then diverged to give trifunctional branch points. This topology appeared to be preserved in the fine films. It is proposed that the strength of the junctions is primarily provided by the twisting topology, though reinforced by non-covalent bonding involving the B sites uncovered by thrombin. In coarse films, bundles of protofibrils, lying primarily in the film plane, had diameters of 40 to 200 nm and were gently twisted around each other to form thicker cables. Uniaxial stretching, up to 100%, of either fine or coarse film before fixing caused suprisingly extensive orientation of the protofibrils or bundles. However, random orientation was recovered if a stretched ligated film was allowed to retract to its original dimensions before fixing. In a stretched coarse film sectioned perpendicular to the stretch direction, fiber bundles could be seen in cross-section; these were roughly circular with scalloped edges. The changes with stretching and recovery are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms of deformation and elastic energy storage. © 1984.",,"fibrin; animal cell; animal experiment; blood and hemopoietic system; cattle; electron microscopy; nonhuman; priority journal; ultrastructure; Animal; Blood Coagulation; Cattle; Clot Retraction; Fibrin; Microscopy, Electron; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021590812

This preliminary study explores an alternative approach by trying to account for the energy fixed in photosynthesis in terms of expenditure, storage and loss. The energy budget so derived for Pocillopora eydouxi suggests that about 51% of the photosynthetically fixed energy is used in respiration, 0.9% in growth and 48% is unaccounted for and presumably lost from the colony. By partitioning the energy budget, it is found that 24% of the respiration and 11% of the energy retained in growth is attributable to the zooxanthellae.

Typically, the height ranges between 0.5 and 1 cm. Two methods of enlarging the exposure field, dealt with in this paper, are the application of plane scanning X-ray mirrors and the stimulation of electron beam oscillations in the ring. Due to the considerable decrease in reflectivity with decreasing wavelength and increasing mirror angle, the usable reflection angles are limited to the grazing-incidence region below 2° in the case of X-ray lithography. The pure SiO2-mirror (Zerodur) used in the experiments has reflectivities above 80% at up to 1.5°. For the wavelengths in question (-1 nm). The theoretical values of the absorbed energy in the resist, depending on the glacing angle, have been compared with experimental results. From this dependence, the velocity profile of the mirror movement for attaining a homogeneous exposure can be derived. The preliminary experiments concerning surface degradation due to cracked hydrocarbons indicate that this factor is not as severe as previously expected in the case of the soft X- rays used in lithography. The alternative method of enlarging the exposed area, by stimulating electron oscillations in the storage ring, has also been investigated. The initial results show a practically- homogeneous exposure area 3 cm in height. A simple improvement in the control electronics for the additional steering magnets, which is being made at the moment, will at least double this area. Then, the exposable step-and-repeat field will amount to 6 x 6 cm2 with this specific method, which does not require any special arrangements in the beam line. © 1984 SPIE.",,"ELECTRON BEAMS; INTEGRATED CIRCUIT MANUFACTURE; LITHOGRAPHY; ELECTRON BEAM WOBBLING; SCANNING X-RAY MIRRORS; STIMULATION OF ELECTRON OSCILLATIONS; STORAGE RING; X-RAY LITHOGRAPHY; ACCELERATORS, SYNCHROTRON",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021598889

The higher concentration provoked spontaneous rhythmic changes even without depolarization. Methylxanthines (5 mM caffeine, theophylline or pentylene-tetrazole) increased the threshold and the sensitivity. Electron microscopic observations of the dantrolene-treated spindles revealed numerous electron-dense deposits associated with the cytoplasmic membrane of the sensory terminals and with mitochondrial membranes. The deposits were found to contain K+ and Ca2+ by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. Electron-dense deposits containing Ca2+ were usually observed in the inner capsular space and in the mitochondria of the sensory terminals perfused by normal or high Ca2+ Ringer solutions. They were reduced in number following incubation with methylxanthines. The amplitudes of afferent spikes and the spindle potential were increased by methylxanthines in much the same way as by K+ channel blockers, suggesting that GK of the terminal membrane may be reduced by methylxanthines. We suggest that methylxanthines may modulate the terminal responses both as a K+ channel blocker and by enhancing the release of Ca2+ from a storage site, perhaps in the inner capsular space, whereas dantrolene has the opposite effect. © 1984.","caffeine; dantrolene; frog muscle spindle; GC dependent oscillation","caffeine; dantrolene; methylxanthine; pentetrazole; theophylline; animal experiment; electron microscopy; frog; hyperpolarization; muscle; muscle spindle; nerve ending; nervous system; nonhuman; peripheral nervous system; sensory nerve; Animal; Axons; Caffeine; Dantrolene; Evoked Potentials; Microscopy, Electron; Neuromuscular Junction; Pentylenetetrazole; Ranidae; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Theophylline; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021337205

The cubic spline coefficients for incoherent and coherent scattering cross sections for elements from sodium through cobalt are reported for energies from 1 to 150 keV, and when two interior knots (three regions) are used they yield accuracies better than those obtined by a single cubic polynomial. Specialized discontinuous cubic spline functions are used to fit X-ray photoelectric cross sections to allow accurate fitting across the absorption edge discontinuities for a wide range of energies with a very simple function. Cubic spline coefficients for photoelectric cross sections of all elements in the atomic number range from 11 to 27 and in the energy range from 1 to 150 keV are reported. The cubic spline representation provides a computationally faster method of using X-ray cross sections than polynomial interpolation from discrete data sets and requires much less computer storage. © 1984.",,"MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES - Curve Fitting; X-rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749140406

The model is a combination of parametric linear programming (used for month-by-month optimization) and dynamic programming (used for optimization over the 1-yr. operation period). The resulting operating policy is updated as new monthly inflow forecasts become available, thus incorporating the stochasticity of inflows. An iterative procedure is used to reduce the computation time and computer storage requirements. This efficiency allows the use of minicomputers which are less expensive than mainframe computers. The use of the model is illustrated for the Shasta reservoir (California Central Valley Project). © 1984.",,"HYDROLOGY; MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING; STATISTICAL METHODS; OPERATING POLICY; RESERVOIRS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021645147

The luminescence properties of all complexes are similar, exhibiting an emission maximum centered about 520 nm and an excitation peak at 405 nm. The lifetime of the luminescence is on the order of 5 ns. For all complexes a new absorption band appears as a shoulder extending out to 500 nm. For the EDTA complex there is a strong pH dependence of both the intensity of the absorption and the stoichiometry of the complex suggesting that at pH values substantially greater than pKa3 of EDTA (10.2) a 2:1 complex (2MV2+:⋯ EDTA4-) is formed. At pH values significantly less than pKa3 of EDTA a 1 : 1 complex is formed (MV2+⋯HEDTA3-). Photoexcitation of the complexes leads to the formation of reduced methyl viologen.

G9A 5H7, Canada","Photosynthetic activities of Anacystis nidulans can be detected by photoacoustic spectroscopy. Algae treated by a photosynthetic inhibitor are used to provide the signal from the photochemically inactive sample. The results of these measurements correspond well with the activities which can be monitored by conventional biochemical assays. Acoustic data from A. nidulans are used to obtain the action spectrum for photochemical energy storage. It is concluded that phycocyanin harvests light for both photoreactions but that chlorophyll a molecules convey most of their excitation energy to photoreaction I. As judged from the relationship between the modulation frequency and the acoustic signal intensity, at least 60% of the photons absorbed at 630 nm perform photochemical work and about half of the useful energy is stored as stable products. Although it cannot be separated from the purely thermal effect, the contribution of modulated oxygen evolution to the acoustic signal of algae is estimated to be relatively small. Due to structural peculiarities, the opposite situation predominates in low frequency measurements performed with leaves from Impatiens petersiana. © 1984.",,"chlorophyll; phycocyanin; article; Cyanobacterium; energy transfer; metabolism; methodology; oxidation reduction reaction; photochemistry; photosynthesis; spectroscopy; Chlorophyll; Cyanobacteria; Energy Transfer; Oxidation-Reduction; Photochemistry; Photosynthesis; Phycocyanin; Spectrum Analysis; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021380302

We measured the charging of the capacitor in one or several pulses; we also measured the rate of increase of the potential and the conversion efficiency at various numbers of pulses.

In situ growth rates of marked worms were negatively related to initial size. Short-term, summer growth rates (volmo-1) of small worms (&lt;80 ml) were greater than longer-term growth rates measured over several seasons (asesonal). Size-frequency distributions of worms sampled from two sites also suggested a seasonal growth pattern with relatively fast spring-summer growth and slower winter growth. However, larger worms sometimes lost volume during in situ growth experiments, and the loss was most pronounced during short-term, summer growth periods. It is suggested that energy used in burrow construction may have contributed to volume loss during short-term growth experiments. In contrast, longer-term, aseasonal growth rates were nearly always positive, and indicated that reproductive size (about 56 ml) could be reached within about 1.5 yr of recruitment, and a large size (about 158 ml) could be reached within about 6 yr. A seasonal pattern of spawning was observed during three consecutive years, as indicated by ripeness indices (storage organ dry weight ÷ body wall dry weight). At least two spawning episodes occurred annually: ripe gametes that accumulated in the storage organs during the summer and fall were spawned during the winter; gametes that accumulated during late winter and early spring were spawned during the spring or early summer. Worms were spawned-out by mid-summer. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000271636

It has been demonstrated that an 80% reduction in test cycle stabilization time is possible when compared with the water brake dynamometer that is commonly used in production engine testing. Hot testing is normally a bottleneck in engine assembly, and the number of test stands is a direct function of the length of the test cycle. The steady state cycle that is used for engine testing may be reduced by quickly stabilizing the speed/load settings. The cycle may be further reduced by shortening the duration of the steady state sampling condition when the speed/load setting is held more accurately (fewer samples are required).[1,2] The AC drive demonstrated a set point stabilization time of 4 seconds or less and speed control accuracy of 0.25%. The drive system evaluated is an AC adjustable speed drive with adjustable frequency static conversion. The drive will absorb power from the engine and deliver it to the AC power line through automatic regeneration as well as motor the engine as required. The transition from motoring to absorption is automatically controlled. Speed is regulated with the AC motor and torque is regulated with the engine via the throttle. Advantages of the AC drive; in addition to fast stablizaton time, include: energy savings due to regeneration, elimination of the need for a seperate starting system, ability to measure frictional torque, more accurate timing setting and prevention of green engine stall-out during rapid speed/load changes. Data in this paper include speed and torque control results with an eight-cylinder 5.0L and four-cylinder 1.6L and 2.3L engines in both steady state and transient operations. Comparisons are made with a water brake test system.

Auroras are a familiar result of geomagnetic activity, but the same solar-terrestrial interaction which drives the auroras induces currents in power lines, pipelines, and cables and can compromise geomagnetic survey expeditions and high-frequency radio communications and radars. Severe effects on spacecraft include electrical charging and increased satellite drag. Even homing pigeons and other migratory creatures that rely on the geomagnetic field as part of their intrinsic navigation systems can become disoriented and permanently lost during storms.

The alternatives investigated were space conditioning, and the generation of compressed air to power tools and other equipment which can be located at distant points from the wind turbine. Various methods of storage of the energy were considered since often the availability to power does not match the need for it. However, as time has permitted, the limitation of purchased wind hardware has been augmented by the company's own designs and the initial research has been conducted. Contrary to initial speculation, the economics of using wind energy economically without the use of the local grid is unattractive today due to the high costs of storage.

Potential location near local centres lowers transmission costs and line losses. Environmental impacts is less than that for coal fired cycling plant. The inherent benefits include those of all pumped storage (i.e. rapid load response, emergency capacity, improvement in efficiency as pumps improve, and capacity for voltage regulation). A UPHS plant would be powered by either a coal fired or nuclear baseload plant. The economic capacity of a UPHS plant would be in the range of 10000 to 3000 MW. This storage level is compatible with the load levelling requirements of a greater metropolitan area with population of 1 million or more.

The approach is illustrated and tested for both centrally preloaded squeeze film dampers and for squeeze film dampers without centralizing springs under a combination of unidirectional and unbalance loading. The results predicted by using such equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients agree quite well with those obtained from the full transient solution, even where the undirectional load exceeds the dynamic load and the damper is operating at high eccentricity. An interative procedure is proposed which, with the aid of such stiffness and damping coefficients, should significantly reduce the computation time presently needed to carry out parametric design studies on general multi degree of freedom systems incorporating non-linear elements such as squeeze film dampers.

The energy equation is reduced to a one dimensional model with the thermal diffusivity factor accounting for all temperature dependent fluid properties. A numerical solution was implemented and correlated with data obtained from an experimental apparatus, to determine an expression for the apparent diffusivity. It was found that the apparent diffusivity is a function of the temperature gradient and the mass flow rate.

Four large scale space heating applications offer particular economic potential, namely residential and commercial office complexes, greenhouses and mine ventilation air heating.

The two systems can operate separately or they can be used together in a hybrid system.

Consequently, it is often too expensive to carry out parametric design studies on such systems.

The approach is illustrated and tested for both centrally preloaded squeeze film dampers and for squeeze film dampers without centralizing springs under a combination of unidirectional and unbalance loading. The results predicted by using such equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients agree quite well with those obtained from the full transient solution, even where the unidirectional load exceeds the dynamic load and the damper is operating at high eccentricity. An iterative procedure is proposed which, with the aid of such stiffness and damping coefficients, should significantly reduce the computation time presently needed to carry out parametric design studies on general multi-degree of freedom systems incorporating non-linear elements such as squeeze film dampers.

PIO photochemically cleaves to give 2,5-diphenylpyrazine on photoirradiation in hexane solution without sensitizer and decomposes thermally to give benzonitrile. The photosensitivity for the polymerization of pentaerythritol trimethacrylate using the benzanthrone (BA)-PIO system as a combined initiator reached 0. 5 mj/cm2. The effective photosensitive composition for argon-ion laser with good storage stability is obtained from a suitable combination of merocyanine dyes having absorption wavelength up to 490 nm with polyhalomethyl compound or sulfonyl chloride as radical precursors. For example, argon-ion laser sensitometry for photopolymerizable composition including the 3,3'-carbonyl bis[7-dimethylaminocoumarin](BC)-TCT initiator system indicates that the minimum energy necessary for image formation is 0. 6 mj/cm2. A specific combination of 9-phenylacridine (9-PA) with certain heteroaromatic thiols such as MBIm gives high photosensitive composition in the polymerization of pentaerythritol tetraacrylate. Its photosensitivity is measured to be 0.3 mj/cm2, much higher than that obtained from the Michler's ketone/benzophenone combination. From the photochemical and spectroscopic investigations of sensitizer/radical precursor combinations, the sensitization of the photoinitiated polymerization is assumed to be initiated by radicals produced through electron transfer (in the case of PIO) or energy transfer (MBIm) from the sensitizers to the radical precursors. The sensitization process in the TCT-sensitizer systems appears to be more competitive and complex. © 1984, The Chemical Society of Japan.

Most hydraulic problems in pipe systems can be solved starting with one or more of the basic equations. For steady, incompressible one-dimensional flow, the continuity equation is simply obtained by equating the flow rate at any section to another section along the stream tube. By “steady flow,” it is implied that there is no variation in velocity at any point. As far as unsteady flow is concerned the continuity equation has an additional term, namely the change in storage between the sections. The momentum equation stems from Newton's basic law of motion and states that the change in momentum flux between two sections equals the sum of the forces on the fluid causing the change. The basic energy equation is derived by equating the work done on an element of fluid by gravitational and pressure forces to the change in kinetic energy. © 1984, Elsevier B.V.

Our previous paper on NMR spectra demonstrated the formation of a stable molecular cluster with restricted migration of acetic acid molecules and decreased monomeric acetic acid which produced a harsh stimulative taste. In the study here, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to examine aqueous acetic acid solutions (acetic acid conc. 0~59%) and aged vinegars. Ice and eutectic mixtures were formed by lowering their temperature by 10°C/min. At the melting point, the DSC thermogram showed two peaks (peak 1 and peak 2). Peak 1 occurred at the -25 to 0°C region and was concerned with the fusion heat of ice and dissolution of water into aqueous acetic acid solution. Peak 2 occurring at -25°C was concerned with the fusion heat of the eutectic mixture. The fusion heat of all eutectic mixtures formed from solutions of acetic acid concentration below the eutectic composition (59%) was greater compared with that of eutectic solid from eutectic liquid. The heat of fusion of eutectic mixtures formed from aged vinegars decreased in proportion to the length of storage, i. e. the eutectic mixture of aged vinegars melted under lower heat compared with new vinegars. These findings suggest a specific liquid state occurred in aged vinegars, i. e. formation of a stable molecular cluster which can be transferred to a eutectic solid by liberating less heat energy.

I. L Ascorbic acid was decomposed with both aqueous extracts of hoshi-nori and yaki-nori (toasted Iaver) as much as an enzyme free control at 37°C. II. A reducing velocity of ascorbic acid in hoshi-nori agreed with that in yaki-nori at each moisture condition (aw0,1-0.6) at 20°C. III. Hoshi-nori was stored at 10, 20, 30 (±0.5)°C under the conditions of aw~0 to 0.6 for 8 weeks. The destruction of ascorbic acid could be treated as a first order reaction. The ratio of the rate constants (k) every 10°C corresponded to 2 or 3 at each aw’s, Arrhenius plots (In k vs. T-1) gave essentially straight lines. Apparent activation energy for the destruction of ascorbic acid (Ea) was no change below a monolayer moisture content (nearly aw0.2) and 78 kJ/raol of Eaat aw0.6 was the same order as the case of the destruction in an enzyme free model system reported by Lee or Labuza. Therefore, we concluded from the experiments described above that ascorbic acid in hoshinori, possibly in yaki-nori, during storage was destroyed mainly by a chemical or non-enzymatic oxidation. © 1984, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

K value of fish muscle during the early stage of storage at a low temperature, where the freshness of fish is not affected by bacterial action, is nearly predicted by the following eauation. where k is the rate constant of IMP degradation, t is storage time, and K(t) is K value at t. The rate constant k obeys Arrhenius’s function: where E is activation energy (cal/mol), R is gas constant, T is absolute temperature, and A is constant (1/day).

Improved propulsion systems will be needed for launch vehicles, as well as orbit transfer vehicles (OTVs), to satisfy future military missions in space. Examination of current and advanced solid rocket propulsion technology Indicates that solid rocket motors can satisfy most of these missions for both launch vehicles and space propulsion. The need for instant readiness, launch on demand, long service life, a high degree of survivability, high reliability and long term space storage makes solid rocket propulsion systems most attractive for these missions. Many of these advance space missions require higher performance or some degree of controllability, i. e., throttling or stop/restart operation which are not available in current operational solid rocket motors. However, results from current development programs indicate the potential for large improvements in delivered performance with higher energy propellants, carbon and graphite composite case and nozzle materials and extendible exit cones. Energy management capability from solid rocket motors has been demonstrated using pulse aotora, variable area nozzles, and mass addition techniques.

The antimatter should be in the form of antiprotons since, unlike positrons or antielectrons, the antiproton does not convert into gamma rays upon annihilation, but instead two-thirds of the energy is emitted as charged particles (pions) whose kinetic energy can be converted into thrust by interaction with a magnetic field nozzle or a working fluid.

Reproductive strategies regulate reproductive effort. Reproductive modes and strategies have been selected in species history: more anciently and with more conservative characters the former; more recently and with some flexibility in response to environmental changes the latter. SemHparity is the expression of entire reproductive effort in a single event in the life cycle; iteroparity, in several events. In itero- parous species living in uniform, aseasonal environments, continuous reproduction can be also found. However, in fluctuating environments, seasonality concentrates reproduction only in the most favourable period of the year (seasonal reproduction). Several mechanisms (i.e. refractoriness) can block reproductive processes in unfavourable periods, avoiding energy waste. Different strategies such as male sperm storage, delayed fertilization, embryonic diapause, have been selected in seasonal breeders, optimizing reproductive effort. In all vertebrate classes, except birds (all oviparous), oviparity and viviparity may co-exist in a genus or a species. Viviparity has been attained many times independently in evolutionary history of vertebrates, as an adaptive response to particular environments (i.e. acquatic environment, cold climate, deserts). Egg retention and ovoviviparity (aplacental viviparity) are considered transitional to placental viviparity, internal fertilization, modifications in oviducal structures and secretions, evolution of a corpus luteuin secreting progesterone, are prerequisite for evolution to viviparity. dual survival to be combined in reproductive effort.

This nutrient-induced thermogenesis represents 6 to 8% of the energy infused when glucose is infused with insulin (glucose clamp technique) to healthy subjects. At physiological plasma insulin levels (i.e. below 200 μU/ml). glucose induced thermogenesis (GIT) was 6%, whereas at supraphysiologieai levels (i.e. > 400 μU/ml) GIT was 8% of the energy content of glucose infused. This thermogenic response to glucose infusion includes two components: An “obligatory thermogenesis” which accounts for the energy cost of storing the nutrient and a “facultative thermogenesis” which is mainly due to a stimulation of sympathetic activity. The thermogenic response to lipid infusion (Intralipid 20%) was 2 to 3% of the energy infused. The stimulation of energy expenditure following amino acid infusion has been studied less in healthy subjects; in depleted patients, the thermogenic response to amino acids has been evaluated to correspond to about 30 to 40% of the amino acid energy infused. In addition to the concept of the thermogenic response to nutrients, it is of interest to know the cost of nutrient storage; for glucose, it amounted to 12%, for lipid to 4% of the energy stored. It is concluded, that lipid induces a lower thermogenic response and has a smaller cost for storage than glucose. Thus, lipid infusion allows giving energy more efficiently to the patient than large amounts of glucose. In total parenteral nutrition, it is common practice to supply non-protein energy roughly equally between glucose and fat; this is more economical than the infusion of large amounts of glucose. © 1984 S.

The respiration rate is lower in the large seeds of Zea and Phaseolus (2.2 and 2.0 mgCO2·gDW-1·h-1) than in the small seeds of Triticum and Helianthus (3.1 and 4.2 mgCO2·gDW-1·h-1).

This high CO2 evolution is caused by the lag phase of growth at the beginning of germination, as indicated in the RGR course. The loss of mobilized storage substances caused by CO2 evolution amounts to 46% in Phaseolus and is less (av. 30%) in the other seeds.

Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry were applied to observe melting and crystallization behavior and to evaluate the thermal stability. Heating and cooling curve methods were also used. It has been revealed that urea has two serious drawbacks; one is a large supercooling tendency and the other is its low thermal stability. By forming a eutectic mixture with potassium chloride or ammonium chloride, the supercooling tendency is remarkably decreased and addition of sebacic acid is also effective for the purpose, but the low thermal stability is not improved by the addition of these compounds. Urea is thus unsuitable for latent heat-thermal energy storage because of its low thermal stability, though the latent heat and the material cost of urea are superior to those of polyethylene which is selected to be a promising material for latent heat-thermal energy storage in the same temperature range. © 1984.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7044242170

The stability of the first system is maintained by the use of an auxiliary oil heater in the concentrator collector loop, thus maintaining a steady energy input to the Rankine cycle. The steady output of the turbogenerator is interfaced with the public utility grid to match the required cooling load. The second system is similar to the first one but includes a thermal energy storage integrated to the collector loop. In the third system the public utility grid interface is eliminated and both the compressor of the vapor compression cooling cycle and the generator are directly coupled to the gear box. A cold storage is used as a capacitor to overcome the fluctuation of the cooling load. The control strategy of the first system is modified to be adopted to the other two systems. © 1984.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749138651

Construction is expected to be at ASWAN near the High Dam artificial pool in the extreme south of Egypt (23.97°N). Twenty-two different conceptual designs using Photovoltaics are investigated with the aid of computer models. Flat-plate SAPV systems using silicon or GaAs solar cells accompanied either by a battery of flywheel storage method are some of these conceptual designs. Concentrating the sunlight with different types of concentrators using Solar Cell Array (SCA) of compatible silicon and GaAs types, accompanied by the above-mentioned types of storage are some of the other designs. In addition, a comparison between the global optimum SCA size and the largest subglobal SCA size designs is carried out. From this study, it is concluded that the flat-plate silicon solar cells, tilted toward the equator by site latitude angle, with a storage battery of the sodium-sulfur type represented was in general, the best techno-economical design (0·1727 U.S. $ kWh-1). It is followed by the integrated photovoltaic/thermal system with a concentrator using Ga1-xAlxAs/GaAs solar cells accompanied by a storage battery of the above mentioned type (0·1860 U.S. $ kWh-1.

A subjective evaluation of the status of some of these key electrochemical reactions is undertaken in relation to the materials problems involved; an outline of the recent progress is given together with the current focus and future possibilities. An elementary examination of the fundamental aspects of some of these reactions, e.g., the electrocatalysis of the hydrogen and the oxygen reaction is carried out in a manner which emphasizes their salient features both in the configuration of a power source, (i.e., fuel cell) and that of the complementary power sink (i.e., electrolyzer). It is observed that considerable progress has been made in the electrocatalysis of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with the discovery of the so-called BP electrocatalysts by Brown et al. recently. The earlier DSA catalysts for the chlorine evolution reaction are also clearly a milestone. Much progress has also been made in the commercialization of phosphoric acid fuel cells for utilities, in the exploratory materials work on photoelectrochemical cells, and in understanding the fundamental constraints and the materials problems of several storage batteries. Future progress is urgently needed in the nearly intractable problem of the stable and active non-noble metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. The promise of much future activity and perhaps some breakthroughs are clearly indicated in the following areas: photoelectrochemical cells - both for photoelectrolyses, and, the electrochemical photovoltaics; commercialization of Li-SOCl2 primary batteries and related systems; optimization and commercial availability of some of the currently researched batteries for vehicular and load-levelling applications; development of the entire area of conducting polymer electrodes and ionic polymeric electrolytes; chemically modified (derivitized) electrode surfaces; and the development of concepts treating living beings as electrochemical power sources. © 1984.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749136770

This roof was a spectrally discriminating filter that transmitted 50-60% of photosynthetically-active radiation and 0-13% of nonactive radiation. During 5 periods of 1-4 days from September, 1979, to July, 1980, data were collected on environmental conditions: solar irradiance, air temperature and humidity, and windspeed; and on greenhouse conditions: temperature and humidity of the air, temperature of the crop, the roof, the fluid storage tank and at four depths in the soil, and net radiation both above the greenhouse and above the crop in the greenhouse. The environmental conditions were used as boundary value inputs in a deterministic, mechanistic, and dynamic simulation model of the greenhouse system. To test the model, its outputs were compared to the corresponding measured values. The model simulated the various temperatures to within 2-3°C and the net radiation to within 20-30 W m-2. For one of the five tests, the humidity was simulated almost exactly, but the reliability of the humidity data in the other tests was inadequate. The greenhouse tanks stored energy equivalent to 32% of the daily total of solar radiation. Among the 12 test days, this ratio ranged from 23 to 43%. This contrasts with a figure of 15% for energy storage by a conventional greenhouse, which we have found by simulation of the test structure with an empty roof. © 1984.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48549114914

The ions from the ionization region are first retarded in an electric field, then sucked out by rapid field switching and finally ejected by a high voltage, up to 400 V, with a voltage rise time of 20-30 ns. The field switching is accomplished using power MOS transistors, and the pulsing repetition rate may be higher than 100 kHz. The resolving power is m/Δm = 50-100 at 50% peak height in the investigated mass range up to M = 60 for a total flight length of 300 mm outside the mirror: this is in good agreement with a theoretical analysis. The ion energy normally used in the flight region is around 200 eV and a typical total flight time is 15 μs at M = 28.

The transmission of phonons through the EHL cloud is observed as the probe pulses are scanned in two dimensions. In contrast to previous phonon-absorption work, the scattering of the fast transverse-acoustic phonons (q110) is found to be quite strong. For cw clouds 2 mm in diameter, 35 of the probe phonons were scattered or absorbed. For the clouds excited by a high-energy Q-switched pulse, up to 60 of the phonon beam was attenuated. This is nearly all of the phonons which can satisfy energy and momentum conservation, indicating that the pulsed cloud has a much larger filling factor than that of a cw cloud. Interpretation of the large absorption requires the inclusion of hole-phonon scattering, which has not been previously considered. Time-resolved phonon-absorption images show that during the laser pulse the liquid expands at near-sonic velocity. After the pulse, electron-hole droplets are driven for millimeters by the action of a phonon wind, consistent with the results of recent luminescence studies. There is no evidence in the absorption profiles of a large, long-lived source of phonons (Hensel-Dynes hot spot). Additional time- and space-resolved heat-pulse experiments indicate that the long tail (=5-10 sec) in the heat-pulse signal is not due to localized storage of phonons. Instead it is ascribed to elastic and inelastic scattering of the phonons within the bulk of the sample. © 1984 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35949023951

We concern ourselves in this paper (paper I) with the position of the CERN accelerators in world high-energy physics relative to those at other large laboratories working in the field. We deal primarily with the period from 1969 to 1978, and attempt to establish how the experimental output from the three principal CERN accelerators, taken as a whole, compares with that from other major facilities. In undertaking this comparative evaluation, we draw on the method of ""converging partial indicators"" used in previous studies of three Big Science specialities. In contrast, the second paper (paper II Irvine amd Martin [12]) focuses in detail on the scientific performance of each of the CERN accelerators taken individually. In particular, it asks, first, how the outputs from the CERN 28 GeV (giga or billion electron-volts) Proton Synchrotron compare with those from a very similar 33 GeV American accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory over the past two decades. Second, how great have been the experimental achievements of the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings in world terms? And, third, how do the outputs from the CERN 400 GeV Super Proton Synchrotron and from a rival US machine at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory compare? Attempts are then made to identify the main factors responsible for determining the relative scientific performance of each CERN machine. These factors are of relevance to the subject of a third paper (paper III - Martin and Irvine [20]) which sets out to assess the future prospects for CERN and in particular for LEP, the large electron positron collider scheduled for completion in the latter half of the 1980s. What are the construction requirements (financial and technical) associated with LEP, and how easily will they he met? How does the scientific potential of LEP compare with that of other major accelerators under construction around the world? And, in the light of the previous record of the CERN accelerators, to what extent is this potential likely to be realized? The paper concludes with a discussion of the extent to which predictive techniques can be utilized in the formulation of scientific priorities, and of the problems in current science policy-making that such techniques might help address. © 1984.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547453422

We concerned ourselves in a previous paper (Paper 1 - Martin and Irvine [51] with the position of the CERN accelerators in world high-energy physics relative to those at other large laboratories working in the field. We dealt primarily with the period from 1969 to 1978, and attempted to establish how the experimental output from the three principal CERN accelerators, taken as a whole, compared with that from other major facilities. In undertaking this comparative evaluation, we drew on the method of ""converging partial indicators"" used in previous studies of three Big Science specialties. In contrast, this paper (Paper II) focuses in detail on the scientific performance of each of the CERN accelerators taken individually. In particular, it asks, first, how the outputs from the CERN 28 GeV (giga or billion electron-volts) Proton Synchrotron compare with those from a very similar 33 GeV American accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory over the past two decades? Second, how great have been the experimental achievements of the Intersecting Storage Rings in world terms? And, third, how do the outputs from the CERN 400 GeV Super Proton Synchrotron and from a rival American machine at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory compare? Attempts are then made to identify the main factors responsible for determining the relative scientific performance of each CERN machine. These factors are of relevance to the subject of a third paper (Paper III - Martin and Irvine [52]) which sets out to assess the future prospects for CERN and in particular for LEP, the large electron-positron collider scheduled for completion in the latter part of the 1980s. What are the construction requirements (financial and technical) associated with LEP, and how easily will they be met? How does the scientific potential of LEP compare with that of other major accelerators under construction around the world? And, in the light of the previous record of the CERN accelerators, to what extent is this potential likely to be realized?

We concerned ourselves in the first paper (Paper I-Martin and Irvine [29]) with the position of the CERN accelerators in world high-energy physics relative to those at other large laboratories working in the field. We dealt primarily with the period from 1969 to 1978, and attempted to establish how the experimental output from the three principal CERN accelerators, taken as a whole, compared with that from other major facilities. In undertaking this comparative evaluation, we drew on the method of ""converging partial indicators"" used in previous studies of three Big Science specialties. In contrast, the second paper (Paper II - Irvine and Martin [24]) focused in detail on the scientific performance of each of the CERN accelerators taken individually. In particular, it asked, first, how the outputs from the CERN 28 GeV (giga or billion electron-volts) Proton Synchrotron compare with those from a very similar 33 GeV American accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory over the past two decades. Second, how great have been the experimental achievements of the Intersecting Storage Rings in world terms? And, third, how do the outputs from the CERN 400 GeV Super Proton Synchrotron and from a rival US machine at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory compare? Attempts were then made to identify the main factors responsible for determining the relative scientific performance of each CERN machine. These factors are of relevance to the subject of this third paper (Paper III), which sets out to assess the future prospects for CERN and in particular for LEP, the large electron-positron collider scheduled for completion in the latter part of 1988. What are the construction requirements (financial and technical) associated with LEP, and how easily will they be met? How does the scientific potential of LEP compare with that of other major accelerators under construction or planned around the world? In the light of the previous record of the CERN accelerators, to what extent is this scientific potential likely to be realized? What spin-off is there likely to be from LEP to accelerator physics in general? Finally, how ""flexible"" is LEP -in other words, what is its potential for future development? The paper concludes with a discussion of the extent to which predictive techniques can be utilized in the formulation of scientific priorities, and of the problems in current science policy-making that such techniques might help address. © 1984.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347873889

In particular, the effects of recent innovations in operational research, computer technology and microelectronics on the energy efficiency, product quality and process economics are assessed. The review concentrates on grain drying, grain storage, hay drying and biomass energy. The sharp increase in energy prices during the 1970s and the requirement for improved product quality have stimulated innovations in grain drying. Significant developments have occurred in high-temperature drying (concurrent-flow and in-bin-counterflow drying) and in lowtemperature drying (solar and chemical-assisted drying). Computer modelling has become a major tool in designing driers. Controlled atmosphere storage is making a revival as a non-chemical grain preservation technique. High nitrogen and high CO2 content systems appear to be economical. Refrigerated aeration also has promise as an alternative method for grain preservation in warm climates. In some parts of the world (e.g. the U.S.A.) hay is becoming of increasing importance as an animal feed. One-day hay harvesting is close to reality through the development of new mechanical and chemical conditioners. Biomass energy has promise as a fossil fuel replacement. The technical feasibility of biomass furnaces has been proven, the economic feasibility remains in question. © 1985 British Society for Research in Agricultural Engineering.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347484734

Oxygenated buffer was circulated through the NMR tube in all three instances. Essentially no differences were observed in the levels of the major metabolites: ATP, NAD(H), UDPG, cytoplasmic Pi, and sugar phosphates. Furthermore, the saturation of ATP by Mg2+, the energy status as determined from the ADP/ATP ratio, as well as the intracellular cytoplasmic and vacuolar pH, were not affected by the entrapment in the polymers. Since the cytoplasmic pH for freely suspended cells drops about 0.5 pH units upon shifting from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, these results indicate that the majority of the entrapped cells are properly oxygenated and that products such as CO2 can diffuse away. In addition, we found that the uptake rate of Pifrom the medium was lower in the polymer entrapped cells, and that the utilization rate of Pi from the vacuolar pool was also considerably reduced. However, the same pattern of Pi uptake, storage and utilization was observed in all cases. Thus, all the results obtained with the noninvasive 31P NMR technique suggest that the entrapment in agarose or alginate does not adversely affect cell metabolism since the phosphate metabolism and the cytoplasmic pH appear unaltered. © 1984.","31P NMR; agarose; alginate; Cataranthus roseus; cytoplasmic pH; immobilization; phosphate metabolism; vacuolar pH",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345428974

Storage volume and launch weight of water, oxygen and food in a conventional non-regenerable life support system are directly proportional to the crew size and the length of the mission. In view of spacecraft payload limitations this will require that the carbon, or food, recycling loop, the third and final part in the life support system, be closed to further reduce logistics cost. This will be practical only if advanced life support systems can be developed in which metabolic waste products are regenerated and food is produced. Biological Life Support Systems (BLSS) satisfy the space station environmental control functions and close the food cycle. A Biological Life Support System has to be a balanced ecological system, biotechnical in nature and consisting of some combination of human beings, animals, plants and microorganisms integrated with mechanical and physico-chemical hardware. Numerous scientific space experiments have been delineated in recent years, the results of which are applicable to the support of BLSS concepts. Furthermore ecological life support systems have become subject to intensified studies and experiments both in the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. The Japanese have also conducted detailed preliminary studies.

These studies have provided important information about the roles of central command and reflexes from skeletal muscle afferents in circulatory control. Few animal models of neuromuscular diseases are available. Studies of patients with specific defects in skeletal muscle energy metabolism are particularly valuable because the local metabolic state participates in both systemic and local cardiovascular regulation. In patients with certain muscle metabolic defects (e.g., McArdle’s disease, carnitine deficiency) cardiac output is normal at rest but increases excessively in relation to oxygen uptake during exercise. The excessive increase in cardiac output during exercise can be totally or partially normalized by increasing the availability of substrate to exercising muscle. These studies provide unique insights into the specific metabolic factors which are involved in cardiovascular regulation. © 1984 The American College of Sports Medicine.","Blood pressure; Cardiac output; Glycogen storage diseases; Heart rate; Inborn errors of energy metabolism; Neuromuscular diseases; Regional blood flow","Afferent Pathways; Cardiac Output; Energy Metabolism; Exertion; Glycogen Storage Disease Type V; Heart; Human; Muscles; Neuromuscular Diseases; Oxygen Consumption; Sensation; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021749775

Potential enzyme cytochemical markers for the ER included glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and nucleoside diphosphatase (NDPase) activities. Presumptive glycogen particles were identified in tissue postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide - 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide or in ultrathin sections poststained with periodic acid-thiocarbohydrazide - silver proteinate. The ER appeared to be related structurally and cytochemically to the nuclear envelope and cis Golgi saccules. Similar relationships between the ER and the trans Golgi saccules or GERL were not observed. In anterior pituitary glands from control mice, G6Pase activity was prominent within the lumen of the ER, nuclear envelope, and cis Golgi saccules of all cells; reaction product was absent in the trans Golgi saccules and in GERL G6Pase activity was sparse to non-existent in anterior pituitary cells from fasted mice. The cytochemical reaction utilizing the Gomori lead capture method indicated that G6Pase in anterior pituitary cells may function as a phosphodydrolase for converting glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. Cytochemical localization of NDPase activity was not evident in the ER; reaction product was localized consistently in one or two trans Golgi saccules and occasionally in GERL and nascent secretory granules. Presumptive glycogen particles in each of the different secretory cell types from control mice appeared as 20-30 nm wide, electron-dense particles scattered as single entities throughout the cytoplasm. Anterior pituitary glands from fasted mice exhibited conspicuous and numerous clumps of glycogen particles in addition to scattered particles in all cell types except corticotrophs, which appeared to be devoid of glycogen. Glycogen particles were absent in anterior pituitary cells incubated in a medium containing diastase. Our results suggest that in anterior pituitary cells of the mouse: 1) the phosphohydrolytic activity of G6Pase is a reliable cytochemical marker for the ER; 2) the ER is associated morphologically and cytochemically with the cis face but not with the trans face of the Golgi apparatus or with GERL; 3) some glucose-6-phosphate, a possible substrate for G6Pase in vivo, may be derived indirectly from glycogen stores; and 4) modulations in G6Pase activity and glycogen storage during fasting may reflect an alteration in energy metabolism.",,"glucose 6 phosphatase; glycogen; nucleoside diphosphatase; animal cell; cytochemistry; cytology; electron microscopy; endocrine system; endoplasmic reticulum; hypophysis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021749028

Dispersions in polyvinylpyrrolidone were prepared by slow evaporation of solvent (type A) and by fast evaporation of solvent (type B). These dispersions were stored at 25°C for 30 d. Plots of time required for 50% (t50%) and 70% (t70%) of the hydrocortisone dispersion to dissolve (beaker method) versus time were obtained. Hydrocortisone‐polyethylene glycol showed no apparent significant change in either dissolution rate, X‐ray spectra, or scanning electron micrographs. Type A dispersions showed an increase in dissolution rate up to 8 d. Type B dispersions showed an initial decrease followed by an increase in dissolution rate. The initial decrease in dissolution rate of type B dispersions is due to hydrocortisone crystallizing out of the polyvinylpyrrolidone matrix. The increased dissolution for both types of polyvinylpyrrolidone dispersions was not expected and is explained by an increased proportion of the high‐energy amorphous component, based on X‐ray spectra.

Therefore additional roles for palmitic and oleic acids during this earily period of growth and development were investigated in the cultured neonatal-rat heart cell model system. Our results indicate significant differences in non-esterified-fatty-acid metabolism exist in this system in comparison with the adult rat or embryonic chick heart. Initial rates of depletion of palmitate and oleate from serum-free growth medium by heart cells obtained from 2-day-old rats and maintained in culture for 10 or 11 days were 111 ± 2 and 115 ± 3 pmol/min per mg of protein respectively. In serum-containing medium, the initial depletion rates were 103 ± 3 and 122 ± 4 pmol/min per mg of protein respectively, when endogenous serum nonesterified-fatty-acid concentrations were included in rate calculations. Less than 1% of the intracellularly incorporated fatty acids were found in aqeous products at any time. After 25 h, 15.5% of the initial palmitate was deposited intracellularly in the phosphatidylcholine lipid fraction, 4.2% in the triacylglycerol + fatty-acid-ester fraction and 3.1% in the sphingomyelin fraction. These results contradict the classical view, based on findings with the lipid-dependent adults heart, that exogenous nonesterified fatty acids are directed intracelllarly primarily to pathways of oxidation or to storage as triacylglycerol.

During steady state conditions of glucose uptake (0.515 ± 0.046 and 0.754 ± 0.056 g/min), significant increases were observed in energy expenditure (0.10 ± 0.02 kcal/min, P < 0.001, and 0.21 ± 0.02 kcal/min, P < 0.01, respectively). Similarly, glucose oxidation increased from 0.100 ± 0.015 to 0.266 ± 0.022 g/min (P < 0.001) at ~90 μU/ml insulin and from 0.082 ± 0.013 to 0.295 ± 0.018 g/min (P < 0.001) at ~620 μU/ml insulin. Concomitantly, the rate of nonoxidative glucose disposal or 'glucose storage' was 0.249 ± 0.033 and 0.459 ± 0.048 g/min, respectively. At this time the thermic effect of infused glucose/insulin was 5.3 ± 0.9 and 7.5 ± 0.7%, and the energy cost of 'glucose storage' was 0.50 ± 0.16 kcal/g and 0.47 ± 0.04 kcal/g at the two different levels of glucose uptake. After β-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol, glucose uptake, oxidation, and 'storage' were unchanged in both studies, but significant decreases in energy expenditure were observed (1.41 ± 0.06-1.36 ± 0.05 kcal/min, P < 0.01 at ~90 μU/ml insulin, and 1.52 ± 0.07-1.43 ± 0.05 kcal/min, P < 0.005 at ~620 μU/ml insulin) causing significant falls in both the estimated thermic effect of infused glucose/insulin and the energy cost of 'glucose storage'. Regression analysis of the results from both studies indicated a mean energy cost for 'glucose storage' of 0.36 kcal/g (r = 0.74, P < 0.001), which fell significantly (P < 0.005) to 0.21 kcal/g (r = 0.49, P < 0.05) during β-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol. The latter is in close agreement with that calculated on theoretical grounds for the metabolic cost of glucose storage as glycogen, i.e., obligatory thermogenesis. It is concluded that β-adrenergically mediated sympathetic nervous activity is responsible for almost the entire rise in energy expenditure in excess of the obligatory requirements for processing and storing glucose during conditions of normoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in healthy man, and that the energy cost of 'glucose storage' is not different at normal (~90 μU/ml) and supraphysiological (~620 μU/ml) plasma insulin concentrations.",,"glucose; insulin; propranolol; adrenergic system; autonomic nervous system; beta adrenergic receptor blocking; blood and hemopoietic system; energy expenditure; glucose metabolism; human; human experiment; normal human; preliminary communication; priority journal; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021739077

The stability of these functions over time within the same individuals has led to the suggestion that maximal transport capacities are genetically determined. The present study confirms the reproducibility of functional assays of countertransport and cotransport in human erythrocytes after overnight storage and over a six-month period in normal volunteers and provides estimates of the magnitude of technical error, for each assay. A long-term dietary intervention study in a group of obese adolescents demonstrated marked increases in erythrocyte sodium levels and maximal frusemide-sensitive sodium and potassium fluxes but no changes in cell potassium or water and no effect on lithium-sodium countertransport. A correlation between the decrease in percentage of body fat and the increase in cell sodium content suggests a link between the metabolic effects of dieting and control of erythrocyte cation handling. Although the mechanism linking dietary calorie restriction and changes in erythrocyte cation metabolism is unknown, evaluation of body weight, and especially recent weight loss, is important in studies of erythrocyte transport. Conclusions regarding genetic contributions to the activities of lithium-sodium countertransport and sodium-potassium cotransport systems will be strengthened by clarification of environmental regulators. © Gower Medical Publishing Ltd.","Cotransport; Countertransport; Erythrocyte cations; Frusemide; Hypertension; Obesity","adult; blood and hemopoietic system; blood pressure; cardiovascular system; erythrocyte; etiology; human; major clinical study; membrane permeability; obesity; therapy; weight reduction; Adolescent; Biological Transport; Child; Diet, Reducing; Energy Intake; Erythrocytes; Female; Furosemide; Human; Hypertension; Lithium; Male; Obesity; Potassium; Sodium; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021721655

Many experiments seem to show that during a pre-stretch movement energy can be stored in the SEC which is re-used during the subsequent concentric contraction. Mechanical calculations were performed to calculate the capacity for muscles and tendons to store elastic energy. The storage of elastic energy in muscle tissue appears to be negligible. In tendons some energy can be stored but the total elastic capacity of the tendons of the lower extremities appears far too small to explain reported advantages of a pre-stretch during jumping and running. Based on literature concerning chemical change and enthalpy production during experiments on isolated muscles, a model is proposed which can explain the advantages of a preliminary counter movement on force and work output during the subsequent concentric contraction. The main advantage of a pre-stretch, as seen in movements like jumping, throwing and running, seems to be to prevent a waste of cross bridges at the onset of a contraction in taking up the slack of the muscle. The model can explain why the mechanical efficiency in running can be much higher than in cycling. A muscle which is stretched prior to concentric contraction can do more work at the same metabolic cost when compared with a concentric contraction without pre-stretch. © 1984.",,"energy; ligament; movement (physiology); muscle; muscle elasticity; nonbiological model; nonhuman; productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021716039

The well nourished L4 rats grew insignificantly larger, heavier and fatter than the L9 controls; the underfed L24 rats remained small and stunted, and had absolutely and relatively less adipose tissue than the L4 and L9 rats. Approximately half of the rats of these three groups were fed a high-fat diet from age 18 to 43 weeks. Almost all of the rats in the fat-fed groups became obese. The amount of adipose tissue expressed as percent body weight was essentially the same in all three fat-fed groups, with the greatest relative enlargement of fat stores and increase in fat cell number in the 24-litter rats. The results show that the feeding pattern during adult life is of greater importance than early feeding experiences. The literature regarding overfeeding and underfeeding during early life is reviewed; it confirms that early overfeeding does not predispose to obesity in later life and that early underfeeding does not prevent or diminish the development of nutritional obesity and adipose tissue hypercellularity. Early underfeeding seems to affect more the regulation of the feeding behavior than the intrinsic functions and growth potential of adipose tissue; it may even stimulate the development of obesity. © 1984.","Adipocytes; Early nutrition; Fat storage; Feeding behavior; Infant nutrition; Obesity","adipocyte; adipose tissue; age; animal experiment; food intake; infancy; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; rat; soft tissue; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Animals, Newborn; Body Weight; Cell Count; Dietary Fats; Energy Intake; Female; Male; Obesity; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021711698

We incubated PMNs at 37° C with 2-deoxyglucose (2-dg) in the presence of 5 mmol/L glucose. As expected, ATP inhibition by 2-dg was time-dependent (T 1/2 , 18 minutes) and dose-dependent, with half-maximal inhibition of ATP (ID50) with 1.3 ± .3 mmol/L 2-dg. Similar concentrations of 2-dg inhibited lactate generation, phagocytosis, superoxide anion generation, and degranulation. The random migration of PMNs was inhibited by somewhat higher concentrations of 2-dg (ID50, 12 mmol/L). In contrast, up to 40 mmol/L 2-dg did not inhibit CTX toward synthetic peptides or activated serum. In fact, 2-dg consistently increased the CTX of PMNs toward 10-8 mol/L f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), to a maximum of 450% of control CTX using 15 mmol/L 2-dg. Half-maximal stimulation (ED50) of CTX occurred at 6.3 ± 1.0 mmol/L 2-dg. Although maximal CTX toward optimal concentrations of fMLP was consistently increased with 2-dg, the ED50 of CTX to fMLP was unchanged (ED50 with glucose, 2.0 ± 0.6 nmol/L fMLP; ED50 with 2-dg 2.2 ± 0.7 nmol/L fMLP), and 2-dg did not increase fMLP receptors. In the absence of glucose, 2-dg exerted similar effects on ATP and CTX, but at doses 30- to 50-fold lower than in the presence of glucose. Other glycolytic inhibitors (iodoacetamide and sodium fluoride) exerted similar effects. Additional studies indicated that CTX enhancement by 2-dg (a) required Mg++ but not Ca++, (b) occurred with PMNs from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease, (c) was unaltered in the presence of inhibitors of proteolysis, (d) was not due to generation of a soluble agent, (e) was not due to alterations in PMN adherence, and (f) was not due to inhibition of glycosylation. We conclude that the chemotaxis, but not the random migration, of PMNs is surprisingly resistant to inhibition of energy metabolism and depletion of ATP, since concentrations of 2-dg that decreased ATP and other cell functions by more than 50% not only did not inhibit, but actually stimulated, CTX. These studies also indicate that the previously reported correlation between ATP depletion and CTX impairment observed in stored PMNs are not causally related.",,"deoxyglucose; chemotaxis; chronic granulomatous disease; energy transfer; granulocyte; migration; phagocytosis; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021705154

In disorders of muscle energy metabolism, muscle bulk and resting strength are preserved, but an imbalance in muscle energy production and utilization in exercise results in exertional muscle pain, cramping, weakness, or fatigue. Isometric exercise is impaired by disorders of anaerobic glycolysis. Dynamic exercise is limited by disorders of oxidative metabolism.

Increased rates of protein catabolism, delayed molting and reduced growth were also evident among oil-exposed lobster larvae and suggest either deficiency or immobilization of lipid reserves. From analyses of lipid class composition of control and oil-exposed lobster larvae, it is evident that oil-exposed larvae have consistently lower levels of triacylglycerols (the major energy store) and higher levels of sterols than control larvae. Decreased ratios of non-essential fatty acids (both saturated and unsaturated) and increased ratios of essential fatty acids were detected in the neutral lipid pools of oil-exposed larvae that suggest both decreased storage of fatty acids in energy reserves and decreased mobilization of essential fatty acids into phospholipid pools. The fatty acid distribution in the phospholipid pools of oil-exposed larvae, however, varied little from control values and reflects a tendency to preserve the integrity of these structural lipids. Increases in sterol levels may be related to decreased mobilization of cholesterol or other sterols and/or transformation of cholesterol into metabolic pathways including the biosynthesis of ecdysterone. Oil-exposed animals contained trace quantities of benzene, thiophene, toluene, alkylcyclohexane and alkylbenzenes, detected with GC-MS analyses. No naphthalene, dimethylnaphthalene, higher molecular weight aromatics or their phenolic derivatives were detected; their absence may be related to either the detection limits of the methodology used or extremely rapid metabolism and turnover of these components. Alterations in lipid metabolism may account for the developmental and energetic abnormalities observed in marine crustaceans. It cannot be ruled out, however, that decreased lipid utilization, synthesis and mobilization may be a defense mechanism against incorporating lipophilic components of petroleum hydrocarbons in metabolic pathways, and that disruption in energetics and development is a consequence of the reduction in energy available for growth and molting. © 1984.",,"BIOCHEMISTRY; MARINE BIOLOGY; AMERICAN LOBSTER; LIPID METABOLISM; OIL-EXPOSED LOBSTER LARVAE; HYDROCARBONS; hydrocarbon; petroleum; abstract report; animal experiment; biological model; ecology; invertebrate; larva; lipid metabolism; lobster; metamorphosis; nonhuman; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021645183

The study focuses on the short‐term storage of heat pump output energy in concrete floor panels. This paper describes the dynamic computer simulation of an air to water heat pump, a floor panel energy store and energy flowpaths in a dwelling. The heating plant, controls and building thermal behaviour, were simulated as a complete energy system to enable the study of interactions between the subsystems. The model heating system comprised a number of under floor water heated panels installed in ground floor rooms of a two storey dwelling. Supplementary energy was supplied by direct electric heaters situated in most rooms. Heat pump operating periods were controlled as a function of the external air temperature within two prescribed occupancy intervals per day. Results of the investigation indicate that a heat pump system using floor panel storage and emission may be efficiently managed to provide nearly continuous heating with little supplementary energy input. The short‐term storage of energy in thick floor panels allowed the heat pump to be operated for extended periods without cycling. Because of this, the seasonal loss in heat pump performance resulting from intermittent operation was less than 1 per cent. Attempting to supply the total space heating load with the heat pump and floor panel system resulted in severe overheating during periods of high solar or casual gain. Under these conditions the simple control strategy based on the measurement of external air temperature was ineffective. This problem was eliminated by reducing the heat pump energy input to the dwelling and supplying about 10 per cent of the seasonal energy demand by direct electric heaters. The influence of floor panel energy storage capacity on the performance of the heating system was investigated. Concrete panel depths of between 25 and 150 mm were considered. The seasonal system efficiency was found to increase with floor panel thickness, although not significantly with panel depths beyond 100 mm. The extensive use of floor slabs to store energy caused mean floor temperatures to be higher than when using direct electric air heaters only. However, with the depth of under floor insulation considered in the study (75 mm), heating the floor slab increased the seasonal energy loss of the building by only 4 per cent.

Important processes that control the chemistry include heating and cooling of the water, equilibration of the pumped water with the atmospheric partial P of CO2 and O2, and the mixing of the injection water with the native groundwater during the injection, storage and recovery cycles. For the given example, 0.3 mmol/litre of calcite would be precipitated under closed-system pumping and heating from 10 to 50oC, while a total of 1.9 mmol/litre would be precipitaaed under the open condition. If this calcite were to form scale within the facility's piping, then considerable lengths would be affected depending on the pumping rate. Alternatively, if the precipitate is kept in suspension it will be transported to the injection well and will be filtered out by the aquifer itself. This filtration can result in significant decreases in porosity and hence permeability in the immediate vicinity of the injection well. Mixing of the injection water with the native groundwater changes the water chemistry and can result in mineral supersaturation or undersaturation, depending on the composition of these waters and the proportions in which they are mixed.

Exposure to these agents first induced a gradual decline in contractility and a transient impairment of relaxation. Spontaneous beating then ceased, associated with increased relaxation, followed by a marked and prolonged contracture. This contracture was completely reversible after washout of metabolic inhibitors. The effects of calcium flux inhibitors on the time course of development of contracture were studied. Verapamil, which inhibits Ca influx via the slow Ca channel, delayed the onset of contracture when used in pretreatment, but had no effect if added to cultures after exposure to CN+2DG. Lanthanum, which inhibits Ca influx both via the slow Ca channel and via Na-Ca exchange, delayed onset of contracture if added after exposure to CN and 2DG, but accelerated contracture if added prior to treatment with CN+2DG. Cellular exchangeable calcium content, measured after exposure to CN and 2DG for the same time period that produced contracture, was reduced compared to the control level while unidirectional Ca influx rate was not measurably altered. Exchangeable Ca content was unaffected by pretreatment with verapamil and La, but was reduced if cells were exposed to La after metabolic inhibition. These findings suggest that after metabolic inhibition intracellular storage capacity for Ca+ is reduced in cultured heart cells. Ca influx via the slow Ca channel after metabolic inhibition does not appear to contribute to development of contracture in this model system. However, Ca entry via Na-Ca exchange may accelerate cellular contracture developing after metabolic inhibition of ATP production. © 1984 Academic Press Inc.

There is a possibility of generating a microstructure that has a high absorption coefficient (low reflectance) but becomes highly reflective upon melting by a laser beam, the surface tension helping the formation of a smooth imprint. A localized amorphous-to-crystalline phase change also provides absorption and reflectance contrast. The most useful result is derived from the thermal dehydrogenation of a-Si:H. Dehydrogenation provides a decrease in energy gap and hydrogen evolution. The latter can form a microscopic blister or a crater that can be easily read optically against a smooth background. Bosch describes a system that greatly reduces the laser power required to record data. In this approach, the a-Si:H is used as a photoconductor supporting an externally applied voltage. The writing energy comes from the electrical power dissipated as heat when the photoconductor is triggered into conduction by the laser pulse. This heat can blister or crater either the photoconductor or an outer layer of a more thermally sensitive material. Thus, with an applied voltage, 1.8 μm dots were recorded with 0.1 mW of laser power (two orders of magnitude lower than without applied voltage). The presence of hydrogen that passivates the dangling bonds renders the material corrosion resistant, a quality that is valued for archival information storage. © 1984, Elsevier Inc.

The results of a survey of nitrogen compounds as dopants in a stable shale DFM base fuel indicate that Some pyrroles and indoles may play significant roles in storage stability. A complete stability test matrix has been developed for the temperatures of 43, 65 and 80ºC, for time periods between A and 179 days, and for a ten-fold concentration range of a model dopant, 2,5-dimethylpyrrole (DMP). Stability was defined by the amount of total insoluble material (filterable sediment and adherent gum) produced after stress, and also by the amount of titratable peroxide present in the filtrates of stressed fuel samples. A very regular pattern for insolubles formation was found within the test matrix. Deposit formation rates exhibited a first-order dependence on DMP concentration, with an apparent activation energy of 11-12 kcal/mol. The sediment was found to contain 12% nitrogen and 18-20% oxygen irrespective of the stress conditions employed. © 1984, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

For this energy analysis of the Hailun agroecosystem and human society, energy production was divided into 3 systems: crops, livestock and forestry. In terms of energy, this agroecosystem was self-sustaining. Human and horse power provided the major energy inputs. In the crop system, the energy input/output ratio was about 1:2. Fossil energy input into the total agroecosystem was less than 2% of the total. Based on only fossil energy inputs and crop outputs, the ratio was 1:107. The sources of food and household energy for human society came from the crop, livestock and forestry systems. The crop system provided more than 80% of the energy for this society. In addition to natural additions of N and P, legumes, other crop rotations and the application of human and livestock wastes to the land provided the nutrients for crop production. However, the agroecosystem was not self-sustaining in terms of some soil nutrients.

The method is incorporated in a computer code called HYBRID, which can be linked to a solar central receiver code such as STEAEC. STEAEC, or a similar code, must be used to calculate the power from the solar central receiver (solar power) on an hourly or quarter-hourly basis. HYBRID determines the quantity of solar power directed to thermal storage, the quantity of solar power directed to a specified load, the amount of power retrieved from thermal storage, and the mass of fuel used by the fossil portion of the hybrid power plant. HYBRID uses the calculated fuel requirements to determine the present value of required revenue for the life of the plant. Fuel consumption is shown to be a dominant variable cost in the economic evaluation of a solar-fossil hybrid system. Fuel costs and other economic parameters are normalized to the present value of the capital investment. The range of normalized parameters is established to reflect economic unknowns and system design variability. It is shown that, under the most favorable economic conditions allowed in this study, the present value of the capital investment for a solar-fossil hybrid system should not exceed 2.5 time the present value of the capital investment for a comparable fossil power system if the hybrid is to be economically competitive. Under more probable conditions, this ratio declines to 1.5-2.0. © 1984.",,"COMPUTER SIMULATION; ENERGY STORAGE; STEAM POWER PLANTS - Energy Conservation; DOMINANT ENERGY FLOWS; HEAT TRANSFER FLUIDS; SOLAR-FOSSIL HYBRID SYSTEM; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; SOLAR POWER PLANTS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021622813

Another advantage is the high electrical resistivity that allows a long charge storage. A CCD is a simpler structure than a chain of field-effect transistors. When analyzing the operation of a-Si:H devices, the localized states must be taken into account.

In spring, full energy transduction is rapidly re‐established by the storage of experimental replicates at a warm temperature and results in a marked increase in net photosynthetic rates. As expansion of the tree canopy takes place both apparent quantum efficiency and photosynthetic capacity increase markedly, whilst respiration decreases significantly, providing high rates of net photosynthesis even under light levels as low as 75 μmol m−2 s−1. This change in summer capacity is interpreted as being due to the synthesis of additional photosynthetic units in response to the low light conditions on the woodland floor. The data are discussed both in relation to comparable events in other lichen species and to the potential significance of seasonal changes in photosynthetic capacity in the ecology of P. praetextata.

The spin-polarized electron states and their changes upon magnetic phase transitions are investigated by using linearly polarized synchroton radiation from the new German dedicated storage ring BESSY and high angle- and energy resolution, while the degree of mixing (via spin-orbit interaction) of electrons states of different orbital symmetry is investigated by optical pumping using circularly polarized low energy photons. We finally discuss the potential of these techniques for the physics of interfaces especially in view of recent developments in the field of photon sources (e.g. ondulators) as well as materials preparation and characterization (e.g. epitaxy). In perspective it seems appropriate to compare the present experiment using dedicated synchrotron radiation at BESSY,with its degree of sophistication, to the one involving scattering of polarized neutrons in the late fifties and early sixties using the first 'dedicated' research reactors. © 1984 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.",,"SURFACES - Spectroscopic Analysis; ELECTRON SPIN; PHOTOEMISSION SPECTROSCOPY; SPIN POLARIZATION; MAGNETIC MATERIALS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021599691

However, even with a saturated solution it is necessary to take certain precautions to avoid deterioration of the heat storage capacity: either a cold finger must be used to maintain the presence of dodecahydrate crystal nuclei at all times or the temperature must not be allowed to exceed the liquidus temperatures for prolonged periods (e.g. 48 hr) or ∼85°C for brief periods, these treatments leading to the subsequent appearance of a lower hydrate. Enthalpy was measured as a function of temperature (to 85°C) and concentration (72-87% dodecahydrate), and the thermal cycling behavior of solutions was studied. Since crystalline trisodium phosphate dodecahydrate (as purchased or separating from solutions having Na P {reversed tilde equals} 3) does not conform to the formula Na3PO4·12 H2O, being more correctly considered as an alkaline complex salt approximating NaPO4·12 H2O· 1 9 to 1 4 NaOH, the role of the Na P ratio is examined in the context of heat storage in a saturated solution. © 1984.",,"HEATING - Heat Storage; HEAT STORAGE MEDIA; SATURATED SOLUTIONS; TRISODIUM PHOSPHATE DODECAHYDRATE; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021578324

Formation of loose aggregations occurs during migration and seasonally. Geographical segregation of sexes, sexual classes and age classes sometimes occurs, eg in Balaenoptera acutorostrata; this can seriously bias the sex ratio and age distribution of catches. In small and greatly reduced stocks such catches can seriously alter the population structure. The female reproductive cycle is generally 2 yr, with a gestation period of c1 yr. Lactation lasts c0.5 yr. Normally just 1 calf is born in warm temperate or sub-tropical waters. Most baleen whales undertake extensive migrations for feeding, an exception being Balaena mysticetus. The reproductive cycle appears to be geared to this annual cycle of migration and feeding. Baleen whales feed mainly by filtering small swarming planktonic Crustacea, the production of which is greatest in cold high latitude waters. Baleen whales thus need to leave the home breeding grounds for the high latitude seas each spring in order to feed and store energy in the form of fat as reserves for the months of poor feeding. Even Eschrichtius robustus, a bottom-feeder, undertakes such migrations. Weaning in most species occurs during or after the summer feeding season. The success of factors such as fertility, pregnancy, lactation, developmental growth and sexual maturity, and net recruitment are dependent on efficient storage of energy for body maintenance, foetal growth and milk production. Inter-correlation between history of exploitation, pregnancy rates and individual growth rate and the attainment of sexual maturity is discussed in relation to possible changes in food supply. -from Author",,"Balaena mysticetus; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Eschrichtius robustus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021566880

Throughflow consists of flow only, not storage. Inclusive throughflow is introduced as a concept that includes both flow and storage. Cycling measures based on this concept are developed. Two Markov chains expressing the probability of transfer of substance from compartment j to i in one unit of transition time are constructed. The first is the conventional, throughflow-based model; second is an extended model based on inclusive throughflow with adjustable time step. This latter model is considered for two cases: storage accounted for and ignored, and is employed to illustrate derived relationships utilizing a small ecosystem energy flow model. Principal conclusions are: (1) cycling measures derived form the conventional throughflow-based model would overestimate cycling as given by the inclusive throughflow model, because they fail to distinguished storage from true cycling; (2) storages exceed cycled flow over low-ordered paths, but (3) decline in importance with increasing path length; (4) path diversity is greater in systems with storage than in corresponding systems without storage; (5) nonstorage path numbers increase combinatorially with path length; (6) cycling tends to become dominant over storage at higher path lengths, and (7) at differing rates for different compartments; (8) true cycling efficiency of each compartment i for the inclusive throughflow model is corrected from the conventional model formulation (qii - 1 /qii) to [qii-1/(1-Pii]/qii (Pii is the probability of substance in i remaining there over a transition time interval; qii is the cumulative substance returned to i over all paths of all lengths in the system); (9) this corrected cycling efficiency of each compartment with respect to inclusive throughflow equals that of the same compartment with respect to only the throughflow component as derived from the conventional model; (10) on the system level, however, the modified cycling index based on inclusive throughflow gives different values for cycling than the published cycling index derived from conventional throughflow; and (11) the modified cycling measures based on the inclusive throughflow model with an adjustable time step are independent of the chosen time step, and thus valid even for the continuous time case which is approached by the employed discrete time model as the time step approaches zero. © 1984.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021548030

The study investigates the timedependent flow, considering an initially isothermal or thermally stratified fluid region, and the approach to the steady-state circumstance. Various flow configurations and boundary conditions, of particular relevance to energy extraction and heat rejection in solar ponds, are considered. The governing parameters, particularly the buoyancy parameter, are varied to determine the dependence of the flow field on these. Both laminar and turbulent flow are considered and numerical results are obtained for the velocity and temperature fields in the pond. Several interesting features are observed, particularly the strong effect of thermal buoyancy on the flow in the range of physical variables of practical interest and the effect of the flow on the growth and decay of a stable thermal stratification in the enclosed region. The effect of a periodic heat input into the region is studied. The study also considers relevant one-dimensional steady and transient analytical models for the thermal field and results are presented to indicate the range of validity of such simple models.

The device uses a conventional polarographic electrode in connection with chronoamperometry to overcome many of the problems limiting the performance of oxygen electrodes. The polarizing potential is applied as a pulse and the resulting current transient is sampled after a 1.5- to 3-s delay. Current during the first few seconds is 4 to 8 times the steady-state current and is unaffected by flow rate past the membrane provided a recovery time of 3 min or more is allowed between pulses. Secondary benefits include reproducibility typically better than ±0.8 μM and essentially drift-free operation for several weeks. At a pulsing rate of 120 h-1 analysis time is 2 to 4 min per bottle. A microcomputer controls all phases of the measuring process: pulse generation, data acquisition, reduction, and storage. Software is used to correct sensor output for temperature dependence exactly using the activation energy of permeation and the Arrhenius equation. An activity coefficient, a function of temperature and salinity, is computed to correct for salinity. Results of an intercomparison with Winkler determinations are presented and an example is given of the instrument's use to measure the respiration of copepods in an unstirred solution. © 1984.",,"COMPUTERS, MICROPROCESSOR - Applications; ELECTRODES; OCEANOGRAPHY - Instruments; OXYGEN - Monitoring; DISSOLVED OXYGEN; PULSED ELECTRODE; SEAWATER",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021520707

The energy storage unit consisted of a column packed with crosslinked polyethylene tubes. The solid‐solid phase transition enables heat transfer by direct contact between the form‐stable polymer and the hot (cold) fluid. A theoretical model for the simulation of this system was developed. The heating‐cooling characteristics of the energy storage system were simulated by the model, using measured thermodynamic properties of the crosslinked polyethylene. The potential of various crosslinked polyethylene materials for energy storage applications will depend on sufficient high‐temperature stability.

First, structural parameter estimating method with the aid of auto-regressive model fitting proposed in the former report is further developed to the system in which its natural frequency and damping variate with time. Such a structural nonstationality is represented as a kind of trajectory on the comlex sr-characteristic plane which is obtained through z-trans formed plane. Numerical examination is carried out for the practical model such as a liquid storage tank in which stored amount should variate with time. Second, proposed technique is applied to the inelastic structure system. Equivalent linealization is introduced in order to estimate equivalent damping which associates with inelastic energy absorbing efftet. After linealization, it is made clear that inelastic behaviour can be also expressed on the linealized sτ-characteristic plane. Obtained results are investigated by comparing the results through statistical linealization methoiand the inelastic response analysis. © 1984, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

The efficiency of the aquifer to store thermal energy is related, in part, to the hydrogeologic characteristics of the aquifer. The movement of heat away from the injection well is directly related to the anisotropy. Aquifer tests were conducted to determine the anisotropy near the heated‐water injection well. The maximum and minimum values of transmissivity along the principal directions of the hydraulic conductivity tensors of the Ironton and Galesville Sandstones in St. Paul, Minnesota are approximately 1,090 and 480 feet squared per day. The storage coefficient is 4.5 × 10−5. These values represent the average of four determinations of nonsteady flow to a well in an idealized infinite anisotropic aquifer. Analysis of the values of transmissivity and storage coefficient for hypothetical changes in location of two of the monitoring wells where depth‐deviation surveys were not available indicates that computed transmissivities vary less than 5 percent and storage coefficients vary less than ±6 percent.

The most efficient sensitizers were Michler's ketone, acetophenone, and benzophenone In that order. A mixture of the sensitizers performed worse than the less efficient sensitizer, perhaps due to a mechanism of intersensitizer energy transfer.

Interface traps (Surface states) are created by tunneling electrons flowing to and from the substrate.

The flow Peclet number and enclosure aspect ratio were varied in the experiment. Flow visualization revealed buoyancy-affected motions in both side-wall configurations. During the charging period of an energy storage cycle, for the strongly conducting side-wall case, axial heat conduction along the side-wall induced an upward-directed buoyant force on the fluid adjacent to the wall in the lower (colder) part of the enclosure. This was in contrast to a downward- directed force on near-wall fluid in the weakly conducting side-wall case. However, the motions induced by the forces were relatively weak compared to the main flow, and in the weakly conducting wall case appeared to be confined to thin fluid layers adjacent to the enclosure side-walls. The cumulative influence of buoyant forces was most noticeable for long times, in flows with small Peclet number and conducting side-walls. Measurements of temperature and of the energy storage performance characteristics of the thermocline were made as a function of time.

Ambient air, water vapor in the air, and clear sky provide the major sources of coolness, for both short-term (a few hours) and long-term (a few months) storage. Materials suitable for short-term storage of coolness are the building mass, water, rocks and phase-changing salt hydrates. For long-term storage, water (stored in aquifers and in the form of ice and frozen soil), ground, rocks, and phase-changing materials are possible candidates. Seasonal storage of coolness in rocks, ground, water (stored in aquifers), and in the form of ice (produced in a covered underground pond) and frozen soil were considered to meet the cooling demands of three commercial buildings. The characteristics of each system were determined, and an economic analysis was performed for these systems, as well as for a conventional vapor compresssion refrigeration machine. It was found that the cost of land and the interest to be paid on it constituted the major initial and annual costs, respectively. For the aquifer storage, where the land used for the system accessories is very small, and for the covered underground ice pond, where the land above the pond can be used for parking, landscaping, etc., the cost of one GJ of coolness delivered by these systems is lower than that delivered by the conventional unit. Both initial and unit coolness costs of the ground and rock-bed storage systems, even without considering the cost of land, are higher than those of the conventional unit. If the cost of land is excluded, the cost of one GJ of coolness stored in the form of frozen soil is competitive with the unit costs incurred using aquifer and ice pond systems. © 1984.",,"AQUIFERS - Energy Storage; ECONOMICS - Evaluation; ICE; ROCK - Energy Storage; SOILS - Energy Storage; ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY STUDY; LOW-TEMPERATURE INTERNAL ENERGY; NATURAL COOLING SYSTEMS; STORAGE OF COOLNESS; ENERGY STORAGE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021463474

Stress-induced demagnetization in a magnetic recording medium results from the magnetization reversal of individual magnetic particles dispersed in the magnetic layer. The magnetoelastic energy due to the application of three-dimensional stresses and the magnetostatic energy due to the demagnetizing field must be taken into account for an investigation of the magnetization reversal of each particle. It is found that the magnetization reversal can take place even during small stresses if a sufficient demagnetizing field exists. The sign of the magnetostric-tive coefficient {\lambda}100 has a significant relation to the susceptibility of magnetization reversal.

The electrical efficiency, durability, and relatively high energy density of alkaline battery systems makes development of an improved sintered nickel electrode advantageous. Modification of current fabrication methods, however, should be targeted at a lightweight, long-life, low cost product, to be of any significant value. The nickel composite electrode (Ni.C.E.) is fabricated by coating a graphite mat fiber material with a thin (0.6 - 1.0 μm) nickel layer and sintering to a compact structure. The resulting lightweight, durable composite structure is producible in porosities of 55 to >90%. This porous structure has been impregnated electrochemically with active material to a level of 200 A h/kg. Test cells, containing single composite positives coupled with commercial negatives, exhibited lives approaching 800 cycles under a demanding cycling regime. The composite nickel electrodes showed utilizable gravimetric energy densities of 125 - 175 A h/kg under the test conditions. ap ]The composite electrodes in multi-plate cells cycled under similar conditions had good capacity retention for 500 or more cycles. A gravimetric energy density of 120 - 125 A h/kg was noted for the entire positive plate block assembly including terminal. This is an increase of 66 - 72% over that measured for commercial positives. Volumetric energy densities for the Ni.C.E. are roughly equivalent to those of powder sinters. No detrimental effects due to the presence of graphite have been noted. Further optimization of this system may produce electrodes of still higher energy density. © 1984.",,"ELECTRODES - Research; ELECTRIC BATTERIES, SECONDARY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021455259

It was shown that the acclimated populations could efficiently remove the toxic waste component phenol under nonproliferating conditions by utilizing an oxidative assimilation mechanism. The phenol was assimilated and converted into nonnitrogenous storage products. During the assimilation process, the cells had a tendency to excrete some product (nonsubstrate) chemical oxygen demand (COD). Bench‐scale oxidative assimilation units were operated by sequentially feeding a carbon source (phenol) and nitrogen source (ammonium sulfate) to heterogeneous populations. This demonstrated that, subsequent to the addition of the nitrogen source to the medium, the cells utilized the stored carbon for replication. Four of these units were operated at different phenol COD‐to‐ammonia‐nitrogen ratios of 10:1, 20:1, 40:1, and 50:1. All of these units demonstrated excellent removal of phenol using an oxidative assimilation mechanism. These results suggested the feasibility of utilizing a continuous flow oxidative assimilation process for the treatment of nitrogen‐deficient phenolic wastes. This process would be advantageous over conventional treatment processes in that it would realize a savings in chemical costs (ammonia as nitrogen source) and prevent leakage of excess ammonia from the system.

One approach to reducing storage and computation requirements is to organize the set of reproduction vectors as the Cartesian product of a vector codebook describing the shape of each reproduction vector and a scalar codebook describing the gain or energy. Such shape-gain vector quantizers can be applied both to waveform coding using a quadratic-error distortion measure and to voice coding using an Itakura-Saito distortion measure. In each case, the minimum distortion reproduction vector can be found by first selecting a shape code-word, and then, based on that choice, selecting a gain codeword. Several algorithms are presented for the design of shape-gain vector quantizers based on a training sequence of data or a probabilistic model. The algorithms are used to design shape-gain vector quantizers for both the waveform coding and voice coding application. The quantizers are simulated, and their performance is compared to that of previously reported vector quantization systems.

The addition of 3 ppm Cu2+ to PFO oil shortened the induction period by 12%. The oxidation of BNO and PRO exhibited first-order kinetics in the production of hydroperoxide (RO2 H), up to the maximum values of the concentration of RO2 H. On the other hand, the oxidation of PFO and PFO+Cu2+ displayed first-order kinetics at higher concentrations of RO2 H and possibly half-order kinetics at low hydroperoxide concentrations in the first 15 days. Therefore, the 3 oils studied and PFO+Cu2+ did not show the same stability pattern over the 115 days of the experiment. The application of kinetic data, a side from the other parameters, allows the definition of 2 different stability patterns. From 0–15 days the oxidation rates led to the following order of stability: PFO+Cu2+&lt;PFO&lt;BNO&lt;PRO. From the 15th day to the end of the period corresponding to the maximum concentration of RO2 H, the rate constants led to the pattern: PFO+Cu2+&lt;BNO&lt;PFO&lt;PRO. Considering the whole period of the experiment, the changes in viscosity and the values of the induction periods point toward the first-mentioned stability pattern, demonstrating that without kinetic data these 2 parameters are insufficient to determine such patterns. © 1984, American Oil Chemists’ Society.

At present, however, the costs and benefit to both the customers and utility are uncertain. As part of a nationwide demonstration program Public Service Electric and Gas Company installed storage space heating and water heating appliances in residential homes. Both the test homes and similiar homes using conventional space and water heating appliances were monitored, allowing for detailed comparisons between the two systems. The purpose of this paper is to detail the methodology used and the results of studies completed on the generation system impacts of storage space and water heating systems. Other electric system impacts involving service entrance size, metering, secondary distribution and primary distribution were detailed in two previous IEEE Papers (refer to Reference 3). This paper is organized into three main sections. The first gives background data on PSE&G and their experience in a nationwide thermal storage demonstration project. The second section details results of the demonstration project and studies that have been performed on the impacts of thermal storage equipment. The last section reports on the conclusions arrived at concerning the impacts of thermal storage on generation. The study was conducted in early 1982 using available data at that time, while PSE&G system plans have changed since then, the conclusions are pertinent and valuable to those contemplating inpacts of thermal energy storage.

This density gradient inhibits thermal convection, with the result that solar radiation reaching the lower region is trapped and the temperature is raised. A method to estimate the storage temperature variation in the pond is described herein. The storage temperature is estimated by a numerical analysis using meteorological observation data with a time interval of one hour. In this analysis, the following effects are considered: the heat transfer from the pond to the surrounding ground, the change of salt-gradient due to the diffusion of salt, and the local occurrence of thermal convection. The results of the simulation are compared with data obtained by the writer.

To generate 10-100 times more power new techniques in solar-array design and fabrication will be needed. Higher specific powers for solar cells and advanced array design will reduce array mass and size. Smaller arrays in turn can decrease problems in storage, deployment, Sun tracking, and structural dynamics. GaAs cells nearing flight readiness have higher efficiency than silicon cells (18% vs. 15%) and are more tolerant to temperature and space radiation. Moreover, a new generation of GaAs-based cells having multiple, cascaded junctions might achieve 30% conversion efficiency. Meanwhile, silicon-cell development has yielded larger (6 multiplied by 6-cm) and thinner (50-dm) cells with more effective contact configurations and lower operating temperatures. As a result, array power density could reach 200 w/m**2 by the year 2000. Nuclear reactors have been proposed with a fast neutron spectrum, allowing larger control margins for higher powers and longer anticipated lifetimes.

The Texas-Louisiana Gulf Coast was selected because of the large concentration of salt domes, proximity to major U.S. refineries, and access to major U.S. oil distribution facilities. In the case of an emergency, SPR oil can be fed directly to Gulf Coast refineries or sent by pipeline to refineries in the interior of the country.

The study was performed by SNC Inc. for the Transportation Development Center of Transport Canada (TDC). WESS introduces savings in the overall costs of the electric energy supplied to the catenary, by reducing the peak load seen by the utility and, if locomotive regeneration is available, the total energy demand. A number of energy storage systems were evaluated for near-term WESS applications. Two were found to be practicable: lead-acid batteries and steel flywheels. The required battery technology already exists and installations, existing or planned, approach the required levels of stored energy and power. For steel flywheels existing systems have available stored energy levels of less than one thirtieth of that required for WESS. Detailed engineering studies would be necessary to demonstrate that single wheel systems of the capacity required could be manufactured at reasonable cost. Budget estimates were derived for the combined installation and operating costs of battery and flywheel WESS. These were compared with the potential savings in the costs of electricity supply for a 20-year operating life, using average Canadian Utility rates and typical WESS parameters. © 1984, IEEE.",,"ELECTRIC BATTERIES; RAILWAY ELECTRIFICATION; WAYSIDE ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS; ELECTRIC RAILROADS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021432443

Most fruits and vegetables require a storage environment near 0°C and 100%rh, which is difficult to achieve with conventional refrigeration systems. In a jacketed storage system, refrigerated air is circulated through air spaces surrounding the storage. High relative humidity levels can be achieved through the use of the large heat transfer surface of walls, ceiling and floor maintained at uniform temperature, and by preventing transmission heat gains into the storage space. While the jacket concept was initially introduced as a full jacket (covering walls, ceiling and floor), this paper discusses an alternative jacketed design which uses only the ceiling as a heat transfer surface. Based on construction simplicity, it is felt that this jacket design can be applied to conversion of conventional storage facilities and to new storage facilities.

The storage moduli of PP composites, E′c, increase with filler content and decreasing filler size in the whole range of temperature. The loss moduli of PP composites, E″c, increase with filler content and decreasing filler size above 40°C. The intensity of the broad despersion which appears at ca. 60°C increases with filler content and decreasing filler size. By assuming that the energy is not dissipated in the effective volume, namely, filler volume plus that of immobilized interfacial region, the effective volume fraction is evaluated from the relative loss modulus, E″cE″0 at 60°C. The effective volume fraction increases with filler content and decreasing filler size. The effect of addition of ultrafine particles on the broad dispersion at ca. 60°C resembles the effect of increasing crystallinity of pure PP.

However, many otherwise attractive CVT designs have a ratio coverage less than ideal for such applications. Split-path configurations can be used to extend the ratio coverage, providing even a geared neutral and reverse capability with some combinations of parameters. The increased coverage is in general achieved, however, only at the expense of lower overall CVT efficiency and a larger required variable unit capacity. All possible single-regime designs which use a single differential to extend the ratio coverage of the basic variable unit are considered, as well as two 2- regime designs. Data for the CVT efficiency characteristics are developed for both otherwise conventional vehicles and those utilizing an energy-storage flywheel, with steady speeds and three driving cycles used for the evaluation. It is found that the efficiency penalty for extending the ratio coverage can be quite severe for some combinations of system parameters and operating conditions, so that a complete analysis of this aspect is important when considering the concept for any specific application. © 1984.",,"AUTOMOBILE TRANSMISSIONS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021411788

Multiple pumped-storage power stations are then scheduled by a search procedure based on the principle that pumping can only take place if the resulting hydrogeneration reduces total production costs.

Transparent insulation material has the property of being transparent or translucent to solar radiation while at the same time acting as heat insulation, Elements made of this material can be attached to the walls of buildings and thus permit the utilization of solar energy for heating. Relations are given for the dependence of heat flux and conversion efficiency of radiation into useful heat on the thermal resistance of the components. Calculations using meteorological data show that with materials parameters achievable with present technology not only south but also west/east and possibly even north orientations can lead to significant contributions to heating. In order to avoid overheating in summer, control of radiation must be provided. Experiments with unoptimized materials on two buildings during 1982/83 showed promising results: for a south facade during a sunny period in January, a mean flux of 9 W/m2into the house was observed. For the entire heating season the extrapolated value is 16 W/m2. On a western orientation a net loss was observed, but the mean effective heat transfer coefficient of the element was lowered from 1.8 W/m2K without radiation to 0.25 W/m2K with radiation. The beneficial effect of masonry walls with regard to heat storage and damping of temperature fluctuation was also demonstrated. The elements proposed here therefore appear particularly attractive for retrofitting. © 1984, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

Five-day N balance studies were conducted in early (0 to 30 d), mid- (30 to 60 d) and late (60 to 90 d) gestation. At slaughter (90 d of gestation), reproductive tracts were weighed and evaluated for reproductive performance and samples of the reproductive tract, liver and semimembranosus muscle (SM) were analyzed for crude protein. The right half of the carcass was subjected to a physical separation of fat, lean and bone. Neither dietary protein nor energy level significantly affected weight gain or reproductive performance. Nitrogen retention increased as dietary protein level increased and stage of gestation progressed (linear effect, P less than .01), but efficiency of N utilization and dry matter digestibility decreased with increasing protein intakes (quadratic effect, P less than .05 and linear effect, P less than .01, respectively). Nitrogen retention (P less than .01), efficiency of N retention (P less than .05) and dry matter digestibility (P less than .01) were higher in gilts fed high (H) energy compared with gilts receiving moderate (M) energy diets. Increasing dietary protein increased total carcass separable lean tissue (quadratic effect, P less than .01), liver weight (linear effect P less than .01) SM weight (quadratic effect, P less than .05) and SM percentage M (linear effect P less than .10).

In contrast to the increase in muscle N, N in uterine tissue and fluids was not affected by dietary protein level.

The method is based on the observation of secondary creep; this is a small effect generated in a stressed specimen by a T-jump. In the experiment, the specimen is maintained isothermally under a constant stress until the primary creep rate is negligible. A T-jump of several degrees, positive or negative, is then imposed and this generates the secondary creep. If JR and JU are independent of temperature there is no secondary creep. The secondary creep has the same time dependence as primary creep. A comparison of the magnitudes of secondary and primary creep — at equivalent reduced times — leads by means of the theory of thermoviscoelasticity to the determination of α and β, the temperature coefficients of (JR-JU) and JU. For isotactic polypropylene in the α-region at 40°C both coefficients are positive: α = 0.7 × 10−2 and β = 0.1 × 10−2°C−1. It is clear from the positive sign for the coefficient of (JR-JU) that the α-relaxation is of the type in which stress increases the entropy. The magnitudes of the coefficients support the conclusion that the use of un-normalized time-temperature superposition to determine activation energy in polypropylene will be highly erroneous. The magnitude of the coefficient of (JR-JU) is sufficiently large to account partially for physical ageing in crystalline polymers. Quenching from T down to T0 will freeze in a non-equilibrium value of (JR-JU), considerably in excess of the equilibrium value at T0. Storage at T0 permits the equilibrium value to be slowly attained, so that with increasing ageing time the polymer becomes stiffer and exhibits lower creep rates. © 1984, All rights reserved.","ageing; Creep; limiting compliances; polypropylene","MATERIALS TESTING - Creep; Polymers; Polypropylene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021388009

The utilization factor of thermal energy was low at the beginning of the operation, because the heat loss from the accumulators and pipes was large. As the result of improvement in the thermal insulation of the accumulators, reducing the leakage of steam from valves and decreasing the number of operating accumulators from 5 to 2, ihe utilization factor was increased from 0.35 to 0.79. Optical system efficiency is dependent on the season. The main problem is considered to be condensed moisture on the mirror surfaces of the heliostats at night. For future projects, it is essential for solar power plants to prevent the small losses of heat that are gathered from a wide area. It is also necessary to match the solar collector system and thermal storage system. The confirmation of the reliability of the heat receiver is important. Heat absorbing tubes in the receiver experience violent temperature cycles every day and night and in the shadow from clouds even in sunny days.

Parametric sensitivity studies were carried out to determine the response of the central solar DHW system performance to the following parameters: flow rate of heat-exchange fluid in the solar collector loop, consumption rate in the consumer loop, start-up time (i.e., activation of the collector loop circulation pump), and storage tank capacity.

Measurements were made during quiet breathing at rest and during exercise on a bicycle ergometer at work rates equivalent to 50 and 100% of their maximal work rate (Ẇmax). The peak inspiratory pleural pressure relative to the chest wall relaxation curve (Pmus) increased from 13.5 ± 1.5 cm H2O at rest to 16.5 ± 2.3 the coincident transdiaphragmatic pressure increased from 9.7 ± 2.1 cm H2O at rest to 16.5 ± 2.3 cm H2O at Ẇmax. Consequently, the coincident gastric pressure relative to its value during relaxation (Pab) was negative at rest (-4.5 ± 1.7 cm H2O) and became even more negative (-6.3 ± 2.3 cm H2O) at Ẇmax. Yet the increase in ventilation with increasing exercise was associated with an increase in the passive outward displacement of the abdomen (ΔVab) relative to the total volume change (♀ab + ΔVrc), such that the ratio ΔVab/(ΔVab + ΔVrc) increased from 0.37 ± 0.08 at rest to 0.52 ± 0.05 at Ẇmax. There was no respiratory paradox. From the analysis of volume-pressure tracings of the chest wall compartments we inferred that expiratory intercostal and abdominal muscles contracted forcefully during expiration on exercise, resulting in a marked increase in pleural pressure and a change in thoraco-abdominal configuration. This represented the storage of elastic and gravitational energy, which was released during inspiration, contributing to inspiratory pleural pressures and the enhanced inspiratory flow. Although recruitment of abdominals as accessory muscles of inspiration facilitated the increase in ventilation while protecting the diaphragm, the other inspiratory muscles generated a high proportion of their maximal pressure, possibly limiting ventilation during exercise.",,"bicycle ergometry; chronic obstructive lung disease; computer analysis; diagnosis; exercise; human; human experiment; inspiration; plethysmography; respiratory system; thorax wall; Abdominal Muscles; Aged; Biomechanics; Exertion; Human; Lung Diseases, Obstructive; Lung Volume Measurements; Middle Age; Movement; Pleura; Pressure; Respiration; Ribs; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Thorax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021368195

A daily record of infant formula and supplemental food intake of a normal, bottle-fed male infant was kept from 1 week to 9 months after birth. The infant's physical growth was assessed at regular intervals. Measurements included weight, recumbent length, head circumference, and skinfold thicknesses. Feeding was ad libitum, and caregivers were highly responsive to the infant's satiety behaviors. Under these conditions, the infant adjusted his caloric intake as supplemental foods were added to his diet by progressively decreasing the volume of formula consumed. His growth was well canalized and tracked very close to the 50th centile of NCHS weight and length standards. The regularity of his growth attests to the adequacy of his intake for meeting energy needs without excess energy storage. This suggests that to avoid overfeeding the bottle-fed infant, caregivers should attempt to facilitate the infant's self-regulation of intake.",,"autoregulation; body height; caloric intake; child; diagnosis; food intake; human; human experiment; infant; skinfold; subcutaneous tissue; weight; Case Report; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Feeding Behavior; Human; Infant; Infant Nutrition; Infant, Newborn; Male",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021363146

During day time meal to meal deficit was decreasing from the beginning to the end of the period but was not correlated to meal sizes.

Seventy-nine obese patients participated in the study. They were divided into four groups according to the degree of carbohydrate intolerance: group A, normal glucose tolerance; group B, impaired glucose tolerance; group C, diabetes with hyperinsulinemic response to the load; group D, diabetes with impaired insulin response. All four groups of patients presented an increase in lipid oxidation, both in the fasting state and during the three-hour glucose tolerance test, when compared to the control group. The lipid oxidation rate was roughly parallel to plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels. The contribution of lipids to energy expenditure was higher in obese as compared to control subjects. These observations suggest that the larger part taken by lipids in the energy metabolism of both nondiabetic and diabetic obese humans is a consequence of their increased fat stores and that the resulting decrease in carbohydrate metabolism may lead, as a late consequence, to alterations in glucose tolerance. The latter may result in delayed glucose storage and oxidation in the obese patient. © 1984.",,"fatty acid; clinical article; diabetes mellitus; endocrine system; etiology; glucose tolerance test; human; lipid metabolism; obesity; therapy; Adult; Age Factors; Calorimetry; Diabetes Mellitus; Energy Metabolism; Female; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021329259

It was developed for multi-sample alpha spectroscopy analysis. The LLPHA system is controlled by a MIK-11/2 microcomputer with 28K of memory and uses a double-density, dual floppy disk for data storage. Detectors are interfaced to the computer via CAMAC (Computer Automated Measurement and Control) equipment. The system simultaneously supports 32 active and independent surface-barrier alpha-particle detectors. It operates with the total collection rate of up to 300 counts/sec from all active detectors, using 128 channels per spectrum and a dynamic energy range of 1.4 MeV. The system is not limited, however, to these conditions. In addition to spectral acquisition, the system provides analysis functions which include peak identification, curve-smoothing, integration, linear and logarithmic scale graphics, and corrections for base-line shift, dead-time, and background counts. These functions can be implemented while other spectra are being collected. The LLPHA system represents a highly cost-effective means of acquiring alpha spectrometric data from a large number of samples simultaneously and with rapid data analysis capability. © 1984 Health Physics Society Pergamon Press Ltd.",,"radioisotope; alpha radiation; alpha radiation emitter; methodology; nonhuman; spectroscopy; Alpha Particles; Microcomputers; Spectrum Analysis; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021327912

For any location the long term solar fraction depends primarily on three non-dimensional groups M, K and R. M is the ratio of energy available on the collector aperture to energy demand and is hence a collector sizing parameter. K is the ratio of a reference rate of collector heat loss to a reference rate of energy available and is a collector performance parameter. R is the number of days storage available. A correlation relating the solar fraction, E, to M, K and R is given and the range of validity of this correlation is examined. For open loop systems with short term storage, the correlation can be used as a design method for a large range of demand temperatures, demand patterns, collector types and orientations. Comparisons are made between the solar fraction calculated by an hour by hour computer model and that predicted by the design method. Agreement is good. Further comparisons are made between measured and predicted performance figures for a large 20 m2 domestic hot water system.

It is difficult to solve analytically this type of heat transfer between a fluid and a material in the latent heat storage equipment, because the boundary condition between the fluid and the material is determined by the heat exchange between them while the temperature of the storage material remains constant. Accordingly, by a numerical solution method the heat transfer phenomena between the fluid and the material in a heat storage device of a shell-tube type using a latent heat material are analyzed and its thermal characteristics are clarified.

The effect is demonstrated of the storage vessel mass and the primary energy expenditures on the specific energy consumption of the automobile at its given fuel distance endurance. It is shown that, at present, the most expedient systems for automobiles of all types are metal hydride systems. Some aspects of thermal exchange and mass transfer in metal hydride are discussed, which allows an evaluation of the dynamic performance of storage vessels. Test results of prototype automobiles confirm that the use of metal hydride storage vessels is promising, especially if the engine operates on mixed fuel (gasoline and hydrogen). © 1984.",,"AUTOMOTIVE FUELS; HYDROGEN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021302303

Nevertheless, a good heat transfer, which is a limiting factor of the process, has to be assured. To heat this reactor, part of the hydrogen combustion energy normally wasted by the engine cooling system can be used.

Projected costs to the end user were determined for: the product of dissociated ammonia (N2+H2)/NH3, and the 99.999% pure H2 obtained by separation of the nitrogen (H2/NH3); hydrogen produced by the steam reforming of natural gas (H2/NG); electrolytic hydrogen (EH2); purchased (merchant) liquid hydrogen (LH2); OTEC (ocean thermal energy conversion) LH2; as well as OTEC NH3 and the H2 products derived from it. Future costs are projected as $ GJ-1 and as $ MBTU-1 (1980$ in 1990) using two sets of forecast energy prices. The results show that merchant LH2 was substantially higher in cost than the other options, and that until EH2 is available at the projected costs, H2/NH3 would be the preferred option for the smallest plant sizes where it is projected to be competitive with H2/NG of comparable purity. Thus, via state-of-the-art technology, industrial NH3 can now serve as a viable H2 carrier for some small-scale users. The availability of OTEC NH3 at the projected costs would substantially increase the competitive position of H2/NH3. Consideration of safety and environmental factors are among the important items listed in recommendations for future work. © 1984.",,"AMMONIA; NITROGEN; HYDROGEN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021290608

Multiple paired arterial and venous blood samples were analyzed for glucose, lactate, pyruvate, D-βhydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, glycerol and O2, and the arteriovenous differences of the concentrations were calculated. In the first three patients the substrates were measured in two successive conditions with lower and higher glucose-intake, respectively, inducing reciprocally higher and lower concentrations of blood lactate. In the fourth patient medium chain triglycerides were administered simultaneously with the glucose-containing gastric drip feeding. Lactate appeared to be taken up significantly. It consumed, if completely oxidized, between 40-50% of the total O2 uptake in most cases. Only once in one patient the uptake of lactate switched to its release, when the blood lactate level decreased to normal. D-β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate arteriovenous (AV) differences were small to negligible and these ketone bodies, therefore, did not contribute substantially to the brain's energy expenditure. Glycerol was not metabolized by the brain. Lactate thus appeared to be the second brain fuel next to glucose. It may protect the brain against fuel depletion in case of hypoglycemia. © 1984 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.",,"glycerol; lactic acid; child; congenital disorder; diagnosis; etiology; glucose 6 phosphatase deficiency; glycogen storage disease type 1; human; hypoglycemia; liver; major clinical study; methodology; nervous system; oxygen consumption; Brain; Child; Child, Preschool; Glucose; Glycogen Storage Disease Type I; Human; Hypoglycemia; Lactates; Lactic Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021277995

Used in electron beams, these insulators store charge and produce internal electric fields large enough to measurably alter the electron dose distribution in the plastic. The reading per monitor unit from a cylindrical ion chamber imbedded in a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or polystyrene phantom will increase with accumulated electron dose, the increase being detectable after about 20 Gy of 6 MeV electrons. The magnitude of the effect also depends on the type of the plastic, the thickness of the plastic, the wall thickness of the detector, the diameter and depth of the hole in the plastic, the energy of the electron beam, and the dose rate used. Effects of charge buildup have been documented elsewhere for very low energy electrons at extremely high doses and dose rates. Here we draw attention to the charging effects in plastics at the dose levels encountered in therapy dosimetry where ion chamber or other dosimeter readings may easily increase by 5% to 10% and where a phantom, once charged, will also affect subsequent readings taken in 60Co beams and high energy electron and x ray beams for periods of several days to many months. It is recommended that conducting plastic phantoms replace PMMA and polystyrene phantoms in radiation dosimetry. © 1982, American Institute of Physics for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

This suppression was seen in three separate studies and lasted at least 1 month. Food intake of these hamsters rose within 48 hr in the cold, and body weight was maintained. In contrast, hamsters which had been sedentary in the 23°C room showed a slower rise in food intake in the cold and sustained a chronic drop in body weight. In vivo fatty acid synthesis rates were greatly elevated in white and brown adipose tissue, but not liver, of exercise versus sedentary hamsters after 1 month in the cold, despite the relative inactivity of both groups throughout the cold exposure. Previous exercise training predisposes hamsters to efficient energy storage in the cold. The energy demand of the cold environment may be responsible for the decreased voluntary running. © 1984.","Cold exposure; Energy homeostasis; Fatty acid synthesis; Food intake; Syrian hamster; Voluntary exercise","animal experiment; central nervous system; cold stress; feeding behavior; metabolism; motor activity; musculoskeletal system; nonhuman; psychological aspect; Adipose Tissue; Animal; Body Weight; Brown Fat; Circadian Rhythm; Cold; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Female; Hamsters; Liver; Male; Mesocricetus; Motor Activity; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021267718

One group of exercising female hamsters, fed high fat diet, grew faster than sedentary controls. The food intake of both exercising and sedentary groups was distributed evenly through the day/night cycle, but the exercising animals took smaller, more frequent meals at night. The nycthemeral variations in plasma glucose, triglycerides, free fatty acids and liver glycogen were quite small in sedentary hamsters. In exercising hamsters, however, liver glycogen was elevated in the late daytime and depleted in the mid-to-late night. In vivo lipogenesis rates in white and brown adipose and liver were elevated by day in the exercising compared to sedentary hamsters, and were lower at night in both groups. It appears that in exercising hamsters, and to a lesser extent sedentary hamsters, the day phase is one of inactivity and fuel storage, and the night phase is one of exercise and fuel mobilization. © 1984.","Exercise; Food intake; Golden hamster; Lipogenesis; Liver glycogen; Meal patterns; Nycthemeral cycles; Plasma metabolites","animal experiment; circadian rhythm; diet; exercise; food intake; glycogen liver level; liver; nonhuman; Animal; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Circadian Rhythm; Eating; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Exertion; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Feeding Behavior; Glycerol; Hamsters; Homeostasis; Ketones; Mesocricetus; Motor Activity; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021265009

High power levels are required for adequate resolution, which often precludes the use of mobile x ray systems for stop motion exposures. Currently available mobile systems use (1) 90 V nickelâcadmium batteries capable of 120 A, (2) a power line of 220 V ac, 60 Hz capable of about 100 A, or (3) a capacitor discharge unit using 1.0 Î¼F capacitors and limited to 17 mAs equivalent output (compared to three phase systems at 100 kVp). In each case, instantaneous power is usually limited to 10 kW. An alternative means which now appears to be a practical power source for mobile x ray systems is the flywheel energy storage system. A 5 kg flywheel has been constructed which runs at 10 000 rpm and stores 25 000 J while drawing only a few hundred watts to bring the system up to speed. When coupled to an aircraft alternator, pulsed power levels of 25 kW have been achieved. The aircraft alternator also has the advantage of high frequency output which has permitted the use of smaller high voltage transformers. This system permits the generation of powerful x rays using low power sources, such as single automobile batteries, common 115 V outlets, or electrical sources of poor regulation such as found in third world countries. © 1982, American Institute of Physics for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Rates of fatty acid synthesis were determined in vivo by measuring the incorporation of tritium from 3H2O into tissue fatty acids. At the end of the training programme, both sedentary and trained mice were assigned to either exercising or resting groups. The results obtained show that both training and exercise affected the rates of fatty acid synthesis, regardless of whether the results are expressed per gram of tissue or per whole tissue. Training led to significant decreases in the rates of synthesis in the liver, interscapular brown tissue, epididymal white adipose tissue, and the remaining carcass, particularly in resting mice. The rates of fatty acid synthesis in the major lipogenic tissues were also lower during exercise than under sedentary conditions. The reduction in synthesis in brown adipose tissue was noteworthy in view of the high capacity of this tissue for fatty acid synthesis.

CHO oxidation and conversion to fat was significantly less in the high-fat diet group (222 ± 5 g) than in the mixed (300 ± 13 g) or high-CHO diet (331 ± 7 g) groups, resulting in a greater glycogen storage in the high-fat (278 ± 6 g) than in the other two groups (197 ± 11 and 170 ± 2 g).

Since chemotaxis is energy dependent, we studied energy metabolism in stored neutrophils. We and others have reported that stored neutrophils have a defect in their energy metabolism. We found that defective adenosine triphosphate maintenance in stored neutrophils was occult in resting cells, but was unmasked by an energy‐intensive stimulus, phagocytosis. In studies reported here, we sought to determine if defective adenosine triphosphate maintenance during granulocyte storage was related to altered glycolytic enzyme activity. We studied the activity of glycolytic enzymes in fresh and stored, resting and stimulated (opsonized zymosan) neutrophils. The following enzyme activities showed no major changes during storage, in resting or stimulated neutrophils: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glucose phosphate isomerase, triose phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglyceromutase, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase. In contrast, pyruvate kinase activity consistently increased during storage. In 6 units, pyruvate kinase activity increased by 75 percent after 24 hours of storage at room temperature and by 198 percent after 48 hours. The storage‐ associated increase in pyruvate kinase activity was not inhibited by cycloheximide. Stimulation of neutrophils by phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan also produced striking increases in the pyruvate kinase activity of both fresh and stored cells. Additional studies indicated that the increases in pyruvate kinase activity observed during storage and after phagocytosis were associated with an increase in the availability of pyruvate kinase activity in the supernatant fraction of neutrophil sonicates.

As part of this research program, five serpentine earth coil experiments were operated between December 1978 and September 1981. Heat was added to or removed from the earth coils according to weekly schedules based on computer simulations of solar-assisted and stand-alone, ground-coupled heat pump systems operated in the local (New York) climate. Each earth coil was operated according to a different control strategy. This paper presents experimental results from these experiments for the period December 1978 to April 1981, and compares these results to those generated by a comptuer model, GROCS, developed at BNL. The model is found to provide a reasonably good fit to the data, for the most part, using the experimental undisturbed soil thermal properties. In some cases, the use of a lower soil thermal conductivity provides a better fit, particularly during summer months when heat was added to the ground. Thus, given soil properties, GROCS can be used to predict earth coil performance. If given earth coil performance, the model can predict soil thermal properties. Serpentine earth coils are found to be suitable to provide auxiliary heat or heat rejection for solar heat pump systems. In fact, earth coil-based, stand-alone, ground-coupled heat pump systems can provide all heat needed for winter space heating and all heat rejection required for summer space cooling with no need for any auxiliary heating. Subfreezing winter operation is necessary for shallow earth coils in cold climates. No deleterious effects to the ground were observed from the long-term operation of these experiments. © 1984 by ASME.",,"COMPUTERS - Applications; SOILS - Heat Transfer; SOLAR ENERGY - Energy Utilization; GROUND COUPLING; SERPENTINE EARTH COILS; HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021219709

Although the conclusion is drawn that a paraffin wax store in this particular application would not replace water as a storage medium, other conclusions are discussed which would apply to the design and modelling of wax storage subsystems in other applications. © 1984.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; HOT WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS; WAXES; DETAILED HEAT TRANSFER MODEL; INFINITE HEAT TRANSFER MODEL; SIMPLIFIED CONSTANT NUSSELT NUMBER MODEL; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021215969

It is known that a decrease in pH due to accelerated production of lactic acid in hypoxic conditions is a major cause for loss of platelet viability. In the current studies, we have measured metabolic parameters such as O2 and glucose consumption rates and CO2 and lactic acid production rates. We have also determined the O2 and CO2 transport capacities of various containers and the buffering capacity of plasma. The O2 consumption rate was 1.10 ± 0.16 (SD) nmol/min/109 platelets. In well-oxygenated systems, lactic acid formation was 1.74 ± 0.12 nmol/min/mL PC for PCs with a platelet count of 1 to 2 x 109/mL; and 0.52 mol of glucose was consumed per 1 mol lactic acid produced. In a completely oxygen-free system, lactic acid production increased 5-8-fold. These calculations suggest that 85% of energy generation is derived through oxidative metabolism and that glucose may not be the primary substrate for this metabolism. Bicarbonate concentration, initially 22.1 ± 1.6 mEq/L, decreased 1.41 ± 0.18 nEq/mim/mL PC for PCs with counts 1 to 2 x 109 platelets/mL. The loss of bicarbonate was caused by displacement by lactic acid and as a consequence of spontaneous CO2 efflux from the container. CO2 production, 2.3 ± 0.4 nmol/min/109 platelets, was derived from oxygen consumption and the CO2 liberated from bicarbonate as it was consumed. A rapid fall in pH to levels below 7.0 (22 °C) took place when the bicarbonate concentration fell below 5 mEq/L as lactate concentrations reached 20 to 25 mmol/L. A further increase in lactate concentration from 25 mmol/L to 40 mmol/L correlated with a further fall in pH to 5.8. Thus, the ultimate storage life of a PC is determined by continuous lactate production and the fixed buffering capacity of plasma and by the glucose concentration of the PC. With knowledge of these parameters, methods for predicting pH as a function of time, platelet count, and O2 and CO2 transport capability of the container have been developed as guidelines for future work.",,"lactic acid; blood and hemopoietic system; human; human cell; thrombocyte metabolism; thrombocyte preservation; viability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021209418

Such systems can make use of the expensive collectors which are, in any case, installed for water and space heating. In this paper the cooling of a prototype house, in Kufra, is reported. Starting with measured radiation and ambient data, calculations are performed on an hourly basis to determine the cooling load, radiation in the collector plane, heat delivered by the collectors and the heat stored in or discharged from the storage tank. Three different types of collectors with varying efficiencies are considered. These collectors are of the evacuated tube, selective coated and black painted types.

The dynamic performance and its optimization as a large scale solar energy collection and long term storage system have been discussed. Numerical computations, corresponding to the data of solar radiation and ambient air temperature of New Delhi during 1974, have been made for two modes of operation, viz (i) constant flow rate of heat removal fluid, and (ii) zone of heat retrieval remaining at constant temperature. At a typical flow rate of 10-3kg/m2s, optimal heat retrieval efficiencies of 32.4% (at non-convective zone depth, l2, of 1.25 m), 25.2% (at l2 = 0.75 m) and 21.5% (at l12 = 0.6 m) are predicted for bottom reflectivities of 0.0, 0.5 and 0.8, respectively. Furthermore, the variability in flow rate required to keep the temperature of the heat extraction zone constant is less for higher temperatures of the heat extraction zone, and the effect of R is found to be insignificant. In the mode of heat retrieval at constant temperature, the calculations of Sodha et al. [Energy Res. 5, 321 (1981)] for the case of a completely absorbing surface with no bottom reflection (α = 1.0, R = 0.0) have yielded the optimal heat retrieval efficiency of 35.5 and 26.5% at extraction temperatures of 40 and 100°C, respectively. However, for the realistic case of a partially absorbing bottom (α = 0.9 and R = 0.0), these efficiencies are predicted to go down to 32.5 and 23.5%, respectively. The effect of bottom reflectivity on heat collection efficiency has further revealed the fact that the heat collection efficiency decreases with an increase in bottom reflectivity. For a typical value of R(= 0.6) corresponding to the realistic case of a partially absorbing bottom (α = 0.9), optimum efficiencies decrease further to 22.3 and 12.4% at collection temperatures of 40 and 100°C, respectively. © 1984.","Bottom reflectivity; Effiency; Heat extraction; Salt gradient; Solar pond","SOLAR ENERGY - Applications; WATER HEATERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021204180

Decreasing temperature reduced the resting effluxes of42K,34Cl, and24Na (active and passive) from control and DOCH in parallel fashion. The slope of the Arrhenius plots (activation energies) and the transition temperatures at which major changes in slope occurred were similar in controls and DOCH. In contrast to the results for resting effluxes, the temperature dependence for the effects of norepinephrine (NE) on contraction and onβK and36Cl effluxes in DOCH differed from controls. At 20° C, the responses to NE were either abolished or greatly suppressed in DOCH, as compared to controls, while no significant differences between the two groups were observed at 30° C. These results indicate that alterations in resting42K,36Cl, and24Na effluxes in DOCH may result from an increased number of transport sites in the membranes of vascular smooth muscle. The concept that alterations occurred in the integral components of the membrane is also supported by the observation that increased resting42K and36Cl effluxes in DOCH at 37° C persisted in aortas that had undergone cold storage for 2 days before incubation at 37° C. The altered temperature dependence for the effects of NE on DOCH, compared to controls, indicates that the involvement of agonist-receptor-membrane events may be dissociated from the alterations in resting ionic fluxes. © 1984 American Heart Association, Inc.","Activation energy; Active transport; Chloride; Doca hypertension; Norepinephrine; Potassium; Sodium; Temperature; Vascular smooth muscle","chlorine 36; deoxycorticosterone; deoxycorticosterone acetate; noradrenalin; potassium; potassium 42; radioisotope; sodium 24; animal experiment; aorta; blood pressure; cardiovascular system; great blood vessel; hypertension; ion transport; muscle; nonhuman; peripheral vascular system; rat; temperature dependence; vascular smooth muscle; Animal; Aorta; Biological Transport; Chlorides; Desoxycorticosterone; Freezing; Hypertension; Male; Norepinephrine; Potassium; Preservation, Biological; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Sodium; Stimulation, Chemical; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021200866

The deeper pond can also act as an interseasonal storage device. A pond operating at a location in Singapore attains a fairly high temperature but the temperature requirements are also high for the desired applications such as space cooling in conjunction with a refrigeration cycle. Although a pond at Kew attains a lower temperature compared with a pond at Singapore, it can supply considerable amounts of thermal energy to support a space heating load.

The presence of hydrogen in such materials can result in a degradation of mechanical properties. The severity of the degradation depends on the characteristics of the particular material, the amount of hydrogen occluded and the distribution of the dissolved hydrogen. Thus, a knowledge of the metallurgical and mechanical effects of hydrogen occlusion is essential for designers and operators of hydrogen energy systems. This is particularly true for systems related to the production, storage, transportation and utilization of hydrogen fuels. This paper reviews aspects of hydrogen entry into metals, its diffusive mobility within the material and its effect on mechanical properties.

The projected performance of fuel-cell vehicles is comparable to that of the internal combustion and diesel engine vehicles but with the additional advantages of higher fuel efficiency, particularly with synfuels from coal. The ideal fuel for a fuel-cell power plant for electric vehicles is methanol. This fuel is reformed to hydrogen, which combines with oxygen from the air in an acid electrolyte (phosphoric, solid polymer, or superacid) fuel cell to produce electricity. Though the phosphoric acid fuel cell is in the most advanced state of development (mainly for power generation applications), the solid polymer and superacid electrolyte fuel cells are more promising for the transportation application because of the faster oxygen reduction kinetics (and hence potential for higher power densities) and shorter start-up times. Alkaline electrolyte fuel cells can be used only with pure hydrogen (which causes a weight or energy penalty for any of the methods it can be carried on board the vehicle), but have the best potential for minimizing or eliminating noble metal requirements. The paper summarizes needed areas of research (i.e. reduction or elimination of noble metal loading, finding CO-tolerant electrocatalysts, finding less expensive solid polymer electrolytes, synthesis and elucidation of higher molecular weight superacids) to advance fuel-cell technology for vehicular applications. © 1984.",,"ELECTROCHEMISTRY; STORAGE BATTERY VEHICLES; FUEL CELLS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021180982

Biomass yields were approximately 4.3 tonne/ha (1.9 ton/acre) but increased plant density is expected to raise these yields considerably. The milkweeds were harvested with standard haying equipment and baled as with alfalfa hay. Storage tests in ambient conditions indicated that the non-polar extractables were stable whereas the polar extractables declined approximately 40% after about 2 months and stabilized at that level after five months. Storage in dry conditions resulted in only small losses. The non-polar extracts consist principally of α- and ß-amyrins and their acetate esters. The methanol extracts contain mostly sucrose and inositol. Milkweed extractives are compared to fossil fuels and cracking to liquid fuels is discussed along with various alternative uses for the extracted residue. The use of milkweed as a new crop depends on weed control, increased yields, product development and the development of commercial extraction and purification technology. © 1984.","Asclepias speciosa; economics; energy crop; milkweed","ENERGY RESOURCES; METHANOL; PULP MATERIALS; WEED CONTROL; BIOMASS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021168942

The single-pass open-loop design thermally ""decouples"" collectors from storage, hence insuring that collectors always heat the coldest fluid possible and that stored heat can be completely depleted by the nighttime load. So the single-pass open-loop design, in spite of the relatively low flow rates entailed, operates at higher system efficiency than conventional system designs. One solved example for an an industrial hot water application shows that the single-pass open-loop design delivers about 30 per cent more useful energy with roughly 30 per cent less storage than the conventional design. Moreover, storage tanks do not have to stand high pressures and can thus be significantly cheaper than in conventional systems. The effects of collector operating time, heat exchangers, and secondary system losses are also treated. The new method is extended to cover systems that require weekend storage. The introduction of weekend storage may be cost effective because it enables the designer to reduce collector area without reducing the yearly useful energy delivered by the system. © 1984.",,"HEAT EXCHANGERS; HOT WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021156269

The objective of this research was to determine whether phenytoin inhibited the transport of catecholamines into storage granules. This was tested by examining the effects of phenytoin (0.05 to 0.4 mM) on the ability of (-)-[3H] norepinephrine to be transported into chromaffin granule 'ghosts' isolated from bovine adrenal glands. Our results indicated that phenytoin, but not phenobarbital, inhibited catecholamine transport in a dose-dependent manner with 50% inhibition occurring at a phenytoin concentration of 0.2 mM. Kinetic analysis of the effects of phenytoin on this transport process indicated that phenytoin was a competitive inhibitor of catecholamine transport with an approximate K(i) of 0.3 mM. Furthermore, phenytoin did not inhibit the Mg adenosine triphosphatase required for providing the energy source for the catecholamine transport process, nor did it dissipate the membrane potential generated by this enzyme. The competitive inhibition of catecholamine transport produced by phenytoin is probably not related to the anticonvulsant effects of the drug as it occurred at greater than therapeutic concentrations.

The energy expenditure of the subjects was continuously measured over 24 h with a respiration chamber, and the spontaneous activity was assessed by a radar system. A new approach was used to obtain the integrated thermogenic response to the three meals ingested over the day (from 8:30 AM to 10:30 PM). This method allows to subtract the energy expended for physical activity from total energy expenditure and to calculate the integral dietary-induced thermogenesis as the difference between the energy expended without physical activity and basal metabolic rate. The thermogenic response to the three meals (expressed in percentage of the total energy ingested) was found to be blunted in obese women (8.7 ± 0.8%) as compared with that of controls (14.8 ± 1.1%). There was an inverse correlation between the percentage body fat and the diet-induced thermogenesis (r = -0.61, p < 0.001). In addition, the relative increase in diurnal urinary norepinephrine excretion was lower in obese than in the control subjects. It is concluded that a low overall thermogenic response to feeding may be a contributing factor for energy storage in some obese subjects; a blunted response of the sympathetic nervous system could explain this low thermogenic response.",,"noradrenalin; basal metabolic rate; controlled study; energy expenditure; exercise; human; human experiment; normal human; nutrition; obesity; thermogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021151925

Three distinct approaches have been taken to the problem; however, all three have recently been shown to be equivalent and to give identical results. Most earlier calculations have been carried out using AMO or AM1.2 solar spectral distributions. In this paper, we use AM1.5 spectra and concentrate primarily on the effects of variation of atmospheric conditions on calculated power-conversion efficiencies. The conditions we examine are: absorber temperature, total solar intensity, air mass, ozone and water-vapor content of the atmosphere, and the turbidity and visibility of the atmosphere. In addition we have computed efficiencies for the diffuse component of global solar radiation as an approximation to turbid conditions. The results are displayed as plots of solar conversion efficiency vs. bandgap wavelength for each set of conditions. Conclusions are then drawn as to the important variants which can serve to guide the design of photochemical and/or photovoltaic systems for a given environment. © 1984.",,"ENERGY STORAGE; THERMODYNAMICS; SOLAR ENERGY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021138590

The objective of the study was to determine the performance of the PV arrays at decreased insolation, the effects of air preheat by solar thermal energy on heat pump operation, and cooling system performance under two different configurations. During the entire operation, the PV arrays converted 4.7 per cent (9.5 MWh) of the incident solar insolation to d.c. power, of which 54.6 per cent was used by the residence. This contributed 23.4 per cent of the total house electrical demand. The remaining 45.4 per cent of the output was fed to the utility, indicating the arrays and the heat pump were not properly sized with each other. Based on results from the winter heating operation, it is shown that for the particular heating system consdered, the best performance is attained when the solar heating is used alone. By using the heat pump as a booster, the remaining available solar energy left in the storage tank can be used with good seasonal performance factor. Summer cooling operation consisted of two sequential cooling configurations. In the first cooling test, the heat pump was operated to either the house or storage when the PV array generation level was greater than the energy demand of the heat pump and associated equipment. When the array output level was less than the cooling system demand, the operating strategy was that of an off-peak cooling operation to chill the water storage. Utilization of chilled water storage was not realized in the first cooling test because of the inherent inefficient design of the Tri-X coil. The capacity at low-speed heat pump operation was too small to effect significant cooling of the water loop; whereas high-speed heat pump operation in attempting to chill water (fan operation absent) caused frosting of the coil. The heat pump was utilized only to maintain chilled water storage in the second cooling test, without heat transfer through the Tri-X coil. Cooling system performance obtained in cooling test 2 using the Ametex exchanger was considerably improved over the test 2 performance with the Tri-X coil. © 1984 Pergamon Press Ltd.",,"AIR CONDITIONING - Solar Energy Systems; HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS - Performance; PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS - Performance; SOLAR CELLS - Arrays; SOLAR ENERGY - Applications; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021122392

The vehicle used in the project was a 1979 Buick Century sedan with a 3.8.1, displacement turbocharged V6 engine and an automatic transmission. The vehicle had a fuel economy for driving in the high altitude Los Alamos area that was equivalent to 2.4 km/l of liquid hydrogen or 8.9 km/l of gasoline on an equivalent energy basis. About 22% less energy was required using hydrogen rather than gasoline to go a given distance based on the Environmental Protection Agency estimate of 7.2 km/l of gasoline for this vehicle. At the end of the project the engine had been operated for 138 h and the car driven 3633 km during the 17 months that the vehicle was operated on hydrogen. Two types of onboard liquid-hydrogen storage tanks were tested in the vehicle; the first was an aluminium Dewar with a liquid-hydrogen capacity of 1101.; the second was a Dewar with an aluminium outer vessel, two copper vapor-cooled thermal radiation shields, and a stainless steel inner vessel with a liquid-hydrogen capacity of 1551. The Buick had an unrefueled range of about 274 km with the first liquid-hydrogen tank and about 362 km with the second. The Buick was fueled at least 65 times involving a minimum of 8.1 kl of liquid hydrogen using various liquid-hydrogen storage Dewars at Los Alamos and a semiautomatic refueling station. A refueling time of 9 min was achieved, and liquid-hydrogen losses during refueling were measured. The project has demonstrated that liquid-hydrogen storage onboard a vehicle, and its refueling, can be accomplished over an extended period without any major difficulties; nevertheless, appropriate testing is still needed to quantitatively address the question of safety for liquid-hydrogen storage onboard a vehicle. © 1984.",,"HYDROGEN; AUTOMOTIVE FUELS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021121369

The innovation characteristics of active solar systems are measured, in part, by economic measures, reliability, and communicability of the qualities of the system among others. The active solar systems industry is characterized as emerging, struggling, underfinanced and diverse. A questionnaire and interview survey of 97 solar industry firms was accomplished.

The free energy potentials (free energy reduction per unit area of contact) for red cell-vesicle aggregation were derived from measurement of the extent of encapsulation of a vesicle by a red blood cell and a relation for surface affinity based on elastic energy storage in deformation of the red cell membrane. The free energy potentials (affinities) for vesicle-vesicle aggregation were determined from measurements of the tension induced in an initially flaccid vesicle membrane as it adhered to another vesicle. Vesicles were formed from mixtures of egg lecithin (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS). For PC: PS ratios less than 2.6 : 1, no aggregation with red cells was detected in 130 mM NACl. In the range of PC : PS ratios from 4 : 1 to 2.6 : 1, vesicle aggregation with red cells only occurred within a window of concentrations from 1 to 8 wt. % of dextran. The peak affinity for red cell-vesicle aggregation increased with PC content. Values up to 1-2 × 10-2 ergs/cm2 were measured. For pure PC vesicles, the free energy potential for vesicle aggregation with red cells appeared to increase without limit at higher dextran concentrations. By comparison, the free energy potentials for aggregation of two PC : PS vesicles showed a linear increase with concentration of dextran. The values were about 1.5 × 10-1 ergs/cm2 at 10 wt. % dextran in 120 mM NaCl for pure PC and decreased as the surface charge (PS) was increased. This approach was also used to determine the free energy potential associated with Van der Waal's interactions between neutral lipid vesicles. The results yielded values in the range of 1-2 × 10-2 ergs/cm2. © 1984.",,"DRUG PRODUCTS; DRUG DELIVERY; ENERGETICS OF RED BLOOD CELL; GLUCOSE POLYMER (DEXTRAN) SOLUTIONS; LIPID VESICLE-VESICLE AGGREGATION; BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020797521

This limitation arises from the increasing resistance and inductance of the rails with increasing rail gun length. The energy efficiency of a rail gun system from the primary energy store to the kinetic energy of the projectile can be improved as compared to the simple railgun in some applications. This is accomplished by a reduction of the stored magnetic field energy in the bore of the railgun at the end of a shot and reduction of the resistive losses in the rails. The improved system performance of the distributed railguns over the simple breech-fed railguns is achieved at the expense of greater system complexity. The only distributed-type railguns that have been built to date are distributed-energy-store (DES) railguns. These systems presently use capacitors as the primary energy store, which allows the use of closing switches to initiate current from each of the stores. In this paper a new type of railgun, the distributed-current-feed (DCF) railgun, is presented. The DCF railgun system is a compromise in system complexity and efficiency between the DES railguns and the simple breech-fed railguns. Also, the DCF railgun utilizes closing switches in such a manner as to allow the use of a variety of primary power supplies, including homopolar generators (HPGs), for such electromagnetic propulsion tasks as space launches. © 1984 IEEE",,"ENERGY STORAGE - Equipment; HOMOPOLAR GENERATORS; RAILGUNS; ROCKET ENGINES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020716122

Thrust for a given current can be a hundred times higher than in a railgun, but the current must be synchronized with projectile motion. The voltage required to do so increases with velocity, and high voltage commutation capability represents the technological limit to launch velocity.

The magnetic cores of the audio heads were made of ferrite, Sendust, and an amorphous metal. The magnetic tapes included a 7-Fe203 tape, a metal particle tape, and an evaporated metal tape. These last two are generally considered to be the ultimate compositions for high density magnetic recording. The ferrite head generally gave the low coefficients of sliding friction in contact with any type of magnetic tape. The amorphous metal head exhibited the greatest wear, despite its considerably higher hardness. The worn surfaces of the various magnetic materials were observed with an scanning electron microscope (SEM). It was concluded that the mechanism of wear by both the 7-Fe203 tape and the metal particle tape is not entirely due to the abrasive action of the magnetic powder in the tapes, but is also partially due to adhesion. Wear by the evaporated metal tape, however, is caused mainly by adhesion. The surface of an amorphous ribbon rubbed by tapes was examined with the reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) method. The results suggest that the surface was partially crystallized during the running. © 1984 IEEE",,"MAGNETIC TAPE; MAGNETIC HEADS; DATA STORAGE, MAGNETIC",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020715551

To illustrate the property-device relationship, we select several representative magnetic applications including commercial frequency transformers, sensors, transducers, and magnetic switches.

(1) the straight-through system with the water driven by the pressure of the mains through a heat exchanger in which it is heated by the warmer water in the solar-thermal storage tank, whenever demand for service hot water is created, and 2. (2) the recirculation system in which a temperature-difference-controlled recirculation loop is used between the solar-thermal storage tank and the auxiliary (or backup) service hot water tank. The latter configuration which needs to have these additional components (controller, pump, and piping) and may thus also be less reliable, is more frequently used when the solar system is to supply both space heat and service hot water, because it is generally though to provide a larger fraction of the hot water from the solar source. A computer program, combining TRNSYS with a comprehensive present-value life-cycle model and an optimization link was prepared and run for a representative year in Philadelphia to determine the thermal storage, heat exchanger, and controller-setting combination which produces the minimal present-value life-cycle costs. To provide more generality to the results, these calculations were repeated for a wide range of temperature levels and transient patterns of the solar-collector-heated water in storage and of the service hot water demand patterns, quantities, and temperatures. Apart from some uncommon cases, it was found that the straight-through solar heating system is better than the recirculation one with respect to all comparison criteria: present-value life-cycle cost, auxiliary energy consumption, and reliability. © 1984.",,"COMPUTER SIMULATION - Applications; ECONOMICS - Analysis; ENERGY STORAGE - Applications; HEATING - Hot Water Systems; RECIRCULATION HOT WATER SYSTEMS; SOLAR NONELECTRIC APPLICATIONS; STRAIGHT-THROUGH HOT WATER SYSTEMS; THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE; WATER HEATERS",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020495664

The supposed supplementary preflaring conditions to have HFl may be either that the preflaring conditions have not been destroyed by the first flare (and then what mechanism has stopped the first and triggered the second ?) or that the preflaring conditions have been destroyed and rebuilt (and then, how ?). The analysis of data related to some selected active regions AR by the members of the working group, and the earlier works on HFl, may be used simultaneously to investigate the differences between one set of HFl and the others, the location of their sites and the evolution of HFl productive AR. This study brings the appearance of new footpoints from one flare to the following, the behaviour of cool arches (surging arches) leading to information on the changes of the magnetic configuration, and to peculiar characteristics of HFl, oif 2nd, 3rd in the time order concerning the chromospheric transition zone or coronal regions. The time delay between two consecutive homologous flares appears very quickly as an essential parameter to study homology. It was found that every set of flares (same type of site) is able to produce ""rafales"" of homologous flares, i.e. two, three, four, oir more flares with Δt in the range of one hour or less. The observations show no great chantes in macroscopic photospheric patterns (B, V) during this H flaring period. They lead to compare their temporal variation curves of flare brightness. A quantitative brightness parameter of homology relation has been defined. Some scale changes have also been detected in the dynamic spectrum of the site, and it is in good agreement with a very interesting theoretical suggestion made by P. Sturrock to produce such ""rafales"". It may be shown that the closely consecutive time-homologous flares (CCHF) or ""rafales"" represent a good tool to analyse the critical conditions related to the origin and the amount of energy, mechanism of storage and release, necessary and, perhaps, sufficient conditions. New statistical results, applied to the different selected homologous flare active regions are presented and show the existence in homologous flaring areas of a ""pivot"" of previous filaments interpreted as a signature of an anomaly in the Solar rotation. © 1984.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0013285513

This is confirmed here, and the theory is extended to include animals that store energy, prior to a jump. Factors affecting jump range for animals of different sizes are discussed. For animals that store energy, a power amplification factor may be calculated, if the animal's range, mass and leg length are known. Alternatively, range may be predicted for an animal of known design. Animals that show a marked increase in jump range with an increase in body size are probably energy storers. The range of large jumping animals will be limited by their ability to produce energy. In order to jump further, a large animal would need to give over a greater proportion of its body mass to jumping muscle. Small animals will be limited by their ability to produce power, but this problem can be overcome by increasing the relative length of the jumping legs or by introducing an energy storage system. Animals showing increased range with increased body size probably use energy storage systems. My thanks are due to Dr H. C. Bennet‐Clark and Dr J.

They all involve measurement of available energy R-G, R being net radiative flux and G the heat flux into the surface. When estimates from forests on an hourly to daily basis are made, the contribution from canopy heat storage should be included in G. The energy budget/Bowen ratio method requires no detailed specification of surface properties but involves relatively complex instrumentation to measure vertical differences of temperature and humidity in the air. With the exclusion of eddy covariance, it is potentially the most accurate method and should be applicable for crops and forests, over a wide range of evaporation conditions. The residual energy budget method requires accurate estimates of atmospheric resistance and measurement of surface temperature. Where the latter is available (by airborne radiometer) the method is most reliable for surfaces of low roughness or in conditions of high evaporation. The combination method incorporates both energy budget and bulk relationships to eliminate surface temperature. It introduces surface resistance, which must be parameterized in terms of soil, plant species and atmospheric quantities, with allowance made for sub-canopy fluxes and evporation of intercepted rainfall. The method is suitable for estimating daily or monthly evaporation using standard atmospheric observations. The eddy covariance method is not yet sufficiently developed to measure E reliably at the operational level over long periods of time and over less-than uniform terrain but, of all the methods to be described, it has the greatest potential to do so. Methods based on eddy covariance, wind and other profiles are more appropriate to research investigations and, with the above, are described in the text. © 1984.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010367139

The metal-hydrogen and H-H interactions, which in all cases result in a low energy structure in the density of states, are analysed by means of a partial wave decomposition within the framework of the augmented plane wave method; this allows us both to gain insight into the preferential interactions of hydrogen with each of the two metal components and to predict the main features of the corresponding X-ray emission spectra. We discuss the change in the general position of the Fermi level in the metal d bands which occurs on hydrogenation of FeTi. The theoretical results are used to interpret successfully some experimental data for the electronic specific heat, the magnetic susceptibility and the Mössbauer isomer shifts. We found that cubic Mg2NiH4 is a semiconductor, unlike the hydrides of FeTi which are metallic. This is due to complete filling of the four low energy metal-hydrogen-induced bands and the narrow nickel d bands. The consequences of these results on the hydrogen absorption capacity of intermetallic compounds of the same family are discussed. © 1984.",,"HYDROGEN - Storage; MAGNESIUM COMPOUNDS - Hydrogenation; NICKEL COMPOUNDS - Hydrogenation; AUGMENTED PLANE WAVE; HYDRIDES; PARTIAL WAVE DECOMPOSITION; Intermetallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002672917

The observed character of magnetic shear and its involvement in the buildup and release of flare energy are reviewed and illustrated with emphasis on recent results from the Marshall Space Flight Center vector magnetograph. It is pointed out that the magnetic field in active regions can become sheared by several processes, including shear flow in the photosphere, flux emergence, magnetic reconnection, and flux submergence. Modeling studies of the buildup of stored magnetic energy by shearing are reported which show ample energy storage for flares. Observational evidence is presented that flares are triggered when the field shear reaches a critical degree, in qualitative agreement with some theoretical analyses of sheared force-free fields. Finally, a scenario is outlined for the class of flares resulting from large-scale magnetic shear; the overall instability driving the energy release results from positive feedback between reconnection and eruption of the sheared field. © 1984.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002664441

CHO oxidation and conversion to fat was significantly less in the high-fat diet group (222 +/- 5 g) than in the mixed (300 +/- 13 g) or high-CHO diet (331 +/- 7 g) groups, resulting in a greater glycogen storage in the high-fat (278 +/- 6 g) than in the other two groups (197 +/- 11 and 170 +/- 2 g). Net lipogenesis occurred sooner and lasted longer in the high-CHO group, amounting to 0.8 +/- 0.5, 3.4 +/- 0.6, and 9 +/- 1 g of lipid synthesized in the high-fat, mixed, and high-CHO groups, respectively. The thermic effect of the CHO load was 5.2 +/- 0.5% on the high-fat, 6.5 +/- 0.4% on the mixed diet, and 8.6 +/- 0.4% on the high-CHO diet. Significant relationships were demonstrated between the postabsorptive nonprotein respiratory quotient and net lipogenesis after the CHO load (r = 0.82) and between net lipogenesis and the increase in energy expenditure (r = 0.71). It is concluded that the antecedent diet influences the amount of net lipogenesis and the magnitude of thermogenesis after a large CHO test meal. However, lipogenesis remains too limited even after such large CHO intakes to cause an increase in the body's fat content.",,"glucose; lipid; palmitic acid; palmitic acid derivative; adult; article; biosynthesis; caloric intake; calorimetry; carbohydrate diet; diet restriction; energy metabolism; human; male; metabolism; thermoregulation; Adult; Body Temperature Regulation; Calorimetry; Dietary Carbohydrates; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Fasting; Glucose; Human; Lipids; Male; Palmitic Acid; Palmitic Acids; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002590185

The circadian rhythm in net CO2 uptake in gasexchange measurements and its disappearance at high irradiances was confirmed by oscillating rates of14CO2 incorporation. At 10-30 W m-2 a markedly circadian oscillation in the14CO2-uptake rate was measured; with increasing energy fluence rate the oscillation levelled off at a constant high uptake rate. The labelling patterns obtained during the 10 min of14CO2 fixation indicated that the rhythm of CO2 exchange is the consequence of a rhythmic behaviour in the C4 pathway of CO2 fixation. During the mininum of14CO2 uptake no C4 products were labelled; however, substantial amounts of label were transferred to C4 products during the peaks of14CO2 uptake. Metabolism of C3 and C4 products was also studied in pulsechase experiments at different points of the circadian cycle. In bright light (100 W m-2), when the14CO2 uptake was constantly high, the transfer of label into C4 products (malic acid) was high in spite of the fact that the malate pool is known to be reduced to a permanently low level under these conditions. This led us to the conclusion that it is not the capacity of the phosphoenolpyruvatecarboxylase-mediated CO2 fixation but rather the storage of malic acid in the vacuole that is disturbed under bright-light conditions when the circadian oscillation levelled off. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon dioxide fixation; Circadian rhythm; Crassulacean acid metabolism; Kalanchoë",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002087442

Advantages of the stack method for treatment of straw with ammonia are simplicity, cheapness (subsidized in Norway), storage at high moisture content, weed seeds killed (wild oats), nitrogen enrichment. Disadvantages are the relatively low energy value of the product and the release of ammonia in the barn (air pollution). Observations from feeding trials and practical experience in Norway can be summarized as follows: 1. - The organic matter digestibility of straw can be increased by 8-12 percentage units (sometimes more) as a result of ammonia treatment. 2. - The treatment increases the nitrogen content of the straw by 8-10 g kg-1. 3. - Ammonia treatment increases the intake of straw. 4. - Ammonia-treated straw has a nutritive value similar to that of low-quality hay. 5. - Ammonia-treated straw can make up the major part of the diet of wintering sheep. 6. - Ammonia-treated straw may be used as the only roughage for cattle from the end of the calf period (4-6 months). 7. - In intensive beef production, 3-4 kg/day of concentrates is necessary together with the ammonia-treated straw to obtain a daily gain of 1.0-1.2 kg. The animals will then eat 4-6 kg/day of ammonia-treated straw, depending on their live weight and the quality of the straw. 8. - In heifers, a lower daily gain is required and hence less concentrate is needed. A daily straw intake of 5-7 kg can be achieved. 9. - If the quality of the ammoniated straw is good, it can make up most of the diet of steers. Particularly in the second winter feeding period, 1-2-year-old steers can take large quantities, 8-11 kg, of ammonia-treated straw per day. 10. - Because of its low energy value, ammonia-treated straw has little potential in the feeding of high yielding dairy cows. The use of appreciable amounts of NH3-straw in the rations of such animals can only be justified when the diet is otherwise lacking in fibre content. © 1984.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001873505

The survey presented here outlines the early historical development in this field, describes the basic ideas governing the kinetics of polarized particles in electromagnetic fields and shows how these have evolved into the current description of polarized-beam behaviour. Orbital motion of particles influences their spin precession, and depolarization of a beam can result from excitation of spin resonances by orbit errors and oscillations. Electrons and positrons are additionally influenced by the quantized character of synchrotron radiation, which not only provides a polarizing mechanism but also enhances depolarizing effects. Progress in the theoretical formulation of these phenomena has clarified the details of the physical processes and suggested improved methods of compensating spin resonances. Full use of polarized beams for high-energy physics with storage rings requires spin totators to produce longitudinal polarization in the interaction regions. Variants of these schemes, dubbed Siberian snakes, provide a curious precession topology which can substantially reduce depolarization in the high-energy range. Efficient polarimetry is an essential requirement for implementing polarized beams, whose utility for physics can be enhanced by various methods of spin manipulation. © 1984.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001811867

Combining the Monteith transpiration equation with both uptake from a single-layered root zone and change in internal storage of the plant, we have explicitly solved the continuity equation for water flux in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. The canopy temperatures are obtained from the energy balance equation. The scaling theory is used to model the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties, and dynamic equations for plant storage water and root-zone soil water are used to simulate soil drying and resulting spatial variation of canopy temperatures. The canopy temperature and its spatial variation are simulated for progressive soil drying using four different sets of mostly clear sky atmospheric parameters. For one set of clear sky atmospheric parameters, the sensitivity results are obtained for uncertainties in the root distribution and in defining a unique function for the leaf stomatal control of water loss by plants. © 1984.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001453247

Color development at 65°, 70° and 75°Brix and storage temperatures of 5°, 20° and 37°C were compared over 120 days. Color deterioration occured at a faster rate in Red Delicious. Reaction at different concentration and storage conditions was exponential, following an Arrhenius‐type dependence with temperature. Activation energy for a solids content of 65 ‐ 75°Brix ranged from 16.4 ‐ 19.3 Kcal/mole. Influence of juice variety on activation energy was negligible. Water activity results are in general agreement with those reported by other investigators. A satisfactory correlation to predict commercial concentrate browning has been obtained. All other things being equal, thermal history is a critical factor to obtain a lighter color concentrate. Copyright © 1984, Wiley Blackwell.

Our value for the resonance position is in good agreement with the theoretical calculation of 60.145 eV of Bhatia and Temkin and lies within the error budget of the previous experimental measurements of Madden and Codling.
