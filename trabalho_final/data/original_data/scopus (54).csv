Nonlinearities in the damping and an appropriate low-level controller allow for precise torque control during stance and for fast task space position control during swing.

UV generates reactive oxygen species leading to collagen deficiency and eventually skin wrinkling. Basil contains a number of phenolics and favonoids which possess antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to formulate and investigate the antiaging potential of a cream containing Basil extract. Methods: A single blinded study was conducted using non-invasive methods. Formulation containing 3% of the concentrated extract of Basil was developed by entrapping in the inner aqueous phase of w/o emulsion and base contained no extract. Both creams were stored at different storage conditions of 8°C, 25°C, 40°C and 40°C+ 75% relative humidity to predict their stabilities. The formulation and base were evaluated for their effects on various skin parameters i.e., moisture and trans epidermal water loss (TEWL), volume, energy and surface evaluation of the living skin (SELS). Results: Significant effects (p≤0.05) were observed for both creams in the case of TEWL. The base showed insignificant (p≤0.05) while formulation showed significant effects on skin moisture. Volume, SELS SEr (skin roughness), SEsc (skin scaliness), SEsm (skin smoothness), SEw (skin wrinkles) parameter showed significant decline while texture parameter of 'Energy' showed significant increase. Conclusion: The results statistically indicated that the active formulation containg extract of Basil exert antiaging effects when applied topically.","Ocimum basilicum; Surface evaluation of living skin (SELS); Transepidermal water loss (TEWL); W/o emulsion","basil extract; plant extract; unclassified drug; adult; aging; antioxidant activity; aqueous solution; article; biophysics; controlled study; cream; drug formulation; drug stability; drug storage; emulsion; energy; human; human experiment; humidity; in vivo study; male; moisture; non invasive procedure; normal human; single blind procedure; skin surface; skin water loss; temperature measurement; wrinkle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84455191713

This study concerns the dielectric characterization of commercial ceramics capacitors for use in high voltage capacitors of high-energy storage systems and soliton wave generation for RF production in space applications. To characterize the dielectric material two commercial ceramic capacitors were submitted to HV tests to determine the dielectric constant variation with the applied voltage and the dielectric strength voltage (breakdown -BD) under pulsed conditions. The results show that ceramic capacitors present BD strength of the order of 90-200 kV/cm and non linear behavior, i.e. the ceramic dielectric constant is greatly reduced with the voltage increase. © 2011 IEEE.","barium and strontium titanates; breakdown voltage; ceramic capacitors; dielectric constant","Applied voltages; Barium and strontium titanates; Ceramic dielectrics; Dielectric characterization; Dielectric constants; Dielectric strengths; High energy; High voltage capacitors; Nonlinear behavior; Pulsed power applications; Soliton waves; Storage systems; Barium; Barium titanate; Ceramic capacitors; Ceramic materials; Dielectric properties; Electric breakdown; Power electronics; Solitons; Space applications; Strength of materials; Strontium; Strontium titanates; Dielectric materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84255208853

The CPT current's decomposition results in several current components, which are associated with specific load characteristics (power transfer, energy storage, unbalances and/or non linearities). These current components are used for the definition of different compensation strategies, which can be selective in terms of minimizing particular disturbing effects. In order to validate the applicability of these new compensation strategies, simulation and experimental results for three-phase four-wire systems are presented. © 2011 IEEE.","active power filters; asymmetry; conservative power theory; harmonic compensation; power factor; reactive compensation; selective compensation","Active power Filter; asymmetry; Harmonic compensation; Power factors; Power theory; Reactive compensation; Selective compensation; Electric power factor; Power electronics; Active filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84255208737

Making the autonomous system more efficient requires optimizing consumption for the computing and storage facilities are they require more energy to function than the sensors. Modern embedded systems are a solution, as they have to continuously balance the need for increased performance, increased miniaturization and decrease in power requirements for the full product to run. This is of special importance if the embedded system is designed to work outside of the normal power grid and instead rely on solar or battery power, as in the case of our autonomous weather station. Miniaturization leads to using increasingly complex system on chip devices in the embedded device in increasingly smaller nanometric geometries. These geometries favor the consumption due to leakage instead of digital transistor switching, thus minimizing the silicon clock frequency has impact in the final power consumption. This paper studies the effects of frequency in power consumption on a modern RISC based system implementation, Texas Instruments' OMAP3 family of devices. In order to study the impact of frequency scaling alone (without the additional effects brought to by voltage scaling or methods of idling the silicon) a modern microkernel is used as the basis of a software operating system. © 2011 IEEE.","ARM; beagleboard; data acquisition; embedded-systems; frequency scaling; micro-architecture; micro-code; microkernel; monitoring; OMAP3; system on chip","ARM; beagleboard; Frequency-scaling; Micro architectures; microkernel; OMAP3; System on chips; Data acquisition; Embedded systems; Energy management; Miniature instruments; Sensors; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84255161743

A MEMS piezoelectric based energy scavenging system consists of a MEMS piezoelectric generator, a voltage multiplication circuit and an energy storage unit. Supercapacitor has the potential to be an excellent power storage material for renewable energy sources. The interdigital structured supercapacitor consists of silicon as the substrate, nickel as current collectors and polyvinyl alcohol based gel as a solid state electrolyte. Coventorware ver. 2008 was used in this work to simulate the working structure of supercapacitor. Physical parameters such as length of fingers, electrode spacings, and electrode widths strongly influence the capacitance value of the interdigital structured supercapacitor. From the simulation, the maximum charge density value is 4.110 6 pC/m 2 and the maximum capacitance achieved is 0.116pF for finger length of 2500 m.

In comparison with other thermal storage materials, such as concrete or water, PCMs have a higher energy storage density. In that way, one can achieve the same goal with less material. On the other hand, PCMs also allow the storage and the release of thermal energy at an almost constant temperature. A research group from ""Constantin Brancusi"" University from Targu-Jiu patented a new type of composite wall system incorporating PCMs and evaluated its potential for air conditioning/heating energy savings in continental temperate climate. The novelty of the wall system consists of the fact that two PCM wallboards, impregnated with different PCMs are used. The structure of the new wall system is that of a three-layer sandwich-type insulating panel with outer layers consisting of PCM wallboards and middle layer conventional thermal insulation. The PCM wallboard layers have different functions: the external layer has a higher value of the PCM melting point and it is active during hot season and the internal layer with a PCM melting point near set point temperature for heating is active during cold season. A year-round simulation of a room built using the new wall system was carried out and the effect of PCM presence into the structure of the wall system was assessed. It was found that the new wall system contributes to annual energy savings and reduces the peak value of the cooling/heating loads.","Building materials; Phase Change Materials; Thermal energy efficiency","Annual energy savings; Cold season; Composite wall; Constant temperature; Energy storage density; External layers; Internal layers; Middle layer; Near set; Outer layer; Peak values; Phase Change; Research groups; Temperate climate; Thermal inertia; Thermal storage; Thickness of walls; Three-layer; Wall systems; Aerodynamics; Building materials; Climatology; Contacts (fluid mechanics); Fluid mechanics; Fluids; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Melting point; Phase change materials; Phase transitions; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Thermal insulation; Walls (structural partitions); Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83655211626

Consolidation techniques using virtualization are currently the most promising methods used in today data centers to mitigate the effects of the increasing energy consumption trend. Although the false impression is that virtualization is the solution to most resource usage optimization problems encountered in data centers, the reality is that its usage raises additional challenges for system administrators and solution designers. One such specific challenge is to measure or at least to estimate the efficiency of a physical-virtual machines deployment. However, at the moment there is a lack of power and thermal metering for virtual machines (VMs). In this paper we evaluate several parameters that can be used to characterize energy consumption and thermal dissipation of a physical machine (PM) while hosting and executing several virtual machines. Furthermore, based on this evaluation we propose a test methodology that can be used to estimate energy efficiency and thermal efficiency of virtualized applications. © 2011 CMP.",,"Consolidation techniques; Data centers; Optimization problems; Resource usage; Storage resources; System administrators; Test methodology; Thermal dissipation; Thermal efficiency; Thermal metering; Virtual machines; Virtualizations; Energy utilization; Temperature measurement; Virtual reality; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83655182698

Moisture content of 24-25% (db) at the harvest should be reduced below 14% (db) to prevent it from deterioration during storage. Drying process is generally performed by heating ambient air and then sending it by forced convection over the corn to be dried. The aim in heating air to a certain temperature is to reduce the relative humidity of the air, which has a positive effect on the drying potential. In this study, drying behavior of single layer corn for different drying air temperature (40-70°C) and drying air velocity 2 ms -1 was simulated by means of a liquid diffusion model numerically by a finite element modeling and simulation software. The results show that temperature is an effective factor on the drying rate. The results also show that as drying proceeds, a moisture gradient develops within the grain. This slows down the drying rate considerably. Therefore, it can be concluded that performing drying with an intermittent period instead of continuous drying will cause a considerable energy-saving.","Corn; Drying; Finite element modeling; Liquid diffusion; Moisture content; Sphere","Ambient air; Corn; Drying air; Drying behavior; Drying process; Drying rates; Effective factors; Finite element modeling; Finite element simulations; High moisture; Liquid diffusion; Moisture contents; Moisture gradient; Positive effects; Single layer; Thin layer drying; Aerodynamics; Air; Behavioral research; C (programming language); Computer simulation; Computer software; Diffusion in liquids; Finite element method; Fluid mechanics; Heat transfer; Liquids; Mass transfer; Moisture; Moisture determination; Spheres; Drying",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83655181185

By introducing a supercapacitor as auxiliary source to increase the system power and to take over the battery stresses, the performance of the combined energy storage unit is improved. This paper introduces a completed model of energy storage system, including a pack of batteries, a pack of supercapacitors and a control strategy. The aim is to discharge the capacitors when the required power from energy storage is above a threshold meaning that the driver needs a boost of power for a period of time. Because of their high density of power supercapacitors have more efficiency in delivering it for short time. This has a positive impact on the fuel consumption and the state of charge at the end of the drive cycle. © 2011 Faculty of Auto Control.",,"Auxiliary source; Combined energy; Control strategies; Drive cycles; Electrical energy; Electrical power; Energy capacity; Energy management strategies; Energy storage systems; High density; Hybrid electric vehicle; Parallel hybrid vehicle; Rule based; State of charge; Super capacitor; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Power quality; System theory; Capacitors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83455223780

The study is carried out for three different cases. In the first case, one of the two dc-link capacitors of the inverter is replaced by a battery bank and the other by a supercapacitor bank. In the second case, dc-link capacitors are replaced by two battery banks. In the third case, ordinary dc-link capacitors are replaced by two supercapacitor banks. The first system is supposed to mitigate both long-term and short-term power fluctuations while the last two systems are intended for smoothening long-term and short-term power fluctuations, respectively. These topologies eliminate the need for interfacing dc-dc converters and thus considerably improve the overall system efficiency. The major issue in aforementioned systems is the unavoidable imbalance in dc-link voltages. An analysis on the effects of unbalance and a space vector modulation method, which can produce undistorted current even in the presence of such unbalances, are presented in this paper. Furthermore, small vector selection-based power sharing and state of charge balancing techniques are proposed. Experimental results, obtained from a laboratory prototype, are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed modulation and control techniques. © 2006 IEEE.","Diode-clamped three-level inverter; direct integration of battery energy storage systems; space vector modulation; unbalanced operation of diode-clamped three-level inverter","Battery banks; Control techniques; Dc link capacitor; DC-link voltages; Diode-clamped; Direct integration; First systems; Inverter-based; Power fluctuations; Power sharing; Renewable energy systems; Space Vector Modulation; Space vector modulation method; State of charge; Super capacitor; System efficiency; Three-level; Three-level inverters; Capacitors; DC-DC converters; Diodes; Integration; Modulation; Renewable energy resources; Vector spaces; DC power transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83455245198

The proposed bitcell design adapts the body bias of its own transistors according to its contents. We show that the use of the proposed CSRAM cells results in significant reduction in the static energy dissipation of on-chip storage components without significant performance degradation. In order to reduce the area overhead introduced by the CSRAM we propose a simplified version of the cell at the circuit level.

However, the battery cannot be quickly charged or discharged because of low rate chemical reaction. In this way, a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) has been widely employed to provide dynamic storage and supply energy. Here, the FESS feeds mechanically a permanent magnetic synchronous machine (PMSM), which will supply the power load. Although the fuel cell is a clean, silent and efficient generator, it has a low output voltage. In order to solve this problem the Z-source converter can be applied as boost and as dc-to-ac power converter, reducing the number of switching.

Ways to suppress the use of fossil reductants and the emissions from the processes should therefore be developed. The present work applies simulation and optimization for studying the economic feasibility of recycling blast furnace top gas to the combustion zones after CO2 stripping. The study comprises the unit processes in an integrated steel plant, paying special attention to the blast furnace and the preheating of the blast or the recycled top gas. The system is optimized with nonlinear programming with respect to some central variables under different CO2 sequestration and emission costs, which yields information about the economic feasibility of the concept. It is demonstrated that the optimal states of the plant show complex transitions, where the costs play a decisive role. It is also shown that hot gas recycling with CO2 capture and storage would dramatically reduce the harmful emissions from the process. The conditions under which top gas recycling is economically feasible are also reported, as well as the effect of omitting oil injection in a blast furnace with top gas recycling. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Emission suppression; Mathematical modelling; Optimization; Simulation; Systems engineering; Top gas recycling","Blast furnace operation; Combustion zones; Complex transitions; Economic feasibilities; Emission costs; Emission suppression; Global emissions; Harmful emissions; High energy requirements; Hot gas; Industrial sector; Mathematical modelling; Non-linear optimization; Oil injection; Optimal state; Reductants; Simulation; Simulation and optimization; Steel plant; Steel production; Top gas recycling; Blast furnace practice; Blast furnaces; Carbon dioxide; Coke fueled furnaces; Explosives; Gas burners; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Injection (oil wells); Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Recycling; Steelmaking; Steelmaking furnaces; Metal refineries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054908360

More realistic boundary conditions for temperature and concentration profiles are used. Our results are compared with those obtained experimentally by authors without extracting the heat flux from the storage zone. We have considered the stability analysis of the equilibrium solution. We assumed that the perturbation of quantities such as velocity, temperature, and concentration are infinitesimal. Linearized equations satisfying appropriate prescribed boundary conditions are then obtained and expanded into polynomials form. The Galerkin method along with a symbolic algebra code (Maple) are used to solve these equations. The effect of the separation coefficient Ψ is anatyzed in thepositive and negative case.

Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and inulin are among the most famous prebiotic compounds. In order to improve viability of probiotic bacteria during storage, fermented food should be supplemented with prebiotics. Material and methods: Yoghurts were produced from skimmed milk powder and prebiotics (FOS, inulin or resistant starch), which were added at concentrations of 1%, 2% and 3%. Yoghurts were stored in +4°C for three weeks. Every week each kind of fermented drink was examined in order to check the growth of lactic acid bacteria. Apparent viscosity and texture of bio-yoghurt were determinated during refrigerated storage. Results: The FOS and inulin addition to yoghurt caused an increase in the numbers of all bacteria in comparison to control yoghurt obtained without addition of prebiotics. The viable counts of Str. thermophilus, Lb. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium sp. when 1% of FOS was added to yoghurt were about 9 log cfu/g, 7.8 log cfu/g and 7.7 log cfu/g, respectively. In the presence of 1% of inulin, streptococci and bifidobacteria reached the growth at the level 8.8 log cfu/g and 7.5 respectively. Hardness and adhesiveness of yoghurt obtained with addition resistant starch increased systematically during 21 days of refrigerated storage. Conclusions: The numbers of lactic acid bacteria in obtained bio-yoghurts were sufficient in 97% of samples (10 6-10 9 cfu/g) according to FAO/WHO protocols. Generally, viability of bacteria was sufficient for 14 days and then their numbers decreased but usually not below 10 6 cfu/g. Prebiotics as FOS and inulin added to bio-yoghurt exhibited stimulatory effect on growth Lb. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium sp. Addition of prebiotics caused an increase in apparent viscosity and hardness (in case of FOS) and decrease in syneresis of obtained bio-yoghurts. © Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Przyrodniczego w Poznaniu.","Lab; Storage; Syneresis; Texture; Yoghurt","Apparent viscosity; Bifidobacteria; Bifidobacterium; Fermented foods; Fructo-oligosaccharides; Gut bacteria; Lab; Lactic acid bacteria; Prebiotics; Probiotic bacteria; Probiotics; Refrigerated storages; Resistant starch; Skimmed milk; Stimulatory effects; Structural similarity; Syneresis; Thermophilus; Viable count; Yoghurt; Energy storage; Food additives; Food storage; Hardness; Lactic acid; Starch; Textures; Viscosity; Bacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bifidobacterium; Bifidobacterium sp.; Streptococcus; Idolax; inulin; oligosaccharide; prebiotic agent; probiotic agent; yoghurt; article; bacterial count; Bifidobacterium; classification; diet supplementation; fermentation; flow kinetics; food storage; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; Lactobacillaceae; metabolism; methodology; microbiology; pH; Streptococcus; Bifidobacterium; Colony Count, Microbial; Dietary Supplements; Fermentation; Food Storage; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Inulin; Lactobacillaceae; Oligosaccharides; Prebiotics; Probiotics; Rheology; Streptococcus; Yogurt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82355171580

The homeostasis of the central nervous system is maintained by the periganglionic connective tissue sheath (PCTS), although the molecular composition responsible for water retention is yet to be clarified. In this chapter we investigated the type and location of these proteins and carbohydrates which are potentially functioning as water-binding molecules. The acid/base and red/ox characteristics of the PCTS of a terrestrial Helix pomatia and a freshwater Lymnaea stagnalis were visualized by histochemistry. Based on the different binding affinity of silver ions to protein macromolecules, reticular fibers were found abundant in the basement lamina, while collagen was found mainly in the central matrix of the PCTS. The interstitial space was impregnated by mucin which was also found in acini as revealed by periodic acid - Schiff (PAS) reaction. A part of this material had both weakly and heavily acidic (sulfated) glucosaminoglycan side chains visualized by cationic dyes such as acridine orange and alcian blue (pH 2.5), respectively. In several areas of the H. pomatia PCTS highly reducing molecules were detected. Although the chemical composition of the PCTS was proved to be similar in both species, H. pomatia had a markedly thicker sheath than L. stagnalis, which was rich of carbohydrates implying a higher capacity for energy storage, cryoprotection, and water-binding. In further investigations the functional groups of glycoproteins were determined using carbohydrate side chain-specific lectin probes. The majority of the lectin-labeled molecules were bound to the PCTS. Galactose (Gal) - N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNac) oligomers, detected by jacalin, showed a uniform distribution in the PCTS. In H. pomatia a single, but extensively glycosylated protein (~200 kDa) was found, in contrast to L. stagnalis, in which a number of proteins showed only weak jacalin signals. N-acetyl glusosamine (GlcNac) oligomers, labeled by Lycopersicon esculentum lectin or wheat germ agglutinin, were also detected more frequently in L. stagnalis, whereas in the PCTS of H. pomatia a single protein (~11 kDa) displayed extensive glycosylation. Mannose was found to bind multiple proteins in both species. Lectin labeling revealed that the basement lamina contains a significant amount of carbohydrates. Among them the terminal Gal bound to Ricinus communis agglutinin was characteristic for H. pomatia, whereas the terminal GalNac detected by the Vicia villosa agglutinin was observed only in L. stagnalis. Our results indicate a complex molecular structure of the snail PCTS, playing a role under different humidity conditions, hence influencing the habitat of the animals. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In this framework, biomass utilization has proven to be a viable alternative for energy production even though its usage is still at its infancy on a global scale. Thus, a number of critical issues for all the involved stakeholders, such as potential investors, involved regulators and decision-makers, need to be addressed systemically. One of the first challenges that hinders the increased biomass utilization for energy production is the cost of its respective logistics operations. What differentiates biomass supply chains from traditional supply chains is the importance of factors such as biomass product quality as this is dictated by the relevant energy production technology, weather related variability, localized agricultural capacity and seasonality, and stochasticity of demand. In this chapter, we present a novel methodological framework for the design and evaluation of sustainable waste biomass supply chains, taking into account the collection, storage, and transport operations for supplying facilities with organic raw materials for energy production. First, the potential of waste biomass for energy production is presented, as well as the relevant regulatory incentives, the constraints and the critical issues that have to be tackled. Moreover, the generic system components of Biomass Supply Chains (BSCs) are described in conjunction with their relevant key variables and unique characteristics. Following that, we recognize the natural hierarchy of the decision-making process and propose an integrated methodological framework that spans all levels of the hierarchy. We then map the existing research efforts within the proposed framework in order to identify gaps and overlaps. We proceed with a taxonomy of the current state of the art research, based on the relevant modeling techniques in order to identify the limitations of the existing modeling efforts.

In 1972, preliminary decision was undertaken to build nuclear power plant and pumped-storage power plant. Nuclear power plant was designed to use the Lake Żarnowiec as a cooling water reservoir and pumped-storage power plant to use this lake as the lower reservoir. Such technical solution required comprehensive hydrological, hydrodynamic, and ecological field investigations of the lake. Also meteorological studies of the lake region were conducted. Apart from field measurements, several studies on physical and mathematical models were performed, which concerned the dispersion of heated water on lake surface and lake water balance as well as the failure of upper reservoir of pumped-storage power plant. All this information is presented in this chapter. In 1983, the pumped-storage power plant was put into operation and in 1989 the government decided to suspend the construction of nuclear power plant.

The probability of any soil to be liquefied is several billion times greater than that of even an extremely weak rock in case of fully saturated. Any rock, ranging from extremely weak to strong rock, is not susceptible to liquefaction even at submerged state. Shear strength of a saturated soil under dynamic condition approaches zero whereas the reduction in strength of the saturated rock is practically negligible. In another saying, the ratio of shear strengths [τ =c+σn' tan θ] of saturated rock over soil goes to infinite. Similarly, the ratio of modulus of elasticily [E, kPa] of saturated rock over soil tends to go infinite too. Turkey is a country over which many micro plates are moving relative to each other. The North Anatolian (NAF), East Anatolian (EAF), and EcemiCs fault (EF) are the three major strike-slip faults that cause destructive earthquakes only in soil grounds. The fourth distinct one is the gravity fault (graben) system prevailing in the Aegean region, which is less destructive due to lower energy storage capacity. All of the active fault systems comprise fertile farm fields and extend their limits with time. Such soil grounds form lowlands rich in groundwater and mineral. However, such soil lands are exposed to earthquake catastrophe. Furthermore, the lowlands are not good human health. Most of the viruses and bacteria can grow up. That is the main reason why such lands have to be preserved for farming and should be closed to settlement. The strike slip faults are, in general, coincident with the former suture zones bearing numerous polished sub-vertical discontinuities. These planes have great potential to act as a strike slip fault plane. San Andreas Fault in USA, Kobe Fault in Japan, and Dead Sea Fault extending from Jordan to Turkey are the typical examples. The recurrences of earthquakes create fertile low lands with shallow groundwater table. Such medium favors liquefaction, plastic deformation, rupture, sand ridges and cones, and magnification of the amplitude. An earthquake becomes more destructive in the cases of shallower groundwater table (z < 20 m) and thicker soil mantle (t > 20 m). Hence, one may conclude that rocky grounds are favorable for construction whereas soil grounds should be reserved for agricultural activities. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.","Catastrophe; Earthquake; Geotechnics; Land-use; Rock-soil grounds",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894337788

Another trend has been the increasing concentration of these industries in the hands of the Russian government. This latter phenomenon has been accompanied by an increasingly authoritarian political system, in which former intelligence officers play key roles. Russian firms have tried to purchase a controlling stake in pipelines, ports, storage facilities, and other key energy assets of the countries of central and eastern Europe. They need these assets to transport energy supplies to lucrative western European markets, as well as to secure greater control over the domestic markets of the countries of the region. In several cases where assets were sold to non-Russian firms, Russian firms cut off energy supplies to the facilities. Russia has also tried to build new pipelines to circumvent infrastructure that it does not control. Another objective Russia has pursued has been to eliminate the energy subsidies former Soviet republics have received since the fall of the Soviet Union, includingbyraising the price these countries pay for natural gas to world market prices. It is not completely clear whether the pursuit of Russian foreign policy objectives is the primary explanation for the actions of its energy firms. Few would disagree in principle that the elimination of subsidies to post-Soviet countries is a sound business decision, even if questions have been raised about the timing of such moves. Even the pursuit of multiple pipelines can be portrayed as a business decision. On the other hand, many countries of the region are concerned that Russia may use their energy dependency to interfere in their domestic affairs or to force them to make foreign policy concessions. Countries of the region also fear that by controlling energy infrastructure in their countries, Russian energy firms are able to manipulate the internal political situation by favoring certain local businessmen and politicians. Administration officials have repeatedly criticized what they view as Russian efforts to use its energy supplies as a political weapon and have urged European countries to reduce their dependence on Russian energy. The United States has strongly advocated the building of multiple pipelines from Central Asia and Azerbaijan to Europe. Members of Congress have also expressed concern about the impact on European countries of their dependence on Russian energy. In the first session of the 110th Congress, committees held hearings that have touched on the issue. Congress has also passed resolutions that refer to worrisome aspects of Russian energy policy. The second session of the 110th Congress may also hold hearings and consider legislation on these issues. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We analyze the sensitivity of CSP value to a number of factors, including the optimization period, price and solar forecasting, ancillary service sales, capacity value and dry cooling of the CSP plant.

One of the primary strategies proposed for integrating large amounts of renewable energy is using energy storage to absorb excess electricity-generating capacity during times of low demand and/or high rates of generation by renewable sources and then reconverting this stored energy into electricity during periods of high demand and/or low renewable generation. Various energy storage technologies have been developed or proposed. The goal of this analysis was to develop a cost survey of the most-promising and/or mature energy storage technologies and compare them with several configurations employing hydrogen as the energy carrier. A simple energy arbitrage scenario was developed for a mid-sized energy storage system consisting of a 300-MWh nominal storage capacity that is charged during off-peak hours (18 hours per day on weekdays and all day on weekends) and discharged at a rate of 50 MW for 6 peak hours on weekdays. For all the hydrogen cases, off-peak and/or excess renewable electricity is used to electrolyze water to produce hydrogen, which is stored in compressed gas tanks or underground geologic formations. The hydrogen is reconverted into electricity using a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell or hydrogen expansion combustion turbine. The hydrogen storage scenarios are compared with the use of several battery systems (nickel cadmium, sodium sulfur, and vanadium redox), pumped hydro, and compressed air energy storage (CAES). All the energy storage systems are evaluated for the same energy arbitrage scenario using consistent financial and operational assumptions. Costs and performance parameters for the technologies were gathered from literature sources and, in the case of the hydrogen expansion combustion turbine, Aspen Plus modeling. Producing excess hydrogen for use in vehicles or backup power is also evaluated. Two production levels are analyzed: 1,400 kg/day (roughly equivalent to the U.S. Department of Energy's standard model for small-scale distributed hydrogen production) and 12,000 kg/day. As for the purely energy arbitrage scenarios, it is assumed that hydrogen would be produced with offpeak/renewable electricity. Cost results for the analysis are presented in terms of the annualized (""levelized""1 ) cost for producing the energy output from the storage system: electricity fed back onto the grid during peak hours ($/kWh) and, in the case of producing excess hydrogen for vehicles, hydrogen ($/kg). Figure ES-1. summarizes the comparison of levelized cost of delivered electricity for hydrogen (green bars) and competing technologies (blue bars). For each technology, high-cost, mid-range, and low-cost cases were analyzed, and sensitivity analyses were performed to generate a range of possible costs for each case. In Figure ES-1, the bottom of the bars represents the low end of the range for the low-cost cases, and the top of the bars represents the high end of the range for the high-cost cases. The numerals shown are the nominal values of the mid-range cases; these mid-range values do not represent a statistical determination of most-probable costs. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

PHAserves as intracellular carbon and energy storage compound. The unique properties of PHA as thermoplastics with complete biodegradability have become the key factor forcontinuous research in this field. PHA is being considered as potential substitute forconventional petrochemical-based plastics. Commercialization and application of PHAwill indeed help to manage waste disposal problems and reduce carbon footprint ofhuman activities. Besides, PHA has also gained much attention as a biomaterial inpharmaceutical and medical fields for various applications as it exhibits good level ofbiocompatibility and is known to be non-toxic. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] is themost commonly found PHA in nature. However, to date, more than 150 different HAshave been detected as constituents of PHAs and mostly are synthesized by cultivablebacteria from various types of carbon substrates ranging from simple sugars to plant oils.The properties of PHA produced very much dependent on the type and composition ofcomonomers. Much research is therefore being geared towards efficient synthesis of PHAs with desirable material properties by both wild-type and even recombinantsmicroorganisms. Genetic engineering and manipulation of process parameters areimportant techniques that have been developed to tailor the production of PHA. Currently, PHAs are aimed at barrier packaging in addition to standard packaging anddisposable uses as well as medical and pharmaceutical devices.

These activities include development of strategic-regional infrastructure for gas transport, building of underground gas storages, new transporting directions for increasing gas supply security, and building the local distributive networks. Positive environmental impact of natural gas using, put upon the need for intensive development and management of natural gas sector in Serbia. In last years, natural gas production has decline tendency due to greatest part of domestic area already being exploited and due to discovering of very few new gas fields. Only northern part of country (Vojvodina) has complete gas infrastructure and full ability to use natural gas, so overall share of natural gas in primary energy consumption is about 13%. Electricity production by natural gas as a fuel is negligible. Consumption structure of natural gas is characterized by a distinctive seasonal inequality (winter/summer consumption ratio is 4:1). Although consumption in last decade was always less than 3.109 m3, some estimates show that the total consumption could reach 4.109 m3 in 2015 with over 70% share in final consumption. In the same period, participation of domestic production will remain about 15%. Underground gas storage (UGS) construction represents the only way for solving the problem of uneven seasonal gas consumption. The first UGS in Serbia, which is currently under the construction, has designed maximum capacity of 800 million m3. Since this storage will not be able to satisfy increasing gas demands, it is necessary to define new locations for underground storages. Estimated capacity of potential UGSs in depleted gas reservoirs is about 2 billion m3. The main objective of gas sector management is improvement of Serbian and even regional security of natural gas supply by: Implementation of exploration and production development program, Eficiency increase of Serbian gas pipeline system, Increase of supply security by: Alternative supply and transit routes, New gas pipeline projects - South Stream and Nabucco, Building of underground gas storage. Besides that, the environmental protection, new climate and energy policy legislation are very significant issues related to furher development of Serbian gas sector. In this chapter will be discussed current status and perspective of gas sector in Serbia concerning activities in natural gas exploration, production, UGS building, natural gas transport and distribution management according to EC standards and Energy Community Treaty of South Eastern European countries. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Linking this with other processes, which constitutes a system to recycle hydrogen is shown. Difficulties and advantages of NaBH4 synthesis by natural available boron source kolemanite and borax minerals are discussed in details. It is presented that basic chemicals suffice for NaBH4 production in a procedure designed to work below 275°C. That proves the feasibility of NaBH4 production. Offered procedure may be used to compensate for the loss of materials during the recycle. In this procedure, hydrogen including substances has been used to remove oxygen and bond remaining hydrogen to the by-product NaBO2 of dehydrogenation reaction. The wet and dry applications of producing NaBH4 have been also discussed. Moreover a shorter procedure can be proposed to directly obtain NaBH4 from borax mineral. Among these processes, dehydrogenation is critical but it requires plenty of water. Hence, new types of catalysts are important to reduce the amount of water required during dehydrogenation. Catalyst types and their production techniques are also given in this chapter.

Though, in developed countries the rise of energy demands are predicted to grow at much lower levels, world's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are expected to grow at an extent that may put in danger life as we know it. Therefore, it is urgent to develop, demonstrate and implement alternative fuels sources and cleaner energy production technologies. It is predictable that developing countries, like China and India will increase the utilization of coal for energy production, thus the implementation of clean coal technologies, especially carbon capture and storage (CCS) are most needed. Gasification is considered as a pre-combustion capture process, as by this process fuel is converted into syngas, which is afterwards converted into CO2 and H2. Thus, a H2 rich fuel and free of carbon is produced while simultaneously CO2 is captured producing a stream ready for storage. Gasification operating conditions may be optimized with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions, while maintaining the heating value and the quality of syngas produced. Several materials with CO2 capture ability may be added to the gasification bed to study their action. Another option is the use of oxygen instead of air producing a syngas without the dilution effect of nitrogen, which also simplifies CO2 separation process.The main challenges of current research work are to achieve high conversion of low grade coals and different types of wastes into syngas, with low contents of undesirable components, to simplify and decrease the cost of syngas cleaning and upgrading processes. Another important issue is syngas conversion into H2 and the development of effective H2 separation processes, which are both technically and economically viable. However, before these processes are ready to be implemented at industrial scale, further research and development activities are still needed and the demonstration at large scale of the known processes is fundamental. The integration of technologies under development in IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) will be the main focus of the near future R, D&amp;D (Research, Development &amp; Deployment), as IGCC has high energy conversion efficiency. This Chapter reviews the latest achievements in gasification processes and syngas cleaning and upgrading processes to produce a syngas with a wide range of applications, including effective H2 separation processes to produce H2 rich fuel and CO2 capture.

The drying with the sun energy was compared with artificial drying. The jack fruit almonds were dried whole, half, with pellicle and without it. The storage of solar energy in water was technically viable for use in night drying. The drying by combining solar dryers in the day and night periods were completed in approximately 35 hours, and were equivalent to artificial drying between 40°C and 70°C.

All over the world new facilities are being constructed or designed. The biggest disadvantage of a large synchrotron facility is that the scientific experiments, which are often very sensitive and complex, have to be performed in a dedicated place, sometimes far away from the researcher's home laboratory. Promising compact synchrotron radiation sources, that fit in a typical research lab, have been proposed recently [1, 2, 3, 4]. In this paper results are presented of an initial study of a single body magnet, low electron energy storage ring, performed with the Finite Element (FE) and Finite Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) modeling possibilities in the CST Studio Suite 2010 software package. Insights were obtained for the most crucial components: The magnet yoke, the internal RF cavity and the resonance injection component.

Motivated by the strong increase in electricity produced from wind energy, we investigate the question of how energy storages may contribute to integrate the strongly fluctuating wind power into the electric power network. In order to study the economics of energy storages, we consider a power generation system which consists of conventional power plants, different types of energy storages, and an offshore wind park which supplies a region of certain dimension with electrical energy. On this basis, we aim at optimizing the commitment of the facilities over several days minimizing the overall costs. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer optimization program concentrating on the combinatorial and stochastic aspects. The nonlinearities arising from partial load efficiencies of the units are approximated by piecewise linear functions. In order to account for the uncertainty regarding the fluctuations of the available wind power and of the prices for electricity purchased on the spot market, we describe the affected data via a scenario tree. Altogether, we obtain a stochastic multistage mixed-integer problem (SMIP) of high complexity whose solution is algorithmically and computationally challenging. The main focus of this thesis is on the development of a scenario tree-based decomposition approach combined with a branch-and-bound method (SDBB) for the solution of the SMIP described above. This novel method relies on the decomposition of the original formulation into several subproblems based on the splitting of the scenario tree into subtrees. Using a branchand-bound framework which we extend by Lagrangian relaxation, we can solve the problem to global optimality. In order to support the solution process, we investigate the polyhedral substructure which results from the description of switching processes in a scenario tree formulation yielding a complete linear description of the polytope. Furthermore, we develop an approximate-and-fix heuristic which generates feasible solutions of the problem with low computational effort. In the sequel, we specify the implementation of the SD-BB algorithm where we exploit problem-specific as well as algorithmic properties to make the method successful. Although our algorithm has originally been devised for a specific kind of problem, the general framework can be applied for the solution of a wide range of related problems. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the developed methods based on a set of test instances close to reality. Applying the SD-BB algorithm, we consider instances with a time horizon ranging from six hours up to several days using a time discretization of 15 minutes. © Vieweg+Teubner Verlag | Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH 2011.

In parallel, plans for various LHC upgrades are under discussion, suggesting a High-Luminosity (HL) upgrade first and a High-Energy (HE) upgrade in a later state. Whereas the upgrade in luminosity would require the modification of only some few key accelerator components like the inner triplets, the upgrade in beam energy from 7 TeV to 16.5 TeV would require the exchange of all dipoles and of numerous other accelerator components. The paper gives an overview of the radiation protection issues related to the dismantling of LHC components prior to the installation of the HE-LHC components, i.e. after about 20 years of LHC operation. Two main topics will be discussed: (i) the exposure of workers to ionizing radiation during the dismantling of dipoles, inner triplets or collimators and experiments and (ii) the production, conditioning, interim storage and final disposal of radioactive waste.",,"Beam energies; Final disposals; LHC upgrade; Ionizing radiation; Luminance; Microstrip devices; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive wastes; Tellurium compounds; Radiation protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883233876

These legacies include many different kinds of objects and activities, including: obsolete large waste sources, such as those used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators; remediation of former military sites used for storage of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste; and wastes from uranium mining and ore processing. The objectives of these bi-lateral cooperation programmes are to promote effective and efficient regulatory supervision, taking into account international recommendations and good practice in other countries. Individual projects organised within the programme address specific challenges which require practical local interpretation of ICRP recommendations, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Basic Safety Standards and other IAEA requirements and guidance documents. In some cases, new regulatory documentation has been required, as well as new regulatory procedures. In the long term, the program is intended to lead to an enhanced and enduring safety culture. Positive experience in Russia encouraged the Norwegian government to extend the regulatory collaboration programme to countries in central Asia, using experience gained with Russian regulatory authorities as well as support from Russian Technical Support Organisations. The programmes are effectively evolving into a regional regulatory support group. Noting this experience, the paper includes suggestions for how international cooperation could be effective in addressing common radiation safety objectives while addressing local differences in technical, geographical, economic and cultural matters in each country. The continuing results from the cooperation will be used to provide input to the International Forum for Regulatory Supervision of Legacy Sites (RSLS) which was recently set up by the IAEA. The RSLS objectives mirror those of the bilateral activities described above and an outline is provided of the preliminary RSLS Work Plan.

The voltage-lift (VL) technique is a popular method that is widely applied in electronic circuit design. Applying this technique effectively overcomes the effects of parasitic elements and greatly increases the output voltage. Multi-quadrant ZCS/ZVS/ZT converters implement ZCS/ZVS technique in four-quadrant operation. Since switches turn on and offat the moment that the current/voltage is equal to zero, the power losses during switching on and offbecome zero. The fifth-generation converters are called synchronous rectifier (SR) DC/DC Converters. After a well discussion of steady-state operation, we prepare one section to investigate the dynamic transient process of DC/DC converters. Energy storage in DC/DC converters have been paid attention long time ago, but it was not well investigated and defined. The four-quadrant ZVS quasi-resonant DC/DC Luoconverter is derived for the energy transmission of a dual voltage system. The source voltage is positive, and load voltage can be positive or negative polarity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882898962

Self-commutated switches are adequate for use in converters where turn-offcapability is necessary. The switching characteristics of thyristors are appropriate for using in line-commutated converters, such as in conventional high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems with a current source in the dc side. Thyristor-based FACTS devices use line or natural commutation together with large energy storage elements. On the other hand, devices based on self-commutating switches, such as GTOs, IGCTs, or IGBTs, use gate-controlled commutation. The VSC-based HVDC technology is a suitable solution for dc transmission systems through underground or undersea dc cables. The VSC-HVDC system can also be seen as an extension of the IPFC concept, keeping in mind that the main idea is to transfer active power from one bus to another through a dc link. The VSC-based dc transmission has an exactly dual configuration of the conventional HVDC transmission system, which is based on the thyristor-controlled CSC. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This means that a switch duty cycle is directly controlled by the switch current rather than by the output voltage. Control of the output voltage is obtained by using the output of a voltage-sensing error amplifier to set the current trip level. This technique has several advantages. First, it has immediate response to input voltage variations, unlike ordinary switchers which have notoriously poor line transient response. Second, it reduces the 90° phase shift at mid-frequencies in the energy storage inductor. This greatly simplifies closed-loop frequency compensation under widely varying input voltage or output load conditions. Finally, it allows simple pulse-by-pulse current limiting to provide maximum switch protection under output overload or short conditions. A low dropout internal regulator provides a 2.3 V supply for all internal circuitry on LT1070. This low dropout design allows the input voltage to vary from 3 to 60 V with virtually no change in device performance. Several versions of LT1070 have been developed. LT1071 and LT1072 are identical to LT1070, except for switch current ratings 2.5 and 1.25 A, respectively. Designs which result in lower switch currents can take advantage of the cost savings of these smaller chips. Design equations for LT1071 and LT1072 are identical to the LT1070. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Via harvest diving, involving repeated diving with half of the time submerged for several hours per day, groups in South East Asia obtain a considerable amount of catch. The physiological basis for such repeated diving involves i) conscious breath control, ii) an efficient diving response, diverting stored oxygen to the heart and brain, and iii) adequate thermal insulation. Another contribution to the human diving ability comes from the spleen, which - by ejecting extra red blood cells into circulation - can enhance blood gas storage and carbon dioxide buffering capacity, a response typically found in seals. Most striking among human aquatic activities is competitive apnea, with records of a period of 11 min 35 s in duration, the distance of 265 m in underwater swimming with fins, and a depth of 124 m in deep-diving with fins. Without fins, the distance of 218 m and depth of 101 m have been achieved, performances in the range of marine mammals. This requires additional mechanisms to maximize gas storage, minimize energy expenditure, and enhance conscious tolerance to asphyxia, involving e.g. increase lung volume, baseline hematocrit and spleen volume, and means to cope with the increased pressure. While it takes both inherent predisposition and training to achieve such record results, most healthy humans can, after some practice, make voluntary apneas of 3-4 min, swim a distance of 50 m under water and reach depths of 20-30 m, which may be unique among terrestrial mammals. Human superior harvest diving and competitive diving capacity may suggest a selective pressure for diving during some time period of human evolution. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.

By taking advantage of the molecular design flexibility of polybenzoxazine and using the appropriate preparation methods, porous materials with various pore dimensions and pore structures are synthesized. Because of the simplicity and versatility, porous carbon materials derived from polybenzoxazine have a great potential in various advanced applications. Porous materials, especially porous carbon, have been extensively studied over the past decade and have been used in various applications, such as water purification, gas separation, catalyst supports, electrode material for energy storage devices, adsorbents, molecular sieves, thermal insulation, etc. According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) definition, porous materials can be classified into three categories based on their pore sizes: microporous, mesoporous, and macroporous. Porous carbon materials have been conventionally prepared by pyrolysis and physical or chemical activation of organic precursors, such as coals, woods, polymers, etc. at elevated temperatures in inert atmospheres. These porous carbon materials, such as activated carbon and molecular sieving carbons, generally have broad pore size distributions in both micro- and mesopore ranges. The products obtained from these processes are mesoporous carbon materials with broad pore size distributions and a reasonable amount of microporosity. © 2011 Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We extend work on a reliability enhancing WSN data storage strategy called Address Coding that provides power efficient self organizing backup capability in networks of homogeneous nodes. We show that the asymptotic energy cost per backup is lower with Address Coding than it would be for a naive storage strategy based on AODV. We also show that probabilistic flooding can be applied to Address Coding, yielding significant reduction in energy cost with negligible loss in reliability. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Address coding; Asymptotic energy; Data storage; Distributed sensor networks; Energy efficient; Power efficient; Probabilistic flooding; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Costs; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Sensor nodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880740363

But power sources for energy harvesters usually exhibit high internal impedance and can therefore only deliver low currents. The most important consideration for harvesting is that the power consumption of the controller circuitry must be less than the energy generated by the power source. Energy harvesters use a storage capacitor slowly charged from power source through the controller and the leakage current of this capacitor is wastes a certain percentage of the generated energy.

This means that distribution networks can no longer be considered as a passive appendage to the transmission network and should be explored actively to take full advantage of the capabilities of DG units available and avoid technical problems (such as line overloading or poor voltage profiles) resulting from massive integration of this type of sources. Presently, when the capacity of the generation, transmission and distribution systems is exceeded, the traditional utility response is expanding or reinforcing existing circuits through large investments in power transformers, substations or distribution feeders. However, in some situations such as in congested metropolitan areas these actions can have prohibitive costs or simply be impossible due to space restrictions, for instance. Although current investment costs of many solutions for energy storage remain extremely high, recent developments and advances in both energy storage technologies and power electronic interfaces are opening new doors to the inclusion of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) as a potentially viable solution for modern power applications, including their use in distribution network planning and operation. This paper presents a heuristic approach for siting and sizing of ESS in distribution networks in order to maximize the capacity of DG that can be integrated in the grid without bringing technical problems to network operation. The proposed methodology enables a technical and economical comparison between a strategy based on ESS deployment and exploitation and typical traditional DNO grid reinforcement strategies. Several technologies for ESS were considered, each one with different costs and technical characteristics.

They are supplied with electricity from diesel power plants using expensive fuel delivered at large distances. However, in many cases it is possible to supply electricity to consumers on the basis of renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines, small hydropower plants, power plants based on biomass, in particular by converting it into gaseous or liquid fuel. The studies show that in the majority of cases the use of renewable energy sources is economically sound. However, because of variable power generation by wind turbines and small hydropower plants the diesel power plants can serve as standby sources. Besides, for this purpose it is also advisable to consider energy storage systems. Electricity demand management and enhancement of consumers' role in the process are topical as well. The power supply system to be formed in such a way is a microgrid of specific structure. Because of unsteady character of power generation, availability of energy storage systems, electricity demand management and also stricter requirements of consumers to power quality and power supply reliability (as a result of extensive use of the up-to-date domestic appliances) operation of such power supply systems and its control, in particular in emergency situations, is not an easy problem that calls for further research.

In order to integrate large amounts of small and micro-generation (μG) units that exploit different power sources (with high or no intermittency) together with controllable loads and storage devices it is necessary to develop flexible management and control solutions where responsibilities for the system operation are shared between Distribution System Operators (DSO), customers and Distributed Generation (DG) units according to a regulatory environment. The incentives provided to the different parties (stakeholders) may have a major impact on their decision to adopt Micro-grid and Multi Micro-grid concepts. Therefore, an identification of the benefits and costs associated with these concepts adoption is needed in order to recognize the real value of their deployment. Moreover, only by proper allocation of these costs and benefits, each stakeholder affected may receive the right incentive to opt for Micro-grid and Multi Micro-grid solutions. The DSO is interested in maximizing profits, by minimizing the capital and operational costs related to the distribution service (for instance, loss reduction and reinforcement costs) and at the same time achieving the performance goals imposed by the regulators [1]. Micro-generation developers make decision considering capital and operational expenditures, the connection costs, and use of system charges. Incomes from energy selling (which may include RES incentives) are the main goals (benefits) for the μG investors. Therefore, one of the priorities of regulators is to ensure that these benefits are perceived by μG developers. Finally, customers may be asked to share with the DSO the responsibility for an increased reliable system and for having the possibility to reduce their bills when exploiting the best market options offered by different traders. This paper presents a detailed identification and characterization of the different benefits and costs for each stakeholder involved. Some of these benefits can be identified and allocated directly to a certain stakeholder, while others need to be shared among a large group of players, involving the society in general (for example CO2 emissions reduction, job creation).","Controllable loads; Distribution system operator; Micro-generation; Micro-grids; Multi micro-grids","Controllable loads; Distribution systems; Micro grid; Microgeneration; Multi micro-grids; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric power systems; Emission control; Profitability; Sales; Virtual storage; Distributed power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877285696

These sources are of fluctuating nature and therefore introduce new challenges to power system operation, which was historically designed for generators with constant infeed. The fluctuations are balanced by ancillary services contracted from flexible generators or storages. So far, large scale solutions for storage are only provided by pumped hydro. However, one potential solution for a large storage could be to aggregate Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), once they are adopted on a wide scale, into a virtual storage. This storage could then be used to balance the infeed error of RES. The balancing would imply that the PHEVs could be recharged from emission free sources, thereby enabling an emission free individual transportation sector. This paper focuses on the realization of an aggregated PHEV storage and the balancing of RES infeed errors. In specific, the paper investigates how a large fleet of PHEVs can be aggregated over a large, urban electricity distribution network and how this storage can be used to balance a wind infeed error while considering the limits of the underlying infrastructure. The balancing can be achieved through so called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services which allow PHEVs to act both as loads and as generators. The utilized aggregation scheme is based on an intelligent PHEV charging control scheme which avoids negative network impacts, such as overloading of assets, from excessive PHEV charging. V2G services are added on top of this intelligent recharging infrastructure. The paper shows that by using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach as a controller for the aggregated PHEV storage, an intrahour wind infeed error from a 500 MW wind park can be fully balanced while keeping the underlying distribution network in a secure state.","Distribution systems; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); Renewable energy sources (RES); Smart grids; Vehicle to grid (V2G)","Distribution systems; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Model predictive control; Natural resources; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Predictive control systems; Virtual storage; Wind power; Aggregates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877277437

Although, traditional communications interfaces, protocols and standards has been used in the electrical grid in an isolated manner, modern communications network is considered as the fundamental enabling technology within the future Smart Grid. Modern communications technologies, protocol architectures and standards can help to build a common communications network infrastructure for data transport between customer premises, power substations, power distribution systems, utility control centres and utility data centres. The Smart Grid will support traditional applications such as SCADA, distribution automation (DA), energy management systems (EMS), demand site management (DSM) and automatic meter reading (AMR), etc., as well as new applications like advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), substation automation (SA), microgrids, distributed generation, grid monitoring and control, data storage and analysis, among others. To make this possible, the Smart Grid requires a two-way wide area communications network between different dispersed areas, from generation, to distribution to consumer premises. In fact, it will consist of many different types of communications networks such as wide area networks, local area network, home area networks, etc. This requires a new architectural approach to implement a common communications infrastructure that provides the reliability, scalability, security and interoperability to support multiple applications. In addition, open standards addressing interoperability, are key for the development and deployment of the Smart Grid as a true integrated network. A communications backbone is necessary to provide interoperability. To achieve the level of networking, interoperability and security that meets the technical requirements of the Smart Grid, its data communications network architecture must be built using standard, open protocols. Internet Protocol (IP) and broadband networks could form the backbone of this infrastructure, as they are flexible and resilient enough to meet the demand of the grid. The Benefits of using IP-based networks include the maturity of a large number of IP standards, the availability of tools and applications that can be applied to multiple smart grid areas, and the widespread use of IP technologies in both private and public networks. In addition, IP technologies are the link between applications and the underlying communication physical medium. They allow applications to be developed independent of both the communications infrastructure and the various communications technologies to be used, either wired or wireless. From a general point of view, the main role of communication and networking technologies is to make the current electrical grid, smart. The Smart Grid will use many types of communications technologies such as public and private, wired and wireless, licensed and unlicensed, and standard and proprietary technologies. There exist a great number of communications and networking technologies that can be used to support smart grid applications, including fiber opticssystems, cellular, satellite, trunked radio, WiMAX, power line carrier, broadband over power lines (BPL), and IP, as well as in-home technologies such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, HomePlug, ZigBee, RF Mesh, etc. In this work, an analysis of the most relevant communications and networking technologies applicable to the Smart Grid is presented.","Communications technologies; HAN; IP; LAN; Networking technologies; Smart grid; WAN","Communications technology; HAN; IP; Networking technology; Smart grid; Advanced metering infrastructures; Automation; Communication; Convolutional codes; Distributed power generation; Electric load distribution; Energy management systems; Home networks; Internet protocols; Interoperability; Local area networks; MESH networking; Network architecture; Public utilities; Smart power grids; Standardization; Technology; Water meters; Wide area networks; Network protocols",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877268755

Additionally, increasing volume of inter-regional power exchanges over the aged transmission infrastructure and the introduction of plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles may potentially lead to a stressed and less secure power system operation. These factors have triggered demand from the power sector for large-scale energy storage systems. This paper first gives an overview of most relevant energy storage technologies considered for utility scale applications (performance, maturity, cost, etc.) and then focuses on various battery based energy storage systems. Energy storage systems (ESS) can cover a wide spectrum of utility scale applications, ranging from fast power quality applications to energy management applications in electric power systems. We provide a comprehensive overview of different utility scale applications and list most important technical requirements which help to identify the appropriate energy storage technology for a given application. Next, the paper highlights some combinations of technologies and applications with the highest potential benefits for the owner of the ESS. The analysis shows that frequency regulation and renewable energy time shift and capacity firming are the applications that most likely will be asked for by utilities in the future. Finally, the paper provides an overview of BESS solutions offered by ABB in the wide range between several kilowatts and tens of megawatts.","Batteries; Energy storage; Frequency regulation; Renewable generation; Smart grids","Energy storage systems; Energy storage technologies; Frequency regulations; Management applications; Power system operations; Renewable generation; Smart grid; Technologies and applications; Electric power transmission; Electric vehicles; Smart power grids; Solar cells; Energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877267912

Today a number of various measures, which can serve interests of both natural gas suppliers and consumers, is being developed and adopted to fulfill requirements of energy safety regulations of EU member states. One of such measures is the integration of national gas supply systems in a unified transnational network that would cover EU states. One of the main tasks is to ensure security of natural gas supplies to Europe. Underground gas storages maintain the status of the most effective solution of this task during the whole period of gas industry development. Increase in global gas consumption opens up new opportunities, methods and means to balance natural gas flows along the whole process chain: production-transmission-storage-marketing. This set of measures together with regional specifics of the power industry development exerts significant impact on development of the European UGS sector. However on the other hand elaboration of UGS development and expansion plans must take into account process specifics and conditions of UGS construction and operation. We must bear in mind that UGS first of all is a hazardous process facility and its construction and operation are strictly controlled by regulating bodies.

The idea is to exploit the mixed ferromagnetic and spin glass phase of the Hopfield neural network to encode the key as a local minimum configuration of the energy functional, ""lost"" amidst the exponentially growing number of valleys and minima representing the spin glass. The correct fingerprint will be able to retrieve the key by dynamical evolution to the nearest attractor. Other fingerprints will be driven far away from the key.

Accurate design and analysis of discontinuous structures is of significant benefit to the manufacturing and energy sectors. A survey of the literature on the analysis of discontinuous structures using component mode synthesis was carried out. It revealed that whilst the theories are well developed independently, limited work is available on the application of component mode synthesis to dynamic analysis of discontinuous structures, key elements in many industries.

Coal and lignocellulosic materials are the most commonly used starting materials for the production of commercial activated carbons (ACs). The latter are also prepared from various agricultural by-products and polymeric materials because of their low cost and high carbon yield. The pores in carbon materials play an important role in their functions and characteristics. Glass-like carbon (GC) is prepared by heat-treatment on thermosetting resins in inert atmosphere. They show various unique properties such as great hardness compared with other carbon materials and gas impermeability. Phenol-formaldehyde resins are being increasingly used to replace pitch as bonding agents for refractory materials. Starting from such precursors, various carbons in the form of fibers, particles, membranes and preforms have been produced. Carbonised phenolic resins are usually highly microporous, with the amount of open micropores passing through a maximum at a carbonisation temperature of 700 to 800 oC. Molecular sieving carbon (MSC) or carbon molecular sieves (CMSs) are carbonaceous adsorbents with almost uniform micropores of a few angstroms in diameter having the ability to selectively separate molecules, mainly of a gas mixture. Carbon molecular sieve membrane (CMSM) is usually prepared by carbonisation of polymeric films, which conducts to the formation of a thin carbon layer or thin film of CMS with pores smaller than 1 nm. In order to prepare CMSM, the polymeric precursor needs to have thermosetting property in order to avoid melting when heated and thus retain structure shape during heating and pyrolysis. Mesoporous carbons, due to their high surface area and periodic arrays of uniform pores, are utilized as catalysis and electrode materials for different purposes such as protection of environment and improvement of energy efficiency. Mesoporous carbons with high surface area, large porosity and fine electric-conductivity have been regarded as an advanced material for many potential applications in nanotechnology. Monomers such as furfuryl alcohol, acrylonitrile, and phenol-aldehyde monomers mixture were usually used as the precursors to prepare mesoporous carbons. Other carbonaceous forms includes carbon brushes prepared from proper thermosetting resin binder and monolithic activated carbons prepared from resin impregnated expanded graphite, from isotropic fibers or prepared as carbon aerogels. Nanostructured carbon materials are potentially of great technological interest for the development of electronic, catalytic and hydrogen-storage systems. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In addition, combining the benefits of 3D memory-on-processor stacking architecture and on-chip networks provides a significant performance gain. To fully exploit the benefits of the 3D stacked memory-on-processor architectures, an efficient on-chip communication platform is required to be integrated in the logic layer. In this paper, we present an on-chip communication platform for the logic layer to exploit the potential bandwidth of stacked memory-on-processor architectures.

In this way, biomass offers one of the largest potential among renewable energy sources. The aim of this work is to demonstrate a novel fuzzy-based methodology for selecting hybrid energy systems fuelled by biogas. Fuzzy multi-rules and fuzzy multi-sets are used to evaluate the main operational characteristics of five types of renewable sources fuelled by biogas. The possibility of using the methodology for energy storage system evaluation is also assessed. The construction of the fuzzy multirules and fuzzy multi-sets is based on the following methods: Mamdani (fuzzification process), Max-Min (inference process), and Center of Gravity (defuzzification process). Several criteria are used: costs, efficiency, cogeneration, life-cycle, technical maturity, power application range, and environmental impacts. The methodology considers three different settings with two different constraints: costs and environment. One of the most relevant aspects presented by this work is about the previous classification of the criteria. It was created according to the different relevance observed among the attributes. The purpose of the proposed arrangement is to facilitate the understanding of the methodology and to increase the possibility of incorporating the decision makers' preferences on the decision-aid process. These aspects are essential to strengthen the final decision. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866337785

The concept presented in this article utilizes integration of the concrete and the microencapsulated Phase Change Material (PCM). PCM has ability to absorb and release significant amount of heat at a specific temperature range. As a consequence of admixing PCM to the concrete a new thermal properties like thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity have to be defined. This paper presents results from the measurements of the thermal conductivity of various microencapsulated PCM-concrete and PCM-cement-paste mixes.

This analysis is fundamental for the safety management and cost reduction of accidents. The case study is the result of the safety coordination of systems, and of the harmonization between the project owner, the safety coordinator and the contractor. The result of this collaboration is and adequate strategy to prevent the risks during the construction of a large hydro-electric dam in the north of Portugal. The project is part of a governmental plan to invest in the energy obtained from hydraulic sources. The dam in the north of Portugal is located in a river and near the confluence with the river Douro. It will have a capacity of storage that will be strategic to the electricity generation in the country. It has two storage-pumped plants equipped with reversible units. The construction volume covers around 700000 m 3 of concrete, 600000 m 3 of excavation and an installed power of 170 MW. This dam presents a strategic value since it will increase the water supply reserves for domestic and industrial use. It will be the largest reserve of water in Portugal. The safety risk evaluation on this construction project was carried out using simulation tools of the different phases of construction according to the tasks of the program plan. This overall analysis of the risks related with the planned tasks provides a sequence of risks over the duration of the project. The simulation allows the analysis to identify peaks and levels of high risks that are identified. The method proposes a scale to classify risks that is compatible with probability of occurrence and gravity of the consequences. There is also a systematic evaluation of risks to each type of the construction task. These conclusions allow the scheduling of additional proposals to prevent accidents and to reduce risks. These preventive measures will contribute to reduce the high risks and consequently, lead to a flattening effect of the project global risk chart. These measures consist in on-site measures and in an integrated implementation of working safety policies. Of course these measures contribute to the risk reduction and rarely to eliminate the risks. The implementation of these prevention systems and working safety policies implies additional costs but when costs are associated to the possible accidents it is concluded that safety has lower costs than a lack of prevention. © 2011 WIT Press.","Accidents; Construction; Prevention costs; Risk analysis; Risk management; Risk prevention; Safety; Safety plans","Additional costs; Construction projects; Electricity generation; Global risks; Industrial use; Installed power; Portugal; Prevention costs; Prevention systems; Preventive measures; Probability of occurrence; Program plan; Project owners; Risk prevention; Risk reductions; Safety management; Safety plan; Safety policies; Safety risks; Strategic values; Systematic evaluation; Accident prevention; Accidents; Construction; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric generators; Industrial applications; Risk analysis; Risk management; Security systems; Water supply; Occupational risks; accident; conference proceeding; construction method; cost-benefit analysis; dam construction; excavation; hydroelectric power plant; installation; policy approach; risk assessment; safety; Douro River; Portugal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865789745

Chemical batteries are the favoured solution because of their ease of use and large storage capacity. Mechanical energy storage devices (e.g., mechanical springs) offer better resistance to extreme temperatures, more load cycles before failure, a faster release of energy and leak-free energy storage over longer periods of time as compared to chemical batteries, making them potentially interesting for handheld and implantable devices. As portable technologies become smaller and more powerful, energy density by mass and by volume become key design factors. Recent developments in advanced materials and nanotechnology have led to materials with stiffness and strength that far exceed that of conventional materials. It may be possible to use these materials to fabricate super-springs which would rival chemical devices in their energy densities. Previous work has demonstrated the storage of elastic potential energy using tensile loading of pure multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). Here, we used the ultra-violet light assisted direct-write (UV-DW) procedure to fabricate three dimensional (3D) helicoidal springs with a filament diameter of 50 μm. This procedure involves the extrusion of a nanocomposite material polymerized by immediate targeted exposure to UV light. When mounted on a three-axis positioning robot, the apparatus allows fabrication of freeform 3D filament structures. The nanocomposite used was a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) reinforced UV curable epoxy. The UV-DW procedure was modified for smaller applications using a 3-axis nanostage and a fixed mounting of the deposition system, calibrated for use with recently developed 50 μm diameter stainless steel dispensing tips. The originality of this work is both the small scale of UV-DW 3D fabrication and the novel application in energy storage. Preliminary results have been the successful fabrication of several 3D structures including a 50 um filament diameter super-springs with 4 active coils. These super-springs were tested under tensile loading. Preliminary design calculations show that for a network of 50 super-springs with a filament diameter of 1 μm loaded torsionally, the theoretical energy density by mass is 1200 kJ/kg. These analytical predictions compare favourably to the 5 kJ/kg experimentally achieved using tensile loaded pure MWCNTs and the theoretical limits of 0.14 kJ/kg for steel and 1000 kJ/kg for lithium ion batteries. With further development, super-springs could become a viable alternative to batteries in applications with challenging environmental conditions such as implantable biomedical devices and remote sensors.",,"3D fabrication; 3D Structure; Active coils; Advanced materials; Analytical predictions; Chemical batteries; Chemical devices; Conventional materials; Deposition systems; Design factors; Direct write; Direct-write technique; Ease-of-use; Elastic potential energy; Energy density; Environmental conditions; Extreme temperatures; Filament diameter; Filament structure; Freeforms; Handhelds; Implantable biomedical devices; Implantable devices; Leak-free; Lithium-ion battery; Load cycle; Mechanical energies; Mechanical springs; Nano-stage; Novel applications; Preliminary design; Remote sensors; Small scale; Storage capacity; Technological applications; Tensile loading; Theoretical limits; Three-axis positioning; Ultra-violet; Ultra-violet light; UV-curable epoxies; Energy storage; Fabrication; Implants (surgical); Nanocomposites; Remote sensing; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN); Strength of materials; Tensile strength; Tensile stress; Three dimensional; Virtual storage; Hydrochemistry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865629002

In addition, pumped-storage hydro is the only renewable energy source that can deliver positive or negative reserve to the grid for balancing intermittent resources such as wind and solar. The increasing contribution of these resources has led to an increase demand for pumped storage, especially in southern and western parts of Europe. Therefore, pumped storage plays a vital role in building low emission capacity for generating electricity, and in meeting targets for reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Much of the pumped-storage capacity operating worldwide was built 30 to 50 years ago.

Arboreal species provide different storage latent heat, a characteristic related with the mitigation of air temperature in local-scale provided by them. The aim of this work is to compare heat fluxes in different arboreal species along the day and verify their contribution for thermal comfort inside and outside buildings. The required data are: net radiation flux density retained by sunlit and shaded layers (W/m 2) (collected by tube solarimeters), air temperature and relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and vegetation phenology (size of crown, leaves and foliar area). The measurements were carried out during the day, from sunrise to sunset, in three-day periods, throughout the year, covering different seasons. The energy balance scheme is based in the big-leaf model by Penman-Monteith (FAO056). In the research four tree species were analyzed, chosen from the most used trees in urban forestry in the South-East region of Brazil. Results showed that Qe by each trees varied between 116, 68 and 1208,89 W.h/m 2 during the year. The greatest contribution of trees for the energy balance was observed in the afternoon period. The different results obtained were due to the characteristics of the sample individual, such as structure and density of the treetop, size, shape and color of leaves, tree age and growth stage. Trees with higher tops have a good contribution in the cities, due to their energy consumption and higher solar radiation attenuation. Deciduous species are excellent in sub-tropical climate, because they can reduce heat fluxes in summer and allow them in winter. The trees around building, on streets and parks can reduce air temperature, by diminishing the conductive and convective heat gains. This effect provides thermal comfort and can reduce the energy for cooling of the buildings. These characteristics of vegetation should be taken in account by professionals of the urban built environment to improve thermal comfort outdoors, reducing the effect of heat island so ensuring better quality of life for people.","Heat flux; Solar radiation; Thermal comfort","Air temperature; Built environment; Convective heat; Deciduous species; Growth stages; Heat island; Net radiation flux; Penman-Monteith; Quality of life; Radiation attenuation; Tree age; Tree species; Urban forestry; Urban spaces; Vegetation phenology; Architecture; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Energy balance; Energy utilization; Forestry; Interfacial energy; Phenols; Planning; Solar radiation; Sun; Sustainable development; Thermal comfort; Vegetation; Heat flux; Barometric Pressure; Brazil; Energy Balance; Heat; Interfaces; Phenols; Planning; Plants; Sun Light; Sustainable Forest Management; Thermal Analysis; Utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864147789

Most existing definitions are based on setting a performance metric (quantity and quality) such as site energy, source energy, energy costs, or emissions, and a boundary for the energy source. However, the problem of most existing definitions is that they neglect the energy use during the whole building lifecycle, neglect the climatic context, neglect the urban or city scale, derive from a 'zero' or neutralizing notion, link the energy use to area separately from occupants and do not specify the intended definition audience they address e.g. policymakers or building developers or construction professionals. On the other hand, the cradle to cradle approach encourages the creation of ecologically positive footprint buildings where buildings are very efficient by design and by using suitable technologies to become energy positive. The cradle to cradle approach allows us to examine broader criteria including the embodied energy, environmental impact, energy storage and the management of plus energy. Therefore, in this paper, we discuss those problems and suggest a necessary shift to approach NZEB definition, from a cradle to cradle approach rather from a balance approach.

This method is also often taken into account when considering systems of carbon capture from flue gases of coal fired power plants. This process is very energy-intensive and significantly reduces the performance of the power plant. Thus it seems appropriate to seek external sources of heat for the purpose of carbon capture installation. In the paper, the integration of a coal-fired power plant with the gas turbine combined heat and power system for carbon capture and storage (CCS) installation has been analyzed. The parameters of the gas unit, which fully meets the needs of CCS for the 900 MW coal power plant with supercritical parameters, have been determined. There have been examined two variants of the gas unit: natural gas fired gas turbine with water boiler and natural gas fired gas steam cycle with 1-pressure heat recovery steam generator. The parameters of these analysis have been compared with parameters of power plant working without an external heat source. Specified rate of avoided emissions, and economic analysis of the project have been determined.","Avoided emission; Chemical absorption; CO2 capture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863975591

If it is used outside the specified range, pump and system efficiencies rapidly deteriorate and eventually mechanical problems leading to a complete system failure develop. When serious deviation from the design production rate is experienced, the possible solutions are (a) running a different pump with the proper recommended operating range, or (b) using a variable speed drive (VSD) unit. However, in case the ESP system produces a higher than desired liquid rate, a simple and frequently used solution is the installation of a wellhead choke. The wellhead choke restricts the pumping rate and forces the ESP pump to operate within its recommended liquid rate range. This solution, of course, is very detrimental to the economy of the production system because of the high hydraulic losses across the choke that cause a considerable waste of energy. The paper utilizes NODAL analysis to investigate the negative effects of surface production chokes on the energy efficiency of ESP systems as compared to the application of VSD drives. The power flow in the ESP system is described and the calculation of energy losses in system components is detailed. Based on these, a calculation model is proposed to evaluate the harmful effects of wellhead choking and to find the proper parameters of the necessary VSD unit. By presenting a detailed calculation on an example well using the proposed model the detrimental effects of wellhead choking are illustrated and the beneficial effects of using a VSD drive are presented. Using data of a group of wells placed on ESP production a detailed investigation is presented on the field-wide effects of choking. The energy flows and the total energy requirements are calculated for current and optimized cases where VSD units providing the required electrical frequencies are used. Final results clearly indicate that substantial electric power savings are possible if production control is executed by VSDs instead of the present practice of using surface chokes. © 2011 The Author(s).","Efficiency; Electrical submersible pumping; Energy; ESP; NODAL analysis; Oil well; Optimization; Production; System analysis; Wellhead choke","Digital storage; Economics; Efficiency; Electric load flow; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Oil wells; Optimization; Production; Production control; Pumps; Submersibles; Systems analysis; Variable speed drives; Wellheads; Artificial lift systems; Electric power savings; Electrical frequency; Electrical submersible pumping; Energy; Nodal analysis; Total energy requirement; Wellhead chokes; Electric oil well pumping",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863761085

An electrical performance metric is evaluated to compare various memory design options targeting different applications. The overall electrical quality is enhanced without increasing the area with a multi-threshold-voltage CMOS technology.

Whereas a group of high-pass complex frequency coefficients are quantized so that the quantized coefficients lie in the middle of the quantization range and the changes are distributed among the coefficients.

In humans the majority of glycogen is stored in skeletal muscles (~500 g) and the liver (~100 g). Food is supplied in larger meals, but the blood glucose concentration has to be kept within narrow limits to survive and stay healthy. Therefore, the body has to cope with periods of excess carbohydrates and periods without supplementation. Healthy persons remove blood glucose rapidly when glucose is in excess, but insulin-stimulated glucose disposal is reduced in insulin resistant and type 2 diabetic subjects. During a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, 70-90% of glucose disposal will be stored as muscle glycogen in healthy subjects. The glycogen stores in skeletal muscles are limited because an efficient feedback-mediated inhibition of glycogen synthase prevents accumulation. De novo lipid synthesis can contribute to glucose disposal when glycogen stores are filled. Exercise physiologists normally consider glycogen's main function as energy substrate. Glycogen is the main energy substrate during exercise intensity above 70% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2max) and fatigue develops when the glycogen stores are depleted in the active muscles. After exercise, the rate of glycogen synthesis is increased to replete glycogen stores, and blood glucose is the substrate. Indeed insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis is elevated after exercise, which, from an evolutional point of view, will favor glycogen repletion and preparation for new ""fight or flight"" events. In the modern society, the reduced glyco-gen stores in skeletal muscles after exercise allows carbohydrates to be stored as muscle glycogen and prevents that glucose is channeled to de novo lipid synthesis, which over time will causes ectopic fat accumulation and insulin resistance. The reduction of skeletal muscle glycogen after exercise allows a healthy storage of carbohydrates after meals and prevents development of type 2 diabetes. © 2011 Jensen, Rustad, Kolnes and Lai.","De novo lipogenesis; Exercise; Glycogen phosphorylase; Glycogen synthase; Insulin resistance; Type 2 diabetes",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861857806

This article investigates two approaches to obtain a low-order state space description of a borehole heat exchanger(BHE): (1) model reduction (MR) of a one-dimensional finite-difference model (1D-FDM) and (2) parameter estimation (PE). The resulting models are compared to the duct storage model (DST-model) implemented in TRNSYS. It is found that a sixth-order model, obtained by MR of a 1D-FDM, is able to predict the mean fluid temperature for a typical annual load profile with an accuracy of up to 2%. Further decreasing the model order by means of MR yields a bad description of the faster dynamics excited by the load profile. The performance of such very low-order models is significantly improved by PE. The maximum temperature error for a fourth-order model obtained by PE using identification data covering a period of three months, for instance, is a factor 4 lower than for a fourth-order model obtained by MR. This benefit is partially counterweighted by an inferior extrapolation capacity. Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the impact of non-idealities, namely (1) the impact of estimation errors on the physical parameters used to set up the 1D-FDM and (2) the impact of measurement noise on the models found by PE. It is shown that the ground thermal conductivity is the parameter that mostly affects the accuracy of the 1D-FDM and, thus, of the reducedorder models derived. The main impact of measurement noise is the reduction of the maximum model order for parameter estitmation to six or lower, depending on the identification dataset used and the magnitude of the measurement error.

Protection of such systems is provided by Fast Discharge Units (FDU). In case of failure, in particular quench in a superconducting coil, rather fast and safe energy discharge from the magnetic system is provided by FDU, which breaks the coil supply loop and provides energy dissipation in high energy resistors. The ITER FDU should interrupt currents up to 70 kA with a voltage up to 10 kV. The FDU includes a two-stage switch consisting of a ByPass Switch (BPS, contactor with a pneumatic drive) and a fast vacuum circuit breaker (VCB). The other important part of FDU is a capacitor bank for generating the counter current pulse. The closed BPS carries a steady-state current up to 70 kA. Once the BPS opens, current passes into closed contacts of VCB. Shortly after, the VCB opens and the capacitor bank generates a counter current pulse, which compensates the current in VCB. In such a way the arcless current commutation is provided in the FDU. This paper studies the transients during FDU electrical switch-off. Peculiarities of the capacitor bank operation are considered. Capacitive storage rated for 5 kV, 70 kA is described. The tests results of capacitor bank are presented. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Arcless current commutation; Capacitive storage; Capacitor bank; Counter current; Energy discharge; Fast discharges; High energy; Magnetic system; Steady-state currents; Super-conducting coils; Supply loop; Two-stage switches; Vacuum circuit breaker; Capacitors; Electric equipment; Energy dissipation; Power quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861388537

That stimulated an extensive search for alternative environment-friendly fuel sources. Since 2003, as a viable alternative, Hydrogen technologies have been included in the framework programmes of the European Commission. In October 2008 these technologies have been labelled ""one of Europe's leading new strategic energy technologies of the future"" with ample financial support for the next six years. In spite of the sizable efforts in this domain, two of the main elements of hydrogen economy that still await a viable solution are the storage and transport of hydrogen. A possible solution to these issues could be the increase of the hydrogen generation efficiency which would allow for its production on site when needed. In that sense, no storage or transport of fuel is required. Pulse electrolysis, widely used in the field of electrodeposition and electrochemical surface treatment, appears to be a new promising method for high efficient water splitting. There is already a proof of the concept by Shimitzu et. al., using ultra-short pulses in certain conditions. The use of pulse electrolysis for water splitting offers more aggressive conditions for the electrode materials which is supposed to lead to increase of their degradation. This phenomenon is of great fundamental scientific interest, thus one of the main goals of the investigation is to elucidate the mechanism of the processes underlying it.","Corrosion; Environment-friendly technologies; Hydrogen technologies; Material degradation; Oxyhydrogen technologies; Pulse electrolysis",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860894628

We propose a lexicographic ordering of the objectives so that the end user's energy cost is considered as the primary objective and the system's stability is the secondary objective. In order to evaluate the performances, we provide a comprehensive micro-simulation environment used to study different demand response (DR) price profiles. The proposed multi-objective approach mitigates the network instability effects introduced by static DR programs with high price volatility. We conclude that almost flat DR price profiles with higher rates during high-peak periods should be preferred instead of high volatile profiles. With flat DR price profiles, both the end user and the utility company can benefit from smart-control algorithms adopting a lexicographic multi-objective optimization scheme. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Bi-directional; Demand response; Dispatchable load; Economic Dispatch; Economic dispatch problems; End users; Energy bills; Energy cost; High price; Lexicographic ordering; Micro grid; Microsimulation; Multi objective; Multi objective optimizations (MOO); Multi-objective optimization scheme; Optimal controls; Primary objective; Unit commitment problem; Utility companies; Volatile profile; Algorithms; Electric utilities; Exhibitions; Multiobjective optimization; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Structural analysis; System stability; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860771271

This paper examines the sustainability of cold chains by analysing product carbon footprints for some refrigerated foods produced in NZ and consumed in the UK. The impact of the refrigeration component is only about 20% of the total impact of the food supply chain. The main environmental impacts of the cold chain are due to refrigerant leakage and energy use, although water use and construction materials can also be important factors. The impact increases with length of storage and/or transport, so eating local seasonal production after minimal storage is often the most sustainable option. Imported counter-seasonal food can be more sustainable than storage of local production especially when primary production in the exporting country is significantly more efficient. On-going efforts to reduce refrigerant leaks, transition to non-ODP and low GWP refrigerants such as natural refrigerants, and improve energy efficiency are all high priority ways to improve sustainability of the cold chain. If yearround supply of perishable products is demanded, then refrigerated storage offers a relatively low cost and low impact solution that is better than most other preservation methods or high rates of food wastage. Changes to eating habits are probably necessary if very large improvements in sustainability of the food chain are to be achieved.","Carbon footprint; Food cold chain; International trade; Refrigerated food; Sustainability","Cold chain; Eating habits; Energy use; Essential component; Food chain; High rate; Local production; Low costs; Natural refrigerants; Perishable product; Primary production; Product carbon footprints; Refrigerated storages; Water use; Carbon footprint; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Food preservation; Food supply; International trade; Quality management; Refrigerants; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Water supply; Food storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860761085

All the available conservation technologies intend to keep these products fresh for longer periods, without significant changes in their organoleptical, compositional and physical characteristics. Indeed, if the water activity is reduced to appropriate level, the shelf life of dried product can be increased. It allows a long storage period, permitting the use in industrial production lines and reduction of production costs of derivative products. Besides, drying is one of the most energy spending process. Consequently, it is necessary that heat and mass transfer mechanisms would be raised by specific appropriated equipments and techniques. So, in the present research work, a continuous dryer with expected energy efficiency and potential preservation of original characteristics of the product was used for drying potato samples. In this equipment, it is possible to conjugate a convective drying process with energy complementation by infrared radiant energy and with a vacuum pulse drying. In this way, cubed samples were submitted to different drying process conditions and then, drying kinetics and mechanical properties (Young modulus or modulus of elasticity) of the final samples were evaluated. The mechanical properties were obtained using a compression testing machine. Results were evaluated by response surface methodology based on drying experimental design in order to identify the effects of drying operational parameters on modulus of elasticity.","Drying kinetic; Modulus of elasticity; Pulse drying","Artificial drying; Complementation; Compression testing machines; Conservation technologies; Convective drying; Dried products; Drying kinetic; Drying process; Heat and mass transfer; Industrial production lines; Operational parameters; Physical characteristics; Production cost; Radiant energy; Response surface methodology; Shelf life; Storage periods; Vacuum pulse; Water activity; Young modulus; Agricultural products; Compression testing; Elastic moduli; Energy efficiency; Heat convection; Quality management; Thermal processing (foods); Infrared drying",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860744212

The study focused on the changes in colour parameters of beef (m. semitendinosus) exposed to fluorescent light of different intensity during cold storage. The first stage of the study showed that after the muscle had been cut, it took 16-18 minutes for the colour parameters to stabilise, which was a consequence of the oxygen partial pressure. Storing meat exposed to fluorescent light showed that, in this time, beef colour was stable and was not affected by the light intensity. Only a few days of storing culinary beef in exposure to light significantly deteriorated its colour stability. All changes affected, above all, the coefficient of redness a*, whose value decreased markedly by 4-7 units after storing for seven days.

Stability of anthocyanins was determined by different factors, such as temperature and heating duration. Fresh and thermally (heated at the temperature +80 °C) treated product was analyzed. Berry mass was stored for 8 days at the temperature +4°C. During storage composition of anthocyanins may reduce in berry mass. Chemical and physical indices of the product - color, pH, soluble dry matter, anthocyanins, and phenols were determined. Analyses were carried out with the interval of 2 days.

The aim of this research was to evaluate and compare the performance of three different strategies for aeration of corn grains during 24 days storage. The following strategies were investigated: continuous aeration, nighttime aeration and aeration at equilibrium moisture content conditions between the grain and the ambient air. Corn grains at two different moisture content levels, 11% (w.b.) and 17% (w.b.), were used. Continuous monitoring of temperature through sensors was done and grain samples were taken for moisture content measures throughout the storage time. All aeration strategies favored temperature reduction of dry and wet grains, but none strategy could maintain homogeneity in temperature inside the grain during the storage. Continuous aeration strategy was the most efficient for wet grains, since it avoided grains heating during storage. Grains moisture content changed during the experimental period and a tendency of drying at the end of the process was observed.","Grain conservation; Moisture content; Storage; Temperature","Aeration strategies; Ambient air; Continuous monitoring; Corn grain; Dry and wet; Equilibrium moisture contents; Grain temperature; Risk of damage; Storage time; Stored grains; Temperature reduction; Energy storage; Moisture; Moisture determination; Quality management; Temperature; Food storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860710727

Different coordination concepts for EVs are being investigated, in which vehicles can be intelligently charged or discharged feeding power back to the grid in vehicle-to-grid mode (V2G). To respond to such needs, EVs are required to share their battery internal data as well as respond to external control signals.

In case of cocoa beans, fermentation and drying are the key operations in order to obtain a final product with quality. Drying has the objective to reduce moisture content. High values of these parameters can lead to microorganism's growth and lower values to excessive energy consumption during drying. The developments of dryers, calculations of energy requirement during drying and water properties at food surface are some of the items that thermodynamic properties provide useful information. Thus, this work had the purpose to calculate the thermodynamic properties during the drying process of cocoa beans. Cocoa was harvested and beans were retrieved from fruits naturally fermented and dried at environment conditions until 50 % d.b. (dry basis). Afterwards, cocoa beans were dried through the dynamic or gravimetric method in several different temperature (25, 35, 45 e 55°C) and relative humidity (30, 40, 50, 60, 70 e 80 %) conditions. A temperature-controlled chamber was used in order to acquire the drying conditions. Airflow was monitored with an anemometer with rotating blades and it was about 10 m 3 min -1 m -2. Experimental data of equilibrium moisture content were fitted to the Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) model. The integral isosteric heat of desorption and differential entropy of the drying process of cocoa beans increased with decrease in equilibrium moisture content, and this trend also occurred with Gibbs free energy.","Entropy; Gibbs free energy; Isosteric heat; Theobroma cacao","Cocoa beans; Differential entropy; Drying condition; Drying process; Energy requirements; Environment conditions; Equilibrium moisture contents; Experimental data; Food surfaces; Gravimetric methods; Isosteric heat of desorption; Isosteric heats; Key operations; Postharvest; Rotating blades; Theobroma cacao; Water properties; Agricultural products; Cocoa; Desorption; Energy utilization; Entropy; Gibbs free energy; Moisture determination; Quality management; Drying",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860703208

In the study we specifically address advantages coming from daily variations in outdoor temperature and electricity prices but other aspects such as peak load reduction are also considered. An important contribution of this paper is also the formulation of a new cost function for our proposed power management system. This means the refrigeration system is enabled to contribute with ancillary services to the balancing power market. Since significant amounts of regulating power are needed for a higher penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, this feature will be in high demand in a future intelligent power grid (Smart Grid). Our perspective is seen from the refrigeration system but, as we demonstrate, the involvement in the balancing market can be economically beneficial for the system itself, while delivering crucial services to the Smart Grid.

Today the methods for mass energy storage are the pumped hydro-electric and Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES). Whilst the former requires two reservoirs at different levels, the CAES requires only space for storing compressed air. Underground caverns have been used for CAES in power plants in Huntorf of Germany, 1978 and McIntosh of Alabama, USA, 1991 (Crotogino et al. [2]). The CAES of a power plant is to regulate the mismatching supply and demand of the grid power, so that the electricity would not be wasted when it is not needed. It is equally important to save energy as to regenerate it. To store the equivalent energy of a power plant, a sizable container is needed. Suitable underground caverns are difficult to find. Bridge structures are plentiful in many cities and their body space is voluminous. Steel pipes are the most effective structural element in storing compressed air. It can perform as a beam to carry loads. The new bridge form is to replace the girders with steel pipes that can carry loads and compressed air. The pipes provide the space for storing mass of unwanted electricity and the intermittent power output from regenerated energy sources such as wind and solar. The stored compressed air can be released to regenerate power according to the demands. The bridge is designed to operate in three levels of safety measures. With proper implementation, it will substantially reduce the energy wastage in the grid and the carbon footprint of the city, and create new industry and new jobs. This paper gives a description of the new bridge form and its applications. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

Also, three small signal input impedance modeling methods are described, the first is the reduced order modeling methodology or steady state variables averaged model, the second is based on the assumption of no energy storage at the AC and DC side of the inverter, and the third uses an approximation of the impedance with current frequency components. For the three methods a comparative evaluation with the impedance obtained was realized by the application of a voltage perturbation to the DC side.

The presence of the chemical and magnetic disorder hindered any previous attempt to calculate the fundamental electronic, structural and mechanical properties of austenitic stainless steels from first-principles theories. Our ability to reach an ab initio atomistic level approach in this exciting field has become possible by the Exact Muffin-Tin Orbitals (EMTO) method. This method, in combination with the coherent potential approximation, has proved an accurate tool in the description of the concentrated random alloys. Using the EMTO method, we presented an insight to the electronic and magnetic structure, and micromechanical properties of austenitic stainless steel alloys. In the present contribution, we will discuss the role of magnetism on the stacking fault energies and elastic properties of paramagnetic Fe-based alloys. © 2011 Materials Research Society.",,"Ab initio; Atomistic levels; Building blockes; Coherent potential approximation; Elastic properties; Engineering materials; Exciting field; Fe-based alloys; First-principles theory; Food production; Magnetic disorder; Micromechanical property; Nonmagnetics; Orbitals; Random alloy; Stacking fault energies; Structural and mechanical properties; Alloy steel; Austenitic stainless steel; Chromium; Food storage; Mechanical properties; Paramagnetic materials; Paramagnetism; Tin; Cerium alloys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859142705

Many research programs are conducted in the Pacific islands, producing a wealth of scientific findings, but those are often scattered on different mediums (hard drives, CDs, intranets.), leaving local authorities with incomplete, hard to exploit results. This paper introduces a solution to help decision-makers access scientific data from a centralized, integrated source, so that data is easy to find, to identify and thus to use. This solution is being developed by two French organizations: the University of New Caledonia (UNC) and the Research Institute for Development (IRD). It uses a web-based, interoperable architecture. The major issues to overcome to provide such an architecture are: availability, accessibility, security, and metadata management (copyrights, authors, protocols .), with all of these in a multilingual context.

Over and above rapid cost increases, newly established dairy farms (farm conversions) are faced with the very high capital costs for electricity network connection, often totalling several hundred thousand NZ$. Progress with renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar-based electricity generation, and recent New Zealand advances with covered anaerobic pond biogas systems treating dairy shed effluent, offer options for establishing energy autonomous dairy farms which rely on a combination of renewable energy resources. Biogas can be stored over short to medium time periods and can therefore, in combination with other storage technologies, provide a back-up and buffer for intermittent renewable electricity generation from wind and solar energy. In this paper, we analyse farm energy needs and renewable on-farm energy resource potential and present a model of a generic 600-cow dairy farm aiming for energy autonomy based on a combination of on-farm biogas, solar and wind technologies, as well as energy-storage technologies. The wind and solar potential was evaluated at four New Zealand locations with contrasting climatic conditions and representative of the majority of NZ dairy regions. For a Southland location, which indicated the best wind but poorest solar resource, energy balances were modelled at a finer scale. For this site the yields of a 30 kW wind turbine, a 30 kW solar set-up and the biogas resources available from the cow shed effluent of the 600-cow dairy farm were calculated. The energy yields were balanced against the farms projected energy demand and the buffer available from the biogas resource to determine the level of achievable energy autonomy. Wind generation yields at farm scale were found to be very location specific and variable and even at the most favourable location in Southland, low compared to larger scale wind projects. The modelled 30 kW wind turbine could provide 30% of farm energy needs with weekly totals varying from 2-78%. Solar generation was found to be more consistent and reliable at all 4 locations. On average, 38% of the Southland farm energy demand could be met with a 30 kW solar set-up, with weekly totals varying from 9-63%. Biogas based electricity generation was able to supply 33% of the total energy demand of the model farm. In combination with the 32% of farm energy needs that could simultaneously be satisfied with biogas generator waste heat of 2/3 total farm energy needs could be met reliably and on demand with biogas. Analysis of weekly farm energy demand indicated that nearly full energy autonomy could be achieved for most of the year with a combination of biogas and solar based generation in conjunction with some further established energy storage technology at the Southland farm. The combination of biogas and wind generation yielded poorer results. For the combination of biogas and solar at Southland, the modelled energy shortfall (5.7% of total) occurring over 20 weeks of the milking season could be met with a biogas generator back-up fuel such as LPG. For the Southland farm 1,587 kg LPG per year would be needed to achieve 100% energy autonomy with the described biogas and solar set-up. Increasing the solar generation capacity to meet the shortfall was found to be impractical as the PV set-up would have to have its capacity quadrupled to meet the shortfall occurring in the last week before the dry season starts. This initial modelling exercise showed that the concept of energy independent dairy farms based on primarily renewable energy resources is feasible in principal. More detailed work needs to be carried out to quantify the energy balances on a finer time scale (e.g. hourly) and required capacity of secondary energy storage equipment. Although outside the scope of this work it is indicated that the cost of the outlined alternative energy provision scheme will be favourable, provided it enables the farm to avoid the expense for a new electricity grid connection.","Biogas; Farm conversion; Flow chart; Solar; Spreadsheet model; Wind turbine","Alternative energy; Anaerobic ponds; Capital costs; Climatic conditions; Cost-increases; Dairy farms; Dry seasons; Electricity generation; Electricity grids; Electricity networks; Energy autonomies; Energy demands; Energy needs; Energy yields; Farm scale; Flow charts; New zealand; Renewable electricity; Renewable energy technologies; Resource potentials; Solar; Solar generation; Solar potential; Solar resources; Spreadsheet model; Storage technology; Time-periods; Time-scales; Total energy; Wind generation; Wind projects; Wind technology; Biogas; Buffer storage; Costs; Electric generators; Electric utilities; Electricity; Energy balance; Energy resources; Energy storage; Farms; Technology; Uncertainty analysis; Waste heat; Wind power; Wind turbines; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858854397

Analysis of variance showed that there were highly significant differences among the genotypes, chemical treatments, and storage periods. Highly significant differences were also recorded for all the interactions among the factors studied. On average, the highest germination energy was found in the hybrid H2 (93.45%), whose values of this parameter were highly significantly higher than those of the rest of the genotypes, except for the hybrid H1. Also, each of the hybrids had highly significantly higher germination energy than either of the two lines, and the differences among the hybrids themselves were highly significant. Looking at the chemical treatments, the control had the highest germination energy by a highly significant margin (80.39%). The largest difference was observed in relation to the treatments with insecticides (5.48 and 9.56%). These treatments had highly significantly lower values of germination energy than those involving fungicides. Germination energy increased in the first nine months of storage, peaking at 81.29%. After that, there was a sharp drop to 68.94% after 12 months of storing.

Furthermore, the ability of recovering energy of the vehicle during breaking can increase the system efficiency. The flywheel-based all-electric driveline investigated here has its novelty in the use of a double-wound flywheel motor/generator, which divides the system in two different voltage levels, enhancing the efficiency of the electric driveline. The connection of two AC electrical machines (i.e., the flywheel and the wheel motor) with different and variable operation frequency is challenging. A power matching control applied to an AC/DC/AC converter has been implemented. The AC/DC/AC converter regenerates the electric power converted during braking to the flywheel machine, used here as power handling device. By controlling the power balance, the same hardware can be used for acceleration and braking, providing the reduction of harmonics and robust response. A simulation of the complete system during braking mode has been performed both in Matlab and Simulink, and their results have been compared.

This technology has narrowed the digital divide between the urban and the rural. However, limitation in electricity supply is the major constraint in powering up the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) equipment in the rural. Consistent electricity supply has become an obstacle in deploying computing systems in the rural environment. Therefore, green and energy efficient power architecture has been proposed in this paper to reduce power wastage and make efficient use of the power for consumption by ICT equipment in order to prolong the operating time of the equipment. Green power architecture can generally be organized into several areas of application such as power sustainability, energy efficiency and reduction in power loss. The effective use of power provision in rural areas has also been taken into consideration. This paper shows that systems that are direct DC powered, wired networked and use solid state Hard Disk Drive (HDD) are more energy efficient and those are the important parameters for rural computing implementation. © 2011 IEEE.","Green Computing Archirecture; Information and Communications Technologies (ICT)","Computer technology; Computing system; Digital divide; Electricity supply; Energy efficient; Green Computing Archirecture; Green power; Hard disk drives; Information and communications technology; Operating time; Power wastage; Power-losses; Rural environment; DC power transmission; Energy efficiency; Equipment; Hard disk storage; Rural areas; Telephone systems; Information technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858167596

Among the various renewable resources, hybrid solar and wind energy seems to be promising solutions to provide reliable power supply with improved system efficiency and reduced storage requirements for stand-alone applications. This paper presents a feasibility assessment and optimum size of photovoltaic (PV) array, wind turbine and battery bank for a standalone hybrid Solar/Wind Power system (HSWPS) at remote telecom station of Nepal at Latitude (27023′ 50″) and Longitude (86044′23″) consisting a telecommunication load of Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT), Repeater station and Code Division Multiple Access Base Transceiver Station (CDMA 2C10 BTS). In any RES based system, the feasibility assessment is considered as the first step analysis. In this work, feasibility analysis is carried through hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER) and mathematical models were implemented in the MATLAB environment to perform the optimal configuration for a given load and a desired loss of power supply probability (LPSP) from a set of systems components with the lowest value of cost function defined in terms of reliability and levelized unit electricity cost (LUCE). The simulation results for the existing and the proposed models are compared. The simulation results shows that existing architecture consisting of 6.12 kW KC85T photovoltaic modules, 1kW H3.1 wind turbine and 1600 Ah GFM-800 battery bank have a 36.6% of unmet load during a year.

Comparisons of the distal gut microbiota of genetically obese mice and their lean littermates, as well as those of obese and lean human volunteers have revealed that obesity is associated with changes in the relative abundance of the two dominant bacterial divisions (phylum), the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes.

One way of resolving the first issue consists of building more traditional power generation units (fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric ...) and building a stronger grid. However, with the democratization of alternative green energy sources more elegant solutions are now becoming viable. Indeed, in the last decade solar panels have not only become affordable but also more efficient. Tackling the energy problem this way permits to relieve the grid but more importantly can also reduce the electricity bill of the user. But given the fluctuant nature of solar energy a smart planning and usage of such energy sources has to be undertaken. In that context a global energy flux optimization is proposed. The latter aims at optimizing the internal (within the house) and external (to and from the main power grid) energy fluxes in a building that is equipped with: solar panels (and the required hardware for domestic voltage generation), a control station (that performs the optimization process and manages the energy fluxes), a battery (for local energy storage), an electrolyzer system (for the car gas production, compression and storage) and a fuel cell powered car This article is the first step of the total energy chain simulation; the article is divided in two main sections. First the different components are described, from a hardware point of view; their interconnections are also highlighted. Focus is naturally given to the control station, which is the core of the energy flux handling. Second, the chosen energy flux modeling formalism will be presented.

These changes are intended to promote greater security in supply, to reduce energy bills as well as greenhouse gas emissions. If this effort make sense anywhere, it is even more significant in islands where conventional primary energy is considerably more expensive. Given the intermittence of renewable sources such as solar and wind, it becomes essential to search for effective solutions to integrate them into the grid.

Peer to peer systems have resources which they share with other peers on network. Existing peer to peer systems are based on WAN connection links, implementing overlay network in order to achieve connectivity with logical addressing scheme. The most important issue that peer to peer systems have to provide is availability of data using some sort of replication and redudancy.

It is controlled by a MIAC unit using proportional integral derivative (PID) control technique. The output of the boost converter is tracked and measured continuously and the values are sent to the MIAC unit to produce pulse-width-modulation (PWM) signal. The PWM signal is used to control the duty cycle of the boost converter. Typical application of this boost converter is to provide DC power supply for inverter either for grid-connected or standalone system.

We presume that the wind generator and the PV panels work jointly in autonomous mode. Systems of the given configuration are used mainly in remote sites or islands, where it is not economically reasonable to establish an electrical grid. The existing wind generator systems are mostly over-dimensioned to provide maximum energy supply reliability, hence their high cost as a rule. Wind and solar conditions are unique for any certain area. Nowadays it is possible to get climate data for a longer period due to which it is possible to rely on an analysis of real conditions. The longer the data row, the more true results it is possible to achieve. If 100 % reliability is aimed at, it will be necessary to guarantee certain capacity of electrical storage. Compromises in reliability might result in a decrease in electrical storage capacity, which will make the system cheaper. In our paper we have not targeted at an economic analysis; however, we will present a methodology for sizing and optimizing the components of a wind-PV energy system according to certain climate conditions.","Energy supply probability; Heat storage; Integrated energy system; Wind and PV energy","Autonomous mode; Climate condition; Climate data; Electrical grids; Energy supplies; Energy systems; Heat storage systems; High costs; Integrated energy system; Integrated energy systems; Probabilistic information; PV panel; Remote sites; Storage capacity; Wind generator systems; Economic analysis; Energy resources; Heat storage; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Regional planning; Reliability; Rural areas; Wind power; Electric utilities",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857337976

In this study a cover over the supply lines was imposed. It has been found that the cover for the side supply feature improves the temperature distributions in the tank. For the bottom supply feature investigations indicated important improvement in the total usable hot water. Approximately 17% saving in usable hot water was achieved by using a round curved cover on the bottom supply line.

The self-powered controller takes advantage of the movement of the user in motion-intensive video games, e.g. continuous pressing of buttons in a 100m sprinting game or the swinging action in a tennis video game. The kinetic energy of the user is converted into electric energy by the use of electromagnetic induction. The electrical energy harvesting circuit consists of a copper coil that houses a mobile permanent magnet. The experimental setup includes AC-DC rectification circuit with a capacitor and an energy storage device. The load is the micro-controller that generates the desired signal to the wireless communication. This paper uses radio frequency for wireless communication. Magnetic reed switches that will be triggered at the proximity of the permanent magnet are implemented at the sides of the controller to replace the traditional left and right buttons. These allows the user to perform dual functions when playing the game, and that is to self-power the controller and also sending the action commands to the game software without pressing any button. A computer game software is created to receive the data from the controller and perform some simple game actions. The conclusion of this paper is a controller that is self-powered while the user is playing game with it.

Consequently, the second one represents the volume changes associated with dendritic solidification phenomena during the interdendritic coherent region in the mushy zone. Calculations for Fe-C binary alloys show that the straining criteria such as strain rate and accumulated strain are sensitive to the solidification behavior of different steel alloys. The results also point out that good predications of different phases, accurate alloy properties (especially thermal expansion coefficient), and precise enthalpy functions during dendritic solidification are extremely necessary. Also, the predications show that the dendrite coherency criterion is considered an essential parameter to define ITM strain of particularly long solidification interval alloys.

However, developing mobile cloud applications involves working with services and APIs from different cloud vendors. Most often these APIs are not interoperable and the information processed and stored into the cloud is non-transferable across clouds. To counter these problems, a generic middleware framework, Mobile Cloud Middleware (MCM) is designed, which handles the interoperability issues, and eases the use of process-intensive services from mobile phones. A prototype of MCM is developed and several applications are demonstrated in different domains. Moreover, to verify the scalability of MCM, load tests are performed on the hybrid cloud resources.

Battery-only Electric Vehicles (BEV) need a very large energy storage system so the use of a Range Extender (RE) may allow a significant downsizing of these bulky components. The Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) have two major discarded energy fluxes, engine cooling and exhaust gas. In Extended Range Electric Vehicles (EREV) and hybrids the potential for heat conversion into electricity is particularly convenient. The direct conversion of thermal energy into electricity, using Thermoelectric Generators (TEG) is very attractive in terms of complexity. However, current commercial TEG modules based on Seebeck effect are temperature limited, so they are unable to be in direct contact with the exhaust gases. A way to downgrade the temperature levels without reducing its potential is to interpose Heat Pipes (HP) between the exhaust gas and the modules. This control of maximum temperature at the modules is achieved by regulating the pressure of phase change of the HP fluid. Such design is convenient for engines with large thermal load variations, such as the RE being developed by the team, with a low (15kW) and a high (40kW) power mode of operation. This system will be able to operate efficiently in both modes. The present work presents the thermal modelling of such a system in order to assess the suitability of this approach. This work is complemented with the experimental work being carried out by the team in this subject, already with some published results. The model was validated with experimental data with a good correlation. Therefore, it was possible to demonstrate the potential of this system for wasted heat recovery. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Direct contact; Direct conversion; Energy fluxes; Energy storage systems; Engine cooling; Experimental data; Extended range; Good correlations; Load variations; Maximum temperature; Phase Change; Power modes; Recent trends; Temperature level; Temperature limiteds; Thermal modelling; Thermoelectric generators; Waste energy; Electric generators; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy conversion; Heat pipes; Industrial electronics; Internal combustion engines; Solid wastes; Temperature; Thermoelectric energy conversion; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Waste incineration; Exhaust gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856527787

Existing approaches, however, do not fully address certain significant issues, such as Service Level Agreements, which tend to be rudimentary, and management of cloud systems, which often lacks sophistication. In this paper, we propose the definition and development of management models that systematically describe the resources, services, usage, and requirements in the context of a cloud storage environment. Furthermore, we introduce content oriented SLA Schemas, which are adapted according to the content term involved in each SLA. Combining all this often heterogeneous information in a smart, structured, and uniform manner can provide significant added value, allowing correlations, links and extraction of useful inferences. We thus propose to incorporate these models in a rich Unified Management Model, which will contribute to optimum decision making, data movement, as well as better resource allocation and energy management, also leading to enhanced Quality of Service.

This type of energy transfer is of great interest in various green energy conversion technologies involving irregular sources of power such as wave and wind with time-varying amplitudes and frequencies. Motivated by these applications, a novel modeling and control scheme is developed for a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) boost converter. In particular, conditions under which the converter would act as a pseudo-resistor as seen by an arbitrary input voltage source are derived. Based on the pseudo-resistive relationship obtained between the input voltage and current a feedback controller is developed that regulates the converter input resistance to a desired value. The importance of this result is that power absorption can be controlled with unity power factor by controlling the input resistance of the converter for an arbitrary band-limited input voltage.

Energy allocation of lipid reserves into liver, gonad and muscle were analyzed for the first time for different gonad maturation stages of S. lysan from the Sri Lankan waters. Relationships of energy storage with body size and gonad maturation stages and percentage of water content and lipid content of muscle, liver and gonad were computed and compared. Results showed that lipid content in the liver varied between 4.54 and 66.96% (Mean 31.11±14.10%) and revealed liver is the major energy storage site in S. lysan. Mean values for percentage of lipid reserve in ovary and liver for maturing female was 20.42 and 41.35% whereas for pre-spawning female was 44.2 and 30.79%, respectively. Similar trend was also obtained for males and it emphasize that the lipid stored in the liver during the maturing stage is mobilized towards the gonad during pre-spawning for gonad development, gamete production and other reproductive purposes. Regression analysis showed that the percentage of lipid of liver, gonad and muscle for all individuals showed a significant curvilinear relationship with standard length. Moreover, a curvilinear relationship was obtained between standard length and lipid hepatosomatic index but linear relationship was obtained between standard length and lipid gonadosomatic index. Interestingly, inverse linear relationship was obtained between percentage of water content and lipid content of muscle, liver and gonad.

Therefore, each sensor node needs its own energy supply unit. Sustainable WSNs are powered by energy harvesting systems (EHSs). These systems harvest and buffer the energy from the environment into rechargeable batteries or double layer capacitors. Due to the fact that the connectivity of the WSN depends on every single sensor node, it is important to know the state-of-charge (SoC) of the buffer to determine the remaining operating time. Therefore, each node has to measure its SoC, calculate the remaining operating time and populate this information through the network. The measurement is usually done by an integrated analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of the microcontroller. Each ADC has a specified error that has to be taken into account at the calculations of the remaining operating time.

Their waste products are also causing global environment problems. One of the solutions is to replace the existing fossil fuel energy systems by the hydrogen energy system. This paper presents a small electrical energy generator based on solar-hydrogen fuel cell. The system comprises solar modules, electrolyzer, fuel cell, and hydrogen storage. Two solar modules of 50 watts peak output each with the help of DC-DC converter provide constant power of 26.28 watts to an PEM electrolyzer to produce 10 liters hydrogen gas within 150 minutes. Using high pressure, the hydrogen gas is then injected into metal cartridge to form metal hydride. The energy efficiency of electrolyzer is up to 75%. The cartridge containing hydrogen is then plugged in to PEM fuel cell to generate electricity. The global power output of fuel cell is 2.8 amperes and 23.5 watts evaluated at 8 volts. The current energy efficiency deduced for the load of 6 Ω is up to 36%. Supplied with 10 liters of hydrogen gas and operated under 6 Ω load, the running time is approximately 40 minutes with average power output of 9.8 watts. The waste products of entire process are merely pure water, heat, and oxygen gas. This small system is successful in demonstrating the future energy scenario of renewable and clean energy. © 2011 IEEE.","electrolyzer; fuel cell; hydrogen; renewable; solar","Average power; Clean energy; Constant power; Electrical energy; Electrolyzers; Energy demands; Energy scenarios; Energy source; Fossil fuel energy; Fuel cell technologies; Generate electricity; Global environment problems; High pressure; Hydrogen energy systems; Hydrogen gas; Metal hydrides; Oxygen gas; PEM fuel cell; PEM-electrolyzer; Power out put; Pure water; renewable; Running time; Small systems; solar; Solar module; Waste products; Biomedical engineering; Communication; DC power transmission; DC-DC converters; Electric generators; Electrolytic cells; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Information technology; Projectiles; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855964002

Such systems are advantageous over the usual ceiling cooling systems because (1)the PCM layer may store considerably greater amounts of heat than those stored in the concrete slab, and (2)night cooling takes place under reduced electricity prices and meets the requirement of smoothing out electricity consumption by reducing daily peak loads. To simulate the phase change process, the concept of effective thermal capacity function is used, which is determined experimentally and then generalized by using triangular functions. Tests are also made with related functions given in the literature. The predictions of this study showed that the use of night ceiling cooling systems with PCM-embedded piping may offer energy savings and more thermal comfort than systems without PCM, even in cases in which system parameters do not permit the user to take advantage of the entire PCM storage capacity.

Usually the donor pancreas is preserved with University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. A large number of reports have shown that the two-layer method (TLM), which employsoxygenated perfluorochemical and UW solution, is superior to simple cold storage. However, the extensive use of TLM is cost intensive and there is evidence that TLM only oxygenates small parts of the organ preserved. Another possibility to increase the oxygen supply during organ preservation would be the use of hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) which increases the oxygen tension in fluids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pre-oxygenation of different preservation solutions on organ quality in terms of high energy phosphate levels as well as the occurrence of apoptosis and the induction of heat shock proteins and nitrosative stress induced cell death in porcine pancreatic tissue. Methods: Porcine pancreatic tissue was preserved in different preservation solutions with or without pre-oxygenation for 6 hours of cold ischemic time (CIT). Then, tissue specimens were harvested and high energy phosphate levels were determined byHPLC. Moreover, immunohistochemistry was performed in order to detect occurrence of apoptosis, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) as well as nitrosative stress induced cell death. Results: Organs stored in pre-oxygenated UW solution showed best results in terms of high energy phosphate levels; apoptotic cells per islet as well as HSP70 positivity were significantly less when compared to simple UW storage and all other organ preservation solutions with or without pre-oxygenation. Conclusions: Pre-oxygenation of UW solution is a simple and promising method toimprove islet cell quality after cold organ storage. However, further in vitro experiments have to be performed in order to confirm these findings. © Springer-Verlag 2011.","HBO; High energy phosphates; Pancreas preservation; Preservation solution","celsior; heat shock protein 70; HTK solution; phosphate; University of Wisconsin solution; animal cell; animal tissue; apoptosis; article; cell death; cold ischemia; controlled study; high performance liquid chromatography; hyperbaric oxygen; male; nitrosative stress; nonhuman; organ preservation; pancreas; pancreas islet cell; swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855906386

In this work, we address the optimal energy storage control problem from the side of the utility operator. The operator controller receives power demand requests with different power requirements and durations that are activated immediately. The controller has access to one energy storage device of finite capacity. The objective is to devise an energy storage control policy that minimizes long-term average grid operational cost. The cost is a convex function of instantaneous power demand that is satisfied from the grid, and it reflects the fact that each additional unit of power needed to serve demands is more expensive as the demand load increases. For the online dynamic control problem, we derive a threshold-based control policy that attempts to maintain balanced power consumption from the grid at all times, in the presence of continual generation and completion of demands. The policy adaptively performs charging or discharging of the storage device. The former increases power consumption from the grid and the latter satisfies part of the grid demand from the stored energy. We prove that the policy is asymptotically optimal as the storage capacity becomes large, and we numerically show that it performs very well even for finite capacity. The off-line problem over a finite time horizon that assumes a priori known power consumption to be satisfied at all times, is formulated and solved with Dynamic Programming. Finally, we show that the model, approach and structure of the optimal policy can be extended to also account for a renewable source that feeds the storage device. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Asymptotically optimal; Control policy; Convex functions; Demand loads; Dynamic controls; Finite capacity; Finite time horizon; Instantaneous power; Off-line problems; Operational costs; Optimal energy; Optimal policies; Power demands; Power requirement; Renewable sources; Storage capacity; Storage control; Stored energy; Controllers; Dynamic programming; Electric load management; Electric power distribution; Energy storage; Resource valuation; Structural optimization; Virtual storage; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855841901

However, the implementation of small-scale PV production units on local utilities may result in bidirectional energy flows. The simultaneous power injection at sunny moments may cause a serious voltage rise along the feeder. These overvoltages may not only damage critical loads but also switches PV inverters off causing loss of green energy at the most productive moments. This paper presents a method to limit the voltage rise by introducing small battery buffers at local production sites. A smart inverter decides whether the PV energy is injected in the grid or buffered in the batteries. The relation between battery buffer size and overvoltage reduction is presented for a typical Belgian residential distribution feeder. The influence of the buffer along the feeder is calculated by working with synthetic load profiles and solar irradiation data. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Buffer sizes; Critical load; Distribution feeders; Energy flow; Energy supplies; Green energy; Load profiles; Local production; Low-voltage distributions; Over-voltages; Power injection; Production units; PV energy; PV installations; PV inverter; Solar irradiation; Storage capacity; Voltage rise; Alternative fuels; Current limiting reactors; Feeding; Voltage distribution measurement; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855830720

As energy storage medium, aluminium batteries have high specific energy density and simple, safe construction. Aluminium is also demonstrating low-cost and high performance in energy related applications such as electric cable, light weight vehicle, building material, LED heat-sink, and solar reflector. It is particularly suited to developing countries with ease and safety of handling plus affordability. With well-conceived bootstrap strategy, clusters of businesses can be formed in developing countries to quickly bring them to the modern era with self-supported electricity and other renewable energies. Riding on the annual capacity of over 24 billion kilograms primary aluminium production and a mature industry infrastructure of recyling and processing, aluminium alloy slabs and extrusion products can be used as basis of energy efficient products for use in developing countries. Processing workshops, manufacturers, and recycling services can be established. Aluminiuim air battery stations provide battery swapping or aluminium electrode refill service, which can be used to power off-grid households and small business stalls reliably with smelting done initially through established aluminium enterprises worldwide and finally through local mini-mills using renewable energy.

One of the biggest obstacles to increase the usage of natural gas is its transportation, mostly done in its liquid form, LNG - Liquefied Natural Gas, and storage. It involves the liquefaction of natural gas, transport by ship, its storage and subsequent regasification, in order to get natural gas in its original form and send it to the final destination through natural gas pipeline system. Nowadays, most terminals for receiving, storing and regasificating LNG, as well as sending-out natural gas are built onshore. These terminals, however, are normally built close to populated areas, where consuming centers can be found, creating safety risks to the population nearby. Apart from possible damages caused by its cryogenic temperatures, LNG spills are associated with hazards such as pool fires and ignition of drifting vapor clouds. Alternatively to onshore terminals, there are currently several offshore terminals projects in the world and some are already running. Today, Brazil owns two FSRU (Floating Storage and Regasification Unit) type offshore terminals, one in Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro and the other in Pecém, Ceará, both contracted to PETROBRAS. The identification of the operation risks sources of LNG terminals onshore and offshore and its quantification through mathematical models can identify the most suitable terminal type for a particular location. In order to identify and compare the risks suggested by onshore and offshore LNG terminals, we have taken the example of the Suape Port and its Industrial Complex, located in Pernambuco, Brazil, which is a promising location for the installation of a LNG terminal. The present work has focused on calculating the distance to the LNG vapor cloud with the lower flammability limits (LFL), as well as thermal radiation emitted by pool fire, in case of a LNG spill from an onshore and from an offshore terminal. The calculation was made for both day and night periods, and for three types of events: operational accident, non-operational accident and worst case event, corresponding to a hole size of 0,75m, 1,5m e 5m, respectively. Even though the accidents that happen at an onshore terminal generate smaller vulnerability distances, according to the results it would not be desirable for the Suape Port, due to the location high density of industries and people working. Therefore, an offshore terminal would be more desirable, since it presents less risk to the surrounding populations, as well as for workers in this location.

Building owners are motivated to reduce the operational costs and are being encouraged by the attractive tariff offered by the utility power provider. However, without proper control the operational costs can be even more than the conventional system due to the higher maximum demand charge. This paper describes the results of an investigation on the actual operating data of a centralized air-conditioning plant integrated with thermal energy storage system operated under two different control strategies. Comparisons on the electrical power consumption, overall plant efficiency and chiller coefficient of performance were carried out by using two identical building load profiles. The results show that the supply pressure control is better than delta-temperature control. The electrical power consumption, overall plant efficiency and chiller coefficient of performance for supply pressure control are 30.1%, 33.4% and 33.5% better than the delta-temperature control, respectively. Also from the general observation on the data it was found out that the storage tank is under utilised. The charging capacity is usually less than the nominal storage capacity.

This arrangement yields a converter with first-order control dynamics, a buck-type converter behavior and discontinuous input current. A photovoltaic (PV) array can provide a specific maximum current depending on the irradiation conditions. This implies that if the peak value of the pulsating input current of the converter tries to exceed the PV array current, the array voltage will collapse to a value dictated by the output voltage of the converter while the output current is determined by the array current. Furthermore, when the discontinuous input current of the converter is zero, the PV array operates in an open circuit. As a consequence, it may be obvious that an energy storage element, i.e. an input capacitor, is needed in parallel with the PV array in order to filter the pulsating input current drawn by the VSI. A vast majority of VSI analysis in PV applications assumes a constant voltage input source and current control dynamics depending only on the filtering elements at the output, e.g. first order dynamics with a mere inductor. However, this assumption is not well justified as will be proven in this paper. © 2011 IEEE.","dynamic modeling; inverter; photovoltaic; RHP-zero; VSI","Dynamic modeling; inverter; photovoltaic; RHP-zero; VSI; Dynamics; Electric inverters; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; DC-DC converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855446833

On contrary to that microbes occur in such waters and form biofilms on surfaces, thus may induce corrosion processes in many industrial applications. In our study, refined saltless water (UPW) produced for the boiler of a Hungarian power plant was examined before and after storage (sampling the inlet [TKE] and outlet [TKU] waters of a storage tank) with cultivation and culture independent methods. Our results showed increased CFU and direct cell counts after the storage. Cultivation results showed the dominance of aerobic, chemoorganotrophic α-Proteobacteria in both samples. In case of TKU sample, a more complex bacterial community structure could be detected. The applied molecular method (T-RFLP) indicated the presence of a complex microbial community structure with changes in the taxon composition: while in the inlet water sample (TKE) α-Proteobacteria (Sphingomonas sp., Novosphingobium hassiacum) dominated, in the outlet water sample (TKU) the bacterial community shifted towards the dominance of α-Proteobacteria (Rhodoferax sp., Polynucleobacter sp., Sterolibacter sp.), CFB (Bacteroidetes, formerly Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group) and Firmicutes. This shift to the direction of fermentative communities suggests that storage could help the development of communities with an increased tendency toward corrosion. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","cultivation; oligotrophic bacteria; T-RFLP; ultrapure water (UPW)","ultrapure water; unclassified drug; water; Alphaproteobacteria; article; bacterial cell; bacterium culture; Bacteroides; Bradyrhizobium; cell count; colony forming unit; fermentation; Firmicutes; Flavobacterium; microbial community; nonhuman; nuclear energy; purification; restriction fragment length polymorphism; Sphingomonas; structure analysis; tank; water contamination; water sampling; water treatment; Alphaproteobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroides; Bacteroidetes; Cytophaga; Firmicutes; Flavobacterium; Novosphingobium hassiacum; Polynucleobacter; Rhodoferax sp.; Sphingomonas sp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855417216

More recently they have been applied as transport layers at PLEDs (Polymer Light-Emitting Diodes) devices. In particular, thin films of ionomer have been deposited between the cathode and the luminescent active layer, improving the efficiency of the charge injection [1,2]. Despite the success of such applications, the involved phenomena related to charge storage and transport mechanisms in ionomer thin films are still challenge to be elucidated. A detailed study of thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) was carried out to investigate dipolar relaxation and the charge storage phenomenon in films of sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) ionomers having lithium as counterions. TSDC of SPS thick samples (80 μm), polarized at temperatures higher than the glass transition temperature, showed three peaks: one at lower temperature (peak β), an intermediate peak (peak α), and a third that appeared at a temperature coincident with the polarization temperature (peak ρ). Quantitative information about trapping-detrapping and dipolar relaxation and their corresponding activation energies was determined by fittings of the deconvoluted peaks with kinetic relaxation processes. In very thin films, below 50 nm, the peak β is not recorded, and the dependence of peaks α and ρ on the polarization temperature and on the polarization field are different from those observed for thick films. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Active Layer; Charge storage; Charged polymers; Counterions; Dipolar relaxation; Polarization field; Polymer light-emitting diodes; Quantitative information; Sulfonated polystyrene; Sulfonated polystyrene ionomer; Thermally stimulated depolarization currents; Thick samples; Transport layers; Transport mechanism; Very thin films; Activation energy; Depolarization; Electrets; Electric properties; Glass transition; Ionomers; Light emitting diodes; Lithium; Polarization; Polymers; Polystyrenes; Thick films; Thin films",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855268673

We describe the management of eight GD1 patients in Slovenia who were diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 15 years. Methods: Patients were individually assessed to establish initial enzyme doses and monitored frequently to determine the effects of long-term enzyme dose regimens. Outcomes up to 10 years after long-term treatment are described by changes in the Zimran severity score index, chitotriosidase and acid phosphatase levels, and after 2001, bone parameters (DEXA bone mineral density scores and the MRI bone marrow burden score). Results: Following the initiation of enzyme therapy with individualized dose regimens (range 25-56 U/kg/14 days) and followed by a gradual reduction of doses (range 12-35 U/kg/14 days) during long-term maintenance, disease status improved in all patients as measured by the Zimran severity score index (from a mean of 11.25 [median 11.5] before therapy to a mean of 4.12 [median 3.5] at last report). Anemia and leucopenia resolved in all patients, chitotriosidase and acid phosphatase levels decreased in all patients (and by over 75% in six patients) within 1 year of treatment. Bone marrow burden scores improved in all monitored patients and DXA scores improved in six of seven monitored patients. Conclusions: We conclude that enzyme therapy with relatively low, individualized dose regimens is well-tolerated and effective in children and young adults with GD1 disease, who are regularly monitored for changes in disease status. © 2011 The Authors.

Food fortification is practically applicable and has drawn considerable attention from governmental and health agencies. The success of food fortification programs lies in the selection of vehicle and fortificant. Wheat flour fortification with minerals seems to have a greater influence compared to many other vehicles in the Indian subcontinent, where the wheat flour is mainly consumed as a dietary staple to meet energy requirements. The fortificants added should not impart undesirable characteristics to the food, such as changes in color, taste, smell, and texture. Atmospheric conditions and lack of modern storage facilities for fortified flours demand more consideration than stability and acceptability issues. Mineral fortification should not unduly curtail the shelf life of the fortified whole wheat flour. Bioavailability of mineral fortified flour has long been debated and highlights the fact that use of novel iron sources in the presence of phytic acid in wheat flour could be a better choice for fortification. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

They have gained great attention as a new green alternative to petrochemical plastic such as polypropylene. The present study was focused on mcl-PHA production by two Pseudomonas strains (Gl01 and Gl06). To make this process more economical, waste rapeseed oil was used as a carbon source. The levels of PHAs synthesized by Pseudomonas sp. Gl01 strain and Gl06 strain were 21.0%, and 19.3% of CDW, respectively. The polyester accumulation increased until nitrogen and oxygen were depleted from the medium. Reverse transcription real-time PCR approach was applied to quantitatively evaluate phaC1, phaC2, and phaZ gene expression. A positive correlation was found between the cellular PHA content and the gene expression of the PHA synthases. The transcriptional analysis revealed that the phaC1 and phaZ genes could be co-transcribed. The overexpressed phaC2 gene was only observed in the Gl06 strain. The monomeric composition of the obtained mcl-PHA was dependent on the strain: 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid (3HO) and 3-hydroxydecanoic acid (3HD) were dominant in strain Gl01, whereas 3-hydroxyhexanoic (3HHx) was present in significant amounts in strain Gl06. Practical applications: This article presents the procedure of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHAs) synthesis by the Pseudomonas Gl01 and Gl06 strains from waste rapeseed oil as a feedstock. Beside the microbial production of these environmentally friendly plastics, this approach also represents a new way of utilizing waste oils. The knowledge of the key enzymes involved in mcl-PHAs accumulation is necessary in order to understand the mechanisms of their synthesis, and to use them effectively in biotechnological applications. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Activation of PPAR-α isoform by its natural ligands, fatty acids (FA) and eicosanoids, promotes mitochondrial FA oxidation as the primary ATP-generating pathway. On the other hand, PPAR-γ regulates lipid anabolism or storage, while, until recently, the function of PPAR-β/δ has been less explored. Under conditions associated with acute or chronic oxygen deprivation, PPAR-α modulates expression of genes that determine substrate switch (FA vs. glucose) aimed at maintenance of basic cardiac function. Although PPAR-α and PPAR-γ synthetic agonists, hypolipidemic and antidiabetic drugs, have been reported to protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury, it is still a matter of debate whether PPAR activation plays a beneficial or detrimental role in myocardial response to ischemia, in particular, in pathological conditions. This article reviews some findings demonstrating the impact of PPAR activation on cardiac resistance to ischemia in normal and pathologically altered heart. Specifically, it addresses the issue of susceptibility to ischemia in the diabetic myocardium, with particular regards to the role of PPAR. Finally, involvement of PPAR in the mechanisms of lipid-independent cardioprotective effects of some hypolipidemic drugs is also discussed.","Cardioprotection; HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors; Hypolipidemic drugs; Myocardial ischemia; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors; Pleiotropic effects","2 [4 [2 [3 cyclohexyl 1 (4 cyclohexylbutyl)ureido]ethyl]phenylthio] 2 methylpropionic acid; [4 [2 (3 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl) 4 methyl 5 thiazolylmethylthio] 2 methylphenoxy]acetic acid; atorvastatin; clofibrate; glitazone derivative; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inducible nitric oxide synthase; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonist; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; pioglitazone; pirinixic acid; protein kinase B; retinoid X receptor; rosiglitazone; simvastatin; adipose tissue; alloxan diabetes mellitus; angiogenesis; antiinflammatory activity; arrhythmogenesis; cardiovascular response; cholesterol synthesis; conformational transition; diabetes mellitus; diabetic cardiomyopathy; disease predisposition; DNA sequence; energy yield; enzyme phosphorylation; fatty acid oxidation; gene repression; glucose oxidation; glucose transport; heart infarction size; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle oxygen consumption; heart protection; heart ventricle arrhythmia; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertriglyceridemia; inflammation; ischemic preconditioning; kidney ischemia; lipid metabolism; macrophage; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; oxidative stress; oxygen supply; pathophysiology; protein expression; protein function; receptor affinity; receptor down regulation; receptor upregulation; reperfusion injury; review; streptozocin diabetes; tissue distribution; transcription initiation; Animals; Cardiotonic Agents; Diabetes Complications; Heart; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Inflammation; Ligands; Models, Biological; Myocardial Ischemia; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Reperfusion Injury; Tissue Distribution; Transcriptional Activation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83155173464

This paper reviews the factors determining performance in the depth disciplines, where hydrostatic pressure is added to the stressors associated with apnea duration and physical work. Apneic duration is essential for performance in all disciplines, and is prolonged by any means that increases gas storage or tolerance to asphyxia, or that reduces metabolic rate. For underwater distance swimming, the main challenge is to restrict metabolism despite the work of swimming, and to redirect blood flow to allow the most vital functions. Here, work economy, local tissue energy and oxygen stores, anaerobic capacity of the muscles, and possibly technical improvements will be essential for further development. In the depth disciplines, direct pressure effects causing barotrauma, the narcotic effects of gases, decompression sickness (DCS) and possibly air embolism during ascent need to be taken into account, as does the risk of hypoxia when the dive cannot be rapidly interrupted before the surface is reached again. While in most deep divers apneic duration is not the main limitation thus far, greater depths may call for exceptionally long apneas and slower ascents to avoid DCS. Narcotic effects may also affect the ultimate depth limit, which elite divers predict to be around 156 metres' sea water, for constant weight with fins. To reach these depths, serious physiological challenges have to be met, technical developments are likely to be needed and safety procedures must be developed concomitantly.","Breath-hold diving; Cardiovascular; Exercise; Hypoxia; Physiology; Respiratory; Review article; Safety","oxygen; air embolism; anaerobic capacity; apnea; asphyxia; barotrauma; blood flow; decompression sickness; diving; gas; human; hydrostatic pressure; hypoxia; manual labor; metabolic rate; oxygen tension; prediction; review; storage; stress; swimming; task performance; metabolism; Apnea; Decompression Sickness; Diving; Embolism, Air; Humans; Oxygen",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82855172427

In this context, we review the 50-year history of the Plastiras reservoir in central Greece, to highlight the multiple negative impacts from a non-systematic, abstraction-oriented, operation policy. This kind of management is contrasted to a hypothetical one, obtained through a multidisciplinary methodological framework that has been developed ten years ago, which aimed to compromise a number of conflicting water uses. This required establishing a minimum allowable level for agricultural abstractions and stabilising the annual releases for irrigation and drinking water supply. The criteria under study are, directly or indirectly, related to the water storage in the lake. Therefore, the key idea is to investigate the performance of each criterion with regard to the variability of the level, by examining alternative level vs. abstraction control rules. Thus, the quantity of water that would be yearly available is a function of the minimum level allowed and the desirable reliability. In fact, objective analysis indicates that the maintenance of the reservoir level as high as possible is necessary for the conservation of the quality of the lake's landscape, for the development of tourist activity and also for providing drinking water of good quality. The advantages of the proposed framework are then exhibited through a back-analysis that focuses to the recent period. The implementation of this management policy not only would improve the water and landscape quality as well as the tourist perspectives, but also allow for a much more efficient planning of the agricultural and, under some premises, hydroelectric energy needs. Thus, the adoption of a constant annual release, irrespective of the recent sequence of inflows, may be beneficial for the long-term interests of all social groups and, therefore, conflicts among drinking water supply, tourism, landscape quality, irrigation and hydroelectric production would become less intense. Yet, the practice showed that a consensus between scientists, authorities and stakeholders for establishing the suggested policy is a considerably difficult task. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Conflicting water uses; Constant release; Drinking water; Landscape quality; Reliability; Reservoir level fluctuation; Safe yield","drinking water; article; environmental exposure; Greece; hydropower; irrigation (agriculture); lake; landscape; priority journal; reliability; water analysis; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82655162244

The expensive-tissue hypothesis explains its evolution by proposing a trade-off between the size of the brain and that of the digestive tract, which is smaller than expected for a primate of our body size. Although this hypothesis is widely accepted, empirical support so far has been equivocal. Here we test it in a sample of 100 mammalian species, including 23 primates, by analysing brain size and organ mass data. We found that, controlling for fat-free body mass, brain size is not negatively correlated with the mass of the digestive tract or any other expensive organ, thus refuting the expensive-tissue hypothesis. Nonetheless, consistent with the existence of energy trade-offs with brain size, we find that the size of brains and adipose depots are negatively correlated in mammals, indicating that encephalization and fat storage are compensatory strategies to buffer against starvation. However, these two strategies can be combined if fat storage does not unduly hamper locomotor efficiency. We propose that human encephalization was made possible by a combination of stabilization of energy inputs and a redirection of energy from locomotion, growth and reproduction. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

After fission, individuals spend the rest of the year regenerating the missing arms. To analyze feeding rates, we conducted three experiments with sea stars in different states of regeneration: recently split, regenerating and arms with advanced regeneration. Three different treatments of food availability (high, intermediate and low) were carried out during each experiment. We found that food availability and regeneration state had an important effect on feeding rates. Recently split individuals showed the lowest values of feeding rates, amount of lipids in the pyloric caeca and gonad production, regardless of the food treatment. Regenerating individuals had the highest feeding rates, allocated of resources in the pyloric caeca and produced gametes. Individuals with arms in an advanced regeneration state showed intermediate feeding rates and no deposition of lipids in the pyloric caeca. These individuals spawned during the experiment, thus indicating that the gonads were mature. Low food availability produced the lowest feeding rates regardless of the regeneration state. Regenerating individuals died only in low food availability. No death was observed in individuals with advance regenerated arms. On the other hand, individuals that had recently undergone fission died regardless of the food availability. Since fission and regeneration are part of the life-history of A. capensis, regenerating individuals may have high feeding rates to achieve a good nutritional state to support regeneration, gamete production and survival after fission. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Asteroidea; Energy storage, lipids; Feeding; Fission; Regeneration; Sea star","asexual reproduction; echinoderm; food availability; gamete; lipid; marine ecosystem; reproductive cycle; sexual reproduction; survival; Allostichaster; Asterias; Asteroidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82555169775

In addition, ambient dose was measured at the outside corridor of the hospitalization room for 137Cs brachytherapy patients. Radionuclides used at the Nuclear Medicine Department are 131I, 18F, 67Ga, 99mTc, 111In, 201Tl. Main gamma emission energies from these elements are in the range from 93 to 511 keV. High dose values were obtained at the waste storage room, the outside corridor of 131I patients, the PET/CT room and the outside corridor of 137Cs brachytherapy patients. The maximum ambient dose equivalent rate equal to about 19 μSv/h was obtained for the 137Cs brachytherapy corridor. Sites with minimum doses are the gamma camera rooms, having ambient dose equivalent rates equal to about 0.05 μSv/h. At most sites where both types of dosemeters were placed ambient dose equivalent values obtained with TLD-900 were 25-45% higher than TLD-100 values. This result was attributed to scattered radiation producing low energy photons which results in over response of TLD-900 and thus, TLD-100 values are considered to be more reliable. Knowledge of ambient dose values is relevant to the occupational exposure personnel who may limit the time spent at high dose areas.

These adaptations would be beneficial if these conditions prevail later in life, but they become detrimental in the case of normal or plentiful nutrition and favor the appearance of the metabolic syndrome. In this article, the discussion is limited to the developmental programming of obesity and cardiovascular disorders caused by an early mismatched nutrition, particularly intrauterine growth retardation followed by postnatal catch-up growth. Selected data in humans are reviewed before evoking some mechanisms revealed or suggested by experiments in rodents. A variety of physiologic mechanisms are implicated in obesity programming, 2 of which are detailed. In some, but not all observations, hyperphagia resulting namely from perturbed development of the hypothalamic circuitry devoted to appetite regulation may contribute to obesity. Another contribution may be the developmental changes in the population of fat cell precursors in adipose tissue. Even if the link between obesity and cardiovascular disease is well established, alteration of blood pressure regulation may appear independently of obesity. A loss of diurnal variation in heart rate and blood pressure in adulthood has resulted from maternal undernutrition followed by postnatal overnutrition. Further research should clarify the effect of mismatched early nutrition on the development of brain centers regulating energy intake, energy expenditure, and circadian rhythms. © 2011 American Society for Nutrition.",,"apolipoprotein E; metyrapone; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; corticosterone; leptin; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; arcuate nucleus; atherogenic diet; atherosclerosis; blood pressure regulation; body weight; caloric intake; caloric restriction; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; circadian rhythm; conference paper; diet restriction; disease association; energy expenditure; food intake; heart rate variability; human; hypercholesterolemia; hyperphagia; hypertension; hypothalamus ventromedial nucleus; intrauterine growth retardation; lipid storage; malnutrition; maternal nutrition; metabolic disorder; nonhuman; obesity; overnutrition; protein restriction; rodent; suprachiasmatic nucleus; artificial milk; birth weight; blood pressure; body mass; cell proliferation; corticosterone blood level; development; fetal malnutrition; glucose intolerance; heart rate; high birth weight; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; hyperleptinemia; insulin resistance; ischemic heart disease; lactation; lipogenesis; low birth weight; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; postnatal care; pregnancy; progeny; protein expression; review; weight gain; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Appetite Regulation; Cardiovascular Diseases; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Female; Fetal Development; Humans; Malnutrition; Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Models, Animal; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Rodentia; Rodentia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82355165133

The PV array is used as the main generator, and the SC functions as an auxiliary source for supplying the (transient and steady-state) power deficiency of the PV array. For high-power applications, four-phase parallel boost converters and four-phase parallel bidirectional converters are implemented as a PV converter and a storage device, respectively. A reduced-order mathematical model of the PV and SC converters is described for the control of the power plant. Using a nonlinear approach based on the flatness property, we propose a simple solution to the dynamic, stabilization, and robustness problems in the hybrid power system. This is the key innovative contribution of this research paper. We analyze a prototype small-scale power plant composed of a 0.8-kW PV array and a 100-F SC module.

An effort has been made to define the liposomes, as well as free and immobilized enzyme stability during storage at 4 and 25 °C. The partition coefficients (K o/w) were greater than 1; therefore, the standard free energies of the enzyme transfer were negative, indicating an affinity of the enzymes for encapsulation in liposomes. The enthalpy calculation led to the conclusion that the process is exothermic. The presence of enzyme decreased the liposome storage stability from 70 days to an approximately 20 days at 25 °C and 30 days at 4 °C. Monitoring of the liposome's diameter demonstrated that their size and concentration decreased during storage. The liposome's diameters ranged from 1.06 to 3.30 μm. The higher percentage of liposome corresponded to a diameter range from 1.06 to 1.34 μm. This percentage increased during storage. There were no evidences for liposome fusion process.

The young in the planktonic and settling phases have a high energy consumption and require live food of specific size range characteristics, causing difficulties in obtaining appropriate food organisms for rearing experiments through the entire life cycle. This study obtained information on details of life cycle characteristics of Amphioctopus aegina (Gray) by resolving these difficulties. The aspects of life cycle of A. aegina were similar to those of other benthic octopus with a similar reproductive strategy. Growth was allometric, consisting of 3 phases in terms of body weight, including a transitional phase for the early settling stage. Feeding and conversion efficiency peaked over a 2-month period prior to reproduction, representing the period of energy storage. Growth from hatching to spawning took approximately 74% of the entire life span and the reproductive phase itself took 34%. Such longevities are similar to those of other benthic cephalopods with planktonic hatchlings. Overall similarities in these cephalopod taxa attest to the fitness of a life-history strategy involving production of planktonic offspring from benthic adults. A. aegina is the second benthic octopus species with planktonic hatchlings for which the life cycle has been completed through rearing in the laboratory.","Amphioctopus aegina; Cephalopoda; Life cycle; Octopus; Reared","body size; cephalopod; experimental study; growth rate; life cycle; mollusc; rearing; reproductive strategy; Cephalopoda; Octopoda; Octopodidae; Octopus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80855164652

The resulting energy balance of the building showed that the primary energy consumption of the heat pump system is 71% lower in comparison with a reference installation based on common gas-fired boilers and water cooling machines. This corresponds to a CO2-reduction of 1280 ton over the whole measuring period. The overall seasonal performance factor (SPF) for heating was 5.9 while the ATES system delivered cooling at an efficiency factor of 26.1.

A basic microcogeneration technology [micro-CHP (combined heat and power) system] integrating solar collectors, storage tank, micro-turbine and a thermodynamic cycle based on the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is combined with an absorption chiller. The heat rejected at the condenser of the micro-CHP system is used for water heating (WH), and the absorption chiller is used for space cooling. Hot water from the solar storage tank is the heat source for the cooling system (absorption chiller) and the micro-CHP system. A heat exchanger is used to transfer heat from the hot water circuit to the power cycle (which uses an organic refrigerant). The micro-CHP system under analysis uses a micro-turbine and an electric generator with a power output of 5 kW. The turbine inlet temperature is 80°C and the working fluid is cyclohexane. The absorption chiller, which is a single-effect water-fired chiller, operates with a lithium bromide and water mixture, and water inlet temperature is between 80 and 100°C. The performance for different solar collector areas and tank capacities was evaluated through a numerical model. A hotel building was used as a case study and the analysis was extended throughout the cooling season, for climatic conditions of different European cities: Athens (Greece), Lisbon (Portugal), Madrid (Spain), Paris (France) and London (UK). The monthly average solar fraction was evaluated for different cases: the micro-CHP system, the cooling system and the micro-tri-generation system with the useful condenser energy used for WH. The solar fraction of the micro-CHP system was low, compared with that of the cooling system, because the efficiency of the micro-CHP system is lower than 7%.

Moreover the dryness phenomenon in these country is imposes more and more the use of pumping plants. The storage of the water in insulated basins from the wells has a double advantage. On the one hand, it is a technical storage solution of the solar energy collected by the photovoltaic panels. On the other hand, it is a hygienic way out to supply water for the rural population. In our work, we propose a technique for the identification of the maximum power point (MPP) based on fuzzy logic. This method is used to generate the cyclic ratio to operate the switcher within the maximum power of a photovoltaic array (PVA). For simulation purpose we made a complete modeling of the entire system. The system carried out consists of a photovoltaic array supplying, through a DC converter, a direct current (DC) engine coupled to a centrifugal pump. Our experimental bench consists of two principal units. A DC converter module composed of IGBT power transistors. And a processing module connected to a PC serial port, handling the input signals delivered by photovoltaic generator and controlling the power unit. The obtained experimental results confirm the simulation result which is very satisfactory and show the utility of the fuzzy controller for the optimization of the system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The final step in TG biosynthesis is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes. Lack of whole body DGAT1 is associated with reduced lipid-induced inflammation. Since one major component of atherosclerosis is chronic inflammation we hypothesized that DGAT1 deficiency might ameliorate atherosclerotic lesion development. We therefore crossbred Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE -/-) mice with Dgat1 -/- mice. ApoE -/- and ApoE -/-Dgat1 -/- mice were fed Western-type diet (WTD) for 9 weeks and thereafter examined for plaque formation. The mean atherosclerotic lesion area was substantially reduced in ApoE -/-Dgat1 -/- compared with ApoE -/- mice in en face and aortic valve section analyses. The reduced lesion size was associated with decreased cholesterol uptake and absorption by the intestine, reduced plasma TG and cholesterol concentrations and increased cholesterol efflux from macrophages. The expression of adhesion molecules was reduced in aortas of ApoE -/-Dgat1 -/- mice, which might be the reason for less migration capacities of monocytes and macrophages and the observed decreased amount of macrophages within the plaques. From our results we conclude that the lack of DGAT1 is atheroprotective, implicating an additional application of DGAT1 inhibitors with regard to maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and attenuating atherosclerosis. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated if n-3PUFA affected fat storage and cecal bacteria in piglets. Twenty-four 4-day-old piglets were allocated to formula rich in n-3PUFA (~3E%) from fish oil (FO) or n-6PUFA from sunflower oil (SO) for 14 days. We assessed body weight, fat accumulation by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and microbial molecular fingerprints. Dietary PUFA-composition was reflected in higher erythrocyte n-3PUFA in the FO- than the SO-group (P<0.001). Principal component analysis revealed group differences in the overall microbiotic composition, which involved a larger Bacteroides community in the SO-group (P=0.02). There was no significant difference in body fat percentage and no relationship between fat accumulation and gut Bacteroides. Hence, this study does not support an impact of n-3PUFA or microbiota on fat accumulation during the postnatal maturation period.

Such systems are capable of early mechanical faults detection, which prevents from costly critical repairs. Fault detection of wind turbines is based on vibration and process signals analysis. Modern SM&D are usually advanced hardware and software technological products, which on the basis of collected data are capable of continuous execution of enormous number of analyses. However, the expansion of distributed systems has disclosed new challenges accompanying the transition from a singular signal analysis to automatic interpretation of large data sets. The paper deals with the assessment of data acquisition final products, namely the correctness of vibration signals recording process. The proposed validation, which is to be implemented a priori to data analysis, is required for significant calculation of any signal features as well as for legitimate storage of raw waveforms in the system database. The latter aspect is especially important in terms of gigabytes of disk space frequently wasted for corrupted data. The paper presents a step-by-step method for automatic signal validation, which can be implemented on a personal computer. Finally, the algorithm is evaluated on a real wind turbine database. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In solidsolid PCMs, polystyrene is the skeleton and PA is a functional side chain that stores and releases heat during its phase transition process. The heat storage of copolymers is due to phase transition between crystalline and amorphous states of the soft segment PA in copolymer and the hard segment polystyrene restricted the free movement of molecular chains of the soft segments even above the phase transition temperature. The copolymers always remain in the solid state during the phase transition processing and therefore they are described as form-stable PCM. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and polarization optical microscopy (POM) analyses were performed to investigate the chemical structures and crystalline morphology. Thermal energy storage properties, thermal reliability and thermal stability of the PCMs were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) methods. Thermal conductivities of the PCMs were also measured using thermal property analyzer. The analysis results indicated that the PA chains were successfully grafted onto the polystyrene backbone and the copolymers showed typical solidsolid phase transition properties. Moreover, thermal cycling test showed that the copolymers have good thermal reliability and chemical stability although they were subjected to 5000 heating/cooling cycling. The synthesized polystyrene-graft-PA copolymers as novel solidsolid PCMs have considerable potential for such as underfloor heating, thermo-regulated fibers and heating and cooling of agricultural greenhouses. Especially, the polystyrene-graft-PA copolymer including 75% PA is the most attractive PCM due to its highest latent heat storage capacity in the synthesized copolymer PCMs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Natural gas and oil fields are the plentiful domestic energy resources in the Gulf of Thailand, but are projected to be available only in the next decade. Using domestic natural gas would reduce national energy security. Due to its low price, coal will dominate in electricity generation in Thailand. However, more utilization of coal results in increasing CO 2 emissions. To comply with the low-carbon society policy of the Royal Thai Government, carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) for the future committed power plants in Thailand is introduced and analysed using the market allocation model, a least-cost energy planning tool. In this study, CO 2 mitigation scenarios include integrated CCS to new gas- and coal-based power plants, nuclear power and renewable-based power plants and these were introduced as mitigation options. In energy-demand forecasting, share of coal-based plants is projected to increase from 0.72% in 2006 to 14.97% in 2030, while the share of gas-based plants decreases from 79.24 to 53.25% in the same period.

Superchilling as used for preserving foods, has been defined as a process by which the temperature of a food product is lowered to 1-2 °C below the initial freezing point. Fresh and high quality food products are in great demand worldwide. Temperature is a major factor determining the shelf life and quality of food products. Fish and meat are perishable food commodities, where better and more advanced preservation technology is needed. Deterioration of these foods mainly occurs as a result of chemical, enzymatic and bacteriological activities leading to loss of quality and subsequent spoilage. Storing food at superchilling temperature has three distinct advantages: maintaining food freshness, retaining high food quality and suppressing growth of harmful microbes. It can reduce the use of freezing/thawing for production and thereby increase yield, reduce energy, labour and transport costs. The study on the growth mechanism of ice crystals, modelling and computer simulation of foods during superchilling and superchilling storage is needed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A micro-hydro power plant with a synchronous generator (SG) and a wind power plant with an induction generator (IG) supply the MG. Both generators directly feed power into the grid without the use of additional power electronics interfaces, thus the solution becoming robust, reliable and cost-effective. An original electronic load controller (ELC) regulates the MG frequency by a centralized load-frequency control method, which is based on a combination of smart load (SL) and battery energy storage system (BESS). SL and BESS provides the active power balance for various events that such systems encounter in real situations, both in cases of energy excess production and energy shortage. Moreover, the proposed ELC includes an ancillary function to compensate the power unbalance produced by the uneven distribution of the single-phase loads on the MG phases, without the use of extra hardware components. A laboratory-scale prototype is used for experimentally assessment of the proposed solutions. The experimental results emphasize the effectiveness of the ELC while also showing its limitations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery energy storage; Frequency control; Micro-hydro; Microgrid; Smart load; Wind turbine","Active power; Battery energy storage; Battery energy storage systems; Electronic load controller; Energy shortages; Hardware components; Induction generator; Laboratory scale; Load-frequency; Load-frequency control; Micro grid; Micro-hydro; Microhydro power plants; Power electronics interface; Power unbalance; Real situation; Renewable energy source; Single-phase loads; Smart load; Asynchronous generators; Electric frequency control; Energy storage; Flywheels; Power electronics; Power plants; Synchronous generators; Wind power; Controllers; assessment method; cost-benefit analysis; electronic equipment; energy efficiency; experimental study; frequency analysis; hydroelectric power; laboratory method; power plant; renewable resource; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960184956

The aim of this study was to compare the biomechanical properties of the rat calcaneal tendon (CT), superficial flexor tendon (SFT), and deep flexor tendon (DFT), and to determine the effect of jump training in association with AAS. Animals were separated into four groups: sedentary, trained, AAS-treated sedentary rats (AAS), and AAS-treated and trained animals. Mechanical testing showed that the CT differed from the DFT and SFT, which showed similar mechanical properties. Jump caused the CT to exhibit an extended toe region, an increased resistance to tensional load, and a decreased elastic modulus, characteristics of an elastic tendon capable of storing energy. AAS caused the tendons to be less compliant, and the effects were reinforced by simultaneous training. The DFT was the most affected by training, AAS, and the interaction of both, likely because of its involvement in the toe-off step of jumping, which we suggest is related to the rapid transmission of force as opposed to energy storage. In conclusion, tendons are differently adapted to exercise, but responded equally to AAS, showing reduced flexibility, which is suggested to increase the risk of tendon rupture in AAS consumers. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Anabolic-androgenic steroids; Biomechanical test; Material properties; Tendons","anabolic agent; drug derivative; nandrolone; nandrolone decanoate; animal; animal experiment; article; biomechanics; drug effect; male; physiology; randomization; rat; tendon; weight bearing; Wistar rat; Anabolic Agents; Animals; Biomechanics; Male; Nandrolone; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Tendons; Weight-Bearing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651449418

Our framework, coined Smart Trace, exploits opportunistic and participatory sensing in order to quickly answer queries of the form: ""Report the users that move more similar to Q, where Q is some query trace"". Smart Trace, relies on an in-situ data storage model, where geo-location data is recorded locally on smart phones for both performance and data-disclosure reasons. Smart Trace then deploys an efficient top-K query processing algorithm that exploits distributed trajectory similarity measures, resilient to spatial and temporal noise, in order to derive the most relevant answers to Q quickly and efficiently. We assess our ideas with realistic and real workloads from Microsoft Research Asia and other sources.

Unfortunately, the given model introduces both data-disclosure concerns (e.g., disclosing all captured media to a central entity) and performance concerns (e.g., consuming precious smart phone battery and bandwidth during content uploads). In this paper, we present a novel framework, coined Smart Opt, for searching objects (e.g., images, videos, etc.) captured by the users in a mobile social community. Our framework, is founded on an in-situ data storage model, where captured objects remain local on their owner's smart phones and searches then take place over a novel lookup structure we compute dynamically, coined the Multi-Objective Query Routing Tree (MO-QRT). Our structure concurrently optimizes several conflicting objectives (i.e., it minimizes energy consumption, minimizes search delay and maximizes query recall), using a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) that calculates a diverse set of high quality non-dominated solutions in a single run. We assess our ideas with mobility patterns derived by Microsoft's Geolife project and social patterns derived by DBLP.

Linking these sub-grids are power converters, whose topological configuration should preferably be not too unconventional to avoid unnecessary compromises in reliability. The desired operating features should therefore be introduced to the interlinking converters through control design with overall system simplicity still preserved for industry relevance. This concern is now addressed here through the development of an appropriate scheme for controlling the interlinking converters, so as to achieve autonomous control for the overall hybrid microgrid. Features achieved include proportional active power sharing among the distributed sources based on their ratings and not placements within the hybrid microgrid, and proper reactive power sharing within the ac sub-grid. These findings are not previously achieved by other existing schemes, which almost always consider only an ac microgrid. The scheme can also be extended to include energy storages within the interlinking converters, as demonstrated through simulation and experiment. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Active power sharing; Autonomous control; Control design; Distributed sources; Industry relevance; Micro grid; Sub-grids; Topological configuration; Energy conversion; Energy storage; DC power transmission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81855209870

Other advantages include: continuous input/output current, extended step-up and step-down voltage conversion ratio without extreme low or high duty-cycle, simple control circuitry, and near zero input and output current ripples compared to other converter topologies. The low current ripple and high gain features result in a longer life-span and lower cost of the energy storage battery system.

Chilling disorders are most prevalent in fruit harvested when flesh colour is &gt;103 °hue, even when fruit have been degreened at 5°C before storage. Chilling disorders may be avoided by using higher storage temperatures, which may also reduce energy use during storage. The objective of this study was to determine whether 'Hort16A' fruit can be stored at high temperatures by using controlled atmospheres (CA) of 1.6% O2 with 2, 5 or 10% CO2 to retard softening and disorder development. Storing fruit harvested at 6.2 kgf when not fully degreened directly at 7°C in CA delayed softening compared with that of fruit degreened at 5°C in air and then stored at 1°C in air; firmness four weeks after harvest was 3.6 kgf and 1.6 kgf, respectively. After 12 weeks of storage, all fruit were approximately 0.6 kgf. There was no significant difference in the softening of fully degreened fruit when stored at 7°C in CA or 1°C in air. There was no significant effect of CO2 concentration on softening, but the highest incidence of rots and disorders was in fruit held in a CA with 10% CO2. Chilling disorders were absent in fruit stored at 7°C, but present at up to 3-5% in fruit stored at 1°C. It is concluded that it is possible to store 'Hort16A' fruit at 7°C by using CA (1.6% CO2 with 2% CO2) to retard softening with no detrimental effects to fruit quality compared with that of fruit stored at 1°C in air. The potential benefits are a reduction in chilling disorders and energy use, plus for fruit that require degreening off the vine, greater firmness retention early in storage. To achieve energy savings, the production of respiratory heat at 7°C in CA should be comparable to the rate at 1°C in air. If so a difference in energy use of 35% is possible.","Actinidia chinensis; Chilling injury; Degreening; Disorders; Energy use; Rots; Softening","Actinidia; Actinidia chinensis; Actinidia deliciosa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855763337

Companies growing organic vegetables are smaller than conventional producers, where electricity and heat cogeneration is a possible solution because of the larger, more suitable scale for introducing cogeneration. In addition to economic reasons, organic growers should implement extra efforts to reduce the use of non-renewable energy. Carbon dioxide is an important factor to enhance horticultural production and food quality. In a working group of growers and an energy specialist, all these parameters were put together. The best solution for small companies using carbon dioxide could be the use of a gas absorption heat pump (GAHP) in combination with Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES) in an extra isolated greenhouse. As a result, this concept was installed at the organic research centre in Kruishoutem, Belgium. A new 1280 m2 greenhouse divided into 6 compartments was installed. By using a double upper screen and polycarbonate in the outer walls, an U-value of 2.75 W m-2 K-1 was obtained. Three GAHP were installed with 41.6 kW thermal power delivered (delta T brine inlet - hot water outlet 35°C) in combination with both short-term and long-term cold and heat buffer storage (45 m3 each, shortterm), BTES (28 holes of 100 m depth, long term) and an air handling unit to cool and dry the air (4750 m3 h-1). During the summer, pump operation is dictated by the need for CO2. The heat is collected short term in the heat buffer storage or long term in the BTES. The cold generated is used to dehumidify and cool the air so the ventilation requirement is reduced, and the emissions from the GAHP can be used for CO2 fertilisation. During the winter, pump operation is dictated by the need for heat, in combination with the need for CO2. This is achieved through preferred heat production at times of high radiation, when absorbed heat is shunted to short term storage. Cold that is produced can be used to dehumidify the air but is mainly used for exchange with the relatively high temperature (loaded in summer) in the BTES, so the temperature of the BTES (and soil) is back in balance at the end of the winter. The heat delivered from the BTES improves the efficiency of the GAHP.","BTES; Technology",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855759070

The metals and intermetallic compounds are the most used materials. Since the reaction of metal hydride formation is, in most cases, sever exothermic and for many materials almost spontaneous, new control system architecture applicable to hydrogen isotopes storage media, taking into account all those properties, is presented. This architecture uses the resources of a DCS (Distributed Control System), based on i-processor technology (able to integrate all typical control functions, friendly display options, an alarm management system, historical data bases and advanced control tools). These resources usage allows us to operate a Deuterium and Tritium storage system under automatic control and to use an advanced Operator Interface too. The DCS closed loop algorithm is used for manual and automatic closed loop control for monitoring the corresponding operating conditions.","Architecture; Control system; Hydrogen; Isotopes; Storage","Advanced control; Alarm management; Closed loops; Closed-loop control; Control architecture; Control functions; Control system architecture; DCS(distributed control system); Display options; Historical data; Hydrogen isotope; Metal hydrides; Operating condition; Operator interfaces; Storage capacity; Storage media; Storage systems; Tritium storage; Architecture; Automation; Computer architecture; Control; Control systems; Deuterium; Distributed parameter control systems; Distributed parameter networks; Energy storage; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Intermetallics; Isotopes; Storage (materials); Tritium; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81755168980

Malaysian sedimentary basins signpost the existence of these energy sources below its sea-bed. In deep sea depth, traditional fixed types of offshore structures to explore these resources have become incongruous and they have resorted to new configurations. Spar platform is treated as a cost-effective and efficient compliant floating platform in this locale for drilling, production, processing and storage of ocean deposits. This study deals with the oil and gas eminence in Malaysian sea along with structural response behaviors of spar platform subjected to hydrodynamic loading. A single model of spar-mooring line combination has been developed. Coupled conduct has been computed under unidirectional wave loading where all non-linearities are incorporated. Solution in time domain approach follows Newmark-beta integration technique. It is seen that the continental shelf offshore of Malaysian waters is divided into seven sedimentary basins, out of which three basins have major ongoing oil and gas exploration and production activity, namely the Malay basin in West Malaysia off Terengganu and the Sabah and Sarawak basins off the two East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, respectively. Surge, heave, pitch motion response of spar hull and tension in mooring line tension have been evaluated. Spar platform indicates itself as advanced and competent offshore structures to enhance the oil and gas exploration from all the Malaysian sedimentary basins in the deep water region. © 2011 Academic Journals.","Compliant floating; Deep water region; Hydrodynamic loading; Malaysian sea; Mooring line; Ocean deposit; Offshore structures; Oil and gas resource; Sedimentary basin; Spar platform",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82755183497

The proposed piezo-based pickup device can be combined with a first stage large stroke actuator such as existing sled motor or voice coil motor to form a novel dual-stage servo system for the next generation high resolution ODDs. This active-passive hybrid actuator possesses two piezoelectric actuators cooperated together to move a lever beam that bears an objective lens for tracking motion or to contract or extend the lever beam to lift the objective lens upwards and downwards for focusing motion. Moreover, the viscoelastic damping layer is sandwiched between the constraining layer and the piezoelectric bimorph actuator to act a cushioning function to reduce the transmission of shock to the pickup device and dissipate vibration energies from the device. In the paper, piezo-based pickup devices with and without passive damping are fabricated, tested and compared to verify the design of pickup unit. Experiments are carried out to investigate their damping abilities and transmissibilities. Several parameters are studied to evaluate their effects on the characteristics of the piezo-based pickup device. Finally, the closed-loop performances of the piezo-based pickup device are compared with the current voice coil motor optical pickup using the internal model controller. © 2011 IEEE.","active-passive hybrid; Blu-ray disc; Optical disk drive; pickup head; piezo-based actuator","active-passive hybrid; Blu-ray Disc; Closed-loop performance; Constraining layer; Damping ability; Dual-stage servo systems; High resolution; Hybrid actuator; Internal model controllers; Large-stroke; Objective lens; Optical disk drives; Optical pick-ups; Passive damping; pickup head; Pickup unit; Piezoelectric bimorph actuators; Precision positioning; Shock resistance; Tracking motion; Vibration energies; Viscoelastic damping layers; Voice coil motors; Actuator disks; Damping; Data storage equipment; Equipment; Optical disk storage; Optical instrument lenses; Pickups; Piezoelectric motors; Piezoelectricity; Videodisks; Piezoelectric actuators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81055138793

The energy created in braking maneuvers in the new hybrid-drive systems is converted back into electrical energy by the regenerative operation of the traction motor, which feeds the energy into an energy-storage device for use. City buses equipped with ELFA traction hybrid-drive systems combine mobile energy generators such as diesel generator sets and fuel cells with high-performance energy-storage devices.

Fibrates, including fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, benzafibrate, ciprofibrate, and clofibrate act on PPAR alpha to reduce the level of hypertriglyceridemia. However, agonists (ligands) of PPAR-beta/delta receptors, such as tesaglitazar, muraglitazar, ragaglitazar, imiglitazar, aleglitazar, alter the body's energy substrate preference from glucose to lipids and hence contribute to the reduction of blood glucose level. Glitazones or thiazolidinediones on the other hand, bind to PPAR-gamma receptors located in the nuclei of cells. Activation of PPAR-gamma receptors leads to a decrease in insulin resistance and modification of adipocyte metabolism. They reduce hyperlipidaemia by increasing the level of ATPbinding cassette A1, which modifies extra-hepatic cholesterol into HDL. Dual or pan PPAR ligands stimulate two or more isoforms of PPAR and thereby reduce insulin resistance and prevent short- and long-term complications of diabetes including micro-and macroangiopathy and atherosclerosis, which are caused by deposition of cholesterol.

Its potential lies mainly in reducing the need for more base load power plants, integrating renewables, and reducing the cost of operation for utilities by smoothing out demand and minimizing power wastage. The integration of renewable sources makes the power supply stochastic and real time pricing makes demand stochastic. We can thus face significant supply-demand imbalances. We show it is possible, at least in theory, to stabilize both the demand and scales of the grid through making RTP attractive, and through exploiting natural phenomena and human habits. Our method can accomplish these goals without calling for costly grid storage. We show how even simple pricing contract can ease consumer acceptance of RTP, something the utilities have not been able to sell to their costumers. We exploit regularities in consumer habits to derive the statistics of power usage over different time scales and show supply and demand statistics can be matched over these different time scales. Thus, we show that solar power production can be matched with the power consumption of air-conditioning, wind power supply can be matched with consumption from weekly consumer needs such as laundry or once per day needs such as dishwashers and water heaters. We conclude with a discission of sensing and control requirements to achieve these goals. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Base-load power; Consumer acceptance; Consumer needs; Control requirements; Cost of operations; Different time scale; Grid Storage; Natural phenomena; Power supply; Power usage; Power wastage; Pricing contracts; Real time monitoring; Real time pricing; Renewable sources; Renewables; Smart grid; Supply and demand; Supply-demand; Costs; Solar energy; Stochastic systems; Water heaters; Wind power; Economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80155147039

One of RE which is hydrogen and has became an alternative fuel for transportation instead of petroleum. For sufficient hydrogen storage, the system requires an inexpensive, safe, low weight tank, comparable in to a gasoline tank with capability of quick loading and unloading hydrogen fuel. Carbon nanomaterials have been nominated as one of the best medium to store hydrogen due to its light weight, low cost production depending upon types of synthesis methods, non-toxic and can be generated with improvement in its storage capacity. The research work focuses on the development of graphitic nanofibers by using chemical vapor deposition method. The development of catalyst which was iron (III) oxide and nickel (II) oxide for the synthesis of graphitic nanofibers has also been investigated. The capacity of the developed materials in hydrogen adsorption is tested at 298K and the pressure up to 100 bar using gravimetric measurement technique. Sample imaging observations using field emission electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicate that the synthesized graphitic nanofibers (GNFs) have both platelet and herringbone structure with little carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Iron-based catalyst GNF (FG) samples have diameter size of 170 nm while nickel-based catalyst GNF (NG) has diameter size of 200 nm. Specific BET surface area of FG and NG are 92.34 m2/g and 45.96 m2/g, respectively. Both analysis which are energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and thermogravimetric proved that purity of FG is between 88% to 95% while purity of NG is ranges from 95% to 97%.

There is a dilemma between the continued reliance on fossil fuel for energy and the pressing need to address the problem of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from combustion. A potential technology that allows for the consumption of fossil fuel with a minimized emission rate is Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Malaysia is a fast developing economy with a historical trend of high reliance on fossil fuel for its energy needs. Therefore, there is compelling motivation to consider CCS for the country's GHG emission reduction initiative. This paper reviews the potential for carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a part of the climate change mitigation strategy for the Malaysian electricity sector using a technology assessment framework. The suitability and practicality of the technology was reviewed from a broad perspective with a consideration of Malaysia specific conditions. There had been a number of prior assessments on the suitability of CCS as a mitigation technology. Nonetheless, most of these assessments are typically more inclined towards the review from an economic viewpoint and are centered towards the case of developed economies. This study aims to fulfill this gap of knowledge and assess the technology from a broad sense in the Malaysia settings. It is apparent to this assessment that CCS has the potential to play an important role in Malaysia's climate change mitigation strategy. However, this study also identified key criteria that would need to be in place for CCS to be an effective climate change mitigation technology for the case of Malaysia. © 2011 IEEE.","CCS; climate change; Malaysia; viability study","Carbon capture and storage; CCS; Climate change mitigation; Developed economies; Developing economies; Electricity sector; Emission rates; Energy needs; GHG emission; Historical trends; Malaysia; Malaysians; Potential technologies; Technology assessment frameworks; viability study; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Rating; Technology; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80055043893

CaCl 2·6H 2O was used as a PCM. A numerical thermal model taken into account the different components of the greenhouse (cover, plants, inside air and north wall PCM) and based on the greenhouse heat and mass balance, has been developed to investigate the impact of the PCM on greenhouse temperature and humidity. Calculations were done for typical decade climate of January in Marrakesh (31.62°N, 8.03°W). Results shows that with an equivalent to 32.4 kg of PCM per square meter of the greenhouse ground surface area, temperature of plants and inside air were found to be 6-12 °C more at night time in winter period with less fluctuations. Relative humidity was found to be on average 10-15% lower at night time. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Upgrading of the power supply circuit of the toroidal magnetic field winding (TFW) in the TUMAN-3M tokamak is aimed, primarily, at increasing B t in the injection heating phase and, second, at maintaining B t quasi-stationarity during the whole tokamak discharge. To do this, an additional two-section capacitive storage commuted by two thyristor switches has been introduced into the available circuit. Either section of the storage is characterized by a charging voltage of 0.25 kV, a capacitance of 4.32 F, and an energy capacity of 135 kJ. The maximum discharge current of the section is 40 kA. The upgraded circuit compensates for the resistive loss in the TFW and ensures thereby a 50% increase in the magnetic field during injection heating relative to the old circuit: B t = 1.0 T instead of 0.68 T. In this case, the circuit maintains a TFW current of 110 kA with an accuracy of 10% for ∼60 ms. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2011.",,"Capacitive storage; Charging voltage; Discharge currents; Energy capacity; Inductive energy storage; Injection heating; Power supply system; Quasi-stationarity; Resistive loss; Thyristor switch; Tokamak discharge; Toroidal fields; Toroidal magnetic fields; Electric power systems; Electric switchgear; Magnetic fields; Winding; Power supply circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855869911

Alkaline water electrolysis, using electricity generated by renewable sources has been proposed as an environmentally inoffensive route to the production of the large volumes of hydrogen gas required by a possible hydrogen economy. The electrochemistry of oxygen has proved to be of perennial interest both from a fundamental and an applied perspective, especially in the important areas of energy conversion and storage. Despite the recent renewal in interest in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at transition metal oxide based electrodes in alkaline solution, the details of the mechanism remain controversial.

Several oxidation productscan be formed from these processes, depending on type and amount of the unsaturated fatty acid esters. In this work, fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters were obtained by basecatalyzed transesterification of soybean oil and physicochemically characterized according to standards from ASTM, EN, and ABNT. The thermal and oxidative stabilities of biodiesel samples were investigated during the storage process by pressure differential scanning calorimetry (PDSC) and by viscosity measurements. Absolute viscosities of biodiesels after accelerated aging were also determined. The viscosity increased as the aging temperature and time were raised. The results showed that oxidation induction can occur during storage, decreasing the biodiesel stability. PDSC analysis showed that during storage under climate simulation the values of high-pressure oxidative induction times (HPOIT) were reduced for both FAEE and FAME. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Accelerated aging; Oxidative stability; PDSC; Soybean biodiesel; Storage","Accelerated aging; Aging temperatures; Chemical compositions; Climate simulation; Complex Processes; Ethyl esters; Induction time; Oxidation induction; Oxidative stability; PDSC; Pressure differential scanning calorimetry; Soybean oil; Storage condition; Thermo-oxidative stability; Chemical stability; Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy storage; Esterification; Esters; Forestry; Oxidation; Oxidation resistance; Unsaturated fatty acids; Viscometers; Viscosity; Viscosity measurement; Biodiesel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83055184575

The late-onset disease form is characterized by progressive skeletal and respiratory muscle dysfunction. In addition to the recently introduced enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), treatments such as protein-enriched diet and exercise training have been proposed, although little is known about their effectiveness on the physical condition of such patients. Aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of exercise training on muscular strength and body composition in five patients with late-onset Pompe disease receiving ERT. All subjects followed a 20. week lasting program of supervised aerobic and progressive resistance exercise training. Before and after the training period, body composition was determined with dual X-ray absorptiometry and isometric muscular strength was measured with a specialized load transducer. Functional capacity was assessed using the 6-min shuttle walk test. A significant increase in muscular strength (15-50% at various body parts, p < 0.05) and 6-minute walking distance (203.8 ± 177. m before vs. 248.2 ± 184. m after, p < 0.01) was observed after training, whereas total and lower extremities lean body mass did not change significantly.

The proportion of aqueous alcohol-soluble teff protein was approx 40% and it was rich in glutamine and leucine. Hence, contrary to previous reports, prolamin is the major teff grain storage protein. With SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions, teff prolamins showed broad bands at approx. 20.3 and 22.8. kDa. Other bands were at approx. 36.1, 50.2, 66.2 and 90.0. kDa, respectively under non-reducing conditions, but were absent under reducing conditions, indicating that these polypeptides are disulphide bonded. The presence of broad monomeric prolamin bands in teff under non-reducing conditions indicates that teff prolamin is less polymerized than sorghum prolamin. Estimated free energy of hydration of teff prolamins was -161.3 kcal/mol compared to -139.8. kcal/mol for sorghum prolamin. By 2-D electrophoresis, teff protein contained more polypeptides than maize or sorghum. Teff contained a higher proportion of basic polypeptides than maize.

Formation of free radicals in whole wheat flour and white flour during heating was compared using Electron Spin Resonance spectroscopy in order to identify the primary oxidative events. Heating lead to a higher content of free radicals in wholemeal wheat flour than in white flour, since components in the husk seem to make a major contribution. Two different pathways are suggested for the formation of free radicals in wheat flour. The activation energy for the radical formation in the flours was estimated by Arrhenius plot as 34 kJ mol-1 up to 453 K, and above 473 K higher activation energies were observed. The change in activation energies indicates a change in reaction mechanisms for oxidation probably involving species with different mobility, i.e. different molecular weight. The accumulated concentration of free radicals in heated flour increased during one month storage and it is slightly affected by the water activity in the storage container. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","ESR; Free radicals; Heat effect; Wheat flour","Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81455131435

In the search for potential anti-obesity compounds from natural sources, the effects of ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid widely found in medicinal herbs and fruits, was evaluated for its effects on blood glucose, lipids, and abdominal fat deposition in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Adult male Swiss mice treated or not with UA (0.05%, 50mg/L, in drinking water) were fed HFD for 15 weeks. A sibutramine (SIB)-treated group (0.05% in drinking water) was included as the positive control. Weekly body weights and food and water consumption were measured, and at the end of the study period, the levels of blood glucose and lipids, the plasma hormones insulin, ghrelin, and leptin, and the abdominal fat accumulation were analyzed. Mice treated with UA and fed HFD showed significantly (P<.05) decreased body weights, visceral adiposity, and levels of blood glucose and plasma lipids relative to their respective controls not fed UA. Also, a significant increase was observed in plasma leptin with a decrease in ghrelin, as well as of amylase and lipase activities. The SIB-treated group also manifested effects similar to those of UA except for the blood glucose level, which was not different from the HFD control. These findings suggest that UA ameliorates abdominal adiposity and decreases the levels of blood glucose and plasma lipids in mice and thus manifests an anti-obesity potential through absorptive and metabolic targets. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. and Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition 2011.","abdominal adiposity; anti-obesity potential; high-fat diet; Swiss mice; ursolic acid","amylase; ghrelin; glucose; insulin; leptin; lipid; sibutramine; triacylglycerol lipase; ursolic acid; abdominal fat; abdominal obesity; animal experiment; animal model; article; body weight; controlled study; drug structure; energy consumption; enzyme activity; fluid intake; food intake; glucose blood level; insulin blood level; lipid blood level; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; Sambucus; Sambucus australis; Abdominal Fat; Adiposity; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Blood Glucose; Diet, High-Fat; Fruit; Ghrelin; Herbal Medicine; Insulin; Leptin; Lipids; Male; Mice; Obesity; Pentacyclic Triterpenes; Plant Extracts; Sambucus; Triterpenes; Weight Loss; Mus; Sambucus australis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80755175244

This paper deals with the power controller design of a SMES unit with an optimal coil size for stabilization of an isolated microgrid. The study microgrid consists of renewable energy sources with intermittent power outputs i.e., wind and photovoltaic. Since power generations from such renewable sources are unpredictable and variable, these result in power fluctuations in a microgrid. To stabilize power fluctuations, a SMES unit with a fast control of active and reactive power can be applied. The structure of a power controller is the practical proportional-integral (PI). Based on the minimization of the variance of power fluctuations from renewable sources as well as the initial stored energy of SMES, the optimal PI parameters and coil size are automatically and simultaneously tuned by a particle swarm optimization. Simulation studies show that the proposed SMES controller with an optimal coil size is able to effectively alleviate power fluctuations under various power patterns from intermittent renewable sources. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A model was developed to illustrate both the microscopic and macroscopic hysteresis of moisture storage, and transport capacities of fibrous materials. The necessary parameters for the model have been obtained using measurements from a number of different materials that were used as humidity buffers. Precise equipment to measure humidity was constructed, tested, and used over a very long measurement period, during which detailed measurements of moisture absorption and emission were measured from different types of fibreboard sheets.

In the future, hydrogen energy systems are expected to progressively replace the existing fossil fuels. Although hydrogen possesses significant advantages, it also exhibits major drawbacks in its utilization. The most important of them are production costs and storage characteristics. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have proven to possess ability as support for the fabrication of efficient heterogeneous catalysts in hydrogen production processes. Moreover, CNTs represent convenient adsorbent material that could form the basis of technologically viable hydrogen storage systems. This paper gives an overview of technologies used in the carbon nanotubes production and in the production and storage of hydrogen. In particular, it investigates the feasibility of CNTs and CNTs based catalyst materials in the mentioned processes.

Most power equipment is designed through linear theory but ferromagnetic materials are highly non-linear and when they resonate, the non-linearity produces currents and voltages that are larger than usual. Ferroresonance is a complex, non-linear electrical phenomenon. It can cause dielectric and thermal problems through overvoltage, an intrinsic phenomenon present in all networks. A network dynamic response to lightning and switching will be energy storage and release. The transfer of energy will propagate an overvoltage through the network and damage substation equipment when lightning strikes near the substation. Application of conventional mathematics is inappropriate to ferroresonance study in which actual events are simulated. Lightning strikes that occurred near a substation and that led to explosion of CVTs have been reported, so this study investigates the effect of a lightning strike on a tower with a 132 kV Capacitor Voltage Transformer (CVT). Alternative Transient Program (ATP) was used for the simulation which duplicated the lightning-strike effect that causes a CVT to explode.","Alternative Transient Program (ATP); Basic Insulation Level (BIL); Capacitor Voltage Transformer (CVT); Ferroresonance; Ferroresonance suppression circuit (FSC); Lightning strike","Alternative transient program; Basic Insulation Level (BIL); Capacitor Voltage Transformer (CVT); Ferroresonance; Lightning strike; Capacitors; Dynamic response; Electric network analysis; Electrolysis; Energy transfer; Ferromagnetic materials; Magnetic resonance; Variable speed transmissions; Lightning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052128557

In addition, inlet temperature of HTF, thermal conductivity of the tube material and the diameter of shell have considerable effects on the storage capability of the system, for charging period.

Therefore, the industry has exploited them in many sectors including food processing. Enzymes can modify food properties by acting on small molecules or on polymers such as carbohydrates or proteins. Crosslinking enzymes such as tyrosinases and sulfhydryl oxidases catalyse the formation of novel covalent bonds between specific residues in proteins and/or peptides, thus forming or modifying the protein network of food. In this study, novel secreted fungal proteins with sequence features typical of tyrosinases and sulfhydryl oxidases were identified through a genome mining study. Representatives of both of these enzyme families were selected for heterologous production in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei and biochemical characterisation. Firstly, a novel family of putative tyrosinases carrying a shorter sequence than the previously characterised tyrosinases was discovered. These proteins lacked the whole linker and C-terminal domain that possibly play a role in cofactor incorporation, folding or protein activity. One of these proteins, AoCO4 from Aspergillus oryzae, was produced in T. reesei with a production level of about 1.5 g/l. The enzyme AoCO4 was correctly folded and bound the copper cofactors with a type-3 copper centre. However, the enzyme had only a low level of activity with the phenolic substrates tested. Highest activity was obtained with 4-tert-butylcatechol. Since tyrosine was not a substrate for AoCO4, the enzyme was classified as catechol oxidase. Secondly, the genome analysis for secreted proteins with sequence features typical of flavin-dependent sulfhydryl oxidases pinpointed two previously uncharacterised proteins AoSOX1 and AoSOX2 from A. oryzae. These two novel sulfhydryl oxidases were produced in T. reesei with production levels of 70 and 180 mg/l, respectively, in shake flask cultivations. AoSOX1 and AoSOX2 were FAD-dependent enzymes with a dimeric tertiary structure and they both showed activity on small sulfhydryl compounds such as glutathione and dithiothreitol, and were drastically inhibited by zinc sulphate. AoSOX2 showed good stability to thermal and chemical denaturation, being superior to AoSOX1 in this respect. Thirdly, the suitability of AoSOX1 as a possible baking improver was elucidated. The effect of AoSOX1, alone and in combination with the widely used improver ascorbic acid was tested on yeasted wheat dough, both fresh and frozen, and on fresh water-flour dough. In all cases, AoSOX1 had no effect on the fermentation properties of fresh yeasted dough. AoSOX1 negatively affected the fermentation properties of frozen doughs and accelerated the damaging effects of the frozen storage, i.e. giving a softer dough with poorer gas retention abilities than the control. In combination with ascorbic acid, AoSOX1 gave harder doughs. In accordance, rheological studies in yeast-free dough showed that the presence of only AoSOX1 resulted in weaker and more extensible dough whereas a dough with opposite properties was obtained if ascorbic acid was also used. Doughs containing ascorbic acid and increasing amounts of AoSOX1 were harder in a dose-dependent manner. Sulfhydryl oxidase AoSOX1 had an enhancing effect on the dough hardening mechanism of ascorbic acid. This was ascribed mainly to the production of hydrogen peroxide in the SOX reaction which is able to convert the ascorbic acid to the actual improver dehydroascorbic acid. In addition, AoSOX1 could possibly oxidise the free glutathione in the dough and thus prevent the loss of dough strength caused by the spontaneous reduction of the disulfide bonds constituting the dough protein network. Sulfhydryl oxidase AoSOX1 is therefore able to enhance the action of ascorbic acid in wheat dough and could potentially be applied in wheat dough baking. © VTT 2011.","Ascorbic acid; Aspergillus oryzae; Catechol oxidase; Genome mining; Heterologous expression; Sulfhydryl oxidase; Trichoderma reesei; Tyrosinase; Wheat dough","Ascorbic acids; Aspergillus oryzae; Catechol oxidase; Genome mining; Heterologous expression; Sulfhydryl; Trichoderma reesei; Tyrosinase; Wheat dough; Amino acids; Aspergillus; Bakeries; Carbohydrates; Catalysts; Chemical stability; Covalent bonds; Crosslinking; Enzymes; Fermentation; Food processing; Genes; Hydrogen peroxide; Ketones; Phenols; Substrates; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054961943

In addition, in light of the green energy boom, the question of whether fibre production could give added value to energy production using wheat straw is addressed. Due to the logistics of the bulky raw material, the process should be applied on a small scale that determines the requirements for the process. The process should be simple, have low chemical consumption and be environmentally safe. The processes selected for the study were based on an initial hot water treatment. Actual defibration in the ""chemical"" approach was then performed using a subsequent alkaline peroxide bleaching process or in the ""mechanical"" approach through mechanical refining. In both approaches, energy can be produced from lower quality material such as dissolved solids or fines. In this work, one of the primary aims besides the development of the abovementioned process is to investigate the chemical storage of wheat straw which decays easily between harvesting periods and examine its effects on pulping and pulp properties. In addition, the aim of this work is to determine the market potential for non-wood pulp and evaluate non-wood pulp production. The results showed that the ""chemical"" approach produced fibres for printing and writing. The quality of the pulp was relatively good, but the chemical consumption at the target brightness of 75% was high, indicating that a chemical recovery would be needed unless the brightness target could be significantly reduced. The ""mechanical"" approach produced unbleached fibres for fluting and the energy production from fines and dissolved solids generated additional income. The results also showed that it is possible to store wheat straw chemically with formic acid-based chemicals over a year without significant changes in the chemical composition. The chemical storage can be integrated with the suggested chemical or mechanical defibration process, soda pulping process or any other process utilising non-wood fibres. In China, a clear demand for non-wood-based fibres exists due to a shortage of fibre and also because of the increasing demand for bioenergy. In Europe, the competitiveness of nonwood fibre utilisation will only be established if combined with energy production. © VTT 2011.","Alkaline peroxide bleaching; Assessment; Biorefinery; Chemical pre-treatment; Energy; Hot water treatment; Mechanical refining; Non-wood fibre; Pulp; Storage; Wheat straw","Alkaline peroxide bleaching; Assessment; Biorefineries; Chemical pre-treatment; Energy; Hot water treatment; Mechanical refining; Non-wood; Wheat straws; Alkalinity; Alternative fuels; Bleaching; Cleaning; Competition; Diesel propulsion; Fibers; Formic acid; Indicators (chemical); Luminance; Oxidation; Pulp; Pulp manufacture; Pulp refining; Rating; Refining; Storage (materials); Water; Water treatment; Wood; Cleaning; Evaluation; Fibers; Formic Acid; Hot Water Heating; Oxidation; Peroxide Bleaching; Pulps; Refining; Storage; Wood Fibers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054922374

This stock is generally referred to as a Stock Pile (SP) whether measured in tonnage (SPT) or in days (SPD). The Total Stock reflects the stock of coal (in tonnes) at hand, plus the replenishments (such as from stathes [e.g. bunker type] or direct-supply); therefore the Total Stock is equivalent to the SPT. Essentially, the SPD reflects the daily SPD variation on the stock, based on the daily usage and replenishment. The SPD's were designed to fulfil most of Eskom energy requirements for the coal PS's with a hedging position at acquiring the shortfalls from the short to medium term markets. However, with the growth in ESO (Energy Sent Out), pressure has been put on these markets to deliver the ever-increasing shortfalls. The lack of additional capacity (more power stations) has also been a contributing factor. Hence, the stock pile levels are at risk and careful management of these has become of outmost importance. The Coal Stock Pile Simulator (CSPS) serves as a simulation model which provides ""what-if"" scenarios and is forward looking. It can provide scenario planning sets for decision making. It is based on the ESO forecasts (including monthly and time-of-use profiles), the Maintenance Plan (for the power stations), the modelled forced outages (UCLF and OCLF), the despatch plan (according to merit order), the international imports (such as Cahora Bassa) and the interrelationships between Eskom's Nuclear, Hydro, Pump-Storage, OCGT and Coal PS's.

The basis of the strategy was to identify the high- and low pressure end users and, if possible, divide the single compressed air system into two separate systems that would receive compressed air at different but correct operating pressures. Energy savings could then be expected because of reduced pipe friction losses as a result of lower operating pressures. Air leaks, through holes in the pipeline and other possible leak prone areas would also be reduced because of the lower pipeline operating pressure. It was possible to divide this compressed air ring into high- and low pressure sections. The reduced air flow in the low pressure section of the ring resulted in less air being lost through air leaks. Furthermore, smaller pressure losses were experienced over the length of the line as a result of reduced line friction. The resulting energy savings achieved was a direct result of the compressors being able to supply lower pressure compressed air to selected parts of the compressed air ring. High pressure compressed air was still maintained on the high pressure side and each compressed air system received compressed air at the correct pressure to maintain operational production as before. © 2011 Cape Peninsula Univ of Tec.",,"African gold mine; Air flow; Air leaks; Compressed air system; End users; Energy efficient; Friction loss; High pressure; Low pressures; Lower pressures; Operating pressure; Operational production; Pipeline operating pressures; Pressure loss; Through hole; Compressed air; Compressed air motors; Energy efficiency; Friction; Pneumatics; Pressure vessels; Cold storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054815381

Results showed that there are surprisingly large differences in energy cost and consumption between facilities. In these variances lie the opportunities for improved energy efficiency. The analysis of consumption has created a comparable measure to serve as a baseline for future improvement, and the quantitative results provide a means of setting targets and developing improvement action plans.

A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that continuously and directly converts chemical energy to electricity with the most common technologies to be the Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) and the Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC). In such devices hydrogen is considered as the preferred fuel in virtue of its high activity and its environmental benignity.Fuel supply is an important problem to be solved for the commercial application of fuel cells' technology. Conventional fuel-cell types require hydrogen as the fuel, which has to be free of impurities when operated at temperatures below 100°C. The storage and distribution of hydrogen is still one of the open questions in the context of a customer-oriented broad commercial market. The last two decades research effort has been devoted to Direct Alcohol Fuel Cells dedicated to overcome the hydrogen specific restrictions. In this direction direct alcohol fuel cells have been extensively studied and considered as possible power production systems for portable electronic devices and vehicles in the near future. However, because of the relatively low performances and the high cost of platinum-based catalysts, a number of research groups have oriented their efforts mainly towards the development: a) of low or non platinum electrocatalysts (anodes and cathodes) and b) of nanostructured electrocatalysts based on non-noble metals. The challenges and the prospects related to the low and non platinum anodes for direct alcohol (methanol and ethanol) PEM fuel cells are presented and discussed in the present work. © 2011 INESC Coimbra.","direct alcohol fuel cells; ethanol and methanol electrooxidation; low and non platinum electrocatalysts","Alternative energy; Chemical energy; Commercial applications; Commercial market; Direct alcohol fuel cell; Electrochemical devices; Future trends; High activity; High costs; Nanostructured electrocatalysts; Non-platinum; PEM fuel cell; Platinum based catalyst; Portable electronic devices; Power production; Research efforts; Research groups; Anodes; Electrocatalysts; Electrolysis; Electrooxidation; Energy conversion; Ethanol; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Methanol; Platinum; Precious metals; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Gas fuel purification",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054005337

Methods: The feasibility of fortifying instant noodles with lysine was evaluated based on sensory qualities and the residual lysine content. Fifty grams of deep-fried and dried instant noodles were fortified with 0.23 and 0.21 g lysine, respectively. The production temperatures used for deep-frying were 165-175°C and for drying, 80-105 °C; these are the temperatures used in the industrial production of both kinds of noodles. Lysine fortification was then performed at the local factories using the commercial production lines and packaging for both types of instant noodles. Both fortified and unfortified deep-fried and dried instant noodles were stored at 50°C under fluorescent light for 2 and 4 months, respectively. Results: The fortified products were tested for residual lysine content and sensory qualities as compared with unfortified noodles. The results show fortified products from the tested processing temperatures were all accepted. After storage, significant losses of lysine were not found in both types of noodles analysed. The lysinefortified noodles had amino acid scores of 102% and 122%, respectively. After 2 months, the sensory quality of fortified deep-fried noodles was still acceptable; however, the dried noodles turned to an unacceptable dark colour. Conclusion: This study shows that it is feasible to fortify deep-fried instant noodles with lysine, though lysine fortification exhibited an undesirable colour in the dried instant noodles after storage.","Fortification; Instant noodles; Lysine; Sensory quality","amino acid; lysine; article; chemistry; color; cooking; diet supplementation; economics; flour; food analysis; food storage; human; malnutrition; standard; taste; temperature; wheat; Amino Acids; Color; Cooking; Flour; Food Analysis; Food Storage; Food, Fortified; Humans; Lysine; Malnutrition; Taste; Temperature; Triticum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053952689

Conducted tests provide evidence of the converters high efficiency at the voltage level of the rated voltage.

Actually, the Energy Storage Systems available are the great obstacle to a faster entrance of the EVs in the market. In fact, EVs applications need sources with high specific energy and high specific power, and currently, there are no available sources with these both characteristics. Consequently, in order to increase the vehicle autonomy and performance, the concept of power sources hybridization has been a study subject in EVs area.

To this end we augment a multi-market equilibrium model of the European energy markets with CCS electricity technologies. The CCS technologies are characterized by costs and technical efficiencies synthesized from a number of recent CCS reviews. Our simulations indicate that with realistic values for carbon prices, new CCS coal power plants become profitable, totally replacing non-CCS coal power investments and to a large extent replacing new wind power. New CCS gas power also becomes profitable, but does not replace non-CCS gas power investment fully. Substantially lower costs, through subsidies on technological development or deployment, would be necessary to make CCS modification of existing coal and gas power plants profitable for private investors.

Since large battery storage is costly, a distributed battery storage, based on Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) seems an attractive option.

Simulations have been done using a mathematical model of energy storage implemented in MATLAB. The obtained results show the quality improvement, of energy delivered by a combination of wind and energy storage, in relation to the size of the energy storage. The introduction of storage enables suppression of wind power fluctuations up to a timescale proportional to the storage energy capacity. Energy storage cannot provide availability of wind power at all times, but it can guarantee that a certain fraction of average wind power will be available within a given timeframe. The amount of storage energy capacity necessary for significant improvement of wind power availability, within a given period, is found to be approximately 20% of the energy produced in that period. The necessary storage power is found to be approximately equal to the average wind power of that same period. © 2011 IEEE.","Energy management; Energy storage; Power system stability; Power systems; Simulation; Wind energy","Power characteristic; Power fluctuations; Power system stability; Quality improvement; Simulation; Storage energy; Storage power; Time-scales; Wind power availability; Computer simulation; Energy management; Energy storage; Mathematical models; MATLAB; Power transmission; Standby power systems; Sustainable development; System stability; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053374832

AC frequency is determined by control of the VSC-HVDC on the WF side, independently of the main grid frequency. Moreover, the rotational speed of a variable speed wind turbine is independent of the AC frequency of the offshore AC grid. These two aforementioned features result in 'inertia-less' system, that is absence of mechanical energy storage to accomodate for abrupt changes in generation and load. An 'inertia-less' system does not have a load-frequency response similar to traditional AC grid with inertia, hence making it difficult for the wind turbines to contribute to frequency support of the main grid. This paper develops an artificial coupling of the wind farm grid and the main grid frequencies, for main grid frequency support by the wind farm. Artificial frequency coupling is achieved by use of droop controllers for the DC voltage control. A case of study, using PSCAD, demonstrates the effectiveness of artificial frequency coupling for the main grid frequency support. © 2011 IEEE.","droop; HVDC; inertia; primary frequency control; wind generation","droop; HVDC; inertia; Primary frequency control; wind generation; Coupled circuits; DC power transmission; Electric utilities; Farms; Power converters; Sustainable development; Wind power; Wind turbines; Frequency response",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053362595

Since then, the installed generation capacity in New Zealand has been observed to follow a bust and boom pattern, resulting in energy shortages during dry winter years. A System Dynamics (SD) model has been developed to study the bust and boom trend. The model is then extended to evaluate whether the generation expansion proposed by the 2008 Statement of Opportunity (SOO2008) will be able to meet future dry winter year demands under the current market mechanism. The evaluation takes into account New Zealand's main storage lake cycles and the El Niño-La Niña Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.

Although Blu-ray high definition disc players (BD) are viewed as better electronic devices than the standard DVD players, they have not yet massively pervaded. That is because the penetration of this new, more efficient technology is determined by factors such as the cost-benefit of BD players as well as the advantages consumers still attribute to the incumbent technology. This paper analyzes the barriers that consumers face to adopt the newer DVD technology in the case of Mexico. Drawing on a survey on Mexican users of DVD technology, it was possible to identify the main factors that deter users from buying BD players. According to the empirical analysis, the chief deterrents are the higher price of Blu-ray combos (players and discs), the lack of information regarding this technology, and, quite surprisingly, the confidence users said to have with the former technology. These results might suggest that Mexico's demand for standard DVDs will continue unabated in years to come in spite of the better quality attributes and energy-efficient features of the Blu-ray technology. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Blu-Ray; Blu-ray technology; Consumer behaviors; DVD players; Efficient technology; Electronic device; Empirical analysis; Energy efficient; High definition; Home videos; Incumbent technology; Me-xico; Quality attributes; Carbon dioxide; Data storage equipment; Energy efficiency; Industrial management; Thermoelectric equipment; Videodisks; Technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053340817

Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography can image the inflammatory nature of gouty arthropathy, revealing synovial and soft tissue inflammation, and can provide information about the composition and vascularity of tophi.

The method employed herein allowed for linear growth of visually homogeneous films composed of V 2O 5, V 2O 5/PAH, and V 2O 5/PAH/AgNP with 15 bilayers. According to the Fourier transform infrared spectra, interaction between the oxygen atom of the vanadyl group and the amino group should be responsible for the growth of these films. This interaction also enabled establishment of an electrostatic shield between the lithium ions and the sites with higher negative charge, thereby raising the ionic mobility and consequently increasing the energy storage capacity and reducing the response time. According to the site-saturation model and the electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical results, the presence of PAH in the self-assembled host matrix decreased the number of V 2O 5 electroactive sites. Thus, AgNPs were stabilized in PAH and inserted into the nanoarchitecture, so as to enhance the specific capacity. This should provide new conducting pathways and connect isolated V 2O 5 particles in the host matrix. Therefore, new nanoarchitectures for specific interactions were formed spontaneously and chosen as examples in this work, aiming to demonstrate the potentiality of the adopted self-assembled method for enhancing the charge transport rate into the host matrices. The obtained materials displayed suitable properties for use as electrodes in lithium batteries and electrochromic devices. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Amino group; Bi-layer; Electroactive sites; Energy storage capacity; Fourier transform infrared spectra; Homogeneous films; Host matrices; Ionic mobility; Layer-by-layer methods; Linear growth; Lithium ions; Lithium-ion battery; Nano-architecture; Nanoarchitectures; Negative charge; Oxygen atom; Polyallylamine; Self assembled material; Self-assembled; Silver nanoparticles; Specific capacities; Specific interaction; Spectroelectrochemical; Vanadyl; Atomic spectroscopy; Electrochromic devices; Electrochromism; Electrodes; Fourier transforms; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Materials properties; Matrix algebra; Silver; Spectroelectrochemistry; Vanadium compounds; Vanadium; ion; lithium; metal nanoparticle; polyallylamine; polyamine; silver; vanadium derivative; vanadium pentoxide; article; chemistry; electrochemical analysis; electrode; particle size; power supply; surface property; Electric Power Supplies; Electrochemical Techniques; Electrodes; Ions; Lithium; Metal Nanoparticles; Particle Size; Polyamines; Silver; Surface Properties; Vanadium Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053311205

This physical stress leads the cathode to crack. The cathode's sulfur reacts to produce lithium polysulfides that dissolve into the electrolyte, taking away active material from the cathode. Yi Cui, associate professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford University and his colleagues realized that they needed to contain the cathode's sulfur. Cui's group developed carbon nanofiber bundles and filled them nearly to the top with sulfur. The researchers used a templating technique, growing the carbon nanofibers on an aluminum-oxide membrane.

DGAT (acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.20) is a transmembrane enzyme that acts in the final and committed step of TAG synthesis, and it has been proposed to be the rate-limiting enzyme in plant storage lipid accumulation. In fact, two different enzymes identified in several eukaryotic species, DGAT1 and DGAT2, are the main enzymes responsible for TAG synthesis. These enzymes do not share high DNA or protein sequence similarities, and it has been suggested that they play non-redundant roles in different tissues and in some species in TAG synthesis. Despite a number of previous studies on the DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes, which have emphasized their importance as potential obesity treatment targets to increase triacylglycerol accumulation, little is known about their evolutionary timeline in eukaryotes. The goal of this study was to examine the evolutionary relationship of the DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes across eukaryotic organisms in order to infer their origin. Results: We have conducted a broad survey of fully sequenced genomes, including representatives of Amoebozoa, yeasts, fungi, algae, musses, plants, vertebrate and invertebrate species, for the presence of DGAT1 and DGAT2 gene homologs. We found that the DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes are nearly ubiquitous in eukaryotes and are readily identifiable in all the major eukaryotic groups and genomes examined. Phylogenetic analyses of the DGAT1 and DGAT2 amino acid sequences revealed evolutionary partitioning of the DGAT protein family into two major DGAT1 and DGAT2 clades. Protein secondary structure and hydrophobic-transmembrane analysis also showed differences between these enzymes. The analysis also revealed that the MGAT2 and AWAT genes may have arisen from DGAT2 duplication events. Conclusions: In this study, we identified several DGAT1 and DGAT2 homologs in eukaryote taxa. Overall, the data show that DGAT1 and DGAT2 are present in most eukaryotic organisms and belong to two different gene families. The phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses revealed that DGAT1 and DGAT2 evolved separately, with functional convergence, despite their wide molecular and structural divergence. © 2011 Turchetto-Zolet et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"accumulation; alga; amino acid; bioassay; bivalve; cell organelle; convergence; divergence; enzyme activity; eukaryote; fungus; hydrophobicity; lipid; membrane; molecular analysis; phylogenetics; protein; algae; Amoebozoa; Eukaryota; Fungi; Invertebrata; Vertebrata; diacylglycerol acyltransferase; primer DNA; triacylglycerol; article; Bayes theorem; biological model; biology; biosynthesis; cluster analysis; comparative study; enzymology; eukaryote; genetics; molecular evolution; phylogeny; species difference; statistical model; Bayes Theorem; Biosynthetic Pathways; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase; DNA Primers; Eukaryota; Evolution, Molecular; Likelihood Functions; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Species Specificity; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053173840

This allows for flexibility in generation and distribution, improving the economic efficiency and utilization of the entire system while making the grid more reliable and robust. Additionally, alternatives to traditional power generation, including variable wind and solar energy technologies, may require back-up power storage. Thus, modernizing the power grid may require a substantial volume of electrical energy storage (EES). The Office of Electricity Delivery & Energy Reliability (OE) is taking leadership on energy storage to ensure that the technologies live up to their potential, and will assist in bringing these solutions into the commercial market. OE's vision of the Program is based on four principles: • Understanding where to put energy storage on the system for the best value • Developing and driving performance targets-e.g., cost, safety, cycle life • Partnering to get the most value, specifically using research, development and demonstrations to understand the value chain, and then using feedback from demonstrations to guide the science in ways for improvements, and • Focusing on engineering that is necessary for manufacturing. OE is providing assistance in three main areas: research, demonstrations/deployments, and systems analysis. • Research is focused on technologies that store electricity in chemicals or batteries, including sodium (Na) based batteries, lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery applications for grid scale systems, advanced lead-acid batteries, and flow batteries. Research is also supported for other categories of technologies, such as superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), ultra-capacitors, advanced materials for flywheels, and geological aspects of compressed air energy storage systems (CAES). • Demonstrations, including deployments within commercial-scale systems, are focused on advancements in the above mentioned batteries, flywheels, CAES, etc. There is some work, also related to advancements in power electronics and control systems as applied to energy storage. • Systems analysis is mainly on the effective integration of storage options within energy balancing areas/authorities. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Automobile drivers; Balancing; Compressed air; Compressed air energy storage; Cost engineering; Demonstrations; Electric power transmission networks; Flywheels; Industrial research; Lead acid batteries; Lithium-ion batteries; Magnetic storage; Solar energy; Storage (materials); Superconducting magnets; Superconducting materials; Systems analysis; Wheels; Battery applications; Driving performance; Electrical energy storages; Electricity delivery; Energy storage systems; Operating capability; Solar energy technologies; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Electric energy storage",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946780009

The basic problem in sizing the PCSU (Phase Change Storage Units) is the accumulation of the maximum heat/cold quantity in a time-lag associated to the capacity of the source to supply heat/cold. The storage units fall into three types of geometry, namely: plane; cylindrical; spherical. The fluid carrying the heat/cold (heat carrier) has a very low thermal capacity (the mass is limited by avoiding the sensitive thermal processes (detrimental in terms of energy as well as in terms of sizing). Two types of processes are considered, as follows: with temperature of the heat carrier variation in time and space and isothermal at value tF.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861165461

Wide-angle X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry results showed that PP crystallized exclusively in the α-form when adding nHAs. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed that nHAs enhanced the storage modulus of PP. Mechanical measurements showed that nHAs stiffened and reinforced PP but reduced its tensile ductility and impact strength considerably. Furthermore, the PP/nHA nanocomposites were found to exhibit excellent bioactivity upon immersion in a simulated body fluid solution.

The positive effects of controlled reperfusion are known and are used clinically. But the positive effects of controlled reperfusion on ovarian tissue have not been seen in the literature yet. The biochemical and histopathological comparative investigation of rat ovaries that were experimentally exposed to ischemia (IG), ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), and ischemia-controlled reperfusion (ICR) was aimed. Forthy rats were divided into four groups (10 rats per group). First group: 3 h ischemia by vascular clips on ovarian tissue. Second group: 3 h ischemia + 1 h reperfusion. Third group: 3 h ischemia + 1 h controlled reperfusion (on-off method: controlled reperfusion by opening and closing the clips (on/off) in 10-second intervals, for 5 times for a total of 100 seconds). Fourth group: healthy rats. Biochemical (tGSH, MDA, and DNA damage level and SOD activity) and histopathological analysis were performed.

It was shown that the phosphorylated carbons contain phosphoric acid residues (condensed phosphates) attached to the carbon matrix mainly by a C-O-P bond and, to a lesser degree, by a C-P bond. The presence of the condensed phosphates in the structure of the carbon determines the hydrophilicity and the acidic characteristics and also the ability to absorb cations. The acidic characteristics of the surface of the phosphorylated carbons gives rise to their high catalytic activity in acid catalysis. The presence of the phosphates/polyphosphates improves the electrochemical characteristics of carbon materials for use as electrodes in supercapacitors. Potential fields for the practical application of phosphorylated carbons are the purification of water from heavy metal ions, the acceleration of reactions of the acid-base type, and the accumulation and storage of energy in double-layer capacitors. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","carbon adsorbents; heteroatoms; phosphorus; phosphorylation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82555195999

This saying also applies to the yeast. In times of excess this microorganism synthesizes non-polar lipids, triacylglycerols (TAG) and steryl esters (SE), which serve as energy source and/or as a source of building blocks for the formation of membrane phospholipids when nutriments become limiting. Due to the lack of charged groups substantial amounts of non-polar lipids cannot be incorporated into cellular membranes, whereas the hydrophobic nature of these molecules also deprives cytosolic localization. Consequently, TAG and SE are stored in specialized compartments known as lipid particles or lipid droplets. TAG synthases and SE synthases which catalyze the final steps in storage lipid formation occur redundantly. Hydrolytic enzymes, TAG lipases and SE hydrolases, initiate the breakdown of storage lipids and make sterols, diacylglycerols, and free fatty acids available for anabolic processes and energy production. In this paper we describe routes of non-polar lipid metabolism, focus on molecular properties of enzymes involved and discuss regulatory aspects of the respective pathways.

The readback signal-based in-situ FH testing technology is the feasible way to monitor and control the FH of heads in HDD. For perpendicular recording, the soft magnetic underlayer has the effects on readback signal and change the Wallace equation into a hyperbolic formula with no explicit solution to the spacing change versus the signal amplitude. Fortunately, the hyperbolic formula can be reduced to the traditional Wallace spacing loss equation at short wavelength. In the actual application, there is a need to compare the FH change or modulation at different disk locations and the harmonic ratio method is preferred to cancel media magnetic fluctuations and a certain level of off-track. This work proposed a new code pattern (11110000) to generate three major harmonic signals: the first, the third, and the fourth harmonics. With zero of the second harmonic signal, the harmonic energies are able to concentrate to the third and the fourth harmonics with strong signal intensity. The most important feature is that both the third and the fourth harmonics can meet the short wavelength requirement with enough signal intensity. This allows the new triple harmonic method to measure FH by the ratio of the fourth over the third harmonics. With the both harmonics in the range of short wavelength, it guarantees the accuracy of FH measurement during the touchdown process. © 2011 IEEE.","In-situ flying height (FH) test; perpendicular recording; thermal FH control; triple harmonic method","Code-patterns; Control technologies; Disk location; Explicit solutions; Flying heights; Fourth harmonics; Hard disk drives; Harmonic energy; Harmonic method; Harmonic ratios; Harmonic signals; In-situ; Magnetic fluctuation; Monitor and control; Perpendicular recording; Second harmonic signals; Short wavelengths; Signal amplitude; Signal intensities; Soft magnetic underlayers; Strong signal; Testing technology; thermal FH control; Third harmonic; Touchdown process; Hard disk storage; Signal analysis; Testing; Harmonic analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053522626

However, the application of the dielectric capacitor is very limited due to its low capacitance, while the double-layer capacitor suffers from difficult scaling-up and high fabrication cost, even though its capacitance is high. In this work, we present the first energy-storage membrane which stores charge when simply sandwiched between two metal plates.

The capacitance of a 1.0 cm 2 area membrane is 0.2 F cm -2, and it can be readily scaled up simply by using larger membrane pieces.

Evidence of an effect on adipose tissue mass in humans is limited, and no studies have specifically aimed to elucidate this in infancy. To explore whether n-3 LCPUFA intake affects adipose tissue growth, we randomly allocated 154 healthy infants to daily supplementation with FO or sunflower oil (SO) from 9 to 18 mo of age and measured z-score changes in various anthropometric assessments of body size and skinfold thicknesses and plasma adipokine concentrations. Among the 133 completing infants, erythrocyte n-3 PUFA increased more in those receiving FO than in infants receiving SO [12.2 ± 0.7 (mean ± SE) versus 2.0 ± 0.4 fatty acid percentage (FA%), p < 0.001] with a concomitant larger decrease in n-6 PUFA (-8.9 ± 0.7 versus-0.9 ± 0.6 FA%, p < 0.001). We found no association between FO consumption relative to SO consumption and any of the anthropometric measures related to the size of the fat mass, but infants in the FO group had a lower skinfold ratio (triceps/subscapular) at 18 mo than those in SO group (p = 0.02). Our findings do not support the hypothesis that dietary n-3 LCPUFA is important for infant fat mass, but future studies testing this specifically are warranted.

The esterification reactions were studied by FT-IR spectroscopy. A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) were intensively used to determine the thermal properties of the introduced thermal storage materials. The thermal properties were given in terms of phase change temperature, enthalpy, specific heat (Cp) and thermal decomposition temperature with related statistical data. The thermal reliability of the novel organic PCMs was investigated by thermal cycling with 1000 thermal cycles with respect to the thermal properties of the original synthesized PCMs. In addition to the synthesized esters, one commercial product was also investigated. The DSC analyses indicated that the melting points of the novel organic PCMs were between 38 and 53 °C with phase change enthalpy above 200 kJ/kg.

In addition, the redundant data in the training set can be significantly discarded. The LS-SVM for SMES controllers are trained using the optimal LS-SVM parameters optimized by a particle swarm optimization and the reduced data. The LS-SVM control signals can be adapted by various operating conditions and different disturbances.

Complex trigger and data acquisition systems are built to select on-line the most interesting events and write them to persistent storage. The final stage of this selection process nowadays often happens on large computer clusters. The stable and reliable operation of such event filter clusters is critical for the success of these experiments. Operating the event filter cluster must ensure dead time free processing of large amount of data, requiring 24-h continuous status monitoring of each processing node, and fast detection and problem solving. Ideally, problems should be recognized before they deteriorate the system performance. The process control of the event filter cluster is performed exclusively by a human operator, placing high demands difficult to accomplish. In this paper, a hybrid system based on expert systems technology and statistical tools and methods is proposed to address this issue. The system is built upon a scalable modular architecture and a design overview is given. The proposed hybrid system is designed and tested in a real environment, with an event filter cluster prototype based on the architecture of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN.

No information is available yet on use of laminarinase for microencapsulation in liposomes. An attempt has been made to define the stability of liposomes as well as free and immobilized enzyme during the storage under different conditions. The partition coefficients (Ko/w) were greater than 1, therefore the standard free energies of the enzyme transfer are negative, indicating an affinity of enzyme for microencapsulation in liposomes. The enthalpy calculation led to the conclusion that the process is endothermic. The transfer of laminarinase in liposomes is a entropy driven process attributable to positive value of entropy change. The presence of enzyme decreases the liposome storage stability from 70 days to an approximately 20 days at 25 °C and 40 days at 4 °C. Monitoring of the liposome's diameter demonstrates that their size and concentration decreases during storage. There was no evidence for liposome fusion process. The stability of immobilized enzyme in the buffer contained suspension did not increase in comparison with free laminarinase, however, stability increased in the soil and phytomass contained systems upon exposure to 254 nm UV-light for every 12 h. Thus the present study has theoretical input, as well as practical significance for enzyme application as biocontrol agent. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Laminarinase microencapsulation; Soya lecithin liposomes; Storage stability","Biocontrol agent; Entropy changes; Enzyme transfer; Immobilized enzyme; Laminarinase microencapsulation; Liposome fusion; Partition coefficient; Phytomass; Positive value; Soya lecithin liposomes; Storage stability; Trichoderma; UV-light; Biocontrol; Entropy; Enzymes; Liposomes; Packaging; Stability; Thermodynamics; Phospholipids; dye; industrial effluent; laccase; adsorption kinetics; article; coconut; controlled study; decolorization; degradation kinetics; enzyme analysis; enzyme immobilization; nonhuman; residue analysis; textile fiber; waste water management; Trichoderma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959606448

The electrochemical energy storage in the nickel hydroxide electrodes is related to the reversible characteristics of the redox couple nickel hydroxide/ox hydroxide. In the present work we describe the use of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique as a tool to characterize the dynamic behaviour of nickel hydroxide electrodes at different states of discharge (SOD) in KOH 7 M electrolytic solutions. The parameter identification procedure allows the estimation of the active area per unit volume, the solution conductivity as well as diffusion and kinetic constants related to the process, that represent very important parameters to evaluate the electrode performance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Available pressure and distribution of the flow to the consumer end are quite significantly affected by the house connection (HC) pipe, storage reservoir (including both the underground and roof tank) and storage type, pumping system and demand pattern. In addition, supply through a distribution pipe is also affected by the relative consumption behavior of all HCs connected with that pipe. Under the Dhaka Water Supply Sector Development Project (DWSSDP); Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) aims to develop a pressurized water supply and distribution system in Dhaka. This study investigates the change in supply pattern due to presence of above factors in between consumer and distribution network. Storage inflow variation due to change in HC pipe diameter and available pressure was analyzed. Again, effects of pumping rate on inflow-outflow of the both storages are determined for a typical consumption pattern. Adequacy of pumping schedule, pumping rate and HC pipe diameter to utilize storage capacity are also investigated. Simplified tentative analyses have been carried out for a single HC (a typical 10 storey building). Flow in HC pipe, storage behavior and peaking of demand are found to be affected quite significantly in the analyses. Finally probable effective combination of HC pipe and pumping system is analyzed to find optimum pressure-flow management. © 2011 IEEE.","demand pattern; DWASA; house connection; pressure head; pumping system; storage","Consumer demands; Consumption patterns; Demand pattern; Development project; Distribution network; Distribution systems; DWASA; Hydraulic designs; Inflow-outflow; Pipe diameter; pressure head; Pressurized water; Pumping rate; pumping system; Pumping systems; Storage capacity; Storage reservoirs; Water supply sector; Communication; Energy storage; Houses; Piping systems; Pressure effects; Pumping plants; Reservoirs (water); Water supply; Pumps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053142381

SOCs with LSV-based hydrogen electrodes exhibit salient catalytic activity in hydrogen and various simulated feedstocks, e.g. syngas, biogas, town gas, and coal gas. LSV electrodes seem to perform better in the electrolyser mode than in the fuel cell mode. LSV electrodes are unlikely to be coked by the deposited carbon when exposed to carbon-forming gases. Most interestingly, LSV undergoes continuous activation during the course of operation, instead of being poisoned, when exposed to gases containing 50 ppm H2S.

The formation of bimetallic carbonate hydroxide was found to start with the nucleation of monometallic nickel carbonate hydroxide evolving into flower-like microspheres. This was followed by the nucleation and growth of the bimetallic carbonate hydroxide nanorods from and on the nanoplates in the flower-like microspheres by localized dissolution-recrystallization, leading finally to the sea urchin structure. After calcination, a morphology conserved NiCo2O4 spinel nanostructure was formed, which uniquely comprises hierarchical, interconnected pores with high specific surface areas suitable for fast electron and electrolyte transport. This, in tandem with the rich redox reactions of nickel cobaltite spinel and their at least two orders of magnitude higher electric conductivity than those of nickel oxides and cobalt oxides alone, renders the novel nanostructures ideal candidates for pseudocapacitors. Indeed, the porous NiCo2O4 nanostructure with a specific surface area of up to 198.9 m2 g-1 has exhibited higher specific capacitances (658 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) than the monometallic cobalt oxides (60 F/g at 1 A g-1) and nickel oxides (194 F g-1 at 1 A g-) with similar porous nanostructures.

Despite rapid progress in mass-storage density, processor speeds and digital communication system performance, demand for data storage capacity and data transmission bandwidth continues to outstrip the capabilities of available technologies. The recent growth of data intensive digital audio, image and video (multimedia) based web applications, have not only sustained the need for more efficient ways to encode signals and images but have made compression of such signals central to signal-storage and digital communication technology. Approach: The objective includes developing and applying an efficient Space-Frequency Segmentation (SFS) as an image partitioning scheme, then using an appropriate entropy-coding algorithm that can be used with the developed segmentation to improve compression performance, particularly in the case of still image compression. The proposed compression system focuses on an innovative scheme for adaptive wavelet coding technique combined with spatial encoding. Result: Experiments conducted using the proposed system produced encouraging results. The entropyspatial coders used in the proposed system produced better results than those obtained by using the basic arithmetic coder. It provides more appropriate rate-distortion optimization for the spacefrequency segmentation than the basic arithmetic coder does. The proposed compression system implies some control coding parameters; the effects of these parameters were investigated to determine the suitable range for each one of them. Conclusion: We conclude that a comparison between the energy of two partitioning types (space and frequency) shows that the energy of frequency partitioning is greater than the space partitioning from the point of view of quality of compressed image. And also the selection of parameter value used in SFS part (Ratio and Threshold) should be chosen correctly, because its value has a great effect on the compressed image quality. And the selection of the quantization step size and the quantization factor (weight) should be done carefully, because experimental results show that these two factors have a great effect on the compression ratio and PSNR factor. Finally experimental results indicate that the use of GAP predictor produces better PSNR than other predictors. © 2011 Science Publications.","Gradient adjacent predication; Image compression; Space-frequency; Wavelet transform",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052843741

According to that strategy, the Member States will reduce their collective green-house gas emissions by at least 20% and boost the share of renewable energy to 20% of total consumption by 2020. In addition, the European Union has set an indicative objective to reduce its primary energy consumption by 20% compared with the projected 2020 energy consumption. This stresses the need to increase energy efficiency in the EU. However, until now there has been no common methodology on how to measure energy efficiency or evaluate the savings achieved by it. The research project ""Measuring and potentials of energy efficiency (EPO)"" was launched in January 2008 to facilitate development in this field. The main objective of the research was to develop a general approach to measure energy efficiency. Furthermore, the research aimed to develop an approach which could be used to calculate the potential achieved by improved energy efficiency. Measuring energy efficiency and potentials are connected closely to each other in the sectors of energy production and distribution, industry, buildings, communities, transportation, and logistics. This report is a state-of-art description and a summary of the research findings in buildings, communities and energy systems made by VTT. Energy systems consist of many energy chains or routes, which include alternative energy sources and process technologies, distribution and storage systems and end use equipments using electricity and producing, heat, light or movement. Almost all energy sources utilize many alternative routes, which may bifurcate and join together again on the way to the end user. Energy efficiency in different energy chains was investigated in batch-surveys on the energy sector. Technical possibilities in energy chain have been evaluated for scenario calculation of energy saving potential in the future. Efficiency impacts to primary energy demand were also evaluated. Emissions of different energy production ways give the value for environmental impacts and further the impacts of making more effective energy chains. A calculation model was made called ""EPOLA"", which is used with scenario technique to analyse impacts of making more efficient national energy chains and to find out the most efficient ways to realise them. Energy production chain has many indicators, which can be presented in consumption/produced-MWh that is one produced energy unit needs fuel, transportation, service, and human resources as well as transfer losses, emissions, and wastes. Indicator of quality of products, availability, reliability and on-peak period has to be present in another way. Indicators during building like material/produced-MW that is one built power unit needs materials like concrete, steel, copper, plastic, glass, etc. Energy is also required when building. The indicators of driving and building can be compared to each other in different energy production alternatives or to make bench marking with same kind and age energy production somewhere else. Energy use in communities (city regions, cities, towns, and other urban areas as well as rural communities) takes place in both buildings and infrastructure, during construction, use, maintenance, repair, renovation, demolition and recycling as well as during transportation of people and goods. That is why energy efficiency of communities must be a composition of energy used during the life-cycle of several physical elements brought together for the community. Energy efficiency of communities can be defined as a ratio between an input of energy consumption or emissions, and an output of services, such as number of inhabitants and jobs or floor square metres. There are several energy efficiency indicators which consist of different parts and phases. Indicators complete each other. System boundaries for measuring energy efficiency of communities can be defined on the grounds of planning levels and areas or from functional bases. Communities may have a relatively high potential for energy efficiency improvements. Potential seems to be highest in the operation phase of structures and in transportation. Buildings have a relatively high potential for energy efficiency improvements compared to other sectors of the economy. Indicators are needed to measure both current energy efficiency and improvement potential. Various indicators serve different purposes and interests in the buildings sector depending on the needs of the indicator's user, who may range from the user of the building to the regulator, just to mention two of the typical stakeholders of a building. Defining a universal indicator to cover all needs is not possible. Therefore an array of indicators is suggested - what indicator to use depends on the situation and the objectives of the analysis. Calculating energy efficiency potential is dependent on the scale and timeframe of the analysis. With small changes it suffices to take into account all significant energy flows and embodied energy with average primary energy coefficients. A profitability calculation should also be made. With large changes that entail systemic effects the primary energy coefficients should take marginal values. Systemic changes should be analyzed with e.g. scenario analysis and economic effects should be evaluated with e.g. economic modelling. Externalities and the rebound effect should also be considered.

The proposed HRES design specifies the operation of the following units: a pumped-storage hydro power plant, a wind power plant and a solar power plant. Since the pumped-storage hydro power plant represents the most complex entity of the HRES, special emphasis is placed on its two control loops: the water tank level control loop and the load-depended frequency control loop. Models of these control loops provide the means for efficient controller design and implementation. In order to achieve effective energy distribution and reliable power supply of the consumers, a switch logic architecture has been developed. Since the HRES's final energy production highly depends on the process of energy conversion, the performances of three types of power converters are analysed. This includes the parametrisation, modelling and simulation of such converters. Finally, a graphical user interface (GUI) for purposes of data monitoring, control and supervision within the designed SCADA system, is presented. The proposed HRES design represents the foundation of the system implementation that aims at serving as a platform for research, education and a broad range of projects on renewable energy. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Complex entities; Concept designs; Control loop; Controller designs; Data monitoring; Effective energy; Energy distributions; Final energy; Frequency control loop; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Logic architecture; Modelling and simulations; Parametrisation; Pumped-storage hydro; Reliable power supply; Renewable energies; System implementation; Design; Electric power distribution; Energy conversion; Graphical user interfaces; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Industrial electronics; Ion beams; SCADA systems; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Water tanks; Wind power; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052828159

The publication starts by introducing a generic roadmap to the ubiquitous world. This is followed by a short overview of the global, societal and human needs, and the technology enablers for a ubiquitous lifestyle. The main part of this work presents several claims together with the vision and reasoning behind each one, trends, signs, and near and long-term future possibilities. Effort has been made to give practical examples wherever possible. A dedicated chapter deals with the new business opportunities of a ubiquitous world. The main findings were that human nature will be the same in a ubiquitous world but that the possibilities and means to do things will broaden considerably. We will become digital persons and citizens. Embedded electronics and smart devices in our surroundings will communicate for our benefit in smart spaces all around our everyday lives. Energy will continue to be a scarce resource, and production, transfer, storage and use will be optimized with smart grid and energy harvesting technologies. Smart devices will provide us with digital sense and means to interact and live with the virtual world. Ever-present and fluent connectivity to the Internet will become an inherent property of the world so that the supporting technologies and wireless networks disappear from the users' knowledge. Similarly, the cloud will be hidden from the users. Data, applications and services will be there somewhere. Smartness will penetrate vehicles and the road infrastructure. There are also generic findings such as technologies being applied more often to new purposes rather than to what they were intended for in the first place. The virtual and real worlds will mimic each other, replicate and make the impossible possible. It will not always be possible to tell real from virtual. Collaboration and cognitivity will bring benefits over single device or object functionality. The integration of virtual world with the real world gives humanity a new dimension of life.

One of the major challenges turns out to be reliable power supply. To overcome this challenge, we explore how to decrease the demand for power as well as the feasibility of using alternative power sources, such as solar and wind, and alternative power storage technologies, such as batteries and ultra-capacitors. In this paper, we present data collected over 2 months from the Serengeti community network in rural Tanzania to discuss the quality of the existing power-grid and the feasibility of using solar and wind energy as alternative energy sources. The network backbone is based on 1Gbps Ethernet links over dark fibre while end-user connections are currently based on WiFi links. Our measurements regarding the quality of the power-grid show up to 21 power-outages in one single day, with an average of 2 outages per day. Some of the outages are due to planned rationing schemes caused by insufficient power generation while some outages are due to poor wiring or installations. Our measurements and analysis of the feasibility of using alternative power sources indicate wind speeds on the average 2m/s and a persistent high-level insolation, making solar energy the prime candidate as an alternative source of electricity. The relatively high cost of solar panels has to be mitigated by increased energy efficiency of the network elements. We also propose power management to be included in the network management system to maximize the availability of the network services and decrease operational costs due to damaged network elements. © 2011 IEEE.","alternative energies; developing regions; Green networking; remote areas","Alternative energy; Alternative energy source; Alternative source; Broadband service; Community networks; Developing regions; End users; Ethernet link; Green networking; High costs; Innovative solutions; Insufficient power; Network backbones; Network element; Network management systems; Network services; Operational costs; Power managements; Power sources; Power storage; Reliable power supply; Remote areas; Solar panels; Sustainable communities; Tanzania; Wind speed; Computer networks; Electric power generation; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Ethers; Network management; Paper capacitors; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Telecommunication systems; Wi-Fi; Wind power; Outages",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052766849

Therefore, the operating time of such devices depends mainly on the capacity of the energy storage component and on the average power consumption of the device. The power consumption depends on the supply voltage and on the activated components of the hardware. This work presents the evaluation of component-aware dynamic voltage scaling (CADVS). This low power technique combines the power-down of unused components and the minimization of the supply voltage. Typically, each component of the hardware (microcontroller, transceiver, sensors) has its own supply voltage range. Therefore, the minimum allowed supply voltage depends on the activated components. However, the activated components and consequently the minimum allowed supply voltage varies over time. CADVS uses voltage converter to adjusts the supply voltage of the hardware to save as much energy as possible. This work presents the evaluation of six different voltage converters. It has been shown that CADVS can be used to save up to 38.7% of the energy compared to a constant voltage supply using the introduced scenario while achieving the same end-user performance. © 2011 IEEE.","component aware dynamic voltage scaling; dynamic voltage scaling; energy efficient supply; mobile devices; perpetual operation; wireless sensor networks","Activated components; Average power; Constant voltage; Dynamic voltage scaling; End users; Energy efficient; Energy storage components; Low power techniques; Operating time; perpetual operation; Supply voltages; Supply-voltage range; Voltage converter; Wireless sensor; Digital devices; Energy efficiency; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Portable equipment; Sensors; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052763775

Capacities of Rhizobium etli R13 to produce the bioplastic during growth on media with different carbon sources appeared to be specific carbon-source. In fed batch fermentation, R. etli R13 resulted in cell dry weight 6.2 g/L and PHB 51.4%. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gel permeation chromatography analysis revealed that PHB produced from R. etli R13 was solely composed of 3-hydroxybutyric acid and the molecular mass of the purified PHB was 3.4 × 105 Da with polydispersity 1.47. Dielectric relaxation of PHB has been studied in the temperature and frequency ranges 300-440 K and 10 kHz-4 MHz, respectively. A clear dielectric α and P-relaxation processes are observed in these studied ranges of temperature and frequency. The first process is due to the dipole relaxation in the crystalline phase of PHB. The second one is due to the space-charge formation or Maxwell-Wagner-polarization. The α-relaxation process has been investigated by semiempirical Havriliak-Negami relaxation function. The activation energy (Ea) and the relaxation time (τ0) are calculated using the Arrhenius equation. The dielectric relaxation strength (δε) is strongly temperature dependent. The calculated values of Ea for ac conductivity, ln(σ), of PHB provide information about the presence of electronic conduction. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","conduction mechanism; poly(3-hydroxybutyrate); relaxation processes; Rhizobium etli R13","3-hydroxybutyric acid; Ac Conductivity; Arrhenius equation; Bioplastics; Calculated values; Carbon source; Carbon storage; Cell dry weight; Conduction Mechanism; Crystalline phase; Dipole relaxation; Electronic conduction; Fed-batch fermentation; Frequency ranges; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate); Relaxation functions; Rhizobium etli; Semi-empirical; Space charges; Temperature dependent; Activation energy; Air purification; Chromatographic analysis; Gas chromatography; Gel permeation chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Polydispersity; Size exclusion chromatography; Dielectric relaxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957923564

The ever increasing fuel price and its cost of transportation to the remote location limited the availability of electricity to certain time of the day. Since the rural settlement usually located near water source, renewable energy based on hydro is suggested. This paper will discuss about the development of model system for cost-effective pico-hydro turbine. The size of the turbine will be based on low flow and low head application. Two types of turbine, propeller or also known as axial-flow and cross-flow, are evaluated under these conditions. Both of the turbines were installed in one model system equipped with storage tanks and piping system. Centrifugal pump is used to ensure the circulation of the water between main storage tank into the flowing tank simulating the run-of river application for pico hydro system. The head of the model system is fixed with variable parameter of water flow rate is controlled by using controller valve and flow meter for power data collection for each turbine. The performance of both turbines were also simulated and evaluated by using CFD's software. Techno-economics evaluations are done so that the model of the system will be able to select the optimum size of the turbine based on the flow rate for a cheap efficient and cost-effective hydro turbine. © 2011 IEEE.","Cost effective; Cross-flow; Model system; Pico hydro turbine; Propeller","Alternative energy; Cost effective; Cost of transportation; Cross flows; Fuel prices; Hydro-system; Hydroturbines; Low flow; Low head; Model system; Power data; Remote location; Renewable energies; Rural electrification; Rural settlement; Storage tank; Techno-economics; Variable parameters; Water flow rate; Water source; Centrifugal pumps; Cost effectiveness; Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Flow rate; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic turbines; Propellers; Pumps; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Tanks (containers); Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052548964

Following some researchers, this trend will continue over the next years. Cloud computing is a new concept based on a well-know model named ""pay-as-you-go"". There is a new concept dubbed PACS Cloud, which the fundamental idea is to do PACS outsourcing taking advantages of the clouds elasticity and scalability, avoiding hardware obsolescence, providing universal access to the information anywhere, anytime and increase the data availability. This paper presents a module of PACS Cloud architecture to grant interoperability with DICOM devices. PACS Cloud Gateway is a component of PACS Cloud, which focuses mainly on the translation from DICOM commands to non-DICOM and vice-versa. While data outsource to the cloud can relieve users from the burden of local storage and maintenance, it also brings new security concerns. This paper presents a secure PACS Cloud Gateway to access PACS Cloud archive, which provides a high security level and without cloud's provider dependence. The workflows of each process was described carefully, specifying data flows since that Gateway is contacted by DICOM device, until it releases the process. Finally, the platform was instantiated in biggest Internet Cloud providers and the solution's results was analysed. © 2011 AISTI.","Cloud Computing; DICOM; Medical Imaging; PACS; Telemedicine","Cloud providers; Concept-based; Data availability; Data flow; DICOM; High security levels; Medical images; Outsource; PACS; Pay-as-you-go; Universal access; Work-flows; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer systems; Elasticity; Gateways (computer networks); High energy physics; Information systems; Medical imaging; Obsolescence; Cloud computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052507826

The proposed protocols leverage trusted authority entities and the ""elastic"" virtualized nature of the cloud computing model to provide energy-efficient key management mechanisms and policy-driven data protection techniques that support the secure interaction of the mobile client with an assortment of cloud software and storage services. The main contribution lies in: (1) Offloading the intensive asymmetric key agreement mechanisms from the mobile client and delegating them to resource-lucrative trusted authority sites. This is achieved by aggregating the security associations, required to agree on symmetric keys between the client and the cloud services, in a single security association between the client and the trusted authority. The aggregation concept results in major energy savings especially when the client consumes a relatively large set of services as is the case in cloud computing today. (2) Designing a customizable policy-based security architecture that considers the sensitivity of cloud data to provide multi-level and fine-grained data protection methodologies that suit the energy-limited mobile devices and the low-bandwidth wireless networks characterizing current mobile cloud computing models. The system is implemented in a real cloud computing environment and the savings in terms of energy consumption and execution time are analyzed.","Cloud computing security; Customizable security protocols; Energy-efficient security; Mobile cloud computing; Policy-driven security","Computing security; Customizable; Energy-efficient security; Mobile cloud computing; Policy driven; Computer systems; Cryptography; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Information management; Mobile devices; Network protocols; Network security; Wireless networks; Cloud computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052497563

In the application of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), overwhelming data provision is another big problem. Data aggregation condenses raw data into useful information and reduces redundant data transmissions. Consequently, significant energy and data storage are saved, and tasks can be completed more efficiently. However, it is a nontrivial problem to organize the various data aggregation techniques into an integrated architecture on a distributed WSN. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based data aggregation architecture to facilitate application development for efficient SHM. We developed a role-based data aggregation middleware and SQL-like user interface to support flexible task configurations.

It is estimated this venture will double the existing gas supplies stored in the UK and represent over 5% of its annual gas demand. As North Sea gas production decreases and the UK becomes more dependent on imports, the ability to store gas has become an important part of the UK energy policy. Drilling into depleted reservoirs for gas storage produces several major technical problems and issues that must be addressed. This field is a pressure-depleted reservoir with a differential pressure equivalent to 7.3 lb/gal between the drilling fluid's hydrostatic pressure and the reservoir pressure. This differential must be controlled to eliminate the risk of differential sticking, downhole losses, and hole collapse. Due to the reservoir depletion, it would be impossible to backflow and clean up the near-wellbore region without a post drill-in treatment fluid to remove the fluid filter cake and water-wet all the surfaces for gas injection. To ensure project success and usable fluid designs, reservoir conditions were simulated in the laboratory and fluid parameters were altered to provide the optimum properties to minimize the future risks. The paper discusses in full the laboratory design process, the verification of the drill-in and treatment fluids as being fit-for-purpose, and their successful application in the field. Initial well testing suggested the expected injection rates of 500 scf/min at 300 psi were exceeded, with rates of 750 scf/min at 280 psi reported.

This paper proposes an implantable biomedical sensor which operates off a super capacitor which is wirelessly charged. A feasibility analysis of supercapacitors is presented first, and then the system design and implementation are detailed for achieving wireless charging control with digital data logging.

Design/methodology/approach - Owing to solar irradiation, wind speed and water flow are highly and randomly changeable, time variation of the signals needs to be taken into consideration as well as some features of the power plants and storage system. A Matlab/Simulink model of the given system - DC microgrid has been developed. The model allows simulation of a few years static simulations of the power balance. Hence, it can be used to size the plants. Findings - An effective method of the power system design has been developed. It allows sizing the plants taking into consideration resources and load profiles, year changes in profiles and future development of the system. The storage system can be optimized to avoid high power unbalance and power cost increasing. Research limitations/implications - The model describes only static power behaviour of the modelled power system. It does not allow simulating local voltage changes and dynamic properties of the plants and storage. Practical implications - This technique helps to size the plants and, first of all, storage system taking into consideration several technical and economical issues. Originality/value - The method gives opportunity to design a storage system's capacity and power and optimize them.

I larvae into juveniles requires minor morphological changes, including segment formation, body elongation, and loss of cilia. In this study, we investigated changes in the expression patterns of both proteins and phosphoproteins during the transition from larvae to juveniles in this species. We used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by multiplex fluorescent staining and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis to identify the differentially expressed proteins as well as the protein and phosphoprotein profiles of both competent larvae and juveniles.Results: Twenty-three differentially expressed proteins were identified in the two developmental stages. Expression patterns of two of those proteins were examined at the protein level by Western blot analysis while seven were further studied at the mRNA level by real-time PCR. Results showed that proteins related to cell division, cell migration, energy storage and oxidative stress were plentifully expressed in the competent larvae; in contrast, proteins involved in oxidative metabolism and transcriptional regulation were abundantly expressed in the juveniles.Conclusion: It is likely that these differentially expressed proteins are involved in regulating the larval metamorphosis process and can be used as protein markers for studying molecular mechanisms associated with larval metamorphosis in polychaetes. © 2011 Chandramouli et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","2-DEphos; Capitella sp.

In vitro investigations on this topic usually encompass biomechanical testing using frozen/thawed specimens and employ quasi-static loading conditions. It is generally accepted that a freezing/thawing cycle does not alter mechanical properties for slow loading rates. However, this has never been investigated for high impact velocities. In order to assess the effects of freezing/thawing and the influence of different impact velocities, we loaded 27 fresh and 15 frozen/thawed cadaveric rabbit spinal segments (intervertebral disc with one third of the adjacent vertebrae) with different impact energies and velocities using a custom-made, dropped-weight loading device. Endplate fractures were assessed by micro-CT scans. Specimen dimensions (disk, bone, and total height) and vertebrae bone density (BV/TV) were compared pre- and post-trauma. Energy absorption by spinal segments was quantified by measuring the initial ball rebound. We found that freezing/thawing increased endplate fracture frequency and decreased the energy absorption of the segments. Higher impact velocities increased the energy absorption, while higher impact energy increased both energy absorption and fracture frequency. Two conclusions are drawn: first, under impact loading, freezing alters permanently the biomechanical response, and second, for different impact velocities, different fracture initiation mechanisms apply. Therefore, quasi-static loading of frozen/thawed spinal segments is not a valid model for traumatic endplate injuries. However, caution should be exercised in extrapolating these findings to human vertebrae until tests on larger vertebrae are performed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Endplate fracture; Fracture frequency; Freezing; Impact rate; Storage condition","Biomechanical response; Biomechanical testing; Bone density; Endplate fracture; Endplates; Fracture frequency; Fracture initiation; Fracture response; Freezing/thawing; High-impact velocities; Impact energy; Impact loadings; Impact rate; Impact velocities; In-vitro; Intervertebral discs; Loading devices; Loading rate; Micro CT; Quasi-static loading; Specimen dimension; Spinal segments; Storage condition; Traumatic injury; Absorption; Biomechanics; Bone; Computerized tomography; Energy absorption; Fatigue crack propagation; Fracture; Freezing; Mechanical properties; Musculoskeletal system; Velocity; Loading; animal tissue; article; biomechanics; bone density; controlled study; energy absorption; experimental rabbit; freeze thawing; in vitro study; loading test; lumbar spine; micro-computed tomography; nonhuman; priority journal; process optimization; spine fracture; statistical model; storage temperature; validation process; velocity; Animals; Energy Transfer; Models, Biological; Preservation, Biological; Rabbits; Spinal Fractures; Spine; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051553667

Dielectric capacitors have high power density with fast discharge rate, but their energy density is typically much lower than electrochemical supercapacitors. Increasing the energy density of dielectric materials is highly desired to extend their applications in many emerging power system applications. In this paper, we review the mechanisms and major characteristics of electric energy storage with electrochemical supercapacitors and dielectric capacitors.

Simulations using the transport of ions in Matter software and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to characterize the embedded layer and their surface chemical composition. XPS and transmission electron microscopy depth profiling results confirm the presence of a shallow mixed layer of carbon and cobalt for all three types of ion energies tested.

The full fat mayonnaise (FF) and commercial low fat (CLF) were used as a control experiment. Physicochemical, rheological, microbiological analyses and sensory evaluation of the FF and light fat mayonnaises preparing by potato powder mash (LFP) at level 5, 10 and 15% were performed. The results indicated that all light-fat mayonnaise formula had significantly lower energy content, but higher water content than their FF and CLF counterpart. In terms of colour, the low fat mayonnaise formula was higher than that of the commercial light fat mayonnaise. With regard to pH, there were no significant differences between the FF, CLF and LFP mayonnaises after one-day storage. Meanwhile, the overall acceptability scores were significantly higher when the substitution levels of potato powder mash increased. The rheological characteristics of LFP at 15% are more close to that of the commercial control CLF. Microbial loadings of all mayonnaises tested were in the acceptable limit throughout the storage time.

The plant is the sole commercial-scale solar tower to combine central tower receiver and molten salt heat storage technology, - a mode of thermal storage used more prevalently in parabolic trough CSP technology. At Gemasolar, the tower receiver is able to absorb 95% of the radiation from the sun's spectrum and transmit this energy to the molten salt compound that circulates within the receiver and heats steam to operate a power-generating turbine. The system can produce electricity for 15 hr without solar radiation, helping overcome energy fluctuations. Torresol used molten salt technology in the solar tower because it enables the tower to more easily reach a much higher operating temperature.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053895998

The demand and supply are extrapolated to the year 2020 and the influences of photovoltaic installations and demand response are investigated. A district of 300 houses is simulated, where each household consists of three types of intelligent systems: electric devices with a storage capacity like boilers, shiftable loads like washing machines and batteries. Agents, representing devices can trade power on virtual markets, like the PowerMatcher. First, the relation between load flows and smart power is examined. We found, as a rule of thumb, that the variations in load flow decrease proportionally to the fraction controlled power. This might have important consequences for investment policies in power networks. Next, the stability of a cluster is examined. Here it is estimated how long a cluster can remain stable if a constant power flux is imposed. This flexibility can be traded, directly on an imbalance market or through a balance responsible party (BRP). In the next two business cases, the implications for retailers and end-users are examined for three billing types: a fixed tariff, a two-tariff structure, and an hourly ""real-time"" tariff structure. Compared to the fixed tariff structure, the incentive to use smart devices is small in the double tariff structure. In a real-time tariff structure incomes increase and risks decrease for retailers, while end-users have the potential to decrease costs. If we succeed to implement 20% demand response by 2020, our power grid remains able to transport the increased power flows. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","agent based control; business cases; demand response; distributed energy resources; power grid simulations; simulation","Agent-based control; business cases; Demand response; distributed energy resources; Power grid simulation; simulation; Electric power distribution; Energy resources; Intelligent systems; Investments; Risk assessment; Washers; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053360765

Although preservation solution and cold storage reduce cold ischemic injury, the depletion of cellular energy and oxidative signalling leads to cellular damage. Because bone morphogenetic protein-7 has renoprotective effect, we have hypothesized that recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-7 (rh BMP-7) will better preserve kidney tissue exposed to prolonged cold ischemia in comparison with University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. We evaluated how the duration of cold ischemia influences the cold ischemic injury. Methods: Levels of lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content, as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were determined in the kidneys by spectrophotometry after 6, 12, and 24 hours of cold ischemia. Results: Time-dependent increases in the levels of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content at all time points were significantly lower in rhBMP-7perfused kidneys versus the UW-treated group. SOD activity after 6 hours, as well as GSH-Px activity after 24 hours of cold ischemia was significantly higher in the kidney tissue perfused by rhBMP-7 than in UW group. Conclusion: rhBMP-7 significantly decreases cellular damage in rat kidney versus UW preservation solution and this is attributed to lowering of cold ischemia injury and maintaining prolonged tissue antioxidant activity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,"glutathione peroxidase; recombinant osteogenic protein 1; superoxide dismutase; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; University of Wisconsin solution; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antioxidant activity; article; cell damage; cold ischemia; controlled study; drug effect; enzyme activity; graft preservation; kidney ischemia; kidney parenchyma; lipid peroxidation; male; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; rat; renal protection; tissue perfusion; tissue regeneration; Animals; Antioxidants; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7; Glutathione Peroxidase; Kidney; Lipid Peroxidation; Male; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Recombinant Proteins; Reperfusion Injury; Superoxide Dismutase",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052721749

Hind-limb preparations of fasted and cold exposed rats were perfused with buffers containing tritium labelled and cold palmitic acid. Palmitic acid incorporation into intracellular lipid pools in the soleus, plantaris, red and white gastrocnemius and red and white quadriceps was measured. It was found that fasting increased approximately 2-fold palmitic acid incorporation in all muscles examined regardless of the fibre type composition of the muscle. On the other hand, exposure to cold had no effect on the palmitic acid incorporation into intramuscular acylglycerols regardless the muscle fibre type. The increased incorporation of palmitic acid into acylglycerols in fasted animals is in line with data showing that 48 h fasting stimulates the expression of plasma membrane proteins putatively facilitating fatty acid uptake. It appears that although 12 h cold exposure increases the use of fatty acids as energy substrates it does not alter the incorporation of palmitic acid into intramuscular acylglycerols in the perfused rat hind-limb. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","cold exposure; fasting; fatty acid uptake; perfusion; skeletal muscle","acylglycerol; fatty acid; glycogen synthase; palmitic acid; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cold exposure; controlled study; diet restriction; fatty acid blood level; fatty acid transport; glycogen liver level; lipid storage; male; muscle cell; nonhuman; protein expression; rat; skeletal muscle; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Cold Temperature; Fasting; Glycerides; Hindlimb; Male; Muscle Fibers, Fast-Twitch; Muscle Fibers, Slow-Twitch; Muscle, Skeletal; Palmitic Acid; Perfusion; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052523445

Fetal growth velocity is high during the third trimester, constituting a potential critical window for organ programming. Intra-pair differences amongmonozygotic twins are instrumental in determining nongenetic associations between early environment and adult metabolic phenotype. Objective: Our objective was to investigate the relationship between size at birth and third-trimester growth velocity on adult body composition and glucose metabolism using intra-pair differences in young healthy twins. Methods: Fifty-eight healthy twins (42 monozygotic/16 dizygotic) aged 18-24 yr participated. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Whole-body fat was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, whereas abdominal visceral and sc fat (L1-L4) were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Third-trimester growth velocity was determined by repeated ultrasound examinations. Results: Size at birth was nongenetically inversely associated with adult visceral and sc fat accumulation but unrelated to adult insulin action. In contrast, fetal growth velocity during third trimester was not associated with adult visceral or sc fat accumulation. Interestingly, third-trimester growth was associated with insulin action in a paradoxical inverse manner. Conclusions: Abdominal adiposity including accumulation of both sc and visceral fat may constitute primary nongenetic factors associated with low birth weight and reduced fetal growth before the third trimester. Reduced fetal growth during vs. before the third trimester may define distinct adult trajectories of metabolic and anthropometric characteristics influencing risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

To mitigate their economic impact, combining the wind power with pumped hydro energy storage may be used. In order to deliver a joint operational strategy for a wind power plant combined with storage, one requires reliable wind power forecasts. The forecasts commonly only consist of a single-value forecast (point forecast) for each look-ahead time. However, additional representative information concerning the forecast uncertainty may be required. In this paper, the influence of uncertainty representation daily operation for a wind power plant combined with pumped hydro storage is discussed. The paper illustrates how uncertainty representations such as Gaussian uncorrelated errors may also not be satisfactory. Based on a case study with a wind power plant combined with pumped hydro storage, organized for illustrative purposes, the paper demonstrates the need to have uncertainty representation including cross-period dependencies, in order to define a correct operation policy. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Economic impacts; Forecast uncertainty; Gaussians; Information concerning; Look-ahead time; Operation policy; Operational strategies; Single-value; Uncertainty representation; Uncorrelated errors; Wind park; Wind power forecast; Errors; Forecasting; Power plants; Reactive power; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052110475

These goals are being achieved mainly due to increasing levels of wind power. One of the main characteristics of wind power is the inherent unpredictability and variability. By allowing the energy storage, pumped-hydro units are able to cope with this drawback, promoting the match between generation and consumption. This paper presents a model based on market prices to determine the optimal bidding strategies that enable the total profit maximization of a pumped-hydro unit. It is considered that this unit participates in the Iberian day-ahead electricity market and in the portuguese ancillary services market. The optimal bids of the unit were calculated for scenarios with different levels of wind energy in the day-ahead market. The results showed that most of the income of the pumped-hydro unit was obtained from the spinning reserve market. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Ancillary services markets; Day ahead market; Day-ahead electricity market; External energy; Main characteristics; Market price; Model-based OPC; Optimal bidding strategy; Optimal bids; Portugal; Profit maximization; Renewable capacity; Spinning reserves; Optimization; Profitability; Wind power; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052106005

Although a favourable renewable energy source (RES) potential might exist, the technical constraints introduced by the conventional generators result in relatively low RES penetration levels, typically up to 15%-20% of the annual energy demand. To overcome such limitations, introduction of energy storage is necessary. In the case of very small islands (less than 1 MW peak load), lead-acid battery energy storage systems (BESS) constitute a technically mature solution with considerable application potential. In this paper, the potential for achieving very high RES penetration levels with the introduction of BESS in an existing small island system is investigated. An operating policy is first introduced for the overall system, including conventional generators, RES (wind and photovoltaic) stations and storage system.

Both postlarvae and adults are found in relative large abundances in Svalbard fjords as well as along the ice edge of north-east Svalbard, even at sub-zero temperatures. The postlarva feeds primarily on Calanus spp. and stores lipids from this high-energy diet in a unique lipid sac on the ventral side of its body. This energy storage enables it to survive pelagically during the arctic winters when food is scarce. The postlarvae are pelagic for the first 2-3 years of their life before they descend to the bottom and transform to a benthic mode of life. Our results indicated that this transition takes place when the postlarva reach about 80 mm in length and an age of 3 years. The relative size of the lipid sac, as well as changes in the morphology of the postlarvae, can be used as indices of the transition from pelagic postlarva to benthic juvenile. The lipid sac index (% of gutted weight) was negatively correlated with length and age and started to decrease when the postlarva transformed to a benthic lifestyle. At this point, the growth in terms of the length-weight relationship shifted from a positive asymptotic growth to a negative asymptotic growth, reflecting the changes in the lipid sac index, while several changes in morphological traits took place. The benthic mode of early juveniles is largely influenced by environmental conditions and prey abundance, since the fish is depleted from their energy stores and need to rapidly switch to benthic prey in their new habitat. In conclusion, this is the first study on the early life history of the daubed shanny and it presents evidence that the first 5 years in the life of this species is divided in two distinct parts, one pelagic and one benthic, in which postlarvae display unique growth and morphological traits adapted to the challenges of these arctic marine environments. © 2011 The Author(s).","Adaptability to high arctic waters; Early life history; Leptoclinus maculatus; Lipid storage; Morphology; Postlarva","abundance; adaptation; arctic environment; bioenergetics; crustacean; fjord; juvenile; larva; length-weight relationship; life history trait; lifestyle; lipid; marine environment; morphology; perciform; temperature effect; Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Calanus; Leptoclinus maculatus; Stichaeidae; Teleostei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051930645

Glassy models were heated up from low temperature at two different heating rates and a glass-to-liquid transition found to occur at the higher heating rate. The temperature dependence of the potential energy, mean-squared-displacements (MSD) of the atoms and the self-intermediate scattering function indicate clearly that a glass transition occurs in the system. The atomic mechanism of the glass-to-liquid transition was investigated by analyzing the spatio-temporal arrangement of liquid-like atoms in the system upon heating. Liquid-like atoms were detected using the Lindemann-melting-like criterion. Upon heating, liquid-like atoms occur at temperatures far below the glass transition temperature (Tg) due to local instabilities. Their number increases upon further heating and they form clusters. Subsequently, a single percolation cluster of liquid-like atoms appears, which spans the system at Tg. The percentage of liquid-like atoms aggregated into this single percolation cluster reaches more than 83% at the melting point (Tm) to form a liquid phase. These results show previously unreported aspects of the glass-to-liquid transition and share some trends observed for homogeneous melting of crystalline solids without a free surface. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.","glass-to-liquid transition; Lennard-Jones glass; Lindemann ratio; melting of glass","Atomic mechanism; Crystalline solids; Form clusters; Free surfaces; glass-to-liquid transition; Homogeneous melting; Lennard jones; Lennard-Jones glass; Lindemann ratio; Liquid Phase; Local instability; Low temperatures; Molecular dynamics methods; Percolation clusters; Scattering functions; Spatio-temporal; Temperature dependence; Atoms; Glass; Glass transition; Heating; Heating rate; Melting; Molecular dynamics; Percolation (computer storage); Solvents; Liquids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051889738

Strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa) immersed in water were exposed to microwaves at a frequency of 2450 MHz for 3 min at 514 W or 1 min 50 s at 763 W to reach an average temperature of 43.8 ± 0.6 °C at the fruit centre. Another batch was treated in hot water at 45 °C for 15 min, and a final batch was not treated (control). RESULTS: After 9 days of refrigerated storage (3 °C and 90% relative humidity), all heat-treated strawberries showed significant retention of quality parameters such as colour and firmness and significantly lower yeast and mould populations (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Strawberries subjected to MW-assisted hot water treatments showed significantly better retention of lightness compared with conventionally treated berries. A short (1 min 50 s) treatment at 763 W was the best choice to prevent strawberry decay. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.","Decay; Microwaves; Strawberries","water; article; bacterial count; chemistry; comparative study; cross breeding; feasibility study; food handling; food preservation; Fragaria; freezing; fruit; fungus; growth, development and aging; heat; immersion; isolation and purification; methodology; microbiology; microwave radiation; pH; physical chemistry; pigmentation; quality control; radiation exposure; radiation response; time; yeast; Colony Count, Microbial; Crosses, Genetic; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Feasibility Studies; Food Handling; Food Preservation; Fragaria; Fruit; Fungi; Hot Temperature; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Immersion; Microwaves; Physicochemical Phenomena; Pigmentation; Quality Control; Refrigeration; Time Factors; Water; Yeasts; Fragaria; Fragaria x ananassa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051874737

The effects of the rotor PM skew angle on the cogging torque and the axial force have been studied. It is found that an optimum skew angle is effective in reducing the overall cogging torque with negligible effect on the static axial force.

Its melting temperature is not suitable for many thermal energy storage applications although it has good latent heat storage capacity compared to the several traditional phase change materials (PCMs). The galactitol also has high supercooling degree as about 72°C. These unfavorable properties limit the usage potential of galactitol in thermal energy storage applications. However, the phase change temperature and supercooling degree of galactitol can be reduced to a reasonable value and therefore its feasibility for energy storage systems can be increased. For this aim, in this study, galactitol hexa stearate (GHS) and galactitol hexa palmitate (GHP) were prepared as novel solid-liquid PCM by means of esterification reaction of the galactitol with palmitic acid and stearic acid. The GHP and GHS esters were characterized chemically using FT-IR and 1H NMR techniques. By using DSC analysis method, the melting temperature and latent heat value of the PCMs were determined as 31.78°C and 201.66Jg-1 for GHP ester and 47.79°C and 251.05Jg-1 for GHS ester. Thermal cycling test showed that the prepared PCMs had good thermal reliability after thermal 1000 melting-freezing cycles. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results revealed that the PCMs have good thermal stability over their working temperatures. In addition, thermal conductivity of the prepared PCMs was increased as about 26.3% for GHP and 53.3% for GHS by addition of 5wt.% expanded graphite. Based on all results it can be concluded that the prepared GHP and GHS esters can be considered as promising solid-liquid PCMs for many energy storage applications such as solar energy storage, indoor temperature controlling in buildings, production of smart textile and insulation clothing due to their good energy storage properties. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Galactitol; Palmitic acid; PCM; Stearic acid; Thermal energy storage; Thermal reliability","Analysis method; Energy storage applications; Energy storage systems; Esterification reactions; Expanded graphite; Fusion enthalpy; Galactitol; In-buildings; Indoor temperature; NMR techniques; Phase change temperature; Reasonable value; Smart textiles; Solid-liquid; Solid-liquid phase change materials; Storage properties; Thermal cycling test; Thermal reliability; Working temperatures; Buoyancy; Esterification; Esters; Flywheels; Heat storage; Latent heat; Liquids; Melting point; Metal melting; Palmitic acid; Phase transitions; Saturated fatty acids; Solar energy; Stearic acid; Storage (materials); Supercooling; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Thermogravimetric analysis; Phase change materials; building; control system; cooling; experimental study; latent heat flux; melting; solar power; temperature effect; thermal conductivity; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051598113

They are primarily synthesized by fluorescent pseudomonads under unbalanced nutrient availability as carbon and energy storage compounds. From thermogravimetic analysis, the mcl-PHAs produced from Pseudomonas putida grown on palm kernel oil showed a drastic decomposition at temperature above 195 °C. An increase of HO-CHR∼∼ terminals was observed when the mcl-PHAs were thermally decomposed at 160-180 °C, which was presumably due to the hydrolytic chain cleavage initiated at -COO-CHR∼∼, the main skeletal bonds of the biopolyester. At 190 °C, molecules with RCH≡CH∼∼ were also observed as minor decomposition products from the FTIR and NMR measurements and this could be probably due to the dehydration of HO-CHR∼ groups of hydroxyl acids, producing terminally unsaturated oligomers.

The above features are related to the hydrophilizing groups in the network which not only generate hydrated ionic conduction channels, but also enable the cross-linking of the network in electrolyte.

From an environmental point of view, the latter is commonly considered as the least desirable option. Many studies based on life-cycle assessment (LCA) highlight the environmental benefits offered by incineration and especially by recycling. However, the landfilling option is often approached unjustly in these studies, maybe disregarding the remarkable technological improvements that landfills have undergone in the last decades in many parts of the world. This study, by means of LCA-modelling, aims at comparing the environmental performance of three major management options (landfilling, recycling and incineration or composting) for a number of individual waste fractions. The landfilling option is here approached comprehensively, accounting for all technical and environmental factors involved, including energy generation from landfill gas and storage of biogenic carbon. Leachate and gas emissions associated to each individual waste fraction have been estimated by means of a mathematical modelling. This approach towards landfilling emissions allows for a more precise quantification of the landfill impacts when comparing management options for selected waste fractions. Results from the life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) show that the environmental performance estimated for landfilling with energy recovery of the fractions ""organics"" and ""recyclable paper"" is comparable with composting (for ""organics"") and incineration (for ""recyclable paper""). This however requires high degree of control over gas and leachate emissions, high gas collection efficiency and extensive gas utilization at the landfill. For the other waste fractions, recycling and incineration are favourable, although specific emissions of a variety of toxic compounds (VOCs, PAHs, NOx, heavy metals, etc.) may significantly worsen their environmental performance. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To obtain robust estimators of the reliability, an ensemble including acceleration records with markedly different characteristics is used in the simulation study.

Energy systems of this society will be based on four pillars: Renewable Energy, Buildings as Positive Power Plants, Energy Storage and Smart grids in combination with Plug-in Vehicles. All these pillars must be supported by the use of smart energy storage. The results of previous research has shown that in order to increase security, efficiency and viability, there is need for energy storage, in primary or secondary form, in order to transfer energy surplus from period of excess to the period when there is a lack. The problem of today's storage systems is that they increase the cost of already expensive, distributed and renewable energy sources. That makes the large scale use of storage systems even less economically viable in market circumstances, despite economics of scale. The paper shows results of an energy planning methodology applied to several cases where use of smart energy storage system helps integration of energy flows, transformations and energy demand at the location of the energy end-use or close to it. Main results presented in this paper focus on planning a 100% independent energy system of Croatia. They also show the role of energy storage in a self-sustainable energy system with excess electricity production from renewable energy sources.

Our study was concerned with the characterization and purification of glutathione S-transferase enzyme (GST) from normal and Down syndrome (DS) erythrocytes to illustrate the difference in the role of this enzyme in the cell. Glutathione S-transferase and glutathione (GSH) was determined in ten DS and ten healthy children matched for age (3-10 years). DS group exhibited significantly lower GST value (2.7units/gHb) as compared to controls (6.6units/gHb) (40.9%). GST activity was significantly decreased to 40.9% in the DS group as compared to controls. Also GSH concentration was significantly decreased to 60.6% in the DS group compared to the controls. Glutathione transferase was purified from erythrocytes of normal and DS pooled blood samples by affinity chromatography with specific activity of 23.7% and 7.9%, respectively. The effect of freezing and thawing, storage time of freezing and GSH concentration on the stability of the enzyme were examined. Normal GST exhibited a pH optimum at pH 7 followed by sharp decrease, however DS GST exhibited pH optimum between pH 7.5 and 8. The Km values for 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and GSH were 0.205mM and 0.786mM, respectively, for normal GST, and 0.318mM and 1.307mM, respectively for DS GST. The activation energy (Ea) was calculated to be 2.25 and 4.25cal/mol for normal GST and 3.8cal/mol for DS GST. Normal and DS GST were inhibited by the same inhibitors (hematin, bromosulfophthalein and cibacron blue), but with different degree.

The elegant technique derived from the classical papers of Pekeris (1958, 1959, 1962, 1965, 1971) [1-3] is applied. The basis functions are composed of the Laguerre functions. The method is based on the perimetric coordinates and specific properties of the Laguerre polynomials. Direct solution of the generalized eigenvalues and eigenvectors problem is used, distinct from the Pekeris works. No special subroutines were used, only built-in objects supported by Mathematica. The accuracy of the results and computation times depend on the basis size. The ground state and the lowest triplet state energies can be computed with a precision of 12 and 14 significant figures, respectively. The accuracy of the higher excited states calculations is slightly worse. The resultant wave functions have a simple analytical form, that enables calculation of expectation values for arbitrary physical operators without any difficulties. Only three natural parameters are required in the input. The above Mathematica code is simpler than the earlier version (Liverts and Barnea, 2010 [4]). At the same time, it is faster and more accurate.

Approximate methods must be applied in order to obtain the wave functions or another physical attributes from quantum mechanical calculations. Solution method: The S-wave function is expanded into a triple set of basis functions which are composed of the exponentials combined with the Laguerre polynomials in the perimetric coordinates. Using specific properties of the Laguerre polynomials, solution of the two-electron Schrödinger equation reduces to solving the generalized eigenvalues and eigenvector problem for the proper Hamiltonian. The unknown exponential parameter is determined by means of minimization of the corresponding eigenvalue (energy). Restrictions: First, the too large length of expansion (basis size) takes the too large computation time and operative memory giving no perceptible improvement in accuracy. Second, the number of shells Ω in the wave function expansion enables one to calculate the excited nS-states up to n=Ω+1 inclusive. Running time: 2-60 minutes (depends on basis size and computer speed). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The system behavior proved to be linear with small relative standard deviations (less than 15%) within the values of the calculated errors and also relatively insensitive to solar radiation fluctuations ranging from 800 to 1100W/m2. Flow rate variations from 0.07 and up to 0.25L/s did not produce any noticeable effects on the energy collected in the storage tank of the system under investigation.

This work contributes with studies on a Low-Cost Solar Heater (LCSH), a new concept of solar water heater made entirely of polymeric materials, which requires a relatively low investment and is user-assembled. The solar collector, which absorbs solar energy and transfers it to water in the form of heat, is composed of uncovered flat panels of rigid PVC. The storage tank that holds the water heated during the day is made of polyethylene coated with polystyrene. The results of the LCSH were compared with those of a conventional solar heater composed of a glass-covered copper collector and a stainless steel storage tank. The efficiency of the systems was evaluated by measuring the incident solar radiation and water temperature with the systems operating naturally (thermosiphon). The heat loss in the hot water storage tanks was measured to estimate the thermal performance of the solar heaters. Considering that the target temperature for the heated water is slightly above the ambient temperature, the results indicated that the LCSH showed a satisfactory global heat transfer coefficient for storage tanks and that it attained an excellent thermal performance, although it is not as efficient as the conventional heater. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Low-cost solar heater; Solar energy; Thermal efficiency","Ambient temperatures; Copper collectors; Flat panel; Global heat transfer coefficients; Hot water storage tanks; Polymeric material; Rigid PVC; Solar heater; Steel storage tank; Storage tank; Target temperature; Thermal efficiency; Thermal Performance; Water temperatures; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Heat transfer; Incident solar radiation; Investments; Mixed convection; Polystyrenes; Polyvinyl chlorides; Solar heating; Stainless steel; Storage (materials); Sun; Water heaters; Water tanks; Solar energy; copper; cost-benefit analysis; energy efficiency; glass; heat transfer; heating; performance assessment; polymer; renewable resource; solar power; solar radiation; thermal power; water temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954577229

Storages in general are important, since they provide energy buffering to load changes, energy leveling to source variations and ride-through enhancement to the overall microgrids. Recognizing their importance, this paper presents a scheme for sharing power among multiple distributed storages, in coordination with the distributed sources and loads. The scheme prompts the storages to autonomously sense for system conditions, requesting for maximum charging energy only when excess generation capacity is available. As generation capacity drops or demand increases, energy drawn by the storages decreases spontaneously, until full source capacity is near. At which point, the storages release their stored energy for meeting the extra load demand. The described process takes place in an automated manner with energy sharing always maintained among the storages. To verify the concepts discussed, simulation was performed with its results shown near to the end of the paper. © 2011 IEEE.","distributed generations; distributed storages; Microgrids; smart grids","Autonomous control; Charging energies; Distributed generators; Distributed sources; Distributed storage; Energy buffering; Energy sharings; Generation capacity; Load change; Load demand; Micro grid; Microgrids; Ride-through; Smart grid; Stored energy; System conditions; Distributed power generation; Power electronics; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052102784

By having multiple DVRs connected to different transmission feeders, the common energy storage in IDVR system can be dynamically replenished from an unaffected feeder so as to maintain the rated power of critical loads in another feeder where voltage sag appears. However, despite its enhancement in compensation capability, the drawbacks faced by original IDVR system are mainly attributed to its complexity in topology and underutilizations of semiconductors. Aimed to improve the system in these aspects, the paper proposes a new IDVR topology with 25% reduction in semiconductors totally used.

It typically consists of consumer loads, energy storage and small generation systems and is capable of islanding to protect itself against grid supply interruption. With the increased awareness of clean energy power systems, renewable technologies such as solar PV, wind turbines and fuel cells are gradually emerging within the power system network, and control and management for these equipment are necessary to ensure the stable operation of microgrids. However, existing centralized control systems are unable to handle the large number of renewable components and thus, a decentralized control scheme called Multi-Agent System (MAS) is introduced to manage these components.

However, DMFC's performance is strongly affected by methanol crossover that significantly degrades the fuel conversion efficiency at low output power, and is characterized by an increasing efficiency at increasing output power. The maximum efficiency point (MEP) is inherently difficult to track due to the commonly unknown methanol crossover rate, but since it is typically located very close to the maximum power point (MPP), an alternative tracking approach based on the MPP is proposed. In this paper, a fuel-cell-oriented MPP tracking (MPPT) algorithm based on resistance matching is developed, implemented, and tested in the context of a DMFC/supercapacitor hybrid power system. To account for the generally slow fuel cell dynamics, the DMFC is constantly tracked at the MPP while any surplus or deficit power is absorbed or delivered by the supercapacitor bank. The detailed formulation of the algorithm and the power flow design and realization are also discussed. © 2011 IEEE.","bi-directional converter; direct methanol fuel cell; Fuel cell; maximum power point tracking; power management","Bidirectional converters; Direct methanol; Fuel conversion efficiencies; Fuel-cell dynamics; Gaseous hydrogen; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid power systems; Maximum Efficiency; Maximum power point; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Methanol crossover; Methanol crossover rates; On-resistance; Output power; Portable electronics; Power flows; Power managements; Super capacitor; Tracking algorithm; Algorithms; Conversion efficiency; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC); Energy management; Hydrogen storage; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Optical flows; Power electronics; Pumps; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052080198

Based on the flexible linkage type, the average diameters of the nanoparticles-containing sulfone or ether linkage were 140 nm and 190 nm, respectively, as judged by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs. Incorporation of copper (II) ions into these particles furnished polymeric complexes in (1:2) ratios with square planar geometries. The polymeric structures were proved on the basis of their IR, UV, ESR and elemental analysis data. The thermal properties of the polymers were evaluated by various techniques and results revealed the high thermal stabilities of the hybrids. The calculated limiting oxygen index (LOI) indicates that such macromolecules can be classified as self-extinguishing polymers. The dc electrical conductivity of all samples indicates either semi-conducting or metal-like nature in the regime of semiconductor behaviors. Incorporation of copper significantly improved the conductivity of the resulting complexes due to the enhanced mobility of the charge carriers upon doping. Dielectric losses are characterized by sharp peaks appearing at characteristic frequencies suggesting the presence of relaxing dipoles. The peak positions did not change with temperature indicating a non-activated process. The loss tangent increased with frequency and the peaks shifted toward the lower frequency upon doping suggesting the increase in the energy loss ratio compared to the energy storage in the dielectric. The higher value of dielectric loss at low frequency is due to the free charge motion within the materials. The reported dielectric results revealed anomalous behaviors which have not been reported earlier in similar hybrids. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Virtual all of these waste streams can be treated by the plasma technology resulting in a final product free from organics, liquids and moisture, and meets without doubt the acceptance criteria for safe storage and disposal. The plasma is a highly desirable heat source Its high temperature up to 10.000 °C can treat the radioactive waste as is.

However, raw materials for fuel pellet production consist of lignocellulosic biomass from various resources and are therefore different in their composition and structural properties. This has the consequence that different types of biomass require different processing conditions such as press channel length and moisture content. Nowadays the process optimization is mainly based on expensive and time-consuming ""trial and error"" experiments and personal experience. However in recent years, the utilization of single pellet press units for testing the biomass pelletizing properties has attracted more attention. The present study outlines an approach where single pellet press testing is combined with modeling to mimic the pelletizing behavior of new types of biomass in a large scale pellet mill. This enables a fast estimation of key process parameters such as optimal press channel length and moisture content. Second, the study addresses the question of the origin of the observed relationship between pelletizing pressure and temperature. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Biomass residue; Channel length; Energy density; Fast estimation; Key process; Lignocellulosic biomass; Multi-parameter models; Pelletizing pressure; Personal experience; Processing condition; Temperature dependence; Transportation cost; Trial and error; Biomass; Moisture; Moisture determination; Optimization; Presses (machine tools); Structural properties; Pelletizing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051949779

Demand response can be seen as a resource like distributed generation, storage, electric vehicles, etc. All these resources require the existence of an infrastructure able to give players the means to operate and use them in an efficient way. This infrastructure implements in practice the smart grid concept, and should accommodate a large number of diverse types of players in the context of a competitive business environment. In this paper, demand response is optimally scheduled jointly with other resources such as distributed generation units and the energy provided by the electricity market, minimizing the operation costs from the point of view of a virtual power player, who manages these resources and supplies the aggregated consumers. The optimal schedule is obtained using two approaches based on particle swarm optimization (with and without mutation) which are compared with a deterministic approach that is used as a reference methodology.

The level 0.16 eV in depth is an effective electron trap that provides crossing of lateral conductivity with a high-resistance mode and, therefore, causes a high photocurrent sensitivity of about 3 AW at 77 K with excitation by interband transitions in QDs.

Hyperspectral canopy reflectance data was collected on 30 trees at monthly intervals over a period of 16 months in a commercial orchard in South Africa. The mean canopy reflectance in the wavelength range 350-2500. nm followed a clear seasonal trend influenced by environmental conditions and tree phenology. Mean monthly reflectance peaked in summer (∼22%) while the lowest value (∼15%) was reached in winter with the seasonal changes in the sun's position accounting for a significant proportion of the variations. A sensitivity analysis of a Penman-Monteith transpiration model showed that water use by individual trees changed by up to 13% when the canopy reflectance was varied over the seasonal range of measured values. This suggested that the seasonal changes in tree water use influenced the seasonal trend of the canopy reflectance. Thus monitoring the canopy reflectance of citrus trees could offer information on the tree water status. To test this, sap flow data of water uptake and loss by the trees were compared with the canopy spectra. Sap flow data showed a heavy reliance by the citrus trees on the internally stored water with up to 25% of the daily total transpiration withdrawn from the trees' internal water storage pools when soil water was limited. This depletion of internally stored water, and hence the change in tree water status, was detected using spectral indices based on the first order derivatives of the canopy reflectance centered at two and, at most, four spectral bands. We conclude that even if citrus trees are evergreen, their canopy reflectance changes significantly throughout the year with a considerable impact on tree energy balance and water use. In addition, the contribution of the internally stored water to daily transpiration is a possible indicator of drought stress for citrus trees detectable from changes in canopy reflectance and it has potential applications in irrigation scheduling using canopy level spectral information. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Drought stress; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Internal water use; Sap flow; Transpiration model","canopy reflectance; dicotyledon; diurnal variation; drought stress; energy budget; evergreen tree; irrigation system; Penman-Monteith equation; phenology; remote sensing; sap flow; seasonal variation; semiarid region; soil water; transpiration; tree; water storage; water uptake; water use; wavelength; South Africa; Western Cape; Citrus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957495755

If the bath effects are to be treated properly on both Markovian and non-Markovian timescales using numerical simulations, the number of bath modes cannot be large. This may affect the ability to simulate realistic scenarios. Even if realistic, such simulations are hard to interpret physically. An alternative approach advocated here is to resort to a perturbative analysis provided the system-bath coupling is weak. This analysis would allow for the effects of any given bath (finite or infinite, Markovian or non-Markovian) and any control at our disposal. This poses the challenge of constructing a method for the optimization of various operations requiring proper manipulation of the system, based on a general perturbative treatment to second order in the system-bath coupling. This proposed treatment yields a universal tool for optimizing the fidelity of a given operation. It involves a fidelity-control matrix: a construct that allows us to prioritize the use of available control resources so as to maximize the operation fidelity in any given bath. As an analytically solvable example of this general method, we analyse quantum state-transfer optimization, from a 'noisy' (write-in) qubit to its 'quiet' counterpart (storage qubit). Intriguing interplay is revealed between our ability to avoid bath-induced errors that profoundly depend on the bath-memory time and the limitations imposed by leakage out of the operational subspace.

This is new approach to mitigate the voltage sags without using special energy storage devices or power transformers. In the normal incident, the load is fed the power from utility supply via main static transfer switch. When voltage sag is occurred, the main static transfer switch is opened and the auxiliary static transfer switch is closed respectively to feed the power from two three-phase voltage-fed PWM converters into the load instead of faulted utility supply. The operation under 4 conditions of voltage sag of 7.5-kW voltage sag compensator using two three-phase voltage-fed PWM converters is verified by simulation using MATLAB/Simulink. It can be seen that the load received continuous power during voltage sags, the transition from utility supply to two three-phase voltage-fed PWM converters is almost seamless, and the synchrony between utility supply and two three-phase voltage-fed PWM converters is correct. Moreover, utility supply current is kept to be sine wave during sag occurrences and line power factor is also maintained nearly unity. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Power factors; PWM converter; Sine-wave; Special energy; Transfer switches; Utility supply; Voltage sag compensation; Voltage sag compensator; Voltage sags; Voltage-fed; Electric power factor; Information technology; Power transformers; Telecommunication; Virtual storage; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961224102

We investigate the production of molecular photofragments upon UV excitation of PAH derivatives, relevant for the interstellar medium. Methods. The action absorption spectra of protonated gas-phase methyl-substituted quinolines (CH3-C9H7NH+) have been recorded in the 215-338 nm spectral range using the electrostatic storage ring ELISA, an electrospray ion source and 3 ns UV laser pulses. Results. It is shown that the absorption profile is both redshifted and broadened when moving the methyl group from the heterocycle containing nitrogen to the homoatomic ring. The absorption profiles are explained by TD-DFT calculations. The dissociation time of the studied molecules is found to be of several milliseconds at 230 nm and it is shown that after redistribution of the absorbed energy the molecules dissociate in several channels.

The challenges include robustness of network components, poor or non-existent power supply and sustainable business models. We argue that large scale user-driven community networks are becoming technically viable to deploy in areas that are short of supply of telecommunication services due to little or no commercial interest. To support this claim, we discuss the design of key network elements and careful power management based on alternative energy sources and storage. We also provide a status report from ongoing field-tests regarding provisioning of broadband network services in Serengeti, Tanzania, and outline briefly our strategy to achieve sustainability. On the technical side, we first discuss an affordable, high-performance, low-effect router based on open source software and standard off-the-shelf hardware offering both copper and fibre links. Our design is capable of forwarding more than 700kpps at 22.3W. The power consumption is considerably less than all alternatives in our comparison.

These calculations are based on DFT with the generalized gradient approximation PW91 (Perdew and Wang) as implemented in the Materials Studio v.4.3 code. The Dmol3 module was used to calculate, among others, total energies, charge density, HOMO-LUMO and Mulliken population analysis. On the basis of these results, it is possible to propose that a single Sc atom is able to adsorb up to 6 H2 molecules. Therefore the study was extended for a ystem with 10 Sc atoms, which can adsorb up to 60 H 2 molecules. This leads to 6.01 wt %, which fulfils the current requirement (6 wt %, at 2010, specified by US Department of Energy (DOE)).

Power generated from renewable energy sources is not stable because of the energy fluctuations caused mainly by atmospheric conditions. Therefore, in order to improve the parameters and stability of the power system, PV power plants should cooperate with electrical energy storage system such as electrochemical batteries. Moreover, because of the reason that PV power plants are often located on the terrain which is accessible by the man, galvanic isolation may be obligatory. Since the efficiency of the power conversion in PV power systems has to be maximized, soft switched resonant power converters, in which switching losses are minimized, are utilized in such PV power systems.

In microbial cells, polyphosphate granules are synthesised for both energy and phosphate storage and are degraded to produce nucleotide triphosphate or phosphate. Energy released from these energetic carriers is used by the cell for production of all vital molecules such as amino acids, nucleobases, sugars and lipids. Polyphosphate chains directly regulate some processes in the cell and are used as phosphate donors in gene regulation. These two processes, energetic metabolism and regulation, are orchestrated by polyphosphate kinases. Polyphosphate kinases (PPKs) can currently be categorized into three groups (PPK1, PPK2 and PPK3) according their functionality; they can also be divided into three groups according their homology (EcPPK1, PaPPK2 and ScVTC). This review discusses historical information, similarities and differences, biochemical characteristics, roles in stress response regulation and possible applications in the biotechnology industry of these enzymes. At the end of the review, a hypothesis is discussed in view of synthetic biology applications that states polyphosphate and calcium-rich organelles have endosymbiotic origins from ancient protocells that metabolized polyphosphate. © 2011 Achbergerová and Nahálka; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"messenger RNA; polyphosphate; polyphosphate kinase; polyphosphate kinase 1; polyphosphate kinase 2; polyphosphate kinase 3; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; phosphotransferase; polyphosphate; polyphosphate kinase; biochemistry; biotechnology; catalysis; energy metabolism; enzyme degradation; enzyme structure; enzyme synthesis; human; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; review; Sinorhizobium meliloti; synthetic biology; bacterium; chemistry; metabolism; physiology; protein tertiary structure; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Phosphotransferases (Phosphate Group Acceptor); Polyphosphates; Protein Structure, Tertiary",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961119081

In this paper, we first introduce geometric quorum systems (along with their metrics) to incarnate the idea of in-network data storage. These quorum systems are geometric because curves (rather than discrete node sets) are used to form quorums. We then propose GeoQuorum as a new quorum system, for which the quorum forming curves are parameterized. Our proposal significantly expands the quorum design methodology, by endowing a system with a great flexibility to fine-tune itself towards different application requirements.

In addition, ATCA successfully delivered solutions in other sensitive issues like redundancy, power dissipation and available area for components and routing. Experience has shown, however, that such hardware devices can require a lengthy development. The ATCA specification allows for custom solutions in areas of the interfaces which can be used to define extensions of the standard for instrumentation needs. The ""xTCA for Physics"" workgroups are currently developing ATCA and MicroTCA extensions for Physics instrumentation applications. These extensions will define interfaces in customizable areas which will support functionalities required by the instrumentation and facilitate hardware development and its posterior operation in a Fusion control plant environment - most notably, dedicated timing and input-output (IO) port assignment on the Rear Transition Module (RTM). The prototype hereby presented is a Peripheral Component Interface (PCIe) switch Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) carrier blade. The device serves as a hub, as to control and handle I/O data from its parent nodes existing within the same ATCA shelf through its fabric channels in dual-star topology. Parent node blades, under development, are equally linked through ATCA's agnostic fabric in full-mesh topology, as to attain system MIMO functionality from all I/O endpoints. The switch blade carries up to four AMC modules, adding up to modularity and versatility. This allows for a much more independent and speedier hardware development, as dedicated AMC modules, such as data processing and storage devices, can be simultaneously developed. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) AMC products are readily available and may also be immediately integrated in the system. © 2006 IEEE.","Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA); fast control plant systems","Advanced mezzanine cards; Advanced telecommunications computing architectures; Channel density; Commercial-off-the-shelf; Control and data acquisition systems; Controller support; Custom solutions; Customizable; Fast control; fast control plant systems; Fusion control; Hardware architecture; Hardware development; Hardware devices; Input-output; MicroTCA; Multi-input multi-output; Nuclear fusion; Nuclear fusion devices; Parent node; Peripheral component interfaces; Switch blade; Workgroups; Architecture; Data handling; Electric network topology; Fusion reactors; High energy physics; Instruments; Real time systems; Specifications; Telecommunication equipment; Topology; Virtual storage; Hardware",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860405412

Patients with type 1 DM always need exogenous insulin administration, recently available in the form of insulin analogs. In type 2 DM, characterized by increased insulin resistance and progressive decline of the beta-cell function, various antidiabetic medications are used. Most of the subjects with type 2 DM will finally need insulin. The main site of insulin action is the skeletal muscle, while the liver is the main site of glucose storage in the form of glycogen. With the modern diabetes therapies it is possible to rapidly reach and maintain normoglycemia in both types of DM but with the cost of higher incidence of hypoglycemia, especially related to exercise. Regular physical exercise causes a lot of beneficial effects in healthy as well as diabetic subjects of all age groups. In type 1 DM physical exercise is a fundamental element for both physical and mental development. In type 2 DM it has a main role in diabetes control. The increased hepatic glucose production and the increased muscular glucose uptake during exercise are closely interrelated in all exercise intensities. In diabetes mellitus there is a disturbed energy substrate use during exercise leading to either hypo- or hyperglycemia. The influence of low or moderate intensity aerobic exercise on diabetes control has been well studied. The inappropriately high insulinemia combined with the low glucose levels can lead to severe hypoglycemia if proper measures are not taken. Prolonged exercise can also predispose to decreased glucose counter regulation. It is better for the type 1 diabetic subject to postpone the exercise session in very high (&gt;300 mg/dl) or very low (&lt;70 mg/dl) BG levels. Every insulin treated subject is recommended to be checked for any existing diabetic complication before the start of every exercise program. Glucose measurement with glucose meters or sometimes with Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) must be made before, during and most importantly after the end of the exercise session. It is recommended either to reduce or suspend the previous insulin dose depending on the insulin regime or to receive extra carbohydrates before, during or after the exercise session or both. Subjects with type 1 DM may participate at almost all the competitive sports if precautions are taken. These measures must be individualized and readjusted, even empirically. In very high intensity exercise (about 80% of VO 2 max) or when high intensity exercise follows a low intensity one, there is a tendency of the BG to increase due to excessive circulating catecholamines necessitating postexercise short acting insulin. In anaerobic or resistance exercise lactic acid is produced. This exercise type is recommended for people in whom aerobic exercise is contraindicated. These two exercise types can be combined. The incidence of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in specific forms of resistance exercise as well as the appropriate insulin dose adjustment are not well studied. In conclusion all exercise types are beneficial for both types of diabetes. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Diabetes mellitus; Exercise; Insulin therapy","fatty acid; glucose transporter 4; insulin derivative; lactic acid; triacylglycerol; aerobic exercise; anaerobic exercise; article; blood glucose monitoring; diabetes control; diabetic diet; drug dose reduction; exercise; exercise intensity; gluconeogenesis; glucose absorption; glucose transport; glycemic control; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin treatment; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas islet cell function; postprandial state; resistance training; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus; Exercise; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860389779

It was found that at lower storage temperatures (&lt;100° C), the plate-like NiSn 3 is the dominant IMC phase in the Sn layers. Upon raising the temperature, a competition between the initiations of NiSn 3 and Ni 3Sn 4 phases was observed as identified by energy dispersive X-ray. The crystal structure of NiSn 3 was determined by the powder diffraction pattern. The investigations revealed that the growth rate of NiSn 3 in terms of the penetration depth from the Sn/Ni interface to the Sn surface follows the square-root power law, implying a diffusion controlled phase growth. The diffusion coefficients of the NiSn 3 phase growth were determined at different temperatures (25°C, 50°C, and 75°C), which are significantly higher than that reported for Ni 3 Sn 4 under the same temperatures. The activation energy for the growth of NiSn 3 obtained is 39.90 kJ/mol. Hardness and Young's modulus of NiSn 3 were determined by means of nanoindentation.

Short but intense rain storms are becoming more common. An expression to predict the time taken for a storage vessel to collapse while subject to external rainfall is developed.

The presence of pure Fe in the MgH2+FeF2 composite, as opposed to MgH 2+FeF3 containing Mg2FeH6 and MgF2, did not cause any significant influence on the sorption proper ties of MgH2. Moreover, the original material doped with FeF 3 predominantly showed iron in the Mg2FeH6 compound, while the FeF2 dopant iron mostly showed the nearly pure BCC metallic phase. © Versita Sp. z o.o.","Activation energy; Hydrogen storage; Iron fluorides; Magnesium hydride; Mg2FeH6",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052553925

The proposed system has compact size without the need for any connecting pipes. The working fluid absorbs the incident solar radiation directly and passes it to the storing fluid container that has been implemented within the core of the novel system. A mathematical model has been presented to describe the thermal behavior of the proposed system. Moreover, an expression has been derived to predict the system efficiency, outlet temperature, and utilized heat transfer. Simultaneously, a comparison of the performance of the novel solar system with that of the conventional solar collector reveals that the performance of the proposed system is much better than that of the conventional collector. The proposed direct absorption collector has a collector efficiency factor, F' = 1 which is 20% more than that of well-manufactured conventional collectors. This yields about 20% increase in the heat removal factors and efficiency of the integrated system as compared with that of the conventional collectors over the entire range of overall heat loss coefficients and for the same operating conditions regarding working fluid mass flow rate, inlet fluid temperature, ambient temperature, and incident solar radiation. However, it is found that the performance of the integrated collector is more sensitive to the variation in the overall heat loss coefficient and working fluid mass flow rate as compared with the conventional collectors.

It is preferable that the control technique in this system possesses robustness for various fault conditions and disturbances. The used flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) in this paper is an advanced super-conducting magnetic energy storage (ASMES). Many control techniques that use ASMES to improve power system stability have been proposed. While fuzzy controller has proven its value in some applications, the researches applying fuzzy controller with ASMES have been actively reported. However, it is sometimes very difficult to specify the rule base for some plants, when the parameters change. To solve this problem, a fuzzy model reference learning controller (FMRLC) is proposed in this paper, which investigates multi-input multi-output FMRLC for time-variant nonlinear system. This control method provides the motivation for adaptive fuzzy control, where the focus is on the automatic online synthesis and tuning of fuzzy controller parameters (i. e., using online data to continually learn the fuzzy controller that will ensure that the performance objectives are met).

Higher DG penetration levels may be interesting from many different points of view, but raise important issues about distribution system operation. Therefore, new techniques are needed to determine the maximum amount of DG that may be installed without requiring major changes in the existing electric power system. According to the literature, voltage rises at load bus bars are a serious limiting factor when installing DG. This paper presents and discusses studies proving that conductor ampacity and voltage rises are limiting factors that manifest themselves under different conditions. The present study highlights situations in which line overloads are more restrictive than voltage rises.

For both biofuels and traditional forest products, the importance of energy efficiency and rail use is growing. A GIS-based model for energy wood supply chains was created and used to simulate the costs for several supply chains in a study area in eastern Finland. Cost curves of ten supply chains for logging residues and full trees based on roadside, terminal and end-facility chipping were analyzed. The average procurement costs from forest to roadside storage were included. Railway transportation was compared to the most commonly used truck transportation options in long-distance transport. The potential for the development of supply chains was analyzed using a sensitivity analysis of 11 modified supply chain scenarios.For distances shorter than 60 km, truck transportation of loose residues and end-facility comminution was the most cost-competitive chain. Over longer distances, roadside chipping with chip truck transportation was the most cost-efficient option. When the transportation distance went from 135 to 165 km, depending on the fuel source, train-based transportation offered the lowest costs. The most cost-competitive alternative for long-distance transport included a combination of roadside chipping, truck transportation to the terminal and train transportation to the plant. Due to the low payload, the energy wood bundle chain with train transportation was not cost-competitive. Reduction of maximum truck weight increased the relative competitiveness of loose residue chains and train-based transportation, while reduction of fuel moisture increased competitiveness, especially of chip trucks. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy wood bundle; Forest chip; Fuel terminal; Logging residue; Railway transportation; Supply chain","Bio-energy; Cost curves; Cost-efficient; Eastern Finland; Energy wood; Finland; Forest chips; Forest products; Fuel moisture; Fuel source; Growing demand; Logging residue; Logging residues; Long-distance transport; Procurement costs; Railway transportation; Study areas; Supply chain costs; Transportation distance; Automobiles; Competition; Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Energy efficiency; Fuels; Grinding (comminution); Railroads; Rails; Roadsides; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Truck drivers; Trucks; Wood; Truck transportation; bioenergy; biofuel; cost-benefit analysis; demand-side management; energy efficiency; energy market; energy resource; GIS; logging (timber); railway transport; Accounting; Chips; Competition; Cost Analysis; Finland; Fuels; Logging Residues; Railroads; Sensitivity; Supply Chain Management; Transport; Trucks; Wood; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960369916

This can be done through the integration of pulpwood and energy wood procurement applying a newly-developed supply chain based on whole-tree bundling. In 2007, the first prototype of the bundle harvester capable of incorporating compaction into the cutting phase was launched. Cost savings, especially in primary and secondary transportation, can be achieved by increasing the load sizes by replacing undelimbed whole trees with bundles. The bundles can be hauled by a standard forwarder to the roadside storage area, from where they are transported by a standard timber truck to the pulp mill. Batches of bundles are then fed into a wood flow consisting of conventional delimbed pulpwood. Separation of the bundles into pulpwood and energy wood fractions does not take place until the wood reaches the debarking drum.In this feasibility study, the required productivity level of bundle harvesting (i.e., cutting and bundling) in Scots pine-dominated stands was assessed by comparing the total supply chain costs based on whole-tree bundling with those of the other pulpwood and energy wood supply chains by means of system analysis.

The simulating results show that the long term yearly average space heating efficiency is improved by 26.3% compared to a traditional ground coupled heat pump (GCHP) system because the solar thermal collecting system is used to elevate the thermal energy in the soil and to provide direct space heating with heat storage. At the same time, the underground heat load imbalance problem for a heating load dominated GCHP is solved by soil recharging during non-heating periods, while extra solar energy is utilized to supply DHW.

But for practical feasibility of biodiesel, antioxidants are added to increase the oxidation stability during long term storage. It is quite possible that these additives may affect the clean burning characteristics of biodiesel. This study investigated the experimental effects of antioxidants on the oxidation stability, engine performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristics of a four cylinder turbocharged direct injection (TDI) diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel from croton megalocarpus oil. The three synthetic antioxidants evaluated its effectiveness on oxidation stability of croton oil methyl ester (COME) were 1, 2, 3 tri-hydroxy benzene (Pyrogallol, PY), 3, 4, 5-tri hydroxy benzoic acid (Propyl Gallate, PG) and 2-tert butyl-4-methoxy phenol (Butylated Hydroxyanisole, BHA). The fuel sample tested in TDI diesel engine include pure croton biodiesel (B100), croton biodiesel dosed with 1000 ppm of an effective antioxidant (B100 + PY1000), B20 (20% croton biodiesel and 80% mineral diesel) and diesel fuel which was used as base fuel. The result showed that the effectiveness of the antioxidants was in the order of PY > PG > BHA. The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of biodiesel fuel with antioxidants decreased more than that of biodiesel fuel without antioxidants, but both were higher than that of diesel. Antioxidants had few effects on the exhaust emissions of a diesel engine running on biodiesel. Combustion characteristics in diesel engine were not influenced by the addition of antioxidants in biodiesel fuel. This study recommends PY and PG to be used for safeguarding biodiesel fuel from the effects of autoxidation during storage. Overall, the biodiesel derived from croton megalocarpus oil can be utilized as partial substitute for mineral diesel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The most sophisticated technique to reach this aim has been X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), largely used in synchrotron beam lines. The spatial resolution limit of this technique is of the order of 20-50 nm. This presents a sensible limit for the study of nanostructured devices. This book describes energy loss magnetic chiral dichroism (EMCD), a phenomenon in energy loss spectroscopy discovered in 2006. EMCD is the equivalent of XMCD but is based on fast probe electrons in the electron microscope. A spatial resolution of 2 nm has been demonstrated, and the lattice-resolved mapping of atomic spins appears feasible. EMCD is, thus, a promising technique for magnetic studies on the nanometer and sub-nanometer scale, providing the technical and logistic advantages of electron microscopy, such as in situ chemical and structural information, easy access, and low cost. The first part of the book sets the stage by regarding EMCD in the broader context of anisotropy in electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), by introducing the XMCD technique and by a description of the physics of broken rotational symmetry in EELS. The role of the crystal as an electron interferometer for the setup of chiral electronic transitions is also discussed. In addition to the appearance of retardation effects in EELS, theoretical approaches to X-ray absorption spectroscopy are covered. In the theory section, various methods of the calculation of XMCD and EMCD spectra from first principles are covered, namely the multiplet, density functional (reciprocal space), and multiple scattering (cluster) methods. The experimental part covers a number of EMCD techniques with their particularities, as well as data treatment that is nontrivial in view of low-scattering cross sections. Sum rules for spin and orbital moments, already touched in several chapters, are treated in a separate contribution. The last part of the book focuses on innovative methods in both XMCD and EMCD. X-ray holography will benefit from the high-brightness X-ray sources now under construction. Scanning EMCD promises spin mapping on the atomic level with the generation of electron microscopes now under development. © 2012 by Pan Stanford Publishing Pte. Ltd.

Ensiling methods, adapted from the feed sector, are suitable storage methods to preserve fresh crops throughout the year for, for example, biogas production. Various preservation methods, namely ensiling with and without acid addition for whole crop maize, fibre hemp and faba bean were investigated. For the drier fibre hemp, alkaline urea treatment was studied as well. These treatments were also explored as mild pretreatment methods to improve the disassembly and hydrolysis of these lignocellulosic substrates. Results: The investigated storage treatments increased the availability of the substrates for biogas production from hemp and in most cases from whole maize but not from faba bean. Ensiling of hemp, without or with addition of formic acid, increased methane production by more than 50% compared to fresh hemp. Ensiling resulted in substantially increased methane yields also from maize, and the use of formic acid in ensiling of maize further enhanced methane yields by 16%, as compared with fresh maize. Ensiled faba bean, in contrast, yielded somewhat less methane than the fresh material. Acidic additives preserved and even increased the amount of the valuable water-soluble carbohydrates during storage, which affected most significantly the enzymatic hydrolysis yield of maize. However, preservation without additives decreased the enzymatic hydrolysis yield especially in maize, due to its high content of soluble sugars that were already converted to acids during storage. Urea-based preservation significantly increased the enzymatic hydrolysability of hemp. Hemp, preserved with urea, produced the highest carbohydrate increase of 46% in enzymatic hydrolysis as compared to the fresh material. Alkaline pretreatment conditions of hemp improved also the methane yields. Conclusions: The results of the present work show that ensiling and alkaline preservation of fresh crop materials are useful pretreatment methods for methane production. Improvements in enzymatic hydrolysis were also promising. While all three crops still require a more powerful pretreatment to release the maximum amount of carbohydrates, anaerobic preservation is clearly a suitable storage and pretreatment method prior to production of platform sugars from fresh crops. © 2011 Pakarinen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Acid addition; Acidic additives; Alkaline pretreatment; Bio-based components; Biogas production; Energy crops; Enzymatic conversions; Faba beans; High-content; Lignocellulosic substrates; Methane production; Methane Yield; Pre-Treatment; Pretreatment methods; Soluble sugars; Transport fuel; Urea treatment; Water-soluble carbohydrates; Agricultural wastes; Biogas; Crops; Formic acid; Hemp; Metabolism; Methane; Storage (materials); Substrates; Sugars; Urea; Enzymatic hydrolysis; biofuel; biogas; crop yield; enzyme activity; gas production; hydrolysis; maize; Cannabis sativa; Vicia faba; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960563623

In particular, nanostructured materials can bind H2 with adequate strength required for adsorptive storage. In this Perspective, an analysis of the types of interactions between molecular hydrogen and the host material is performed, supported by illustrative examples from the literature.

The modified derivative method was tested with a few monoenergetic and continuous neutron sources (252Cf and 241Am-Be). It was demonstrated that the analytical method based on the first derivative of pulse height data and the detector response matrix taking into account one collision on hydrogen, can be rather successfully used for evaluation of discrete energy spectra with a few neutron peaks. More complex spectra continuous in energy, such as 252Cf and 241Am-Be obtained by the analytical approach show significant oscillations although with the appropriate smoothing procedure the unfolded results generally follow the trend of the reference data. The more involved method as a reference unfolding method is based on the maximum likelihood expectation- maximization method (MLEM) with one-step-late (OSL) algorithm. The unfolding is performed on pulse height distributions generated with the MCNP-PoliMi numerical code. This code based on the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate each neutron interaction in the scintillaton detector with high accuracy. The results of this study have shown that the more involved unfolding method is superior to the analytical method for both monoenergetic and continuous sources, but it is more time consuming and computationally rather demanding. The analytical approach requires less computer storage space, as well as it is simple to implement and suitable for online applications. The results of the analytical approach show acceptable agreement with the results obtained by the more involved method.","Analytical approach; Deconvolution; Neutron spectrum; Pulse height",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960297319

Cooperation among network nodes is crucial to address these challenging connectivity issues. In order to contribute for a better network performance, network nodes have to share their constrained storage, bandwidth, and energy resources with one another. Each node should contribute to store, carry and forward network data, to mutually enhance the overall network performance. However, nodes may decide to not cooperate, for instance, to save energy resources, or due to selfish or malicious behavior. This severely affects the network functionality. This chapter surveys recent advances related with cooperation on delay tolerant networks. Furthermore, it presents a study that evaluates the impact of cooperative behavior on the performance of a novel DTN-based network architecture for vehicular communications, called vehicular-delay tolerant network (VDTN). It was shown the importance of nodes' cooperation to improve the delivery ratio, corresponding to a better performance of VDTN networks. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Cooperation; Delay-tolerant network; Performance Assessment; Simulation; Vehicular communications; Vehicular delay-tolerant network",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886042846

Charging and discharging processes for the battery including the voltage as a function of specific gravity and time have been carried out. All the results are significantly encouraging and hence test results of our system using the charge controller and DC powered refrigerator are presented.

The dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) configuration was selected. Treatment time was varied, and induced chemical and topographical surface modifications were assessed. Attention was first focused on the effect of the treatment duration on the hydrophilicity and the topography of PLA. Results showed that plasma treatment enhanced the PLA surface hydrophilicity. The overall surface roughness was also found to be increased. Moreover, both properties rose with increasing treatment time. Thus, according to the Wenzel's relation, the surface roughening contributed to the enhancement of the PLA hydrophilicity generated by plasma treatment. Then, the chemical surface changes induced by specific plasma activation were studied. Analyses pointed out the incorporation of hydrophilic groups such as nitrogen functional species after treatment. The stability of this treatment under air was also investigated: measurements showed that the hydrophobic recovery mainly occurred the first hours of storage. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","hydrophilicity; microstructure property relationships; plasma; poly(lactic acid); surface modification; topography","After-treatment; Chemical surfaces; DBD plasma; Dielectric barrier discharges; Hydrophilic groups; Hydrophobic recovery; Interface adhesion; Low surface energy; microstructure property relationships; Nitrogen plasma treatment; Plasma activation; Plasma treatment; Poly(lactic acid); Surface hydrophilicity; Surface-roughening; Treatment duration; Treatment time; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric pressure; Chemical modification; Dielectric devices; Electric discharges; Hydrophilicity; Interfaces (materials); Lactic acid; Plasma applications; Surface chemistry; Surface properties; Surface roughness; Surface treatment; Nitrogen plasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959691678

In the infective juvenile (IJ) phase, the level of such reserves can be influenced by storage, and this may affect their infectivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the percentage of lipids and the associated infectivity in IJs of Steinernema carpocapsae, S. riobrave, Heterorhabditis sp. JPM4, Heterorhabditis sp. CCA and Heterorhabditis sp. PI that had been stored under different temperatures (8-28°C) for various times (0 to 180 days). The amounts of lipids present in IJs were evaluated histologically using a colorimetric method, while infectivity was assayed against Galleria mellonella larvae. Lipid levels diminished with increasing storage time for all nematodes, but the rates of decrease varied according to storage temperature and species. Lipid reserves were conserved for longer storage periods at 8, 16 and 20°C, while at 24 and 28°C the percentage of lipids decreased rapidly. The infectivities of IJs of Heterorhabditis spp. were less tolerant than those of Steinernema spp. to temperatures of 8, 24 and 28°C. Thus, while storage at 8°C was optimal for conserving lipid reserves, infectivity was best preserved at temperatures of 16 and 20°C gave rise to the least reduction in infectivities after 180 days of storage. In this way, lipids and infectivity are influenced by different storage temperatures for the species tested. These data are useful for greater success in using entomopathogenic nematodes as bio control agents.","Biological control; Heterorhabditidae; Infectivity; Steinernematidae","Galleria mellonella; Heterorhabditidae; Heterorhabditis; Heterorhabditis sp.; Nematoda; Steinernema; Steinernema carpocapsae; Steinernema riobrave; Steinernematidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861944313

In the past decade, adipose tissue has been shown to have endocrine functions and the most abundant peptide secreted by adipocytes is adiponectin. Pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) is distributed around coronary arteries and endovascular injury, caused by the presence of intracoronary bare-metal stent (BMS), could promote inflammatory changes in the periadvential fat, contributing to vascular restenosis. Objective: We sought to determine gene expression of inflammatory mediator in pericardial adipose tissue after bare-metal stent implantation and vascular restenosis that had been referred to operative treatment. Methods: Paired samples of PAT were harvested at the time of elective coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) in 11 patients (n=22), one sample was obtained of the tissue around BMS area and another sample around coronary artery without stent. Local expression of adiponectin was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) using Taq DNA polymerase. Results: In two samples, there was no gene expression of adiponectin. We are able to identify adiponectin in 20 samples, however, the pattern of gene expression were heterogeneous.We did not notice specificity when we compared PAT obtained near BMS area or far from BMS area. Conclusion: There were no correlation between adiponectin gene expression and presence of BMS.","Adiponectin; Angioplasty; Coronary restenosis; Percutaneous coronary; Transluminal","adiponectin; autacoid; adipose tissue; article; gene expression; genetics; human; metabolism; pathology; pericardium; restenosis; stent; Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue; Coronary Restenosis; Gene Expression; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Pericardium; Stents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81355154168

Activation energy values between 13 and 15 kcal.mol -1 and Q 10 values between 2.1 and 2.3 were obtained for light strawberry jelly and light guava jelly, respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that, with respect to color changes, every 10 °C temperature increase reduces light jellies shelf-life by half.","Color alterations; Kinetic study; Low-calorie sweets","Fragaria x ananassa; Psidium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80055053553

The EPMS software, metering, monitoring, and control hardware will also provide the needed load profiles, trending, and historical data needed to execute energy management.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961149217

Thus, it is proposed that different subsets of wavelet coefficients of a color image be subjected to different spectral transforms before the resultant coefficients are coded by an efficient wavelet coefficient coding scheme such as that used in JPEG2000 or color set partitioning in hierarchical trees (CSPIHT). A quadtree represents the spatial partitioning of the set of high frequency coefficients of the color planes into spatially oriented subsets which may be further partitioned into smaller directionally oriented subsets. The partitioning decisions and decisions to employ fixed or signal-dependent bases for each subset are rate-distortion (R-D) optimized by employing a known analytical R-D model for these coefficient coding schemes. A compression system of asymmetric complexity, that integrates the proposed adaptive spectral transform with the CSPIHT coefficient coding scheme yields average coding gains of 0.3 dB and 0.9 dB in the Y component at 1.0 b/p and 2.5 b/p, respectively, and 0.9 dB and 1.35 dB in the U and V components at 1.0 b/p and 2.5 b/p, respectively, over a reference compression system that integrates the single spectral transform derived from the entire image with the CSPIHT coefficient coding scheme. © 2011 IEEE.","Adaptive coding; color; image coding; Karhunen-Loeve transform; quadtree; wavelet transform","Adaptive coding; Coding gains; Coding scheme; Color image compression; Color images; Color planes; Compression system; Energy compaction; High frequency; JPEG 2000; Karhunen-Loeve Transform; Quad trees; R-D model; Rate distortions; Set partitioning in hierarchical tree; Spatial partitioning; Spectral characteristics; Spectral transform; Wavelet coefficients; Color; Compaction; Digital image storage; Image coding; Image compression; Principal component analysis; Set theory; Wavelet transforms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960201007

The existing storage of Hydro Electric Power (HEP) is suggested as a possible solution to this issue. The paper contains a detailed analysis of the possible joint operation of Photovoltaic (PV) generator and HEP. The key element of this scenario is the HEP storage that would serve as EES. The analysis of the possible joint operation of the PV generator and HEP shows it as a natural, feasible and very acceptable solution that would enhance the features of both energy sources. Joint operation would increase the energy production sustainability, cut volatility and increase reliability, and therefore the value of the RES energy, as well as the efficiency of the HEP.

The increased demand in energy consumption through the years will require additional energy supply and generation which would subsequently increase carbon emission level. However the carbon emission levels in the environment for a country is subject to the allowable limits based on obligated emission limits. More often the reduction in carbon emission requires strategic planning and heavy investments via development of alternative energy (e.g., renewable energy) or carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiatives. This paper demonstrates the use of targeting technique based on pinch analysis in carbon constrained planning for multi-period scenario in a country. Applying CCS on existing power plants requires comprehensive planning in not only identifying the CCS method to be adopted but also the timing of the modifications. This is to ensure that power plant modifications and retrofitting are inline with the nation's direction in balancing investments with environmental commitments. The timing of the execution can be distributed throughout a given planning horizon.

The analyses were performed immediately after harvesting (without being stored), after two, four and six months of storage. The evaluated properties were: moisture content, gross and net calorific value, ash content and solubility in cold water, hot water and sodium hydroxide. The species composition, storage span, harvesting season and storage season influenced the forest biomass characteristics. In general, eucalyptus presented better results than pine, losing moisture faster, having less alteration in the chemical composition and producing greater energetic gain over storage time. For both species, the ideal storage time was four months. Furthermore, spring and summer were the best harvesting seasons. Thus, if the forest biomass is harvested at the end of winter or beginning of spring with subsequent storage during the summer, this biomass will have the best performance for energy production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass species; Energy production; Harvesting season; Storage season; Storage time","Ash contents; Biomass species; Chemical compositions; Cold waters; Energy generations; Energy productions; Eucalyptus dunnii; Forest biomass; Fuel quality; Hot water; Net calorific value; Pinus taeda; Sodium hydroxides; Species composition; Storage time; Biomass; Energy harvesting; Forestry; Harvesting; Sodium; Water content; Wood fuels; Fuel storage; biomass power; chemical composition; coniferous tree; dicotyledon; energy resource; energy use; fuelwood; harvesting; wood quality; Brazil; Lajes; Santa Catarina; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus dunnii; Pinus taeda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958293919

When burning firewood in domestic stoves, combustion and thus energy efficiency is dependent on the moisture content of the wood. In Denmark, it is generally recommended that moisture content should be no more than 180 g kg-1 total weight. This study aims to assess the effect of species, harvesting time and shelter on the drying of stacked firewood. After felling, the moisture content declined to a relative stable level for all species. The rate of drying depended on the felling time, tree species, and the presence of shelter. The lower asymptotic moisture content depended mainly on the presence of shelter and averaged 188 g kg-1 total weight for frames left in the open and 154 g kg-1 total weight for frames covered by a shelter. It is concluded that Norway spruce felled during the early summer may obtain an acceptable moisture content at the onset of the heating season. Deciduous trees should be felled during the winter or early spring and stored under shelter to be suitable for burning before the heating season.

However, in order to achieve high sugar and ethanol yields, the lignocellulosic material must be pretreated before the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. Dilute acid pretreatment, using SO2, is one of the most promising methods of pretreatment for softwood and agricultural residues. However, handling the high acidity of the slurry obtained from pretreatment and difficulty in recycling/degradation of the impregnating agent are some of the drawbacks of the dilute acid processes. In the present study the influence of utilization of a weak organic acid (lactic acid), as impregnating agent, on the sugar yield from pretreatment, with and without addition of SO2, was investigated. The efficiency of pretreatment was assessed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the slurry obtained by pretreatment, using sugarcane bagasse and spruce, stored for one and two months in the presence of lactic acid separately, as feedstocks. Pretreatment of bagasse after storage with 0.5% lactic acid resulted in an overall glucose yield, i.e. after enzymatic hydrolysis, of 79% of theoretical based on the amount available in the raw material. This was as good as pretreatment using SO2 as impregnating agent. However, storage of spruce with lactic acid before pretreatment, with and without addition of SO2, was not efficient and resulted in lower sugar yields than pretreatment using SO2 only. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioethanol; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Lactic acid; SO2; Steam pretreatment","Alternative energy source; Bio-ethanol production; Dilute acid pretreatment; Dilute acids; Ethanol yield; Glucose yields; Impregnating agents; Lignocellulosic biomass; Lignocellulosic material; Pre-Treatment; SO2; Steam pretreatment; Sugar yield; Sugar-cane bagasse; Weak organic acids; Agricultural wastes; Bagasse; Bioethanol; Body fluids; Ethanol; Fermentation; Glucose; Impregnation; Lactic acid; Organic acids; Raw materials; Sulfur dioxide; Enzymatic hydrolysis; bioenergy; biofuel; biomass power; cellulose; coniferous tree; crop residue; degradation; enzyme activity; ethanol; fermentation; hydrolysis; lignin; organic acid; recycling; sugar; sugar cane; sulfur dioxide; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958151310

MW pump, 300. MW turbine, and a 2. GWh storage utilising price arbitrage on 13 electricity spot markets. The results indicate that almost all (~97%) of the profits can be obtained by a PHES facility when it is optimised using the 24Optimal strategy developed, which optimises the energy storage based on the day-ahead electricity prices. However, to maximise profits with the 24Optimal strategy, the day-ahead electricity prices must be the actual prices which the PHES facility is charged or the PHES operator must have very accurate price predictions. Otherwise, the predicted profit could be significantly reduced and even become a loss. Finally, using the 24Optimal strategy, the PHES profit can surpass the annual investment repayments required. However, over the 5-year period investigated (2005-2009) the annual profit from the PHES facility varied by more than 50% on five out of six electricity markets considered.

The main advantage of thermal heat storage is that the thermal energy is available also during times when there is little or no sun shine. A well insulated heat storage should keep the heat for about 24 h. Many solar heat collection systems are based on transportation of heat from the focal point to the storage by a circulating heat transfer fluid. With a double-reflector arrangement, the storage is heated directly, and no heat transport fluid is needed in this system. NaNO3 and KNO3 in 60:40 percent ratio (mol%) were used as latent heat storage medium. The melting temperature of about 220 °C is quite suitable for cooking and baking purposes. Copper fin was used to increase the heat transfer rate from the heated top plate into the heat storage medium. The experimental results demonstrated that the melting of phase change material occurred within 2-2.5 h and reached the temperature range of 230-260 °C. The latent heat storage unit has been analyzed numerically using a finite element model. Effective heat capacity method was adopted to simulate the phase change process.

The kernels were divided into two categories sizes namely: small size kernel (SSK) and large size kernel (LSK) and the properties investigated were: rupture force, deformation at rupture and energy consumed at rupture. The tests were carried out at a deformation rate of 50 mm/min and four moisture content levels of 25.9%, 11.60%, 6.88%, 4.98% (db) for SSK and 11.19%, 6.21%, 5.78% and 2.77% (db) for LSK.

Sample kernels were compressed along the orthogonal axes corresponding to major axes (length), intermediate axes (width) and minor axes (thickness) of Shea kernel. Some physical characteristics of Shea kernel such as dimensions, geometric mean diameter and mass were also evaluated. Results showed that generally, rupture force, deformation and energy at rupture decreased as moisture content decreased.

Here we aimed to investigate if the amount of sucrose in the background diet influences the ability of n-3 PUFAs to protect against diet-induced obesity, adipose tissue inflammation and glucose intolerance. Methodology/Principal Findings: We fed C57BL/6J mice a protein- (casein) or sucrose-based high fat diet supplemented with fish oil or corn oil for 9 weeks. Irrespective of the fatty acid source, mice fed diets rich in sucrose became obese whereas mice fed high protein diets remained lean. Inclusion of sucrose in the diet also counteracted the well-known anti-inflammatory effect of fish oil in adipose tissue, but did not impair the ability of fish oil to prevent accumulation of fat in the liver. Calculation of HOMA-IR indicated that mice fed high levels of proteins remained insulin sensitive, whereas insulin sensitivity was reduced in the obese mice fed sucrose irrespectively of the fat source. We show that a high fat diet decreased glucose tolerance in the mice independently of both obesity and dietary levels of n-3 PUFAs and sucrose. Of note, increasing the protein:sucrose ratio in high fat diets decreased energy efficiency irrespective of fat source. This was accompanied by increased expression of Ppargc1a (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 alpha) and increased gluconeogenesis in the fed state. Conclusions/Significance: The background diet influence the ability of n-3 PUFAs to protect against development of obesity, glucose intolerance and adipose tissue inflammation. High levels of dietary sucrose counteract the anti-inflammatory effect of fish oil in adipose tissue and increases obesity development in mice. © 2011 Ma et al.",,"adiponectin; casein; CD68 antigen; corn oil; fish oil; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; sucrose; fish oil; sucrose; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; article; controlled study; diet supplementation; diet therapy; food composition; gluconeogenesis; glucose tolerance; insulin sensitivity; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; protein diet; protein expression; adipose tissue; animal; C57BL mouse; calorimetry; chemically induced disorder; drug effect; lipid diet; metabolism; obesity; polymerase chain reaction; Mus; Zea mays; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Calorimetry, Indirect; Diet, High-Fat; Fish Oils; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sucrose",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959589798

Western diet is characterized by an insufficient n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) consumption which is known to promote the pathogenesis of several diseases. We have previously observed that mice fed with a diet poor in n-3 PUFA for two generations exhibit hepatic steatosis together with a decrease in body weight. The gut microbiota contributes to the regulation of host energy metabolism, due to symbiotic relationship with fermentable nutrients provided in the diet. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that perturbations of the gut microbiota contribute to the metabolic alterations occurring in mice fed a diet poor in n-3 PUFA for two generations (n-3/- mice). Methods. C57Bl/6J mice fed with a control or an n-3 PUFA depleted diet for two generations were supplemented with prebiotic (inulin-type Fructooligosaccharides, FOS, 0.20 g/day/mice) during 24 days. Results: n-3/-mice exhibited a marked drop in caecum weight, a decrease in lactobacilli and an increase in bifidobacteria in the caecal content as compared to control mice (n-3/+ mice). Dietary supplementation with FOS for 24 days was sufficient to increase caecal weight and bifidobacteria count in both n-3/+ and n-3/-mice. Moreover, FOS increased lactobacilli content in n-3/-mice, whereas it decreased their level in n-3/+ mice. Interestingly, FOS treatment promoted body weight gain in n-3/-mice by increasing energy efficiency. In addition, FOS treatment decreased fasting glycemia and lowered the higher expression of key factors involved in the fatty acid catabolism observed in the liver of n-3/-mice, without lessening steatosis. Conclusions: the changes in the gut microbiota composition induced by FOS are different depending on the type of diet. We show that FOS may promote lactobacilli and counteract the catabolic status induced by n-3 PUFA depletion in mice, thereby contributing to restore efficient fat storage. © 2011 Pachikian et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","energy efficiency; gut microbiota; n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid; prebiotic","carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; fructose oligosaccharide; glucose; lipid; messenger RNA; omega 3 fatty acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; proglucagon; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial count; Bifidobacteriaceae; caloric intake; catabolism; cecum; controlled study; diet supplementation; dietary intake; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; female; fermentation; food intake; glucose blood level; insulin release; insulin sensitivity; intestine flora; Lactobacillus; lipid storage; liver; mouse; nonhuman; oral glucose tolerance test; Prevotella; protein expression; steatosis; triacylglycerol blood level; weight gain; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959562150

It has been shown that, compared with food-restricted rats refed a high-fat (lard) diet low in PUFA, those refed isoenergetically on diets enriched in LA or ALA, independently of the n-6:n-3 ratio, show improved insulin sensitivity, lower fat mass and higher lean mass, the magnitude of which is related to the proportion of total PUFA precursors (LA+ALA) consumed. These relationships are best fitted by quadratic regression models (r2&gt;0•8, P &lt; 0•001), with threshold values for an impact on body composition corresponding to PUFA precursors contributing 25-30 % of energy intake. Isoenergetic refeeding on high-fat diets enriched in AA or DHA also led to improved body composition, with increases in lean mass as predicted by the quadratic model for PUFA precursors, but decreases in fat mass, which are disproportionately greater than predicted values; insulin sensitivity, however, was not improved. These findings pertaining to the impact of dietary intake of PUFA precursors (LA and ALA) and their elongated-desaturated products (AA and DHA), on body composition and insulin sensitivity, provide important insights into the search for diets aimed at counteracting the pathophysiological consequences of catch-up growth. In particular, diets enriched in essential fatty acids (LA and/or ALA) markedly improve insulin sensitivity and composition of weight regained, independently of the n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio. © 2011 The Authors.","Obesity; Programming and insulin sensitivity; Thermogenesis; Weight regain","arachidonic acid; docosahexaenoic acid; glucose; insulin; linoleic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; safflower oil; animal experiment; article; body composition; controlled study; diet restriction; diet supplementation; fatty acid analysis; hyperinsulinemia; insulin sensitivity; lipid diet; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; obesity; rat; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958766579

In addition, a review of relevant sensors is also included. Examples of existing and future systems are also included. Micro- and nano-vehicles with rotary wings and rechargeable batteries are dominating. The flight times of current systems are typically around 1 hour or less due to the limited energy storage capabilities of the used rechargeable batteries. Fuel cells and ultra capacitors are promising alternative energy supply technologies for the future. Technology improvements, mainly based on micro- and nanotechnologies, are expected to continue in an evolutionary way to improve the capabilities of future micro- and nano air vehicles, giving improved flight times and payload capabilities.

For pure hard disks, the virial coefficients B3-B18 are determined and compared with their pseudo-experimental values. The 2D compressibility factor, Z, of pure hard disks is evaluated from the improved equation of state (IEOS) and compared with Z from Henderson's relation and with simulation data. Similarly, the Z values of mixtures of hard disks with diameter ratios σ2/σ 1 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 and mole fractions x1 = 0.5 and 0.25 were compared with the corresponding simulation data. Fair agreement was found in the case of the pure fluid as well as the studied mixtures. The third and fourth virial coefficients of three types of convex figures - hard ellipses, hard spherocylinders and rectangles - were determined from the IEOS and fair agreement with pseudo-experiment was found. The predictive capability of the considered IEOS was investigated for 2D hard prolate spherocylinders and systems of hard ellipses with three values of the aspect ratio, k = a/b, k = 2, 4 and 6 (where a and b denote the semi-axes of an ellipse). The compressibility factor of the 2D spherocylinders compared well with the MC data; in the case of hard ellipses, the description is fair for the isotropic phase. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.","2D hard spherocylinder; compressibility factor; disk; ellipse; equation of state; Helmholtz energy; non-circular parameter; surface density; virial coefficient","compressibility factor; disk; ellipse; Equation of state; Helmholtz energy; Non-circular; Spherocylinders; surface density; Virial coefficient; Aspect ratio; Compressibility; Geometry; Hard disk storage; Equations of state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958861496

In a conventional IGCC design for power generation without carbon capture, the syngas is purified for dust and hydrogen sulphide removal and then sent to a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) for power production. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are expected to play a significant role in the coming decades for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. IGCC is one of the power generation technologies having the highest potential to capture carbon dioxide with low penalties in term of plant energy efficiency, capital and operational costs. This paper investigates the most important techno-economical and environmental indicators (e.g. net and gross power output, ancillary power consumption, plant efficiency, specific capital cost investment, operational costs, specific carbon dioxide emissions etc.) for power generation with CCS applied to an IGCC scheme. The coal-based IGCC case study investigated in the paper produces around 400 MW net electricity with 90 % carbon capture rate.

Coal utilization for generating energy is regarded with concern because of the higher amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions can be considerably reduced by combining Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) with Carbon Capture and storage, having near-zero CO2 emission. The base design of this plant is an entrained-flow gasifier with water quench (Siemens), water-gas shift conversion of CO, a modified Acid Gas Removal (AGR) system using Selexol which captures in addition to hydrogen sulphide also carbon dioxide, Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) for the purification of hydrogen and a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) based on Mitsubishi gas turbine (M701G2), running on hydrogen-rich gas.

Characteristics such as low effective concentrations, broad applicability and neutral favour impact make this compound an ideal preservative. Although widely used in the global food industry, natamycin is forbidden in wine in the European Union (EU). It is a permitted wine additive in South Africa, although export wines must comply with EU standards. Germany in particular implemented strict measures to prevent wines containing natamycin from entering their market. Sensitive analytical methodologies with the capacity to regulate this segment of the wine export industry are therefore required. Here we report on the development of a simple, robust and fast liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS/MS) method for the determination of natamycin in wine. Sample cleanup involves dilution followed by direct elution of natamycin from aminopropyl SPE cartridges. Recoveries are better than 80% relative standard deviation (RSD < 10%), while the limit of detection (LOD) of the method is 0.0003 mg/L, which renders it compliant with EU standards. The method also yields qualitative information for positive compound identifcation. The degradation of natamycin in wine was also studied and kinetic parameters are reported in this matrix for the frst time. The activation energy for the decomposition reaction is ~80 kJ/mol and the half-life under normal wine storage conditions is in the order of 20 days. As in the wine matrix, natamycin in aqueous calibration standards are labile, necessitating regular preparation and cold storage of standard solutions to ensure accurate quantitation.","Electrospray tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS); Natamycin; Solid phase extraction (SPE); Ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC); Wine",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958776675

The explosion may occur in ammunition storage or result from a terrorist action or from a warhead that had penetrated into this room. The study includes numerical simulations of the problem and analytical derivations. Different types of analysis (1-D, 2-D and 3-D analysis) were performed for a room with rigid walls and the results were analyzed. For the 3D problem the effect of the charge size and its location within the room was investigated and a new insight regarding the pressure distribution on the interior wall as function of these parameters has been gained. The numerical analyses were carried out using the Eulerian multi-material approach. Further, an approximate analytical formula to predict the residual internal pressure was developed. The formula is based on the conservation law of total energy and its implementation yields very good agreement with the results obtained numerically using the complete statement of the problem for a wide range of explosive weights and room sizes that is expressed through a non-dimensional parameter. This new formula is superior to existing literature recommendations and compares considerably better with the above numerical results.","Confined explosion; Peak pressure; Residual pressure; Shock wave; Wave reflection","Laws and legislation; Shock waves; Ammunition storage; Approximate analytical; Confined explosions; Non-dimensional parameters; Numerical results; Peak pressure; Residual pressures; Wave reflections; Explosions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957849703

The tool is based on the consumers deriving benefit from energy services and not on electric energy. It maximizes consumer net benefit by scheduling the operation of DER. The robust schedule is derived using a stochastic programming approach formulated for the DER scheduler: the objective function describing the consumer net benefit is maximized over a set of scenarios that model the range of uncertainty. The optimal scenario set is derived using heuristic scenario reduction techniques. Robust operational schedules are formulated for a 'smart' home case study with four controllable DER under stochastic energy service demand, availability of storage DER, and status of dynamic peak pricing. The robust schedule results in a lower expected cost but at the expense of long computation times. The computation period however is not much of a disadvantage because schedules are computed off-line. The consumer can prepare several DER schedules and simply choose the one to implement according to their perception of the coming day. The robust schedules are formulated using an improved version of co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization. © 2011 IEEE.","'smart' home; distributed energy resources; Energy services; particle swarm optimization; robust scheduling; scenario reduction; scenario trees","'smart' home; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy services; Robust scheduling; scenario reduction; scenario trees; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Innovation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Scheduling; Smart power grids; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958015732

Some application areas for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are home automations, health care services, military domain, and environment monitoring. The required constraints are limited capacity of processing, limited storage capability, and especially these nodes are limited in energy. In addition, such networks are tiny battery powered which their lifetime is very limited. During image processing and transmission to the destination, the lifetime of sensor network is decreased quickly due to battery and processing power constraints. Therefore, digital image transmissions are a significant challenge for image sensor based Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Based on a wavelet image compression, we propose a novel, robust and energy-efficient scheme, called Priority Image Transmission (PIT) in WSN by providing various priority levels during image transmissions. Different priorities in the compressed image are considered. The information for the significant wavelet coefficients are transmitted with higher quality assurance, whereas relatively less important coefficients are transmitted with lower overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme prolongs the system lifetime and achieves higher energy efficiency in WSN with an acceptable compromise on the image quality. © 2011 IEEE.","Discrete Wavelet Transform; Energy optimization; Priority Image Transmission; Wireless Sensor Network","Application area; Autonomous networks; Battery powered; Compressed images; Digital image transmission; Emerging technologies; Energy efficient; Energy optimization; Environment monitoring; Healthcare services; Home automation; Image transmission; Important coefficients; Limited capacity; Limited storage; Military domains; Priority Image Transmission; Priority levels; Processing power; Simulation result; Wavelet coefficients; Wireless communications; Digital image storage; Discrete wavelet transforms; Energy efficiency; Health care; Image communication systems; Image compression; Image quality; Imaging systems; Quality assurance; Sensors; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957893088

The dietary importance of maize in Katumba ward was investigated through studying the importance of maize as a source of food, nutrients and energy in using secondary data and face to face structured and semi- structured interviews that were administered using a questionnaire to 260 farm households that were randomly selected for the study. The aim of the study was to provide empirical data that show how maize contributes to household food security in Katumba ward. In turn, the data can be used to advocate for agricultural policy that promotes maize quality through using efficient storage methods in the ward and other places that have the same climatic conditions as Katumba ward. It was found that farm households in Katumba ward prefer maize meals, and that they may be able to obtain 66.8 to 69.5% of the total energy and 83 to 90% of the total protein required per day through maize meals consumption. Therefore it was concluded that maize is a very important food crop in Katumba ward, and it was recommended that storage mechanisms in this ward be given adequate attention in order to maximize the quality of stored maize for the enhancement of healthy diets and food security of the consumers. © 2011 Academic Journals.","Food security; Katumba ward; Maize","Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052862351

Design: Longitudinal study with repeated annual measurements. Setting: Dunedin, New Zealand. Participants: 244 children recruited from a birth cohort and followed from age 3 to 7. Main outcome measures: Body mass index (BMI), fat mass (kg), and fat free mass (kg) measured with bioelectrical impedance; dual energy x ray absorptiometry; physical activity and sleep duration measured with accelerometry; dietary intake (fruit and vegetables, non-core foods), television viewing, and family factors (maternal BMI and education, birth weight, smoking during pregnancy) measured with questionnaire. Results: After adjustment for multiple confounders, each additional hour of sleep at ages 3-5 was associated with a reduction in BMI of 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.96) and a reduced risk of being overweight (BMI ≥85th centile) of 0.39 (0.24 to 0.63) at age 7. Further adjustment for BMI at age 3 strengthened these relations. These differences in BMI were explained by differences in fat mass index (-0.43, -0.82 to -0.03) more than by differences in fat free mass index (-0.21, -0.41 to -0.00). Conclusions: Young children who do not get enough sleep are at increased risk of becoming overweight, even after adjustment for initial weight status and multiple confounding factors. This weight gain is a result of increased fat deposition in both sexes rather than additional accumulation of fat free mass.",,"accelerometry; article; body composition; body fat; body mass; child; dietary intake; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; human; impedance; lipid storage; longitudinal study; male; New Zealand; obesity; physical activity; preschool child; priority journal; questionnaire; risk reduction; school child; sleep quality; sleep time; weight gain; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; female; obesity; sleep; Adiposity; Body Mass Index; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; New Zealand; Sleep",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957951981

The results of this investigation showed that storing bamboo pulp fibres, whilst under agitation, had a negative impact on pulp properties like tensile index, curl, TEA and tensile stiffness. The apparent density of the sheets decreased slightly with agitated storage, whereas the relationship between density and tensile index was not affected. The decrease in strength properties after storage with agitation was most probably due to the increase in the number of kinks per mm fibre, the decrease in fibre length and the decrease in shape factor. The effect of non-agitated storage on the pulp and fibre quality was shown to be negligible. It should be observed that the loss in pulp strength, caused by agitated storage, requires extra beating energy input on the pulp prior to papermaking, if the initial tensile index level is to be maintained.","Agitation; Bamboo; Kinks; Pulp and fibre properties; Refining; Shape factor; Storage","Agitation; Apparent density; Fibre properties; Kinks; Pulp properties; Shape factor; Strength property; Tensile stiffness; Bamboo; Energy storage; Kraft pulp; Pulp beating; Refining; Tensile strength; Textile fibers; Pulp refining; Agitation; Bamboo; Kraft Pulps; Refining; Storage; Tensile Strength; Textile Fibers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880139525

A complete solar heating system was utilized for heating the cucumber greenhouses located in the eastern area of the coastal delta, Egypt. Temperatures of inside and outside air, water in the storage tank, pipe surface of heat exchanger, floor surface (concrete), and air relative humidity were measured and recorded on a data-logger to analyze their correlation with the cucumber crop yield response. A mathematical model was developed to simulate microclimatic conditions for the cucumber greenhouse. The data showed that the daily average solar energy available was 13.345 kWh of which 7.138 kWh was stored in the storage tank of each solar energy system. There were daily variations during the experimental period that depended upon the water temperature in the storage tank at the beginning of each day, the ambient air temperature, the rate of heat energy consumed at night to provide and maintain the air temperature within the greenhouses at the desired level, and the growth stage of the cucumber crop. The daily average heat energy consumed at night for heating the two greenhouses was 10.070 and 12.391 kWh and the polyethylene greenhouse consumed heat energy greater than the fiberglass greenhouse by 23.05 %. The heat energy consumed resulted in an increase of the inside air temperatures above the outside (12.6 °C) by 4.5 °C and 3.4 °C for fiberglass and polyethylene greenhouses, respectively. Under these conditions, the fiberglass and polyethylene covers provided, respectively, a heating effect of 4.5 °C and 3.4 °C. The nightly average air relative humidity inside and outside the two greenhouses was 56.5 %, 60.8 % and 54.4 %, respectively. The proportions of heat energy provided by utilizing the solar energy system for the two greenhouses, respectively, were 65.95 % and 55.68 %. Due to the optimal level of microclimatic conditions of the two greenhouses, they produced a fresh cucumber yield of 6.825 and 5.245 kg/m 2, respectively. Thus, the fiberglass greenhouse increased the fresh yield of cucumbers by 30.12 % as compared with the polyethylene greenhouse.",,"Air temperature; Ambient air temperature; Coastal deltas; Crop yield; Datalogger; Eastern area; Floor surface; Greenhouse cucumbers; Growth stages; Heat energy; Heating effect; Microclimatic conditions; Optimal level; Pipe surfaces; Solar energy systems; Solar heating system; Storage tank; Water temperatures; Winter seasons; Atmospheric temperature; Crops; Glass fibers; Greenhouses; Heating; Mathematical models; Optimization; Polyethylenes; Solar concentrators; Solar heating; Solar radiation; Storage (materials); Tanks (containers); Thermoplastics; Solar energy; Cucumis sativus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054888211

A recent addition to the autopsy work flow is the possibility of conducting postmortem imaging, in its 3D version also called virtual autopsy (VA), using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) or magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) data from scans of cadavers displayed with direct volume rendering (DVR) 3D techniques. The use of the data and their workflow are presented. Data acquisition was performed and high quality data-sets with submillimeter precision were acquired. New data acquisition techniques such as dualenergy CT (DECT) and quantitative MRI, then were implemented and provided additional information. Particular findings hardly visualized in conventional autopsy can rather easy be seen at the full body CT, such as air distribution, e.g. pneumothorax, pneumopericardium, air embolism, and wound channels. MRI shows natural deaths such as myocardial infarctions. Interactive visualization of these 3D data-sets can provide valuable insight into the corpses and enables non-invasive diagnostic procedures. In postmortem CT imaging, not being limited by a patient depending radiation dose limit the data-sets can, however, be generated with such a high resolution that they become difficult to handle in today's archive retrieval and interactive visualization systems, specifically in the case of full body scans. To take full advantage of these new technologies the postmortem workflow needs to be tailored to the demands and opportunities that the new technologies allow.","Adults and pediatrics; Computer applications - virtual imaging; CT high resolution; Forensics; MR imaging; Technical aspects","Air distribution; Data sets; Direct volume rendering; Dual-energy CT; Forensics; Full body; High quality; High resolution; Image interpretation; Interactive visualization systems; Interactive visualizations; MR imaging; Multidetector computed tomography; Myocardial Infarction; Natural death; Non-invasive diagnostics; Postmortem CT; Radiation dose; Submillimeter precision; Technical aspects; Virtual autopsy; Work-flows; Computer applications; Data acquisition; Data visualization; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Search engines; Three dimensional; Tomography; Visualization; Volume rendering; Computerized tomography; algorithm; article; autopsy; cadaver; cause of death; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted tomography; computer graphics; computer interface; human; information retrieval; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; whole body imaging; Algorithms; Autopsy; Cadaver; Cause of Death; Computer Graphics; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Postmortem Changes; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; User-Computer Interface; Whole Body Imaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051570415

The decisive factor for the determination of the life cycle costs of compressed-air filters is the indirect energy consumption that is due to the differential pressure. The differential pressure is reduced by up to 50% during operation with working pressure compared to customary filters when using compressed-air filters, type Ultra-Filter DF. The energy costs savings will be achieved by the timely replacement of the used filter element.

At the same time, the involvement of politics and ideology testifies to the high importance of water-related issues internationally, and reflects the intensifying unresolved problems related to water, food and energy adequacy, as well as protection from floods and droughts. In an attempt to separate, as much as possible, the essence of problems from the political and ideological influences, several facts and fallacies about water and interrelated issues are discussed, based on data (numbers) rather than on dominant ideological views. The domain of the discussion is generally the entire globe, but, as a particular case, Greece, whose water resources are only partly developed, is discussed in more detail. From a pragmatic point of view, the water infrastructure in developed countries appears to be irreplaceable, although its management is adaptable toward more environmentally-friendly operation. For developing countries, no alternative to large-scale water resources development by engineering means appears plausible. The recent pursuit of renewable energy makes imperative the utilization of the existing and, where possible, the building of new, large hydropower plants, as only these can provide efficient energy storage, which is necessary for the renewable energy provided by nature in highly varying patterns. © 2011 IAHS Press.","Dams; Energy storage; Hydropower; Renewable energy; Reservoirs; Scale of development; Water needs; Water resources","Developed countries; Echelle; Energy adequacy; Energy supplies; Environmentally-friendly; Hydropower; Hydropower plants; Natural hazard; Renewable energies; Scale of development; Water infrastructure; Water needs; Water resources development; Developing countries; Energy storage; Flywheels; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Reservoirs (water); Water resources exploration; Water supply; Water resources; dam; developing world; energy resource; governance approach; hydroelectric power; hydroelectric power plant; infrastructural development; renewable resource; reservoir; resource development; sustainable development; water resource; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960343077

The construction of this double electrostatic ion ring experiment uniquely allows for studies of interactions between cations and anions at low and well-defined internal temperatures and centre-of-mass collision energies down to about 10 K and 10 meV, respectively. Position sensitive multi-hit detector systems have been extensively tested and proven to work in cryogenic environments and these will be used to measure correlations between reaction products in, for example, electron-transfer processes. The technical advantages of using purely electrostatic ion storage devices over magnetic ones are many, but the most relevant are: electrostatic elements which are more compact and easier to construct; remanent fields, hysteresis, and eddy-currents, which are of concern in magnetic devices, are no longer relevant; and electrical fields required to control the orbit of the ions are not only much easier to create and control than the corresponding magnetic fields, they also set no upper mass limit on the ions that can be stored. These technical differences are a boon to new areas of fundamental experimental research, not only in atomic and molecular physics but also in the boundaries of these fields with chemistry and biology. For examples, studies of interactions with internally cold molecular ions will be particular useful for applications in astrophysics, while studies of solvated ionic clusters will be of relevance to aeronomy and biology. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.",,"Atomic and molecular physics; Centre of mass; Collision energies; Cryogenic conditions; Cryogenic environment; Detector systems; Electrical field; Electron transfer process; Experimental research; Extreme high vacuum; Internal temperature; Ion storage; Ionic clusters; Molecular ions; Multi-hit; Opposite charge; Position sensitive; Stockholm University; Astrophysics; Atomic physics; Cryogenics; Eddy currents; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatics; Ion beams; Ions; Magnetic fields; Magnetic storage; Virtual storage; Experiments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960176948

The objective of this article was to show experimentally and through computer simulation using SUNREL that phase change material impregnated in building materials can provide thermal energy storage benefits.

A two-year research was conducted during two periods: just after harvesting (2007, 2008) and after six months of storage (2008, 2009). The following cooking methods were used: shallow frying (150 ± 5°C); deep-fat frying (180 ± 5°C) and roasting (210 ± 5°C). The weight of the potatoes was recorded before and after frying along with the time and temperature during frying. Chemical analyses were performed to determine the content of reducing sugars, starch, fructose, glucose, sucrose, fibre, fat, protein, moisture, vitamin C and amino acids. The content of the analyzed nutrients differed significantly between both potato varieties and applied cooking methods: differences between potato varieties and cooking methods were found for vitamin C, moisture, reducing sugars, fructose, glucose, sucrose, amino acids, essential amino acids, and energy content, whereas significant differences in starch, fibre, fat and protein content were found between cooking methods. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Deep-fat frying; Energy content; Food composition; Macronutrients; Micronutrients; Nutritional composition; Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.); Roasting; Shallow or pan frying; Storage; Weight loss","Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958270204

The structure of active and reactive power controllers of SMES is the practical first-order lead/lag compensator. To handle system uncertainties such as various generating and loading conditions, unpredictable network structures etc., the multiplicative uncertainty model is embedded in the system modeling. As a result, the optimization problem of SMES coil size and controller parameters based on the enhancement of system damping and robust stability margin against system uncertainties can be formulated.

The special design of the machine itself aimed to decrease the no-load losses so that they become equal or less than the lossesof the superconducting bearing itself. To achieve this, no-load losses had to be decreased by several orders of magnitude compared to the similar losses of ordinary machines. Hence, we applied a special double-rotor, ironless stator construction, with copper windings made of Litz wire. The machine is equipped with its own axial flux superconducting bearing consisting of several permanent magnet rings within each other. The compact rotor of the machine and the bearing itself represents a stored energy of 50 kJ, so it could be tested without additional flywheel parts in a vacuum chamber. In this paper we introduce spin-down test results of the above machine at different vacuum levels.

The aim of this study was to model how the moisture content and dry matter losses of logging residues develop during storage. Logging residues were collected from five different stands of spruce and pine during different seasons of the year and stored in the same location. The logging residues were stored in covered piles of bundled residues and loose residues. Only minor differences were found in the moisture content profiles between piles of bundles and loose residues. Logging residues located in the centre of both types of piles had considerably lower moisture content than the outer parts. The moisture content significantly affected dry matter loss, with the highest dry matter losses being found in the samples with the least favourable drying conditions. The dry matter losses varied between 1 and 3% per month. Significantly higher dry matter losses were found in the spruce bundles than in the pine bundles. Seasoned logging residues had the lowest dry matter loss, while the logging residues harvested and piled in the autumn had the highest loss. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Dry matter loss; Forest energy; Logging residues; Moisture content; Statistical modelling; Storage","Dry matter loss; Forest energy; Logging residues; Moisture content; Statistical modelling; Storage; Fuel storage; Moisture determination; Piles; Moisture; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957858652

The proposed hybrid grid can operate in a grid-tied or autonomous mode. The coordination control algorithms are proposed for smooth power transfer between ac and dc links and for stable system operation under various generation and load conditions. Uncertainty and intermittent characteristics of wind speed, solar irradiation level, ambient temperature, and load are also considered in system control and operation.

In potato, which is the most widely studied tuber crop, there is ample evidence suggesting that metabolism and regulatory processes in leaf may have an impact on tuber formation. To search for leaf proteins putatively involved in regulating tuber generation and/or development in cassava, comparative proteomic approaches have been applied to monitor differentially expressed leaf proteins during root transition from fibrous to tuberous. Stringent cross comparison and statistical analysis between two groups with different plant ages using Student's t test with 95% significance level revealed a number of protein spots whose abundance were significantly altered (P < 0.05) during week 4 to week 8 of growth. Of these, 39 spots were successfully identified by ion trap LC-MS/MS. The proteins span various functional categories from antioxidant and defense, carbohydrate metabolism, cyanogenesis, energy metabolism, miscellaneous and unknown proteins. Results suggested possible metabolic switches in the leaf that may trigger/regulate storage root initiation and growth.

One of the two inverters in the dual inverter is connected to the rectified output of the wind generator while the other is directly connected to a battery energy storage system (BESS). This approach eliminates the need for an additional dcdc converter and thus reduces power losses, cost, and complexity. The main issue with this scheme is uncorrelated dynamic changes in dc-link voltages that results in unevenly distributed space vectors. A detailed analysis on the effects of these variations is presented in this paper. Furthermore, a modified modulation technique is proposed to produce undistorted currents even in the presence of unevenly distributed and dynamically changing space vectors. An analysis on the battery charging/discharging process and maximum power point tracking of the wind turbine generator is also presented.

This trend is mainly supported by the rising integration of large-scale renewable energy power plants into the high-power utility system and by major features of SMES units. In a SMES system, the power conditioning system (PCS) is the crucial component for controlling the power exchange between the superconducting coil and the ac system. The dynamics of the PCS directly influences the validity of the SMES in the dynamic control of the power system. This paper describes a novel PCS scheme of SMES to simultaneously perform both active and reactive power flow controls. Moreover, a detailed model of the SMES unit is derived and a three-level control scheme is designed, comprising a full decoupled current control strategy in the dq reference frame with a novel controller to prevent PCS dc bus capacitors voltage drift/imbalance.

Concurrently, large blooms of filamentous cyanobacteria have increased in the Baltic Proper and in coastal waters. This study examined whether extended exposure to toxic and non-toxic filamentous cyanobacterium Nodularia affect YOY perch growth and feeding behavior under simulated bloom conditions (30 days at 50 μg Chl a L-1). Specific growth rate (SGR), the somatic condition index (SCI) and the lipid content of YOY perch (10-12 weeks old) were significantly lower in perch exposed to Nodularia compared to fed controls (no Nodularia). YOY perch exposed to non-toxic Nodularia displayed a higher attack rate than perch living in Nodularia free controls in 2 out of 3 trials.

Bioenergy production based on resources from agriculture and forestry is an important option for attaining these targets. To increase the share of bioenergy in the energy supply, supporting policy instruments are necessary. The cost-effectiveness of these instruments in attaining policy targets depends on the availability of bioenergy technologies. Advanced technologies such as second-generation biofuels, biomass gasification for power production, and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) will likely change the performance of policy instruments. This article assesses the cost-effectiveness of energy policy instruments, considering new bioenergy technologies for the year 2030, with respect to greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction and fossil fuel substitution. Instruments that directly subsidize bioenergy are compared with instruments that aim at reducing GHG emissions. A spatially explicit modeling approach is used to account for biomass supply and energy distribution costs in Austria. Results indicate that a carbon tax performs cost-effectively with respect to both policy targets if BECCS is not available. However, the availability of BECCS creates a trade-off between GHG emission reduction and fossil fuel substitution.

Phase solubility studies were performed and thermodynamic parameters involved in the complex formation were calculated. The solubility of Terp increased linearly as the concentration of BCD was increased, confirming the 1:1 stoichiometry of the complex. The stability constants decreased along with increasing temperature. The negative value of the enthalpy and of the Gibbs free energy demonstrated that the process is exothermic and spontaneous. Since complexation gives more ordered systems, the negative value obtained for the entropy change evidenced the encapsulation of Terp. Terp was completely encapsulated in BCD at the preparation conditions and studied molar ratios, as confirmed in the freeze-dried samples by differential scanning calorimeter. The presence of Terp greatly modified the BCD water sorption curves, and the amount of adsorbed water was lower for the complexes. The limited water solubility of Terp could be overcome by the formation of BCD inclusion complexes, and the complexes were stable at different storage conditions (relative humidities 11-97% and 25 °C). The obtained phase solubility data are useful for food or pharmaceutical products formulation involving cyclodextrins and stability predictions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Beta-cyclodextrin; Freeze-dried complexes; Phase solubility studies; Stability constant; Terpineol","Beta-cyclodextrin; Freeze-dried complexes; Phase solubility studies; Stability constant; Terpineol; Atmospheric humidity; Cyclodextrins; Differential scanning calorimetry; Drug products; Silanes; Sorption; Stability; Stoichiometry; Solubility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955467033

The waste can overwhelm existing solid waste management facilities and impact on other emergency response and recovery activities. If poorly managed, the waste can have significant environmental and public health impacts and can affect the overall recovery process. This paper presents a system overview of disaster waste management based on existing literature. The main literature available to date comprises disaster waste management plans or guidelines and isolated case studies. There is ample discussion on technical management options such as temporary storage sites, recycling, disposal, etc.; however, there is little or no guidance on how these various management options are selected post-disaster. The literature does not specifically address the impact or appropriateness of existing legislation, organisational structures and funding mechanisms on disaster waste management programmes, nor does it satisfactorily cover the social impact of disaster waste management programmes. It is envisaged that the discussion presented in this paper, and the literature gaps identified, will form a basis for future comprehensive and cohesive research on disaster waste management. In turn, research will lead to better preparedness and response to disaster waste management problems. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Emergency response; Funding mechanisms; Management options; Management problems; Organisational structure; Preparedness and response; Public health; Recovery process; Social impact; Solid waste management facilities; Technical management; Temporary storage sites; Waste management plan; Debris; Research; Waste management; disaster management; guideline; health impact; legislation; planning system; social impact; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; cleaning; community; construction work; decision support system; developed country; developing country; disaster; disaster debris; disaster planning; earthquake; economic aspect; emergency; employment; energy resource; environmental impact; environmental planning; environmental reclamation; funding; hazard assessment; hazardous waste; health hazard; hurricane; landfill; legal aspect; manual labor; municipal solid waste; natural disaster; organization and management; prescribed burning; priority journal; public health; recycling; review; social aspect; solid waste; solid waste management; United Nations; urban area; waste management; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Disasters; Environment; Organization and Administration; Planning Techniques; Public Health; Recycling; Socioeconomic Factors; Waste Management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954648695

However, for MX systems, good correlations between the chemical bond overlap polarizabilities and macroscopic properties such as molar polarizabilities and energy band gaps were established.

Findings derived from applied microwave power, long term storage investigation, and high and low temperature studies indicate that two radicals were formed after the irradiations. The spectroscopic parameters of these radicals were determined through spectrum simulation calculations. The dosimetric potential of NaEDTA was also investigated and it was concluded that NaEDTA does not present the characteristics of a good dosimetric material, but that ESR spectroscopy could be used in the discrimination of irradiated NaEDTA from the unirradiated one even long after irradiation.

However, it is anticipated that these sources of energy will deplete within the next 40-50 years. Moreover, the expected environmental damages such as the global warming, acid rain and urban smog due to the production of emissions from these sources have tempted the world to try to reduce carbon emissions by 80% and shift towards utilizing a variety of renewable energy resources (RES) which are less environmentally harmful such as solar, wind, biomass etc. in a sustainable way. Biomass is one of the earliest sources of energy with very specific properties. In this review, several aspects which are associated with burning biomass in boilers have been investigated such as composition of biomass, estimating the higher heating value of biomass, comparison between biomass and other fuels, combustion of biomass, co-firing of biomass and coal, impacts of biomass, economic and social analysis of biomass, transportation of biomass, densification of biomass, problems of biomass and future of biomass. It has been found that utilizing biomass in boilers offers many economical, social and environmental benefits such as financial net saving, conservation of fossil fuel resources, job opportunities creation and CO 2 and NOx emissions reduction. However, care should be taken to other environmental impacts of biomass such as land and water resources, soil erosion, loss of biodiversity and deforestation. Fouling, marketing, low heating value, storage and collections and handling are all associated problems when burning biomass in boilers. The future of biomass in boilers depends upon the development of the markets for fossil fuels and on policy decisions regarding the biomass market. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, this subsector releases CO2 emissions to the atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels to produce energy needed for the cement manufacturing process. The cement industry contributes about 7% of the total worldwide CO2 emissions. This study complied a comprehensive literature in terms of Thesis (MS and PhD), peer reviewed journals papers, conference proceedings, books, reports, websites for emission generation and mitigation technique. Emission released associated with the burning of fuels have been presented in this paper. Different sources of emissions in a cement industry has been identified and presented in this study. Different techniques to reduce CO2 emissions from the cement manufacturing industries are reviewed and presented in this paper. The major techniques are: capture and storage CO2 emissions, reducing clinker/cement ratio by replacing clinker with different of additives and using alternative fuels instead of fossil fuels. Apart from these techniques, various energy savings measures in cement industries expected to reduce indirect emissions released to the atmosphere. Based on review results it was found that sizeable amount of emission can be mitigated using different techniques and energy savings measures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed high resistant starch content, which was reduced by ultrasound treatment and also by spray drying. Both techniques increased the solubility, swelling power and water absorption capacity. The gels exhibited non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior, since flow behavior index was less than one (n < 1). Ultrasound wave propagation reduced yield stress and consistency coefficient in starch gels. Under oscillatory shear, all gels exhibited solid-like viscoelastic behavior, storage modulus was higher than loss modulus to entire frequency range (G′ > G′′), which was confirmed by the Cox-Merz experiment that showed that the complex dynamic viscosity was greater than the apparent viscosity in all samples.

The charge and discharge modes of the device are performed within maximum power conditions, so that an intermittent time-modulated operation with adjustable speed of the rotor pneumatic motor is required.

First, tradeoffs of employing high energy versus high power battery are revealed. Then, different topologies of batteryultracapacitor hybrids are discussed, highlighting pros and cons of each configuration. The superiority of fully active hybrids is indicated, obtained at the expense of increase of power electronic circuitry, control effort, and efficiency. The second part of the paper focuses on two types of range extenders: renewable energy and fuel-based units. The operation strategy is shown to be different for each range extender type. The renewable-energy-based range extender should be operated employing either passive or active maximum power point tracking strategy and hence not be involved in the powertrain energy balancing. It is shown that such a strategy allows the rest of system to perceive the renewable energy range extender (RERE) as a part of the load and act accordingly. Solar array is given as an example of a RERE and the possible connection topologies are discussed. On the other hand, the fuel-based range extender (FBRE) should be operated near the lowest specific fuel consumption point employing maximum efficiency point tracking strategy.

This can lead to severe problems, such as system frequency oscillations, and/or violations of power lines capability. With the proper control, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) is able to significantly enhance the dynamic security of the PS. In an SMES system, the power conditioning system (PCS) is the crucial component that directly influences the validity of the SMES in the dynamic control of the PS.

Moreover, a detailed model of the SMES unit is derived and a novel three-level control scheme is designed, comprising a full decoupled current control strategy in the d-q reference frame and an enhanced PS frequency controller.

Usage of energy storage becomes mandatory when such microgrids are used to supply quality power to the loads. Microgrids have two modes of operation, namely, grid-connected and islanding modes. During islanding mode, the main responsibility of the storage is to perform energy balance. During grid-connected mode, the goal is to prevent propagation of the renewable source intermittency and load fluctuations to the grid. Energy storage of a single type cannot perform all these jobs efficiently in a renewable powered microgrid. The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like photovoltaic (PV) demands usage of storage with high energy density. At the same time, quick fluctuation of load demands storage with high power density. This paper proposes a composite energy storage system (CESS) that contains both high energy density storage battery and high power density storage ultracapacitor to meet the aforementioned requirements.

The mechanism of hydrogen absorption has been described. It was noticed that palladium catalyses hydrogen absorption by dissociating the adsorbed H2 molecules into H atoms more rapidly on its own atoms than on cobalt ones.

However, the ability to achieve such hierarchical architectures on a multiple scale still has remained a great challenge. In this paper, we report a scalable self-assembly strategy to create bioinspired hierarchical structures composed of functionalized graphene sheets to work as anodes of lithium-ion batteries. The resulting electrodes with novel multilevel architectures simultaneously optimize ion transport and capacity, leading to a high performance of reversible capacity of up to 1600 mAh/g, and 1150 mAh/g after 50 cycles.

Objectives: The design, synthesis and experimental testing of new safe and effective small molecule direct thrombin inhibitors for intravenous administration. Methods: Computer-aided molecular design of new thrombin inhibitors was performed using our original docking program SOL, which is based on the genetic algorithm of global energy minimization in the framework of a Merck Molecular Force Field. This program takes into account the effects of solvent. The designed molecules with the best scoring functions (calculated binding energies) were synthesized and their thrombin inhibitory activity evaluated experimentally in vitro using a chromogenic substrate in a buffer system and using a thrombin generation test in isolated plasma and in vivo using the newly developed model of hemodilution-induced hypercoagulation in rats. The acute toxicities of the most promising new thrombin inhibitors were evaluated in mice, and their stabilities in aqueous solutions were measured. Results: New compounds that are both effective direct thrombin inhibitors (the best KI was &lt;1 nM) and strong anticoagulants in plasma (an IC50 in the thrombin generation assay of approximately 100 nM) were discovered. These compounds contain one of the following new residues as the basic fragment: isothiuronium, 4-aminopyridinium, or 2-aminothiazolinium. LD50 values for the best new inhibitors ranged from 166.7 to &gt;1111.1 mg/kg. A plasma-substituting solution supplemented with one of the new inhibitors prevented hypercoagulation in the rat model of hemodilution-induced hypercoagulation. Activities of the best new inhibitors in physiological saline (1 μM solutions) were stable after sterilization by autoclaving, and the inhibitors remained stable at long-term storage over more than 1.5 years at room temperature and at 4°C. Conclusions: The high efficacy, stability and low acute toxicity reveal that the inhibitors that were developed may be promising for potential medical applications. © 2011 Sinauridze et al.",,"2 aminothiazolinium derivative; 4 aminopyridinium derivative; argatroban; nsc 1123477; nsc 123477; nsc 305831; nsc 328131; nsc 41339; nsc 4482; thiourea derivative; thrombin inhibitor; unclassified drug; anticoagulant agent; antithrombin; thrombin; acute toxicity; animal experiment; animal model; anticoagulation; aqueous solution; article; autoclave; computer aided design; controlled study; drug design; drug efficacy; drug screening; drug stability; drug storage; drug structure; drug synthesis; female; genetic algorithm; hemodilution; human; hypercoagulability; IC 50; in vitro study; in vivo study; LD 50; male; molecular docking; mouse; nonhuman; rat; thrombin time; algorithm; animal; chemical structure; chemistry; computer aided design; drug antagonism; drug screening; methodology; synthesis; thrombophilia; thrombosis; Mus; Rattus; Algorithms; Animals; Anticoagulants; Antithrombins; Computer-Aided Design; Drug Design; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Inhibitory Concentration 50; Models, Molecular; Rats; Thrombin; Thrombophilia; Thrombosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956150472

First, it hydrolyzes monoacylglycerols (MG) into fatty acids and glycerol. These products can be used for energy production or synthetic reactions. Second,MGL degrades 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), the most abundant endogenous ligand of cannabinoid receptors (CBR). Activation of CBR affects energy homeostasis by central orexigenic stimuli, by promoting lipid storage, and by reducing energy expenditure. To characterize the metabolic role of MGL in vivo, we generated an MGL-deficient mouse model (MGL-ko). These mice exhibit a reduction in MG hydrolase activity and a concomitant increase in MG levels in adipose tissue, brain, and liver. In adipose tissue, the lack of MGL activity is partially compensated by hormone-sensitive lipase. Nonetheless, fasted MGL-ko mice exhibit reduced plasma glycerol and triacylglycerol, as well as liver triacylglycerol levels indicative for impaired lipolysis. Despite a strong elevation of 2-AG levels, MGL-ko mice exhibit normal food intake, fat mass, and energy expenditure. Yet mice lacking MGL show a pharmacological tolerance to the CBR agonist CP 55,940 suggesting that the elevated 2-AG levels are functionally antagonized by desensitization of CBR. Interestingly, however, MGL-ko mice receiving a high fat diet exhibit significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in comparison with wild-type controls despite equal weight gain. In conclusion, our observations implicate that MGL deficiency impairs lipolysis and attenuates diet-induced insulin resistance. Defective degradation of 2-AG does not provoke cannabinoid-like effects on feeding behavior, lipid storage, and energy expenditure, which may be explained by desensitization of CBR. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Brain; Enzymes; Fatty acids; Glycerol; Insulin; Metabolism; Nutrition; Tissue; 2-Arachidonoyl glycerols; Cannabinoid receptors; Energy homeostasis; Hormone-sensitive lipase; Hydrolase activities; Insulin sensitivity; Synthetic reactions; Wild-type controls; Mammals; acylglycerol lipase; cannabinoid receptor; cre recombinase; animal experiment; animal model; article; carbohydrate analysis; controlled study; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; enzyme activity; enzyme deficiency; food intake; gene cassette; gene disruption; glucose tolerance; homeostasis; homologous recombination; hydrolysis; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid analysis; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipolysis; monoglyceride lipase deficiency; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; synaptic transmission; upregulation; weight gain; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955958008

Here we investigate the dependence of the binding energy and the top-atom magnetic moment upon composition, cluster size, and cluster dimensionality by considering the trimer and the tetramer, that is, the smallest two-dimensional and three-dimensional clusters, respectively. We find that for trimers the highest binding energy occurs for configurations that are perpendicularly bound and have the largest charge transfer to graphene. For tetramers, the binding energy is highest for the compact configurations with the largest charge transfer to graphene. Binding is generally strongest at the hole site of the graphene lattice. The charge transfer to graphene is mainly from the base atoms, while the s-d orbital configuration of the top atom is close to that in the free cluster, indicating electronic shielding of the top atom from the graphene substrate. Thus, the binding energy of mixed trimers and tetramers to graphene is determined largely by the elemental identity of the base atoms, while the magnetic moment of the top atom depends on the elemental identity of the top atom. We show that graphene-adsorbed mixed clusters FeCo2 and FeCo3 with top Fe atom are strongly bound and have large top-atom magnetic moments, indicating the potential for magnetic storage applications. © 2011 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961109118

The intended hybrid design is expected to provide small- or near-medium-sized wind turbine of unique design in terms of the gained energy and speed factors. The whole system is dedicated for stand-alone power plants. Integration of wind power into electricity generation is associated with some challenges as wind power generation is known by its fluctuating nature. The operation philosophy here is based on continual storing of wind energy into temporal energy storage systems. This paper is pioneering in developing a bidirectional process by which storing and expanding energy take place simultaneously or separately. A continual energy storing goes forward by a mechanically-actuated compressor in order to compress air into air tanks which is simultaneously providing air expanders by the necessary energy. These expanders concurrently generate electricity and/or produce hydrogen and nitrogen. Pumping air into storage by using a wind turbine is normally done at high delivered torques rather than high speeds, while electricity generation finds most of its impact at relatively high speeds. A conflict is then exists which adds more complexity to the system operation in addition to the wind and load fluctuation problems. This paper suggests a solution to this problem by the integration of four storage facilities in order to realize a consistent, sustainable electricity generation, pumping air into air storage and generating hydrogen and nitrogen. © 2011 IEEE.","Energy storage; Pneumatic control; Renewable energy; Wind energy","Air storage; Air tanks; Compress air; Electricity generation; Energy storage systems; Generate electricity; Hybrid design; Load fluctuations; Multi-stage; Pneumatic system; Renewable energies; Savonius rotor; Storage facilities; System operation; Whole systems; Wind energy; Electric power generation; Electricity; Flywheels; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Pneumatic control; Pumps; Wind power; Wind turbines; Electric generators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955862330

The influence of synthesis conditions particularly the solvent was studied. Various solvents, such as n-propanol, isoproponol, benzyl alcohol, methanol, ethanol, cyclohexanone, tetrahydrofuran (THF), nitromethane, 1,4-dioxane, and n-heptane were examined for this purpose. Graft copolymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDAX). It was found that the nature of the solvent had profound influence over the grafting reaction. Cyclohexanone, n-propanol, and isoproponol for 4VP/ETFE grafting, THF and 1,4-dioxane for NVP/ETFE grafting, and benzyl alcohol and methanol for 2VP/ETFE grafting were found to be the suitable solvents yielding highest graft levels. Isoproponol and n-propanol are promising in terms of both graft level and mechanical properties for 4VP/ETFE. Grafting of NVP, 4VP, and 2VP onto ETFE were verified through FTIR spectroscopy. Storage modulus and glass transition temperature of the copolymers were found to increase as graft level increased. Surface profile of representative films was also investigated by viewing the distribution of elemental nitrogen using SEM-EDAX. Results indicated that copolymers of 4VP, NVP, and 2VP are considerably different from each other. 4VP-based copolymers exhibited relatively more homogenous grafting over the surface compared with NVP- and 2VP-based copolymers. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","fuel cell; graft copolymers; irradiation; membrane; solvent effect","2-vinyl pyridine (2VP); 4-vinyl pyridine; Benzyl alcohol; Cyclohexanones; Fourier transform infrared; FTIR spectroscopy; Glass transition temperature; Graft copolymerization; Grafting reactions; n-Heptanes; N-propanol; N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone; Nitromethane; Poly(ethylene-alt-tetrafluoroethylene); Radiation-induced; Radiation-induced grafting; SEM-EDAX; solvent effect; Storage moduli; Surface profiles; Synthesis conditions; Tetrahydrofurans; Copolymerization; Dynamic analysis; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Ethanol; Ethers; Ethylene; Fluorine containing polymers; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fourier transforms; Fuel cells; Glass transition; Graft copolymers; Irradiation; Knowledge based systems; Mechanical properties; Methanol; Organic polymers; Organic solvents; Plastic products; Propanol; Pyridine; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); Grafting (chemical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951917384

In the second step, paraffin-alumina-FPE composites were prepared by using the ex situ technique. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry were used to evaluate the structure and thermal properties of the composites.

The result would be useful in the design of efficient power flow control in systems using SCs and li-ion batteries as parallel energy storages, and offers a possibility to predict energy storage power losses from the frequency spectrum of the energy storage current. In order to obtain accurate measurement results a calorimetric test setup has been built. In addition the li-ion battery efficiency is analyzed according to draft standard ISO 12405-1 and with a small scale straddle carrier laboratory drive. The calorimetric measurements indicate that frequency has only a minor impact on the energy storage efficiencies, but the efficiency of the SC is approximately 3 % better than that of the li-ion battery system. The standard measurements and straddle carrier measurements indicate an even greater difference in li-ion battery efficiency in comparison to the SC. Hence, in parallel SC and li-ion battery energy storage systems the control of power flow should be arranged so that the SC is utilized as much as possible. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Accurate measurement; Battery systems; Calorimetric measurements; Calorimetric test; Charge-discharge; Current frequency; Draft standard; Efficiency measurement; Efficient power; Frequency spectra; Li-ion batteries; Lithium ions; Lithium-ion battery; Power flows; Small scale; Standard measurements; Storage efficiency; Storage power; Straddle carriers; Super capacitor; Calorimetry; Capacitors; Energy storage; Flywheels; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Power electronics; Spectroscopy; Ions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955781418

These hybrid systems require separate dc-dc converters, or at least one dc-dc converter for the supercapacitor bank, to connect them to the dc-link of the grid interfacing inverter. These additional dc-dc converters increase power losses, complexity and cost. Therefore, possibility of their direct connection is investigated in this paper. The inverter system used in this study is formed by cascading two 3-level inverters, named as the ""main inverter"" and the ""auxiliary inverter"", through a coupling transformer. In the test system the main inverter is connected with the rectified output of a wind generator while the auxiliary inverter is directly attached to a battery and a supercapacitor bank. The major issues with this approach are the dynamic changes in dc-link voltages and inevitable imbalances in the auxiliary inverter voltages, which results in unevenly distributed space vectors. A modified SVM technique is proposed to solve this issue. A PWM based time sharing method is proposed for power sharing between the battery and the supercapacitor. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed modulation and control techniques. © 2011 IEEE.",,"3-level inverters; Control techniques; Coupling transformers; Dc-link; DC-link voltages; Direct integration; Dynamic changes; Energy performance; Hybrid energy storage; Inverter system; Modified SVM; Power sharing; Power-losses; Renewable energy sector; Simulation result; Space Vector; Super capacitor; Test systems; Time-sharing; Wind generators; Capacitors; DC-DC converters; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Energy storage; Flywheels; Hybrid systems; Power electronics; Vector spaces; Wind power; DC power transmission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955753240

This paper discusses a practical method in determining the performance parameters of stratified TES based on thermocline profile. Non linear regression fitting was adopted to identify the function which could represent temperature distribution profile. The function was used to define performance parameters namely limit points of thermocline, thermocline thickness, lost capacity, integrated capacity, theoretical capacity as well as half cycle of Figure of Merit. Results identified a function which could represent S-curve of temperature distribution, namely Sigmoid Dose Response (SDR) equation. The function was observed to fit the temperature distributions having coefficient determination more than 0.99.

In addition Alstom's DDS integrates silos, heat exchangers, scrubbers, fans and stack into an extremely compact and efficient multi-pollutant control and recovery technology with incomparable footprint.

The hydrogen is a promising energy source due its clean and high energy combustion. However, the major drawbacks to use hydrogen are the difficulty of formation, transportation and storage. The objective of this work is the study of hydrogen formation by aluminium reaction with water by using strong alkalis as catalysts (NaOH and KOH), and the development of a mathematical model that accounts the evolution of hydrogen at each time. Different alkali concentrations were used (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 mol.L-1). The reactions were carried out with aluminum in different samples: foils, plates with 0.5 mm and 1 mm width each. The range of temperatures studied was: 295, 305, 315 and 325 K for foils and 0.5 mm plates; 315, 325, 335 and 345 K for 1 mm plates. The results showed a strong dependence of the reaction rate on the temperature, alkali concentration and shape of the samples. The model predictions of hydrogen formation agreed with the experimental data of volume versus time, as well as the peaks observed in the reaction rates. © 2011, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

Its potential is vast and technically easy to utilise. At present, photovoltaic power plants are the fastest-growing renewable energy source (RES) in the Czech Republic. Their installed capacity reached 1390 MWp (December 2010). Only in the last two years more than 1300 MWp was put in operation. This rapid development of photovoltaic sources is having a negative effect on the electric power system control. One option for mitigating this effect is to store the energy generated by photovoltaic in times of excess power in the grid and supply it to the grid when required, i.e., during peak periods of the daily load curve. There are numerous different storage technologies. The hydrogen system can be used to provide for storage of electric power in large amounts as well.

Analysis of the results showed that a linear behavior of the heat losses with the night mean ambient temperature exists. The correlation coefficients of the linearity, for the three systems under consideration, range from 0.93 to 0.97, with the losses reaching almost 8000 kJ at a mean ambient air temperature of 10 C.

Among the analysed technologies are integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems, supercritical coal-fired power plants, multi-fuel hybrid cycles, and natural gas combined cycles. In addition, as a complement to coal technologies, CO2 capture and storage installations are adopted. The main indicators evaluated are the unit carbon dioxide emission and the break-even price of electricity. The analysis took into account, among other factors, the existing support mechanisms for ecological technologies, primarily in the form of the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme. The analysis shows that the systems integrated with CO2 capture can be competitive compared to systems without capture. Especially interesting in this context are IGCC systems integrated with carbon capture installations. The results are, however, affected by many factors, such as the fuel price, operational reliability, and auxiliary power need. The influence of these factors is evaluated in this article both qualitatively and quantitatively.","Advanced energy technologies; Carbon capture and storage installations; Economic and ecological evaluation","Advanced energy technologies; Advanced technology; Auxiliary power; Break-even prices; Carbon capture; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide emissions; Coal technologies; Coal-fired power plant; Ecological benefits; Electricity production; Emissions Trading Scheme; Environmental evaluation; European union; Fuel prices; Hybrid cycle; Integrated gasification combined cycle systems; Natural gas combined cycles; Operational reliability; Power generation technology; Super-critical; Support mechanism; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal gasification plants; Coal storage; Ecology; Electric power generation; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Global warming; Integration; International law; Natural gas; Rating; Technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960176982

Adipose tissue is not only a triglyceride storage organ, but studies have shown the role of white adipose tissue as a producer of certain bioactive substances called adipokines. Among adipokines, we find some inflammatory functions, such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6); other adipokines entail the functions of regulating food intake, therefore exerting a direct effect on weight control. This is the case of leptin, which acts on the limbic system by stimulating dopamine uptake, creating a feeling of fullness. However, these adipokines induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), generating a process known as oxidative stress (OS). Because adipose tissue is the organ that secretes adipokines and these in turn generate ROS, adipose tissue is considered an independent factor for the generation of systemic OS. There are several mechanisms by which obesity produces OS. The first of these is the mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation of fatty acids, which can produce ROS in oxidation reactions, while another mechanism is over-consumption of oxygen, which generates free radicals in the mitochondrial respiratory chain that is found coupled with oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Lipid-rich diets are also capable of generating ROS because they can alter oxygen metabolism. Upon the increase of adipose tissue, the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), was found to be significantly diminished. Finally, high ROS production and the decrease in antioxidant capacity leads to various abnormalities, among which we find endothelial dysfunction, which is characterized by a reduction in the bioavailability of vasodilators, particularly nitric oxide (NO), and an increase in endothelium-derived contractile factors, favoring atherosclerotic disease. © 2011 by the authors.","Adipokines; Obesity; Reactive oxygen species","adipocytokine; adiponectin; adipsin; angiotensinogen; catalase; cytokine receptor; glutathione peroxidase; interleukin 6; leptin; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; reactive oxygen metabolite; resistin; superoxide dismutase; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adipocytokine; catalase; glutathione peroxidase; nitric oxide; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; adipocyte; adipose tissue; age; asthma; cell differentiation; cell function; diabetes mellitus; disease association; endothelial dysfunction; energy consumption; ethnicity; exercise; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; food intake; gout; human; hypertension; immobilization; inflammation; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; ischemic heart disease; limbic system; lipid storage; lipogenesis; lipolysis; lipotoxicity; liver failure; mitochondrion; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oxidative phosphorylation; oxidative stress; oxygen consumption; peripheral vascular disease; protein function; protein secretion; review; signal transduction; sleep apnea syndrome; social stigma; thermogenesis; endothelium; homeostasis; inflammation; metabolism; obesity; pathology; pathophysiology; Adipokines; Adiposity; Catalase; Endothelium; Glutathione Peroxidase; Homeostasis; Humans; Inflammation; Nitric Oxide; Obesity; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Dismutase",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957805810

This means storage of energy in the series elastic Z-filaments and a considerable decrease of the liberated energy of heat and work to (h-wap), where h is the heat energy and wap the stretch energy induced from outside by an apparatus. The steep thin filament helix with an inclination angle of 70° promotes the passive rotation during stretch, but impedes the smooth sliding of shortening by increased friction and production of frictional heat. The frictional heat may be produced by the contact with the myosin cross-bridges: (1) when they passively snap on drilling thin filaments from cleft to cleft over a distance 2 × 2.7 nm = 5.4 nm between the globular actin monomers in one groove, causing stepwise motion; or (2) when they passively cycle from one helical groove to the next (distance 36 nm). The latter causes more heat and may take place on rotating thin filaments without an effective forward drilling (""idle rotation""), e.g., when they produce ""unexplained heat"" at the beginning of an isometric tetanus.

This study examines the evolving CCS debates, focusing on the media's framing of firms. Corporations are central CCS actors, and we analyze them in light of the nation-state, which has been emphasized in previous research as the primary context of CCS politics. Empirically, we compare framings of Statoil and Vattenfall in the Norwegian and Swedish media, drawing on a qualitative dataset of news media articles published between 2005 and 2009. We conclude that firms make regular media statements either to foster legitimacy or to respond to criticism of CCS. We also conclude that framing is not necessarily linked to technological success or failure and that interpretations of the technology have different forms depending on whether the related activity occurs in domestic or foreign markets. Finally, we explain the media framings based on the domestic energy situation and politics. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Corporation; Cross-country comparison; Media; Norway; Sweden","carbon sequestration; corporate strategy; data set; empirical analysis; national politics; technological change; Norway; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956275642

While electrochemistry at the edges and the basal plane of graphene has been studied in the past, the new frontier is the electrochemistry of folded graphene edges. Here we describe the electrochemistry of folded graphene edges and compare it to that of open graphene edges. The materials were characterized in detail by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. We found that the heterogeneous electron transfer rate is significantly lower on folded graphene edges compared to open edge sites for ferro/ferricyanide, and that electrochemical properties of open edges offer lower potential detection of biomarkers than the folded ones. It is apparent, therefore, that for sensing and biosensing applications the folded edges are less active than open edges, which should then be preferred for such applications. As folded edges are the product of thermal treatment of multilayer graphene, such thermal procedures should be avoided when fabricating graphene for electrochemical applications. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Basal planes; Biosensing applications; Electrochemical applications; Electron transfer rates; Heterogeneous electron transfer; High resolution; Open edges; Sensing applications; Thermal treatment; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrochemical properties; Electrolysis; Electron transitions; Graphene; High resolution electron microscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Raman spectroscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Electrochemistry; graphite; nanomaterial; article; chemistry; conformation; electric conductivity; electron transport; macromolecule; materials testing; particle size; surface property; ultrastructure; Electric Conductivity; Electron Transport; Graphite; Macromolecular Substances; Materials Testing; Molecular Conformation; Nanostructures; Particle Size; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956160399

We characterized skeletal muscle metabolic gene expression patterns, as well as protein content, in these individuals to assess the impact of spinal cord injury on critical determinants of skeletal muscle metabolism. Our results demonstrate that mRNA levels and protein expression of skeletal muscle genes essential for glucose storage are reduced, whereas expression of glycolytic genes is reciprocally increased in individuals with spinal cord injury. Furthermore, expression of genes essential for lipid oxidation is coordinately reduced in spinal cord injured subjects, consistent with a marked reduction of mitochondrial proteins.

For comparison, stress and fillet quality was also studied for commercially slaughtered farmed cod (fish sampled from waiting cage, after pumping and stunning with carbon dioxide, and after bleeding and chilling). Baseline values for stress-related parameters (blood chemistry, muscle high-energy phosphates and inosine monophospate, initial pH, muscle twitches, and rigor mortis) of rested Atlantic cod have been established. Since our stress bout showed that this species was not easily excitable, we were less convinced that we actually did study the other extreme, namely, exhausted fish. Nevertheless, the present data from the commercial slaughter of cod suggested that our stress bout was of adequate magnitude to represent potential poor handling routines. Our results consistently showed largely no differences between treatments, and that perimortem handling stress did not cause inferior flesh quality. This suggested that farmed cod can be processed with little risk of reducing product quality (quality index, fillet water content, water-holding capacity, ultimate pH, adenosine triphosphate-related degradation products and K-value, skin and fillet color, water and salt-soluble proteins, hardness, and gaping).

The highest Ec was recorded in mussels at estuarine site compared to coastal site, which may be caused by the energetically costly maintenance of osmotic balance.

Calculation of other environmental impacts shows the trade-offs: an increase of 43% in acidification, 35% in eutrophication, and 120-170% in various toxicity impacts. Given the assumptions employed in this analysis, emissions of MEA and formaldehyde during capture process and generation of reclaimer wastes contributes to various toxicity potentials and cause many-fold increase in the on-site direct freshwater ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity impacts. NOx from fuel combustion is still the dominant contributor to most direct impacts, other than toxicity potentials and GWP. It is found that the direct emission of MEA contribute little to human toxicity (HT&lt;1%), however it makes 16% of terrestrial ecotoxicity impact. Hazardous reclaimer waste causes significant freshwater and marine ecotoxicity impacts. Most increases in impact are due to increased fuel requirements or increased investments and operating inputs. The reductions in GWP range from 58% to 68% for the worst-case to best-case CCS system. Acidification, eutrophication and toxicity potentials show an even large range of variation in the sensitivity analysis. Decreases in energy use and solvent degradation will significantly reduce the impact in all categories. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Life cycle assessment; Natural gas combined cycle; Structural path analysis","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Direct emissions; Direct impact; Ecotoxicity; Electricity generation; Energy use; Fuel combustion; Fuel requirements; Global warming potential; Human toxicity; Life cycle assessment; Life-cycle assessments; Monoethanolamine; Natural gas combined cycle; Natural gas combined cycles; Pipeline transport; Post-combustion; Saline aquifers; Structural path analysis; Toxicity potential; Acidification; Air pollution; Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Combined cycle power plants; Electric generators; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Flue gases; Fuels; Gases; Global warming; Investments; Natural gas; Rating; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Toxicity; Waste incineration; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; combustion; environmental impact; eutrophication; hazardous waste; life cycle analysis; natural gas; sensitivity analysis; toxicity; transport process; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955598095

Empirical studies have demonstrated that organisms adapted to fluctuating energy availability plastically adjust their storage strategies. So far, however, theoretical studies have investigated general storage strategies only in constant or deterministically varying environments. In this study, we analyze how the ability to store energy influences optimal energy allocation to storage, reproduction, and maintenance in environments in which energy availability varies stochastically. We find that allocation to storage is evolutionarily optimal when environmental energy availability is intermediate and energy stores are not yet too full. In environments with low variability and low predictability of energy availability, it is not optimal to store energy. As environments become more variable or more predictable, energy allocation to storage is increasingly favored. By varying environmental variability, environmental predictability, and the cost of survival, we obtain a variety of different optimal life-history strategies, from highly iteroparous to semelparous, which differ significantly in their storage patterns. Our results demonstrate that in a stochastically varying environment simultaneous allocation to reproduction, maintenance, and storage can be optimal, which contrasts with previous findings obtained for deterministic environments. © 2010 The Author(s).

The sustainability of such system is based exclusively on solar energy input (without hybridization with any fossil fuel), as a renewable and pure energy resource, and the use of hydro energy, due to the possibility of its continuous production of energy. The feasibility and characteristics of the ST-PSH power plant were tested on power supply of the Island of Vis in Croatia, and the results show that the proposed model describes the operation of the power plant very well. For average solar irradiation of about 1500kWh/m2/a, precipitation 644mm/a, evaporation 1444mm/a, volume of PSH upper reservoir of 20hm3, electric energy consumption of 18GVAh/a and reserve in the system for 3-4 months, the obtained power of the ST power plant is 22MW, which can produce unit value of the annual thermal energy of 459kWh/m2/a and electric energy of 160kWh/m2/a, while the total collector aperture in the observed case is about 16ha. These results show that ST-PSH plants can be successfully applied on locations with relatively low irradiation, wherein the key element that ensures continuous production of energy is precisely the PSH technology that can in the best way, in economic-technical, and especially in ecological sense, balance the relatively large summer surpluses and winter energy shortages. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Hydroelectric power plant; Optimal sizing; Renewable energy sources; Solar thermal power plant; Sustainable energy production","Continuous production; Croatia; Electric energies; Electric energy consumption; Energy independence; Energy shortages; Key elements; Optimal sizing; Parabolic collector; Power supply; Renewable energy sources; Solar irradiation; Solar thermal; Solar thermal power plants; Sustainable energy; Electric power systems; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Hydroelectric power; Irradiation; Linear transformations; Optimization; Power plants; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar radiation; Thermoelectric power plants; Hydroelectric power plants; economic analysis; electrical power; energy resource; energy use; hydroelectric power plant; numerical model; optimization; renewable resource; solar power; solar radiation; sustainability; thermal power; wind power; Croatia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954626517

The spesific surface area of the m-poly(EGDMA-VIM) beads was found 63.1 m2/g. Cu2+ ions were chelated on the m-poly(EGDMA-VIM) beads and used in immobilization of Aspergillus niger glucoamylase in a batch system. The maximum glucoamylase adsorption capacity of the m-poly(EGDMA-VIM)-Cu2+ beads was observed as 120 mg/g at pH 6.5. The optimum pH for free and m-poly(EGDMA-VIM)-Cu 2+ immobilized glucoamylase were found 4.0 and 4.5, respectively. The optimum temperature of glucoamylase was not changed after immobilization and determined as 60°C for free and immobilized enzyme preparations. The glucoamylase adsorption capacity and adsorbed enzyme activity slightly decreased after 10 batch successive reactions, demonstrating the usefulness of the enzyme-loaded beads in biocatalytic applications. Storage stability was found to increase with immobilization. The effect of various experimental parameters such as pH, glucoamylase concentration, contact time and temperature in aqueous solution were also investigated. Adsorption isotherm obtained for m-poly(EGDMA-VIM)-Cu2+ was consistent with Langmuir model.

In this regard, the literature provides a novel concept that we call ""MicrObesity"" (Microbes and Obesity), which is devoted to deciphering the specific role of dysbiosis and its impact on host metabolism and energy storage. In the present review, we discuss novel findings that may partly explain how the microbial community participates in the development of the fat mass development, insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation that characterise obesity. In recent years, numerous mechanisms have been proposed and several proteins identified. Amongst the key players involved in the control of fat mass development, Fasting induced adipose factor, AMP-activated protein kinase, G-protein coupled receptor 41 and G-protein coupled receptor 43 have been linked to gut microbiota. In addition, the discovery that low-grade inflammation might be directly linked to the gut microbiota through metabolic endotoxaemia (elevated plasma lipopolysaccharide levels) has led to the identification of novel mechanisms involved in the control of the gut barrier. Amongst these, the impacts of glucagon-like peptide-2, the endocannabinoid system and specific bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium spp.) have been investigated. Moreover, the advent of probiotic and prebiotic treatments appears to be a promising ""pharmaco-nutritional"" approach to reversing the host metabolic alterations linked to the dysbiosis observed in obesity. Although novel powerful molecular system biology approaches have offered great insight into this ""small world within"", more studies are needed to unravel how specific changes in the gut microbial community might affect or counteract the development of obesity and related disorders. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Endocannabinoid system; Gut microbiota; Gut permeability; Inflammation; LPS; Obesity/type 2 diabetes","G protein coupled receptor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; prebiotic agent; Bacteroides; Bifidobacterium; environmental factor; homeostasis; human; inflammation; insulin resistance; intestine flora; intestine mucosa permeability; lipid storage; metabolic regulation; microbial community; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; review; Animals; Drug Delivery Systems; Energy Metabolism; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Inflammation; Insulin Resistance; Metagenome; Models, Biological; Obesity; Permeability; Prebiotics; Probiotics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953647671

In 2007 the annual use was 5.3 TWh (firewood use excluded), whereas the targeted growth by the year 2010 is 10.6 TWh, i.e. some 5 million m3. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the maximum availability of forest fuels to CHP plants in Eastern Finland. The total availability to the selected CHP plant population was 7 TWh at the maximum transport distance of 100 km. The main share came from logging residues, 3.3 TWh, and the rest from stumps, 1.8 TWh, and small diameter energy wood, 1.9 TWh. The highest plant-specific availability reached the level of 1.7-1.8 TWh, but the overlapping procurement areas reduced the availability for most plants to a level less than 1 TWh. In all plant sites peat fuel could be partially compensated with forest fuels according to availability, but not completely due to the boiler technology. Increasing the targeted national forest fuel use presupposes the use of new logistics supply solutions, such as other transport modes and regional buffer storage networks. This makes it possible to widen the traditional procurement area-based on truck transportation, which is less than 60 km because of a dense plant network. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass allocation; Biomass availability; Biomass resources; Combined heat and power generation (CHP); Geographical information systems (GIS)","Biomass allocation; Biomass availability; Biomass resources; Combined heat and power generation; Geographical information systems; Buffer storage; Fuel storage; Fuels; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Truck drivers; Truck transportation; Biomass; bioenergy; biofuel; biomass allocation; combined heat and power; fuel consumption; GIS; heat production; power generation; power plant; trucking; twenty first century; Finland; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953278278

The pelletization experiments were performed using a Sprout Matador M30 press (nominal production capacity 3.5 tonnes/h). Results showed that pelletization of 11 months stored wood compared to fresh material and high drying temperature (450 °C) compared to 75 °C resulted in higher energy consumption, probably due to increased friction in the matrix caused by the loss of extractives. However, the pellets produced were of higher density than those made from fresh material dried at a low temperature. The latter had the highest durability.

The emphasis is from an electricity demand side perspective with case studies that incorporates wholesale electricity market data of New Zealand. The results presented in this paper show that for space heating application significant advantages could be obtained using PCM built structures. These positive impacts include peak load shifting, energy conservation and reduction in peak demand for network line companies and potential reduction in electricity consumption and savings for residential customers. This paper uses a testing facility that consists of two identically designed and shaped offices built at Tamaki Campus location of the University of Auckland, New Zealand. The walls and ceilings of one office are finished with ordinary gypsum boards while the interior of the other office is finished with PCM impregnated gypsum boards. Controlled heating facility is provided in both the offices for maintaining temperature within the range of human comfort. This facility is equipped with advanced data acquisition equipment for data monitoring and archiving both locally within the offices and also remotely.

The phenomena of laminar natural convection and vertical stratification of temperature were considered. The developed three-dimensional transient computing code solves the equations of energy and momentum through the finite volume method. The simulation of fluid cooling process inside the tank showed the formation of stratified temperature profiles that matched those obtained experimentally. Based on several simulations, a correlation was proposed for determining the degree of thermal stratification inside the tank regarding thermal and geometrical parameters. From this correlation, an expression was proposed to predict the fluid temperature profiles along the time. This information is very important in many applications, such as in thermosiphon solar water heating systems, where the global efficiency of the system increases with the thermal stratification degree of the working fluid. Another case studied considered that the tank was connected to solar collectors, aiming at investigating the influence of the inlet jet position with and without a baffle plate on the preservation of the thermal stratification. Results showed that the baffle plate modified the velocity and temperature fields close to the inlet jet, allowing a better thermal stratification. Also the suitable choice of the inlet jet position allowed the formation of a more effective thermal stratification. Some other aspects of the internal dynamics of this kind of storage tank are presented and discussed. For the cases studied, the inlet jet next to the top led to a greater thermal stratification. However, it was verified that when the inlet jet temperature remains constant for a long period of time, and thus its temperature approaches the temperature of the water inside the tank, for the same height, the temperature profiles obtained become similar to the case of the inlet located at usual height of 2/3 of the diameter. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Finite volume method; Storage tanks; Three-dimensional numerical analysis","Baffle plate; Computing codes; Cooling process; Cylindrical storage tank; Dimensional temperatures; Fluid temperatures; Geometrical parameters; Global efficiency; Hydrodynamic behavior; Internal dynamics; Jet temperature; Laminar natural convection; Solar water heating systems; Storage tank; Temperature field; Temperature profiles; Three-dimensional analysis; Three-dimensional numerical analysis; Velocity field; Vertical stratification; Working fluid; Finite volume method; Fluids; Heating equipment; Numerical analysis; Numerical methods; Solar heating; Solar water heaters; Temperature control; Thermal stratification; Three dimensional; Tanks (containers); cylinder; finite volume method; heating; hydrodynamics; momentum; storage tank; temperature effect; temperature profile; three-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650743179

The major production hub is placed around the capital city, Bogota. Approximately 7266 ha are devoted to production of ornamental species under greenhouse conditions, the most important being roses (Rosa spp.) and carnations (Dianthus caryophyllus). Concern about the environmental performance of the industry is growing among the international market. The aim of this work was to explore technological alternatives to reduce the environmental impact exerted by the supply chain (production, marketing and consumption) of cut roses under greenhouse but at the same time looking for a production model that improves actual yields. The Life Cycle Assessment method was used to evaluate the environmental performance of the actual production system as well as a proposed technological alternative. The supply chain was divided into three stages: 1. cropping system including infrastructure, pest management, fertilization, harvest and residues; 2. postharvest including grading, packaging and storage and, 3. transportation to markets in the United States. The number of rose stems produced per square meter of soil was defined as the functional unit. Addition of a heating system to the actual cropping system in order to increase yields and reduce pest incidence was considered. Previous studies have shown that transportation of the flowers by aircraft imposes the major environmental impact by the product. Alternative transportation by ship is discussed in the present study. Results indicated the feasibility of including heating systems actual production schemes due to increase in energy use efficiency. In the overall impact assessment, this alternative will reduce the environmental impact of the actual cropping system. This study demonstrated that technological improvements to the supply chain can result in environmental benefits in order to preserve the competitiveness of the flower industry in Colombia.","Cut roses; Energy efficiency; Life cycle assessment; Sustainability","Dianthus caryophyllus; Rosa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053288006

Nowadays, crop monitoring techniques have become commercially available, which might aid growers to support their decision to adapt their climate control set points once a thermal screen is installed. In this study, leaf temperature, stem diameter and sap flow measurements were performed on glasshouse tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L. 'Clothilde') grown inside two compartments in Beitem, Belgium during spring 2008. In one compartment, a movable and semi-transparent thermal screen was used during the night. Differences in leaf temperature between the two compartments were observed, which were mainly caused by differences in air temperature, although differences in radiative energy losses also had to be taken into account in the upper canopy layer in the case of cold nights. Based on these results, it is advised to include leaf temperature measurements in research concerning the effect of the use of thermal screens. Additionally, a reduced water uptake was observed in the morning when the screen was still closed, whereas during the evening hours no difference in water uptake could be revealed. However, when the thermal screen was closed in the evening, stem diameter measurements indicated that the internal water storage pools were restored more quickly under the screen. It is, however, acknowledged that these effects were only observed on sunny days. Consequently, in addition to leaf temperature measurements, sap flow and stem diameter measurements can provide growers and researchers useful feedback from the crop itself, when thermal screen application strategies are to be evaluated. As a general conclusion, it was stated that these crop monitoring techniques are imperative when novel techniques are to be introduced in glasshouse horticulture in a sustainable way.","Crop monitoring; Energy screen; Leaf temperature; Sap flow; Speaking plant; Stem diameter","Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053278379

To gain a better understanding of the molecular processes that occur in 'Mor' mandarin flesh and contribute to flavor deterioration during storage, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling analysis using the Affymetrix Citrus GeneChip. Out of 30,171 probe sets representing citrus transcripts on the microarray, expression of 1,139 probe sets was significantly (q ≤ 0.01) altered by factors of at least 4 after 6 weeks of cold storage at 5 °C, of which 745 (65%) were downregulated and 394 (35%) upregulated. Overall, storage led to expression arrest of general cellular and metabolic activity, but enhanced lipid and amino acid catabolism, most probably to form substrates for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and energy production. In addition, storage enhanced gene expression of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), a key enzyme in anaerobic respiration and the ethanol fermentation pathway. Taken together, we propose that induction of amino acids and fatty acids degradation leads to accumulation of volatiles involved in formation of ""fruity"" (overripe) and ""musty"" aromas, respectively, whereas induction of ethanol fermentation metabolism leads to formation of ""alcohol"" flavor, all of which generate off-flavors after harvest. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","aroma; citrus; flavor; mandarin; off-flavor; postharvest; storage; transcriptome","aroma; citrus; mandarin; Off-flavors; Postharvest; storage; Transcriptomes; Amino acids; Cold storage; Deterioration; Ethanol; Fermentation; Gene expression; Metabolism; Physiology; Probes; Volatile fatty acids; Flavors; article; fruit; gene expression profiling; genetics; molecular probe; Fruit; Gene Expression Profiling; Molecular Probes; Citrus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955026320

The LSPR spectral peak position, as a function of nanoparticle size and material, is known to depend primarily on dynamic depolarization and electron structure related effects. The former gives rise to the well-known spectral red shift with increasing nanoparticle size. A corresponding understanding of the LSPR spectral line width for a wide range of nanoparticle sizes and different metals does, however, not exist. In this work, the radiative and nonradiative damping contributions to the LSPR line width over a broad nanoparticle size range (40-500 nm) for a selection of three metals with fundamentally different bulk dielectric properties (Au, Pt, and Al) are explored experimentally and theoretically. Excellent agreement was obtained between the observed experimental trends and the predictions based on electrostatic spheroid theory (MLWA), and the obtained results were successfully related to the specific band structure of the respective metal. Moreover, for the first time, a clear transition from a radiation damping dominated to a quenched radiation damping regime (subradiance) in large nanoparticles was observed and probed by varying the electron density through appropriate material choice. To minimize inhomogeneous broadening (commonly present in ensemble-based spectroscopic measurements), a novel, electron-beam lithography (EBL)-based nanofabrication method was developed. The method generates large-area 2D patterns of randomly distributed nanodisks with well-defined size and shape, narrow size distribution, and tunable (minimum) interparticle distance. In order to minimize particle-particle coupling effects, sparse patterns with a large interparticle distance (center-to-center ≥6 particle diameters) were considered. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","aluminum; gold; line width; localized surface plasmon resonance; material independence; plasmon energy; platinum; subradiance","2D patterns; Appropriate materials; Coupling effect; Damping contribution; Damping mechanisms; Electron densities; Electron structures; Electronic excitation; Inhomogeneous broadening; Interparticle distances; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Metallic nanoparticles; Nano-fabrication methods; Nanodisks; Nanoparticle sizes; Narrow size distributions; Non-radiative; ON dynamics; Particle diameters; plasmon energy; Radiation damping; Randomly distributed; Size and shape; Spectral line width; Spectral peak positions; Spectral red shifts; Spectroscopic measurements; Subradiances; Aluminum; Damping; Dielectric properties; Electric excitation; Materials; Nanoparticles; Optical data storage; Plasmons; Platinum; Radiation; Spectroscopy; Surface plasmon resonance; Surfaces; Gold",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955412961

The basic idea of CAES is that excess power on the grid is used in an electric motor to drive a compressor. The compressed air is cooled and stored at pressures of typically 60-70 bar. The energy from this high-pressure air, together with some thermal input, drives the turbine stage. To increase the efficiency of CAES, there is potential to capture the heat produced when the compressors are running, store the heat and then recycle it when the cool air has to be warmed up again. The bags use a butyl rubber bladder and a polyester-reinforced fabric for the outer surface. Special coated steel or ararmid straps provide the main structural strength. At depths of around 600m, there will be enough pressure in one 20m-diameter bag to store around 70MW hours of energy.",,"Butyl rubber; Coated steel; Compressed air energy storage; Cool air; Outer surface; Structural strength; Turbine stages; Cold storage; Compressed air; Compressors; Drives; Pneumatics; Pressure vessels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956372367

However, this new technology has a high energy demand for air separation and CO2 compression and storage. Unresolved issues, such as determination of the optimal recycle location of flue gas, the flue gas cleaning steps required (SO2, NOx, and particles), and the impact of an oxy-fuel flue gas on the cleaning steps, also persist. The aim of this work was to study the performance of the wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) process under operating conditions corresponding to oxy-fuel firing. The most important output parameters were the overall degree of desulfurization and the residual limestone concentration in the gypsum slurry. Pilot-scale experiments quantified that the introduction of a flue gas with 90 vol % CO2, at a holding tank pH 5.4, reduced the limestone dissolution rate significantly and thereby increased the residual, particulate limestone concentration in the gypsum slurry from 3.2 to 5.0 g/L slurry relative to a base-case (air-firing) experiment with a flue gas CO 2 concentration around 7 vol %. In the same experiment, due to the higher residual limestone concentration, the degree of desulfurization increased from 91 to 94%. The addition of 10 mM adipic acid to the slurry was not sufficient to return the increased concentration of residual limestone to the base-case level, but an additional increase in desulfurization degree, from 94 to 97%, was obtained. Using a holding tank pH 5.0 (no adipic acid) returned both parameters to the levels observed in the base-case experiment. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Adipic acids; Air separation; Flue gas cleaning; Heavy industries; High energy; Holding tank; Limestone dissolution; New technologies; Operating condition; Output parameters; Oxy-fuel firing; Oxy-fuels; Pilot-scale experiments; Stationary sources; Wet flue gas desulfurization; Concentration (process); Desulfurization; Dissolution; Energy management; Experiments; Flue gases; Flues; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gypsum; Limestone; Pilot plants; Tanks (containers); Gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954493035

Box 3000, 1001 Ljubljana, Slovenia","Using the quantum-mechanical approach combined with the image charge method we calculated the lowest energy levels of the impurities and neutral vacancies with two electrons or holes located in the vicinity of flat surface of different solids. Unexpectedly we obtained that the magnetic triplet state is the ground state of the impurities and neutral vacancies in the vicinity of surface, while the nonmagnetic singlet is the ground state in the bulk, for e.g. He atom, Li, Beions, etc. The energy difference between the lowest triplet and singlet states strongly depends on the electron (hole) effective mass μ, dielectric permittivity of the solid ε2 and the distance from the surface z0. For z0=0 and defect charge |Z|=2 the energy difference is more than several hundreds of Kelvins at μ=(0.5-1)me and ε2=210, more than several tens of Kelvins at μ=(0.1-0.2)me and ε2=510, and not more than several Kelvins at μ&lt;0.1me and ε2&gt;15 (m e is the mass of a free electron). Pair interaction of the identical surface defects (two doubly charged impurities or vacancies with two electrons or holes) reveals the ferromagnetic spin state with the maximal exchange energy at the definite distance between the defects (∼525 nm). We estimated the critical concentration of surface defects and transition temperature of ferromagnetic long-range order appearance in the framework of percolation and mean field theories, and RKKY approach for semiconductors like ZnO. We obtained that the nonmagnetic singlet state is the lowest one for a molecule with two electrons formed by a pair of identical surface impurities (like surface hydrogen), while its next state with deep enough negative energy minimum is the magnetic triplet. The metastable magnetic triplet state appeared for such molecule at the surface indicates the possibility of metastable ortho-states of the hydrogen-like molecules, while they are absent in the bulk of material. The two series of spectral lines are expected due to the coexistence of ortho- and para-states of the molecules at the surface. We hope that obtained results could provide an alternative mechanism of the room temperature ferromagnetism observed in TiO2, HfO2, and In2O3 thin films with contribution of the oxygen vacancies. We expect that both anion and cation vacancies near the flat surface act as magnetic defects because of their triplet ground state and Hunds rule. The theoretical forecasts are waiting for experimental justification allowing for the number of the defects in the vicinity of surface is much larger than in the bulk of as-grown samples. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

High temperature oxygen transport perovskite membranes can fulfill an important role in the separation of oxygen from air needed in the oxy-fuel technologies for CCS. In this study we present the development, performance and stability of gastight, macrovoid-free and sulfur-free Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) mixed conductor capillary membranes prepared by phase-inversion spinning and sintering. A sulfur-free phase-inversion polymer was chosen in order to obtain a phase-pure BSCF crystal phase. Special attention was given to the polymer solution and ceramic spinning suspension in order to avoid macrovoids and achieve gastight membranes. The sulfur-free BSCF capillaries showed an average 4-point bending strength of 64±8MPa and a maximum oxygen flux of ∼5.3Nml/(cm2min) at 950°C for an argon sweep flow rate of 125Nml/min. The comparison of the performance of sulfur-free and sulfur-containing BSCF capillaries with similar dimensions revealed a profound impact of the sulfur contamination on both the oxygen flux and the activation energy of the overall oxygen transport mechanism. Both long-term oxygen permeation at different temperatures and post-operation analysis of a sulfur-free BSCF capillary were performed and discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","BSCF; Capillary membrane; Macrovoid-free; Oxygen permeation; Phase-inversion spinning; Sulfur-free","BSCF; Capillary membranes; Macrovoid-free; Oxygen permeation; Phase-inversion spinning; Activation energy; Barium; Bending strength; Capillarity; Ceramic membranes; Fossil fuel power plants; Global warming; Oxygen; Oxygen permeable membranes; Permeation; Perovskite; Sintering; Sulfur; argon; barium; carbon dioxide; cellulose acetate; cobalt; dimethyl sulfoxide; iron; oxygen; perovskite; polymer; strontium; sulfur; article; ceramics; electron probe microanalysis; field emission scanning electron microscopy; flow rate; gas permeability; high temperature procedures; hollow fiber membrane; membrane technology; microtechnology; priority journal; sintering; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953029916

One such promising construction material for growing a well-defined nanostructure is deoxyribonucleic acid, due to its π-electron hydrophobic core and predictable recognition attributed to the specificity of Watson-Crick base-pairing. Hydrogen bonding provides the specificity behind the matching of complementary pairs of single-stranded (ss) DNA to hybridize into a double strand (ds) of helical DNA. The double-helical structure of DNA is determined by a subtle balance of noncovalent interactions among the DNA building blocks. The most prominent role is played by the interactions between the DNA bases, where two binding motifs can be recognized: planar hydrogen bonding and vertical stacking. DNA-based nanotechnology has generated interest in a number of applications due to the specificity, programmability, and reproducibility of DNA interaction with noble metal nanoparticles. 5′ and 3′ thiol moieties are used to prepare composite DNAs, DNA-gold nanoparticle conjugates and nanostructures with a variety of nanoparticle-based DNA assays. Particularly, color changes induced by the association of nanometer-sized gold particles provide a basis of a simple yet highly selective method for detecting specific biological reactions between anchored ligand molecules and receptor molecules in the milieu. Colloidal noble metal nanoparticles, in particular, have found application in a variety of assay formats in which analyte binding is coupled to particle adsorption. The extreme sensitivity of the bandwidth, the peak height, and the position of the absorption (or scattering) maximum of surface plasmon resonance spectra to environmental changes have prompted the development of approaches directly monitor the DNA hybridization. The same features that make DNA an effective molecule for the storage of genetic information also render it useful as an engineering material for the construction of smart objects at the nanometer scale because of its ability to self organize into desired structures via the specific hybridization of complementary sequences. Biocompatibility between gold nanomaterials and biological scaffolding is crucial to the development of smart biomaterials. These DNA/metal colloids are interesting for their fundamental properties as well as for applications in nanomaterials science and nanobiotechnology. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Fuel transportation, particularly by rail, is congested, and any outage of a rail line can create stress on electric power supply. Coal piles at power plants have been low in the recent past. Much of the electricity supply and delivery infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life. Without attention, natural gas demand could grow faster than the supply and capacity of the associated infrastructure to produce and deliver it. Spent nuclear fuel storage at some reactors is reaching capacity without any policy direction on long-term storage or reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The integration of renewable energy resources rises and falls with the ebb and flow of congressional legislation to fund the production tax credits (PTCs).

However, interest in electric power storage (EPS) has been growing with technological advancements that can make storage a more practical means of integrating renewable power into the electricity grid and achieving other operating benefits. This report summarizes the technical, regulatory, and policy issues that surround implementation of EPS. Electricity storage is one of several non-traditional technologies and methods of meeting power demand that are of current Congressional interest (others include distributed generation, renewable power, and demand response). EPS and these other alternatives do not fit the traditional power industry paradigm, which involves reliance on large scale central power plants and long distance transmission lines to meet demand. This raises the question of how quickly and effectively the power industry and its regulators will be willing to pursue and deploy new approaches. Electricity storage is also currently a relatively high cost technology, another factor which could delay its deployment. The report identifies several areas for possible congressional oversight, including: • Power industry and state regulator acceptance of storage technologies. • Integration of storage into transmission system planning, including integration of renewable power into the electricity grid. • Federal executive agency focus on EPS as a solution to power system needs. • The application of incentives for electric power storage development included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5).

Affected units will be subject to the permitting requirements of the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V provisions. For PSD, this will include state determinations of what constitutes Best Available Control Technology (BACT) that affected facilities will be required to install. On November 10, 2010, EPA released guidance and technical information to assist state authorities in issuing permits and determining BACT.Among the sources likely to be affected by implementation of the PSD permit requirements are new and modified electric generating units of all kinds, but particularly those fired by coal. These sources emit substantially more than EPA's threshold of 100,000 metric tons of CO2 annually: for example, a 500 megawatt (MW) coal-fired baseload power plant would emit on the order of three million metric tons of CO2 annually. The coal mining industry and coal-fired electric utilities face at least half a dozen major regulatory actions over the next few years; industry supporters view these rules collectively as a significant threat to the future of coal. Viewed in this context, the permit requirement is one more nail in what increasingly appears to them as coal's future coffin.In its new guidance, EPA retains the basic five-step process for determining BACT that it has recommended to state authorities for 20 years. The primary foci of the EPA guidance package are on state discretion in determining BACT and on energy efficiency as the most likely result of a GHG BACT analysis. These foci are evident through EPA's guidance for each of the five steps.For those looking for bright lines and specific recommendations with respect to GHG BACT technologies, particularly with respect to coal-fired facilities, the released package does not provide them. Indeed, EPA's supplemental ""Questions and Answers"" release on the guidance seems to stress that it did not draw such conclusions. For example:• Do these tools identify BACT for specific types of industrial facilities? No.• Does this guidance say that fuel switching (coal to natural gas) should be selected as BACT for a power plant? No.• Does this guidance say that carbon capture and storage (CCS) should be selected as BACT? No.Likewise, the guidance provides no cost thresholds for permitting authorities to consider in determining the economic impacts of alternatives nor proposes a new approach to selecting BACT for GHG emissions. Instead, the guidance focuses on the discretionary authority that states have in determining BACT-discretion that ensures that BACT will continue to be determined on a case-by-case basis with states differing in what they consider appropriate control measures and what constitutes BACT. Whether industry will find such discretion provides sufficient regulatory certainty to invest billions in new plants remains to be seen.In short, the EPA GHG guidance is a simple expansion of the five-step BACT process that has been used for two decades to include greenhouse gases. Whether that is an adequate response will be determined by applicants, state authorities, and future EPA regulatory actions under related parts of the act, such as Section 111 (NSPS), to which BACT is linked. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Agriculture is also a ""sink"" for sequestering carbon, which might offset GHG emissions by capturing and storing carbon in agricultural soils. The two key types of GHG emissions associated with agricultural activities are methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N,2O). Agricultural sources of CH4 emissions mostly occur as part of the natural digestive process of animals and manure management at livestock operations; sources of N2O emissions are associated with soil management and fertilizer use on croplands. This report describes these emissions on a carbon-equivalent basis to illustrate agriculture's contribution to total national GHG emissions and to contrast emissions against estimates of sequestered carbon.Emissions from agricultural activities account for 6%-8% of all GHG emissions in the United States. Carbon captured and stored in U.S. agricultural soils partially offsets these emissions, sequestering about one-tenth of the emissions generated by the agriculture sector, but less than 1% of all U.S. emissions annually. Emissions and sinks discussed in this report are those associated with agricultural production only. Emissions associated with on-farm energy use or with food processing or distribution, and carbon uptake on forested lands or open areas that might be affiliated with the farming sector, are outside the scope of this report. Most land management and farm conservation practices can help reduce GHG emissions and/or sequester carbon, including land retirement, conservation tillage, soil management, and manure and animal feed management, among other practices. Many of these practices are encouraged under most existing voluntary federal and state agricultural programs that provide cost-sharing and technical assistance to farmers, predominantly for other production or environmental purposes. However, uncertainties are associated with implementing these types of practices depending on site-specific conditions, the type of practice, how well it is implemented, the length of time a practice is undertaken, and available funding, among other factors. Despite these considerations, the potential to reduce emissions and sequester carbon on agricultural lands is reportedly much greater than current rates. Congress is currently considering a range of energy and climate policy options. In general, the current climate proposals would not require GHG emission reductions in the agriculture and forestry sectors. However, if enacted, provisions in these bills could potentially raise farm input costs for fossil fuels, fertilizers, energy, and other production inputs. These higher costs could potentially be offset by possible farm revenue increases should farmers participate in carbon offset and renewable energy provisions that are part of this legislation. For example, within capand-trade proposals being debated in Congress are provisions that could provide tradeable allowances to certain agricultural industries, and provisions that could establish a carbon offset program for domestic farm- and land-based carbon storage activities. In addition, the renewable energy provisions contained in these bills could potentially expand the market for farm-based biofuels, biomass residues, and dedicated energy crops. These and related bills and issues are currently being debated in Congress. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All Rights Reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892207047

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is one of the signalling systems that control feeding behaviour. The ECS is implicated in many functions, such as pain, memory, addiction, inflammation, and feeding, and could be considered a stress recovery system. It also seems to integrate nutrient intake, metabolism and storage maintaining homeostatic balance. The ECS is a recently discovered system, and research indicates hyperactivity in obesity. The aim of this thesis is to elaborate on the relationships of this widespread system and its elements in adipose tissue in obesity. Study I is a 4 weeks rat intervention study to investigate whether weight independent effect of Rimonabant treatment exists. We found that food intake-tolerance development could be circumvented by cyclic administration of Rimonabant and implications of weight independent effects of treatment. Study II is a cross-sectional study to establish the expression of cannabinoid receptor 1 from various adipose tissue depots of lean and obese persons. In this study we conclude, that the subcutaneous adipose tissue express more CBR1 than the visceral depot in lean, but comparable levels in obese. Study III is a 10 weeks human intervention study to asses the effects on the ECS of 10% weight loss. We found reduction in the ECS in obesity that normalised with weight loss. Our results clearly show the presence of all the components of the ECS in human adipose tissue, and suggest that the ECS is reduced in adipose tissue in obesity. Our results do not support the hypothesis of hyperactivity of the ECS in human obesity. Possible future treatment of obesity with CBR1 antagonist could involve cyclic treatment of specific peripheral compounds.",,"adiponectin; C reactive protein; endocannabinoid; fatty acid; piperidine derivative; pyrazole derivative; rimonabant; adipose tissue; animal; blood; body mass; body weight; case control study; drug effect; feeding behavior; female; genetic variability; human; inflammation; male; obesity; pathology; physiology; rat; reference value; review; risk factor; weight reduction; Wistar rat; Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; C-Reactive Protein; Case-Control Studies; Endocannabinoids; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Food Habits; Genetic Variation; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Obesity; Piperidines; Pyrazoles; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Reference Values; Risk Factors; Weight Loss",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052048034

Methods: With a given energy density and for each of two different light-curing units (QTH or LED), the curing rate was reduced by modulating the curing mode. Thus, the irradiation of resin composite specimens (Filtek Z250, Tetric Ceram, Esthet-X) was performed in a continuous curing mode and in a pulse-delay curing mode. Wallace hardness was used to determine the softening of resin composite after storage in ethanol. Degree of conversion was determined by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Wear was assessed by a three-body test. Data were submitted to Levene's test, one and three-way ANOVA, and Tukey HSD test (α= 0.05). Results: Immersion in ethanol, curing mode, and material all had significant effects on Wallace hardness. After ethanol storage, resin composites exposed to the pulsedelay curing mode were softer than resin composites exposed to continuous cure (P< 0.0001). Tetric Ceram was the softest material followed by Esthet-X and Filtek Z250 (P< 0.001). Only the restorative material had a significant effect on degree of conversion (P< 0.001): Esthet-X had the lowest degree of conversion followed by Filtek Z250 and Tetric Ceram. Curing mode (P= 0.007) and material (P< 0.001) had significant effect on wear. Higher wear resulted from the pulse-delay curing mode when compared to continuous curing, and Filtek Z250 showed the lowest wear followed by Esthet-X and Tetric Ceram.",,"alcohol; Esthet X; Esthet-X; Filtek Z250; resin; Tetric ceram; article; chemistry; comparative study; dental bonding; dental care; dental equipment; dental surgery; hardness; infrared spectroscopy; materials testing; methodology; polymerization; Composite Resins; Curing Lights, Dental; Dental Restoration Wear; Dental Stress Analysis; Ethanol; Hardness; Light-Curing of Dental Adhesives; Materials Testing; Polymerization; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959648127

There is considerable synergy between these two sectors at extreme ends of the shipping industry, i.e., they share a common concern on energy efficiency and reduction of air emissions. Moreover, there is a market for LNG-fuelled ferries, which can operate on fixed routes.

The dominant anaerobic microorganisms isolated from these samples during the study belonged to acetogens, methanogens, and sulfate reducers. The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis of the physiological properties showed that the isolates were close to the species of Eubacterium limosum, Sporomusa sphaeroides, Methanosarcina barkeri, Methanobacterium formicicum, and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. The isolated organisms, except for Methanobacterium formicicum, were capable of methylotrophic growth. All strains were characterized by resistance to high methanol concentrations (up to 40-50 g l-1). Their other energy substrate was hydrogen. The combination of the growth characteristics of these strains (pH, temperature, and salinity ranges) was shown to correspond to the ecological situation observed in the UGSF. The results of investigation of the isolated strains suggest that organic acids (acetate, butyrate) found in high concentrations in the initial samples are metabolic products of the revealed acetogens. Based on the established biological peculiarities of the isolated strains of methanogens, acetogens, and sulfate-reducing bacteria, these microorganisms may be considered as the main agents of anaerobic transformation of methanol and some other organic and inorganic compounds in UGSFs. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","acetogens; methanogens; methanol; underground gas storage facility","Bacteria (microorganisms); Desulfovibrio desulfuricans; Eubacterium limosum; Methanobacterium formicicum; Methanosarcina barkeri; Sporomusa sphaeroides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955086158

Most sensors operate on batteries with limited power. Battery recharging or replacement may be impossible. Security mechanisms that are based on public key cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and digital signatures are prohibitively expensive in terms of energy consumption and storage requirements, and thus unsuitable for WSN applications. This paper proposes a new fragile watermarking technique to detect unauthorized alterations in WSN data streams. We propose the FWC-D scheme, which uses group delimiters to keep the sender and receivers synchronized and help them to avoid ambiguity in the event of data insertion or deletion. The watermark, which is computed using a hash function, is stored in the previous group in a linked-list fashion to ensure data freshness and mitigate replay attacks, FWC-D generates a serial number SN that is attached to each group to help the receiver determines how many group insertions or deletions occurred. Detailed security analysis that compares the proposed FWC-D scheme with SGW, one of the latest integrity schemes for WSNs, shows that FWC-D is more robust than SGW. Simulation results further show that the proposed scheme is much faster than SGW. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Data integrity; Security; Watermarking; Wireless sensor network","algorithm; article; computer assisted diagnosis; computer graphics; computer network; computer security; computer simulation; human; information processing; methodology; signal processing; telemetry; wireless communication; Algorithms; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Graphics; Computer Security; Computer Simulation; Data Compression; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Telemetry; Wireless Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953862193

However, as graphene nanomaterials are prone to stacking and therefore blocking electroactive sites, its real capacity is low. Recently, there has been a significant interest in quasi 1D structures of carbon nanofibers with radially oriented graphene sheets, called stacked graphene nanofibers graphite nanofibers or nanoribbons. Such nanofibers exhibit an unparalleled amount of edge sites on their surface. In this study, we use gold nanoparticles as nanospacers for separating stacked graphene nanofibers. We investigate the dependence of the capacitance of stacked graphene nanofiber/nanogold nanocomposites upon the size of gold nanoparticles (2-150nm) and the amount of gold nanospacers in the composite.

Its beneficial activities for aquaculture have already been shown in terms of increased disease resistance and growth performance in a number of studies. However, the action of PHB on the intestinal microbial community in the treated animals has not yet been studied in depth. In this research, the effects of PHB on the microbiota composition in the intestinal tract of juvenile sea bass were examined. It was found that fish cohabiting in the same tank were on average 87% similar regarding the intestinal microbiota. When subjected to the same treatment and environmental conditions but reared in different tanks, the compositions of the enteric communities diverged. The provision of PHB overruled this tank effect by sustaining a microbial core community in the gut that represented 60% of the total bacterial diversity at the highest PHB level of 10%. The microbial community compositions converged between replicate tanks upon supplementation of PHB and were characterized by high dynamics and increased evenness. The results are discussed in the framework of hypotheses that try to relate the intestinal microbial community composition to the health status of the host organisms. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"bacterial DNA; hydroxybutyric acid; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate; polyester; animal; aquaculture; article; bacterium; bass; DNA fingerprinting; ecosystem; feces; genetics; growth, development and aging; intestine; metabolism; metagenome; microbiology; Animals; Aquaculture; Bacteria; Bass; DNA Fingerprinting; DNA, Bacterial; Ecosystem; Feces; Hydroxybutyrates; Intestines; Metagenome; Polyesters; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Dicentrarchus labrax; Serranidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953273230

Most DG units are connected to the microgrid via a power-electronic inverter with dc link. Therefore, new control methods for these inverters need to be developed in order to exploit the DG units as effectively as possible in case of an islanded microgrid. In the literature, most control strategies are based on the conventional transmission grid control or depend on a communication infrastructure. In this paper, on the other hand, an alternative control strategy is proposed based on the specific characteristics of islanded low-voltage microgrids. The microgrid power is balanced by using a control strategy that modifies the set value of the rms microgrid voltage at the inverter ac side as a function of the dc-link voltage. In case a certain voltage, which is determined by a constant-power band, is surpassed, this control strategy is combined with P/V -droop control. This droop controller changes the output power of the DG unit and its possible storage devices as a function of the grid voltage. In this way, voltage-limit violation is avoided. The constant-power band depends on the characteristics of the generator to avoid frequent changes of the power of certain DG units. In this paper, it is concluded that the new control method shows good results in power sharing, transient issues, and stability. This is achieved without interunit communication, which is beneficial concerning reliability issues, and an optimized integration of the renewable energy sources in the microgrid is obtained. © 2011 IEEE.","DC-link voltage control; distributed generation; microgrid; P/V -droop; power sharing; voltage-source inverter","DC-link voltages; distributed generation; Micro grid; P/V -droop; power sharing; voltage-source inverter; AC generator motors; Electric energy storage; Electric potential; Renewable energy resources; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; DC power transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953228919

An energy hub is an integrated system of units, e.g., a combined heat and power plant and a heat storage, which allows the conversion and storage of multiple energy carriers. In this paper, an extended energy hub model is presented which additionally takes into account the possibility of performing DSM with the load(s) connected to the hub output. Taking into account the energy hub's flexibility to change its output power(s), its economic value is determined with a method based on Monte Carlo simulation. This method calculates an optimal dispatch of the hub for a large amount of possible price paths of the input and output energy carriers. By means of the proposed energy hub Monte Carlo valuation model, integrated systems of multi-energy conversion and storage devices can be valued together with load management schemes. In doing so, the energy hub's ability to flexibly adapt its output to uncertain and volatile market prices is explicitly considered. © 2010 IEEE.","Combined heat and power (CHP); demand-side management (DSM); energy storage; Monte Carlo simulation; multiple energy carriers; power generation investment","Combined heat and power; Demand side managements; Monte Carlo Simulation; multiple energy carriers; power generation investment; Computer simulation; Economics; Electric load management; Electric utilities; Energy conversion; Flywheels; Heat storage; Integrated control; Integrated optics; Monte Carlo methods; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953111459

The LG plasmons carry a finite orbital angular momentum despite longitudinal nature, which can be partly transfered to the electrons. For short timescales, such that ion motion can be neglected, plasmons primarily interact with the electrons, creating an azimuthal electric field and generating an axial magnetic field. This effect can be called an inverse Faraday effect due to plasmons. Numerically, it is found that the magnitude of the magnetic field enhances with the plasmon density or with the energy of the electron plasma waves.

It was used to convert d-glucose into d-glucosone at moderate pressures (i.e. up to 150 bar) with compressed air in a modified commercial batch reactor. Several parameters affecting biocatalysis at moderate pressures were investigated as follows: pressure, [enzyme], [glucose], pH, temperature, nature of fluid and the presence of catalase. Glucose 2-oxidase was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B-IDA-Cu(II) column at pH 6.0. The rate of bioconversion of d-glucose increased with the pressure since an increase in the pressure with compressed air resulted in higher rates of conversion. On the other hand, the presence of catalase increased the rate of reaction which strongly suggests that H2O2 acted as inhibitor for this reaction. The rate of bioconversion of d-glucose by glucose 2-oxidase in the presence of either nitrogen or supercritical CO2 at 110 bar was very low compared with the use of compressed air at the same pressure. The optimum temperature (55°C) and pH (5.0) of d-glucose bioconversion as well as kinetic parameters for this enzyme were determined under moderate pressure. The activation energy (Ea) was 32.08 kJ mol-1 and kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km, K cat and Kcat/Km) for this bioconversion were 8.8 U mg-1 protein, 2.95 mM, 30.81 s-1 and 10,444.06 s-1 M-1, respectively. The biomass of C. versicolor as well as the cell-free extract containing glucose 2-oxidase activity were also useful for bioconversion of d-glucose at moderate pressures. The enzyme was apparently stable at moderate pressures since such pressures did not affect significantly the enzyme activity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Biocatalysis; Bioconversion of D-glucose into D-glucosone; Catalase; Coriolus versicolor; Glucose 2-oxidase; Kinetic parameters; Moderate pressures","Biocatalysis; Catalase; Coriolus versicolor; Glucosone; Moderate pressures; Activation energy; Affinity chromatography; Batch reactors; Bioconversion; Cold storage; Column chromatography; Compressed air; Enzyme activity; Enzymes; Gel permeation chromatography; Glucose; Kinetic parameters; Molecular oxygen; Pneumatics; Pressure vessels; Glucose oxidase; carbon dioxide; catalase; glucose; glucose derivative; glucosone; hydrogen peroxide; nitrogen; oxidoreductase; pyranose oxidase; unclassified drug; article; atmospheric pressure; batch reactor; biocatalysis; biomass; biotransformation; compressed air; coriolus versicolor; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetics; Eumycota; glucose oxidation; immobilized metal affinity chromatography; nonhuman; pH; temperature; Biocatalysis; Biomass; Bioreactors; Carbohydrate Dehydrogenases; Chromatography, Affinity; Compressed Air; Enzyme Stability; Fungal Proteins; Glucose; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ketoses; Kinetics; Oxidation-Reduction; Pressure; Substrate Specificity; Thermodynamics; Trametes; Trametes versicolor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952705695

Although protein can also serve as a source of energy, amino acids oxidation is usually tightly adjusted to amino acids intake and their contribution to total energy expenditure is rather insignificant in healthy subjects. Blood glucose, glycogen, plasma fatty acids and intramuscular triglycerides, on the other hand, present major sources for energy production. The amount of energy stored in the form of fat is large, representing 92-98% of all endogenously stored energy with CHO contributing only about 2-8%. Fat is at the bottom of an oxidative hierarchy that determines fuel selection, and its oxidation is governed by the presence or absence of the other macronutrients. In addition, the rate at which it can be oxidized depends on intensity of energy expenditure. In contrast, CHO elicit strong auto-regulatory adjustments in their oxidation. This review aims at summarizing the current state of knowledge on CHO and fat body storage, hierarchy of fuel utilization during resting state, anaerobic and aerobic pathways for energy production during exercise, and the effects of exercise mode, intensity, duration, and training on CHO and fat utilization. © 2011 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.","Carbohydrate; Duration; Exercise intensity; Fat; Substrate utilization; Training status","adenosine triphosphate; carbohydrate; catecholamine; creatine phosphate; fat; glycerol; glycogen; insulin; lactic acid; aerobic exercise; aerobic metabolism; anaerobic glycolysis; anaerobic metabolism; carbohydrate diet; carbohydrate metabolism; catecholamine blood level; citric acid cycle; energy consumption; energy yield; exercise intensity; exercise physiology; fatty acid oxidation; food intake; glucose metabolism; glycogen metabolism; human; insulin blood level; insulin release; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipogenesis; metabolic rate; muscle exercise; obesity; oxygen consumption; physical activity; postprandial state; resistance training; rest; review; sex difference",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952600197

A mean energy consumption rate of 2.7kW/TEU was assumed in this study, but was found to have potential variations of around ±60%. New Zealand's maritime trade was considered as a case study for the year 2007 to place the effect of refrigerated transport in context. For individual refrigerated containers, approximately 19% of the energy use related to its journey is used for refrigeration purposes. In 2007, approximately 18% and 61% of New Zealand's imported and exported food products by mass, respectively, required some form of refrigeration during transportation. Maintaining the refrigerated state of imports and exports to and from New Zealand during maritime transportation consumed approximately 280GWh of electricity. Assuming all this electricity was generated onboard vessels using auxiliary engines, approximately 61kt of fuel was consumed and 190kt of CO2 produced. Refrigeration is of particular importance to the many greenhouse gas or carbon footprinting studies conducted around the world. Implications are discussed in the context of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport of apples from NZ to the UK and long-term storage of UK apples. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon footprinting; Greenhouse gas emissions; Refrigerated shipping containers","Atmospheric controls; Auxiliary engines; Energy use; Footprinting; Global trading; Long-term storage; Maritime transportation; Mean energy; New zealand; Potential variations; Refrigerated shipping containers; Refrigerated transport; Energy utilization; Freight transportation; Fruits; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Mass transportation; Refrigeration; Waterway transportation; Refrigerated containers; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy use; greenhouse gas; maritime transportation; shipping; New Zealand; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952310278

The synthesized ethylene dilauroyl amide (EDLA), ethylene dimyristoyl amide (EDMA), and ethylene dipalmytoyl amide (EDPA) were characterized structurally by FT-IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy techniques. Latent heats of melting and freezing determined using DSC technique were found to be 127.83 and -118.30 J/g for EDLA, 129.95 and -132.40 J/g for EDMA, and 150.66 and -145.22 J/g for EDPA, respectively. Phase change temperatures of these PCMs were ranged between 38.5 and 52.5 °C. The synthesized PCMs were tested for durability by accelerated thermal cyclings including 1000 melting/freezing cycles. Besides the thermal endurance of the PCMs were determined by TG analysis. Based on the results it was concluded that EDLA, EDMA, and EDPA compounds synthesized as novel solidliquid PCMs have considerable amount of thermal energy storage potential in terms of suitable phase change temperatures, high latent heats, thermal reliability, and thermal stability. Moreover, the other advantages of the synthesized PCMs over the fatty acids used are better odor, low corrosivity, and low sublimation rates. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The first one is the 52.5 MWe cogeneration plant at the Suvarnabhumi Airport, and the second is the 9.9 MWe cogeneration plant of the government office building complex. Both plants are located in Bangkok. Performance improvements assume changing system design and operational plans during on-peak and off-peak periods with applying chilled water storage for more flexible operation. Such analysis gives opportunity for improvement of plant efficiency, primary energy saving, emission reduction and economical benefits. In case study 1, the selection of new prime mover results in overall efficiency improvement from 48% to 61%, 24% increase of primary energy saving, and 27% improvement of CO2 emission reduction. Significant amount of primary energy is saved 1451 TJ/a and CO2 emission reduction is 129,271 tCO2/a. The profit is increased to 24.80 Million US$/a and the payback period is 4.77 years. In case study 2, the application of chilled water storage leads to maximum profit of 2.63 Million US$/a. The results show that the selection of plant components should be made very carefully in the design stage, as well as that permanent control and optimization of plant operation in the exploitation phase is essential. Economic aspects of cogeneration plants are more sensitive to changeable input parameters than classical separate heat and power generation since cogeneration plants are more complex in the aspects of process configuration and products costs/values (electricity, steam, hot water, and chilled water). Having in mind the future development of the natural gas distribution network in Thailand, it can be estimated that the potential of power generation in public buildings is around 1.3 GWe.

To overcome this problem, the inverse input and output multiplicative model is proposed to represent unstructured uncertainties due to system operations and communication delay in the robust centralized damping controller design of superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) based on WAMS. The structure of centralized controller for SMES is the practical 1st-order lead/lag compensator. To automatically tune the control parameters, the optimization problem based on the enhancement of damping performance and system robust stability margin is achieved by particle swarm optimization.

There is a critical need for the development of alternative, appropriate, affordable methods of cooking for use in developing countries. There is a history for solar cooking since 1650 where they are broadly divided into direct or focusing type, box-type and indirect or advanced solar cookers. The advanced solar cookers have the advantage of being usable indoors and thus solve one of the problems, which impede the social acceptance of solar cookers. The advanced type solar cookers are employing additional solar units that increase the cost. Therefore, the solar cooker must contain a heat storage medium to store thermal energy for use during off-sunshine hours. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of the melting/solidification fast thermal cycling of commercial grade magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2·6H2O) on its thermo-physical properties; such as melting point and latent heat of fusion, to be used as a storage medium inside solar cookers. One thousand cycles have been performed in a sealed container under the extra water principle. The thermo-physical properties are measured using the differential scanning calorimetric technique. It is indicated that MgCl2·6H 2O with the extra water principle and hermetically sealing of the container is a promising phase change material (PCM) for cooking indoors and during law intensity solar radiation periods. It is also found from the melting/solidification behavior of MgCl2·6H2O that it is solidify almost without supercooling; except in few cases where it showed maximum of 0.1-3.5 °C of supercooling. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Since in situ measurements are scarce, there is a strong need for alternative validation data sources. Here we present a new dataset of monthly basin-scale terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) derived with the combined atmospheric-terrestrial water-balance approach, also referred to as basin-scale water-balance (BSWB) approach. It is diagnosed from observation-constrained reanalysis data for the atmospheric fields and observed streamflow. A previous BSWB dataset derived from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis ERA-40 provided reasonable estimates of TWSC for mid-latitude basins. The here presented BSWB dataset is derived from the latest ECMWF reanalysis ERA-Interim, which is available in real time. The potential real-time availability of TWSC derived from ERA-Interim is of great relevance for several agricultural, hydrological, and climate applications. An uncertainty analysis of the derived TWSC highlights the importance of the atmospheric moisture flux convergence fields from the reanalysis for the resulting product uncertainty. We find that the BSWB estimates have a relative uncertainty of about 4-6% in basins larger than 1·5 × 106 km2 compared with the mean seasonal cycle. The ERA-Interim based dataset compares better with in situ soil moisture, snow depth, and groundwater measurements in the Ob basin and Illinois than the previous ERA-40 based dataset. We further compare the BSWB datasets to retrievals from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE), scatterometer data from the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites, and land surface model output from the second phase of the Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP). We find a better correlation between ERS and the BSWB data than between GRACE and the BSWB data, which might be related to the relatively coarse resolution of GRACE. GSWP model output and the BSWB datasets compare well in most of the studied river basins. © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","ERA-Interim; Terrestrial water storage; Water-balance","Atmospheric fields; Atmospheric moisture; Climate system; Data sets; Ecmwf re-analysis; ERA-Interim; European center for medium-range weather forecasts; European Remote Sensing satellites; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Illinois; In-situ; In-situ measurement; Land surface; Land surface models; Model outputs; Real time; Reanalysis; Relative uncertainty; River basins; Scatterometer data; Seasonal cycle; Second phase; Snow depths; Soil wetness; Terrestrial water storage; Time availability; Validation data; Water and energies; Climate models; Estimation; Geodetic satellites; Geologic models; Gravitational effects; Groundwater; Meteorological instruments; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Surface measurement; Weather forecasting; Uncertainty analysis; data set; estimation method; GRACE; river basin; scatterometer; streamflow; water budget; water storage; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952687007

We find maxima at 535 and 265 nm, and that the band shape is largely determined by the sampling time interval, which is due to the kinetics of the dissociation process. Calculations at the TD-B3LYP/TZVPP++ level predict maximum absorption at 533 and 275 nm for the carboxylate isomer in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. The phenolate isomer lies higher in energy by 0.22 eV, and also its absorption maximum is calculated to be at 463 nm, which is far away from the experimental value. Our data serve to benchmark future theoretical models for bioluminescence from fireflies. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption maxima; Action spectra; Band shapes; Chemical environment; Dissociation process; Electronic absorption spectra; Experimental values; Intrinsic behavior; Ionic dissociation; Sampling time; Short time scale; Single pass; Theoretical models; Time-scales; Absorption; Absorption spectroscopy; Bioluminescence; Carboxylation; Dissociation; Excited states; Fire protection; Ions; Isomers; Light absorption; Mass spectrometry; Particle accelerator accessories; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; anion; carbon dioxide; hydroxybenzoic acid derivative; luciferin; phenolic acid; photoprotein; article; chemistry; electron; kinetics; mass spectrometry; spectrophotometry; vacuum; Anions; Carbon Dioxide; Electrons; Firefly Luciferin; Hydroxybenzoic Acids; Kinetics; Luminescent Proteins; Mass Spectrometry; Spectrophotometry; Vacuum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952748125

The weekly estimate of petroleum products is based on products that were supplied to the US markets, not an actual end-use consumption figure. EIA calculates the product supply estimate by the ""net barrels made available to the economy from that week's production and imports, minus any change in that product's stock level from the prior week, and less a model-based estimate of exports of that product"". Though product supplied is a good indicator for consumption, supply data can actually fluctuate more than consumption. Supply estimates for products can vary week to week due to transporting from primary storage to refineries, pipelines, and terminals. Timing also affects the weekly variations to the product supplied estimates. WPSR survey respondents are to account for their weekly activities each Friday by 7 A.M.EST.

The storage life, quality and safety of many foodstuffs are based on the combined effects of several factors (hurdles). These hurdles can have an additive or even synergistic effect. Hurdles in foods are substances or processes inhibiting deteriorative processes. Hurdle technology is the application of selected processing techniques in combination to preserve a product. Hurdle technology acts by exhausting bacterial cells as each hurdle that is applied requires the cells to use energy to maintain their internal pH, osmotic pressure and keep toxic molecules out. Traditional hurdles include the control of water activity (aW), acidity (pH), temperature or redox potential (Eh), or the addition of preservatives or starter cultures. In many cases prevention of deteriorative processes and maintenance of quality are opposing actions. Therefore, to maintain optimal quality, the height of hurdles has to be kept as low as possible, i.e. by combination of various hurdles. Nowadays, Hurdle Technologies is a source of information for expert developers and technologists in industry, as well as for experts in academia and newcomers to the field, such as students of food microbiology, engineering and technology. Thus this chapter gives a useful scientific contribution to the understanding of having to ensure safe food production, and also a short description of the most important hurdles, especially the hurdles for safety and stability, rather arbitrarily, a subdivision will be made between physical hurdles, physico-chemical hurdles, microbially derived hurdles and miscellaneous hurdles. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Early CCS initiatives were motivated by the challenge of reconciling relatively ambitious climate policy targets with growing emissions from Norway's offshore oil and gas operations, whose expertise and project opportunities formed the basis for these initiatives. The early start of the CCS debate created political path dependence effects, including recruitment of much of the environmental sector (government agencies and some NGOs) as CCS promoters. Paradoxically, the historical absence from Norway of fossilbased power generation also favoured CCS. Initiatives to add gas-fired generating capacity to Norway's previously emissions-free power supply created an entrenched conflict in which CCS became a politically necessary compromise. The more recent growth in political support for CCS in other countries may be explained by the fact that governments increasingly experience similar, politically difficult climate/energy policy dilemmas. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Ccs; Climate policy; Path dependence; Policy entrepreneurship; Technology","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; emission control; environmental policy; governance approach; nongovernmental organization; power generation; underground storage; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80655123461

Design/methodology/approach: Field research in Mozambique including 12 in-depth interviews with key personnel from December 2006 to January 2007. Findings: First, clear threats to the success of VidaGás' pro-poor business model encompass insufficient liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) supply and storage facilities; poor industrial and commercial infrastructure in Northern Mozambique; inadequate training of retailers in LPG use; and inadequate consumer knowledge of the benefits of LPG. Second, key innovations employed by VidaGás to overcome these obstacles consist of the introduction of a novel cold chain to safeguard medicines; a complex supply chain to ensure timely delivery; and the exploitation of local knowledge and expertise to expand the uptake of LPG by Mozambicans. Practical implications: The case study focuses on a business problem with significant development implications. The challenge is to ensure a reliable supply of LPG in Northern Mozambique. To meet this challenge, VidaGás must achieve its stated goal of becoming a revenue-generating entity within three years. In order to create a viable market for LPG, VidaGás must not only increase the uptake of LPG by poor consumers, it must expand LPG market access to commercial consumers, while raising additional capital.

In addition to enteric (animal-derived) CH 4, excreta are another source of CH4, especially when stored anaerobically. Increasing the proportion of dietary concentrate is often considered as the primary CH4 mitigation option. However, it is unclear whether this is still valid when diets to be compared are energy-balanced. In addition, non-structural carbohydrates and side effects on nitrogen (N) emissions may be important. In this experiment, diet types representing either forage-only or mixed diets were examined for their effects on CH4 and N emissions from animals and their slurries in 18 lactating cows. Apart from a hay-only diet, treatments included two mixed diets consisting of maize stover, pelleted whole maize plants and gluten or barley straw and grain and soy bean meal. The diets were balanced in crude protein and net energy for lactation. After adaptation, data and samples were collected for 8 days including a 2-day CH4 measurement in respiratory chambers. Faeces and urine, combined proportionately according to excretion, were used to determine slurry-derived CH4 and N emissions. Slurry was stored for 15 weeks at either 14°C or 27°C, and temperatures were classified as cool and warm, respectively. The low-starch hay-only diet had high organic matter and fibre digestibility and proved to be equally effective on the cows performance as mixed diets. The enteric CH4 formation remained unaffected by the diet except when related to digested fibre. In this case emission was lowest with the hay-only diet (61 v. 88 to 101 g CH4/kg digested NDF). Feeding the hay diet resulted in the highest slurry-CH 4 production after 7 weeks of storage at 14°C and 27°C, and after 15 weeks at 14C. CH4 emissions were, in general, about 10-fold higher at 27°C compared with 14°C but only after 15 weeks of storage. Urinary N losses were highest with the barley diet and lowest with the maize diet. There was a trend towards similar differences in N losses from the slurry of these cows (significant at 14°C). However, contrary to CH4, slurry-N emissions seemed to be temperature-independent. In conclusion, energetically balanced diets proved to be widely equivalent in their emission potential when combining animal and their slurry, this even at a clearly differing forage : concentrate ratio. The variation in CH4 emission from slurry stored shortly or at cold temperature for 15 weeks was of low importance as such conditions did not support methanogenesis in slurry anyway. © The Animal Consortium 2011.","carbohydrate; dairy cows; methane; nitrogen; slurry","Animalia; Bos; Bovidae; Glycine max; Hordeum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952897952

Sophisticated multi-scale theoretical techniques have been considered as a valuable tool for the prediction of materials storage properties. Such techniques have also been used for the investigation of hydrogen storage in a novel category of porous materials known as Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs). These framework materials are consisted of light elements and are characterized by exceptional physicochemical properties such as large surface areas and pore volumes. Combinations of ab initio, Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Grand Canonical Monte-Carlo (GCMC) calculations have been performed to investigate the hydrogen adsorption in these ultra-light materials. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the theoretical hydrogen storage studies that have been published after the discovery of COFs. Experimental and theoretical studies have proven that COFs have comparable or better hydrogen storage abilities than other competitive materials such as MOF. The key factors that can lead to the improvement of the hydrogen storage properties of COFs are highlighted, accompanied with some recently presented theoretical multi-scale studies concerning these factors. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Ab initio; Covalent organic frameworks; Energy carriers; Grand canonical Monte-Carlo; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen storage materials; Hydrogen storage properties; Key factors; Large surface area; Light elements; Limiting step; Multiscales; Physicochemical property; Pore volume; Scientific community; Storage properties; Theoretical investigations; Theoretical study; Theoretical technique; Ultra-light; Calculations; Chemical elements; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen; Materials properties; Molecular dynamics; Porous materials; Storage (materials); Hydrogen storage; hydrogen; organic compound; absorption; chemical model; chemistry; computer simulation; isolation and purification; review; Absorption; Computer Simulation; Hydrogen; Models, Chemical; Organic Chemicals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952666433

Either Fe2O3 or CoO NPs were grown onto rGO sheets in ethanol solution through a solvothermal process, during which GOs were reduced to rGO without the addition of any strong reducing agent, e.g. hydrazine, or requiring any post-high-temperature annealing process. The GO or rGO during the precipitation of metal oxide NPs may act as heterogeneous nucleation seeds to facilitate the formation of small crystal grains. This may allow more efficient diffusion of Li ions and lead to high specific capacities. These metal oxide NPs-rGO hybrids were used as anodes for Li-ion batteries, which showed high capacities and excellent charge-discharge cycling stability in the voltage window between 0.01 and 3.0 V. For example, Fe2O 3 NPs/rGO hybrids showed specific capacity of 881 mA h g-1 in the 90th cycle at a discharge current density of 302 mA g -1 (0.3 C), while CoO NPs/rGO hybrids showed a lower capacity of 600 mA h g-1 in the 90th cycle at a discharge current density of 215 mA g-1 (0.3 C). These nanohybrids also show excellent capacities at high C rate currents, e.g. 611 mA h g-1 for Fe 2O3/rGO sample in the 300th cycle at 2014 mA g-1 (2 C). Such synthesis technique can be a promising route to produce advanced electrode materials for Li-ion batteries. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Advanced electrodes; Charge-discharge cycling stability; Cyclability; Discharge current density; Environment friendly; Ethanol solutions; Facile synthesis; Heterogeneous nucleation; High capacity; High specific capacity; High-temperature annealing; Li-ion batteries; Lithium storage capacity; Metal oxides; Nanohybrids; One step; Small crystals; Solvothermal process; Specific capacities; Synthesis techniques; Transition metal oxide nanoparticles; Voltage window; Anodes; Cobalt compounds; Ethanol; Graphene; Ions; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Metallic compounds; Transition metals; Precipitation (chemical); graphite; lithium; metal; nanomaterial; oxide; article; chemistry; energy transfer; equipment; equipment design; isolation and purification; particle size; power supply; ultrastructure; Electric Power Supplies; Energy Transfer; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Graphite; Lithium; Metals; Nanostructures; Oxides; Particle Size",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952642176

Aqueous solutions containing InCl3 and SC(NH 2)2 at a molar ratio of In/S = 1/3 and 1/6 were deposited onto preheated glass sheets at substrate temperatures Ts = 205-410 °C. The obtained films were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM,) optical transmission spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). According to XRD, thin films deposited at Ts = 205-365 °C were composed of the (0 0 12) orientated tetragonal β-In2S 3 phase independent of the In/S ratio in the spray solution. Depositions performed at Ts = 410 °C led to the formation of the In2O3 phase, preferably when the 1/3 solution was sprayed. Post-deposition annealing in air indicated that oxidation of the sulphide phase has a minor role in the formation of In2O3 at temperatures up to 450 °C. In2S3 films grown at T s below 365 °C exhibited transparency over 70% in the visible spectral region and Eg of 2.90-2.96 eV for direct and 2.15-2.30 eV for indirect transitions, respectively. Film thickness and chlorine content decreased with increasing deposition temperatures. The XPS study revealed that the In/S ratio in the spray solution had a significant influence on the content of oxygen (Me-O, BE = 530.0 eV) in the In2S3 films deposited in the temperature range of 205-365 °C.

Coal is regarded as the most important indigenous energy source in Turkey together with hydropower to strengthen the supply security of the country. Turkish government set targets to fully utilize coal reserves of the country in next decades. However, the country is also in the process of becoming an EU Member State, hence, it is expected that the energy policies have to comply with the EU. Moreover, Turkey ratified Kyoto Protocol in 2009, thus the country should limit CO2 emission together with other greenhouse gases. The probable obstacles that Turkey may face due to the utilization of coal were determined as CO2 emissions, lack of technology and application in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and health and safety issues. It is concluded that coal is a very important domestic energy source for Turkey but new policies have to be developed and adopted immediately, and more realistic targets for the country should be set accordingly. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Coal; Energy policy; Turkey","Carbon capture and storage; Coal reserves; Domestic energy; Energy source; Energy strategy; Health and safety; KYOTO protocol; Member state; Supply security; Turkey; Turkish government; Coal industry; Emission control; Energy policy; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Coal; carbon sequestration; coal; energy policy; energy resource; European Union; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; sustainable development; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952071027

The best examples of support mechanisms presented in the last two decades have been the various schemes for the promotion of renewable energy sources (RES). In the EU, the most successful supporting schemes are feed-in tariffs which have significantly increased utilisation of renewable energy sources in Germany, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and many other EU countries. Despite the successful feed-in tariffs for RES promotion, in many cases RES penetration is limited by power system requirements linked to the intermittency of RES sources and technical capabilities of grids. These problems can be solved by implementation of energy storage technologies like reversible or pumped hydro, hydrogen, batteries or any other technology that can be used for balancing or dump load. In this paper, feed-in tariffs for various energy storage technologies are discussed along with a proposal for their application in more appropriate regions. After successful application on islands and outermost regions, energy storage tariffs should be also applied in mainland power systems. Increased use of energy storage could optimise existing assets on the market. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Feed-in tariffs; Renewable energy sources","Denmark; Dump load; EU countries; Feed-in tariff; Germany; Intermittency; Market condition; Market integration; New energy technologies; Portugal; Power systems; Renewable energy source; Storage technology; Support mechanism; Supporting scheme; Technical capabilities; Commerce; Flywheels; Hydrogen storage; Natural resources; Technology; Renewable energy resources; electricity; energy policy; European Union; renewable resource; technology adoption; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952068222

The first three tasks are achieved by controlling the pulse width modulation inverter interfacing the PV array to the system. The fourth is realized by a modified fuzzy logic controller of the diesel engine. The obstacles encountered on operating the system under certain probable loading conditions are addressed. Two different operation strategies are proposed to provide high-quality power under all loading scenarios, and to achieve the targets of the control scheme.

In this paper we discuss the definition of an appropriate functional unit and the establishment of effective system boundaries in terms of activity, time and space, with an emphasis on the comparison of buildings. The functional unit can be defined at the level of building component, complete building, or services provided by the built environment. Energy use or carbon emissions per unit of mass or volume of material is inadequate as a functional unit because equal masses or volumes of different materials do not fulfil the same function. Activity-based system boundaries include life cycle processes such as material production, product operation, and post-use material management. If the products compared are functionally equivalent, such that the impacts occurring during the operation phase are equal, we suggest that this phase may be dropped from the analysis allowing a focus on material flows. The use of wood co-products as biofuel can be analytically treated through system expansion, and compared to an alternative of providing the same energy service with fossil fuels. The assumed production of electricity used for material processing is another important energy-related issue, and we suggest that using marginal production data is more appropriate than average production. Temporal system boundaries include such aspects of the wood life cycle as the dynamics of forest growth including regeneration and saturation, the availability of residue biofuels at different times, and the duration of carbon storage in products. The establishment of spatial boundaries can be problematic, because using wood-based materials instead of non-wood materials requires more land area to capture solar energy and accumulate biomass. We discuss several possible approaches to meet this challenge, including the intensification of land use to increase the time rate of biomass production. Finally, we discuss issues related to scaling up an analysis of wood substitution from the micro-level to the macro-level of national, regional or global. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Activity-based; Biomass productions; Built environment; Carbon balance; Carbon emissions; Carbon storage; Comparative analysis; Energy services; Energy use; Forest growth; Functional units; Land areas; Life-cycle process; Material Flow; Material management; Material processing; Non-wood; Operation phase; Per unit; Product operations; Production data; Scaling-up; System boundary; System expansion; Temporal systems; Time and space; Time-rate; Wood Co; Wood-based materials; Biofuels; Ecology; Fossil fuels; Reforestation; Solar energy; Wood; Wood fuels; alternative energy; biofuel; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; comparative study; electricity generation; energy efficiency; fossil fuel; land use; life cycle; regeneration; solar power; spatial analysis; wood; Buildings; Carbon Dioxide; Construction; Emission; Energy; Fossil Fuels; Storage; Sun Light; Wood Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951813422

Furthermore, solar radiation estimates are important in energy studies for buildings, as during the cooling load calculation for air conditioning systems. The calculation of the solar radiation and shading involves many equations and a lot of influencing factors must be considered. Therefore, a Matlab GUI was developed that execute the equations and considers all the influencing factors. The program calculates the solar radiation and shadows caused by a rectangle as well as shadows on a rectangle surface caused by fins beside it. The user only has to set few values (like the location, time, etc.) and he can choose between the calculations either for a selectable time of the day or for a completely day. Then the results are plotted either in simple editor frames or in 2D- and 3D-graphics. The program also shows the results of some influencing angles subject to the location of the sun in the sky that can be helpful for many applications.

Leptin is a protein hormone synthesized and secreted by adipose tissue. The expression of leptin is strongly dependent on growth and luteinizing hormones, which play an important role in the brain-pituitary axis. The concentration of leptin in blood plasma increases with age and obesity and is associated with the level of leptin mRNA in adipose tissue. Selection of appropriate internal control gene (ICG) for normalization of quantitative PCR data for genes of interest is critical for interpretation of results. The estimation of leptin mRNA is important in the research on regulation of feed intake and metabolic and energy balance. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the stability of mRNA expression for a number of candidate housekeeping genes in the porcine backfat tissue across different breeds. In our study we used a freeware computer program (geNorm) to evaluate the most stable among eight ICG genes (β-actin, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1, TATA binding protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1, 60S ribosomal protein L27, 40S ribosomal protein S29, eukaryotic elongation factor (1) in 90. mRNA samples of backfat tissue. In the study we used three breeds differing in muscling: Polish Large White (n = 30), Polish Landrace (n=30) and Pietrain (n=30). The results showed that the three most stable genes were ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1 (OAZ1), 60S ribosomal protein L27 (RPL27) and β-actin (M=0.579, 0.602 and 0.607, respectively). In order to evaluate the abundance of leptin mRNA, the two most stable genes were used. The highest level of mRNA expression was obtained for PL and the lowest for Pietrain pigs. These results confirmed previous studies which showed that pigs with lean carcass were characterized by a lower level of leptin transcript compared to pigs with large fat deposit. Moreover, we analyzed relationship between C3469T Lep polymorphism and level of leptin mRNA, but did not find significant associations. Our study provides a new panel of housekeeping genes for normalization of the expression of a gene of interest in adipose tissue. © 2010 The American Meat Science Association.","Adipose tissue; Expression; Leptin; Optimization; Pig","Adipose tissue; Antizyme; Blood plasma; Computer program; Cytokines; Elongation factor; Expression; Feed intake; Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Housekeeping gene; Internal controls; Leptin; mRNA expression; Ornithine decarboxylase; Phosphoribosyltransferase; Pig; Quantitative PCR; Real time RT-PCR; Ribosomal proteins; TATA-binding proteins; Amino acids; Blood; Endocrinology; Hormones; Nucleic acids; Optimization; Polymerase chain reaction; Proteins; Rating; Tissue; Gene expression; actin; antizyme; leptin; messenger RNA; protein; ribosomal proteins L27; ribosome protein; leptin; messenger RNA; abdominal subcutaneous fat; animal; article; body weight; comparative study; diet; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; single nucleotide polymorphism; species difference; swine; abdominal subcutaneous fat; pig; Actins; Animals; Body Weight; Diet; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Leptin; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Proteins; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ribosomal Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Species Specificity; Subcutaneous Fat, Abdominal; Sus scrofa; Eukaryota; Pieris brassicae; Suidae; Sus; Actins; Animals; Body Weight; Diet; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Leptin; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Proteins; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ribosomal Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Species Specificity; Subcutaneous Fat, Abdominal; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649928303

Thirty six coatings of six colors containing different quantities of PCMs in different melting points were produced. Accordingly, infrared reflective (cool) and common coatings with the same binder system and of the same color were prepared for a comparative thermal evaluation. The samples were divided in six groups of different color and eight samples each: three PCM coatings of different melting temperatures (18 °C, 24 °C, 28 °C) each one of two different PCM concentrations (20% w/w, 30% w/w), an infrared reflective and a common coating of matching color. Surface temperature of the samples was recorded at a 24 h basis during August 2008. The results demonstrate that all PCM coatings present lower surface temperatures than infrared reflective and common coatings. Analysis of the daily temperature differences showed that peak temperature differences occur between PCM and common or cool coatings from 7 am to 10 am. Investigating the temperature gradient revealed that for this time period the values for PCM coatings are lower compared to infrared reflective and common. From 10 am to 12 pm, temperature gradients for all coatings have similar values. Thus coatings containing PCMs store heat in a latent form maintaining constant surface temperatures and discharge with time delay. PCM doped cool colored coatings have the potential to enhance thermal inertia and achieve important energy savings in buildings maintaining a thermally comfortable indoor environment, while fighting urban heat island when applied on external surfaces. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Latent heat storage; PCM doped cool colored coatings; Phase change material; Urban heat island","Binder systems; Colored coatings; Constant surface temperatures; Cool coating; Daily temperatures; Energy saving; External surfaces; H basis; In-buildings; Indoor environment; Melting temperatures; Peak temperatures; Phase Change; Surface temperatures; Temperature gradient; Thermal evaluations; Thermal inertia; Time-periods; Urban fabrics; Urban heat island; Atmospheric temperature; Color; Color matching; Heat storage; Latent heat; Melting point; Phase change materials; Storage (materials); Surface properties; Thermal gradients; Thermal pollution; Reflective coatings; building; coating; construction material; heat island; mitigation; surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649447102

Forty invited participants from around the world spent a week presenting and debating research and practice in the area of obesity. A unique feature of this forum was that it was cross-disciplinary with participants ranging from those working in public health with a background in medicine, paediatrics, nutrition, nursing, education, policy analysis, behaviour and social sciences, and exercise physiology to those working in the food industry and health insurance. The link between our current affluent lifestyle and increasing obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and the associated morbidity and mortality is well established. Interventions have involved individual patient clinician encounters aimed at weight loss and broader public health interventions with the goal of prevention and management of obesity. However, what is often overlooked is the need to also understand the psychosocial implications and issues for those living with a large body in a society where the prevailing culture, including that of health professionals, espouses a lean body as the ideal and excess weight as a testimony to greed, sloth and lack of will power. In this paper we share observations and learning from Round Table participation together with some of our own research interests. ©NZMA.",,"cholecystokinin; glucagon like peptide; insulin; leptin; oxytocin; pectin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; sex hormone; sterol regulatory element binding protein; uncoupling protein; adrenergic stimulation; aerobic metabolism; basal metabolic rate; body composition; cardiovascular disease; dietary fiber; disease course; energy balance; epigenetics; exercise; health; health hazard; human; hypothalamus function; lipid storage; lipogenesis; long term care; medical research; metabolic syndrome X; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; nutrition; obesity; oxidative stress; practice guideline; review; thermogenesis; thyroid function; weight gain; weight reduction; Congresses as Topic; Diet; Diet, Reducing; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; Homeostasis; Humans; Obesity; Risk Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951494412

Sixteen boars (64kg live weight±1.5kg) were assigned to one of four dietary treatments (T) varying in benzoic acid concentration: (T1) 0g benzoic acid/kg (as fed); (T2) 10g benzoic acid/kg; (T3) 20g benzoic acid/kg; (T4) 30g benzoic acid/kg. Animals were housed in individual metabolism crates and feed was provided ad libitum. All diets were formulated to have similar concentration of digestible energy and ileal digestible lysine with benzoic acid replacing wheat in the diet. There was a linear decrease in NH3 emission (P&lt;0.001), as the dietary benzoic acid concentration increased (141.4mg/g versus 40.5mg/g N intake (S.E.M. 12.1) over the 240-h storage period). However, there was no effect (P&gt;0.05) of benzoic acid on odour concentration. Urinary nitrogen (N) excretion, total N excretion and the urinary:faecal N ratio were linearly reduced (P&lt;0.05) with increasing benzoic acid inclusion. Furthermore, N retention increased linearly (P&lt;0.05) as benzoic acid concentration increased from 0g/kg to 30g/kg in the diet. In conclusion, the inclusion of benzoic acid in the diet of finishing pigs has the potential to reduce total and urinary N excretion and the urinary to faecal N ratio. This was mirrored by reductions in manure NH3 emissions in the benzoic acid supplemented treatments. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonia; Benzoic acid; Odour; Pigs","Animalia; Suidae; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78951479232

This energy can be next transferred to a semiconductor substrate via a near-field channel, in a more efficient manner in comparison with the direct photo-effect. We explain this enhancement by inclusion of indirect interband transitions in a semiconductor layer due to the near-field coupling with plasmon radiation in nanoscale of the metallic components, where the momentum is not conserved as the system is not translationally invariant. The model of the nanosphere plasmons is developed (random phase approximation, analytical version, adjusted to description of large metallic clusters, with a radius of 10-60 nm) including surface and volume modes. Damping of plasmons is analysed via Lorentz friction, and irradiation losses in the far- and near-field regimes. Resulting resonance shifts are verified experimentally for Au and Ag colloidal water solutions with respect to particle size. Probability of the electron interband transition (within the Fermi golden rule) in the substrate semiconductor induced by coupling to plasmons in the near-field regime turns out to be significantly larger than for coupling of electrons to planar-wave photons. This is of practical importance for enhancement of thin-film solar cell efficiency, both for semiconductor type (such as III-V semiconductor based cells) and for conjugate-polymer-based or dye organic plastic cells, intensively developed at present. We have described also a non-dissipative collective mode of surface plasmons in a chain of near-field-coupled metallic nanospheres, for particular size, separation parameters and wavelengths.

Additionally, there are other aspects which usually must be ensured in order to get an acceptable performance of WSNs, such as area coverage and network connectivity. This paper proposes a procedure for enhancing the performance of WSNs: a multiobjective hybrid optimization algorithm is employed for solving the Dynamic Coverage and Connectivity Problem (DCCP) in flat WSNs subjected to node failures. This method combines a multiobjective global on-demand algorithm (MGoDA), which improves the current DCCP solution using a Genetic Algorithm, with a local on line algorithm (LoA), which is intended to restore the network coverage soon after any failure. The proposed approach is compared with an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based approach and a similar mono-objective approach with regard to coverage, network lifetime and required running time for achieving the optimal solution provided by each method. Results achieved for a test instance show that the hybrid approach presented can improve the performance of the WSN obtaining good solutions with a considerably smaller computational time than ILP. The multiobjective approach still provides a feasible method for extending WSNs lifetime with slight decreasing in the network mean coverage. © 2006 IEEE.","Evolutionary algorithms; multiobjective optimization; performance evaluation; wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Computational time; Connectivity problems; Dynamic coverages; Energy efficient; Evolutionary approach; Hybrid approach; Hybrid optimization algorithm; Integer Linear Programming; Multi objective; Multiobjective approach; Network connectivity; Network coverage; Network lifetime; Node failure; On-line algorithms; Optimal solutions; Performance evaluation; Running time; Storage limitation; Test instances; Computer network performance evaluation; Evolutionary algorithms; Integer programming; Internet protocols; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Sensors; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79251607125

The bill also continues the emphasis on the research and development of advanced and cellulosic bioenergy authorized in the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (P.L. 110-140). Farm bill debate over U.S. biomass-based renewable energy production policy focused mainly on the continuation of subsidies for ethanol blenders, continuation of the import tariff for ethanol, and the impact of corn-based ethanol on agriculture. The enacted bill requires reports on the economic impacts of ethanol production, reflecting concerns that the increasing share of corn production being used for ethanol had contributed to high commodity prices and food price inflation. Title VII, the research title of the 2008 farm bill, contains numerous renewable energy related provisions that promote research, development, and demonstration of biomass-based renewable energy and biofuels. The Sun Grant Initiative coordinates and funds research at land grant institutions onbiobased energy technologies. The Agricultural Bioenergy Feedstock and Energy Efficiency Research and Extension Initiative provides support for on-farm biomass energy crop production research and demonstration. Title IX, the energy title of the farm bill, authorizes mandatory funds (not subject to appropriations) of $1.1 billion, and discretionary funds (subject to appropriations) totaling $1.0 billion, for the FY2008-FY2012 period. Energy grants and loans provided through initiatives such as the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels promote the development of cellulosic biorefinery capacity. The Repowering Assistance Program supports increasing efficiencies in existing refineries. Programs such as the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) assist rural communities and businesses in becoming more energy-efficient and self-sufficient, with an emphasis on small operations. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program, the Biorefinery Assistance Program, and the Forest Biomass for Energy Program provide support to develop alternative feedstock resources and the infrastructure to support the production, harvest, storage, and processing of cellulosic biomass feedstocks. Cellulosic feedstocks-for example, switchgrass and woody biomass-are given high priority both in research and funding. Title XV of the 2008 farm bill contains tax and trade provisions. It continues current biofuels tax incentives, reducing those for corn-based ethanol but expanding tax credits for cellulosic ethanol. The tariff on ethanol imports is extended. Implementation of the farm bill's energy provisions is underway. President Obama, in May 2009, directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) to accelerate implementation of renewable energy programs.

These capacitors store charge at the surface of the electrodes instead of within the electrodes similar to batteries. Hybrid capacitors store 85 to 115% more energy than a conventional ultracapacitor, while retaining a higher cycle life than a battery.

The world is suffering from a critical shortage in water and energy; the researchers must work hard to find sources of potable water and renewable energy. Energy and water saving techniques have a great importance especially in this transmission period. In this paper analyses were done for discrete water supply in hot water storage tanks, aiming to reduce energy and water losses. The analyses were based on an experimental study for the temperature distribution in the hot water storage tank for different flow rates and off periods, 3, 6, and 9 L/min, and 5, 10, and 15 minutes were considered for flow rates and off periods respectively. It has been found that increasing the hot water consumption rate reduces the total delivered hot water to the consumer. The analyses indicated increase in the usable hot water for small and medium off periods. This increase results in water and energy saving for the consumer. © 2011 Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.","Discrete water supply; Domestic storage tank; Energy saving; Hot water management; Usable energy","Domestic hot water; Domestic storage tank; Experimental studies; Hot water; Hot water storage tanks; Human lives; Renewable energies; Usable energy; Water and energies; Water loss; Water saving; Energy conservation; Flow rate; Heat pump systems; Hot water distribution systems; Potable water; Thermoanalysis; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Water tanks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053642607

Discharge and laser parameters in high-pressure gas mixtures are studied. It is shown that the IES generator produces a high-voltage pre-pulse and the sharp increase of discharge current, which allows to form a long-lived stable discharge in different gas mixtures. Therewith the pre-pulse parameters can be easily controlled and optimized for each gas mixture. Without the IES breakdown voltage and amplitude of the first discharge, the current spike decreases by a factor of 1.5-2 and results in pure laser parameters. The maximal radiation power, output energy and the laser pulse duration of a N2 laser are obtained. The UV output is as high as 50 mJ in 40 ns pulse duration (FWHM), while that on the IR transition exceeds 25 mJ. The cascade lasing on N2 molecule transitions is achieved. As a result, the total pulse duration on the C3∏u-B3∏g band is extended up to 100 ns. The improvement of both pulse duration and output energy are achieved for XeCl, XeF and KrF excimer lasers. The maximal efficiency of XeF laser is as high as 1.6%, while peak output is 0.85 J and maximal pulse duration exceeds 200 ns.

These threats require the adoption of effective power saving measures aimed at three principal objectives: the elimination of wastage, the reduction of power usage particularly during peak demand periods and, more importantly, improving the efficiency of high power-demand processes. It is reasonable to assume that the greatest impact will be achieved by concentrating on those processes that are large electrical power consumers. For Anglo Platinum operations, mine ventilation and, currently to a lesser extent, mine cooling are two continuous processes that fall in this category. It is estimated that these may consume fifteen to thirtyfive per cent of the power delivered to the shaft head-depending on the shaft's design. Mine ventilation systems suffer from inherent, historical inefficiencies that lead to excessive power consumption. Air cooling systems are designed to be energy-wise in terms of modulating refrigeration plant operation to meet the underground requirements while maximizing use of 'free' cooling from surface conditions. Currently about ninety-five per cent of the refrigeration capacity used in Anglo Platinum mines is dedicated to surface bulk air coolers. The net thermal efficiency of these systems is compromised as mines expand in depth and on strike. Looking to the future, this practice will be complemented by more energy demanding underground cooling tactics requiring considerably higher electrical power consumption per unit ton produced. To counter this increase in power consumption, more energyefficient systems and advantageous transient strategies such as thermal storage and the use of ice-on surface and possibly even underground-are being considered. This paper describes work currently undertaken and planned by Anglo Platinum operations to reduce power consumption by main fans during off-shift periods, the associated efforts currently introduced to reduce underground air leakage, the possibility of introducing more efficient auxiliary ventilation systems, the feasibility of thermal storage, and a brief look at energy recovery system as a means of countering the anticipated power demand associated with underground cooling. © The Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2011.","Air wastage; Chilled service water; Energy efficiency; Energy recovery; Fan selection; Mine air cooling; Mine ventilation","Air cooler; Air cooling system; Air leakage; Anglo platinums; Auxiliary ventilation; Chilled service water; Continuous process; Cooling strategy; Electrical power; Electrical power consumption; Energy efficient; Energy recovery; Energy recovery system; High-power; Main fans; Mine ventilation systems; Mining operations; New projects; Peak demand; Per unit; Power Consumption; Power demands; Power savings; Power usage; Refrigeration capacity; Refrigeration plants; Surface conditions; Thermal efficiency; Thermal storage; Cooling; Cooling systems; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Mine ventilation; Mining; Platinum; Platinum mines; Recovery; Refrigeration; Mine shafts",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952285401

Increase in temperature leads to domination of the free volume contribution over the cohesive strength, affecting mechanisms of the debonding process, examined with a probe tack test. Linear viscoelastic properties and probe tack adhesion of five types of PSAs have been studied: polyisobutylene (PIB); acrylic, styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) triblock copolymer; hydrogen-bonded complex of high molecular weight poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), PVP; with oligomeric poly(ethylene glycol), PEG; and plasticized polybase-polyacid polyelectrolyte complex (PEC). The transition from solid-like mechanism of debonding to ductile type of adhesive bond failure with fibrillation of adhesive layer has been established to occur for all examined PSAs under temperature increase within the range from -20 to 80°C. The Dahlquist criterion of tack, which defines the value of the storage modulus, G', below 0.1MPa, featured for all the PSAs demonstrating maximum work of debonding, has been found to have a universal character and holds at corresponding temperatures for all the PSAs examined, including both typical and innovative adhesives. In addition to this adhesion predictor we have also established that for all the PSAs the transition from a solid-like debonding mechanism to a ductile type of debonding is observed in the range of G'=0.09-0.34MPa. The value of the dissipation factor, tan δ, is also included in the analysis of correlation between linear viscoelasticity and probe tack behavior. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cohesive strength - free volume ratio; Linear viscoelastic properties; Mechanisms of debonding; Pressure sensitive adhesives; Probe tack behavior","Adhesive bond; Adhesive layers; Cohesive strength; Debonding process; Dissipation factors; Effect of temperature; High energy; High molecular weight; Hydrogen-bonded complexes; Linear viscoelastic; Linear viscoelasticity; Maximum works; Molecular levels; N-vinyl pyrrolidone; Poly acids; Polyelectrolyte complexes; Polyisobutylenes; Pressure sensitive adhesives; Probe tack test; Storage moduli; Styrene-isoprene-styrene; Temperature increase; Triblock copolymers; Volume ratio; Adhesion; Adhesive joints; Block copolymers; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Free volume; Hydrogen bonds; Oligomers; Organic polymers; Peeling; Plastic adhesives; Polyethylene glycols; Polyethylene oxides; Probes; Styrene; Viscoelasticity; Debonding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951840529

The module is remotely controlled and consists essentially of eight capacitor cells with semiconductor switches built around reverse-switching dynistors (RSDs). It includes a charger with a high-frequency inverter, a protective contactor with normally closed high-voltage contacts, cell RSD switch controls, and control and diagnostic equipment provided with a programmable logic controller. The semiconductor switches in the capacitor cells are triggered by light pulses transmitted from a remote-control panel over eight fiber-optic cables. Information exchange between the module control and diagnostic system and the remote terminal is realized likewise over two fiber-optic cables. The storage is designed to operate in a programmable discharge mode in which the semiconductor switches in the capacitor cells are activated by a preset time-sequence program. The maximum current pulse amplitude of 400 kA at the module output is reached under synchronous discharge of all eight cells in the short-circuit mode. In these conditions, the pulse rise time is 150 μs.

These mice spontaneously consume less food when fed ad libitum and live longer compared with wild-type (WT) control mice. αMUPA mice are obesity resistant and they share many similarities with calorically restricted animals. However, extensive metabolic characterization of this unique transgenic model has never been performed.Method:Metabolism of αMUPA mice was analyzed by measuring hormone, lipid and glucose levels in the serum, as well as gene and protein expression levels in the liver, hypothalamus and brainstem.Results:αMUPA mice were found to be leaner than WT mice mainly because of reduced fat depots. Serum analyses showed that αMUPA mice have high levels of the anorexigenic hormones insulin and leptin, and low levels of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin. Analyses of brain neuropeptides showed that the transcript of the anorexigenic neuropeptide Pomc is highly expressed in the brainstem, whereas the expression of the orexigenic neuropeptides Npy, Orexin and Mch is blunted in the hypothalamus of αMUPA mice. In addition, adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels were higher in the liver and lower in the hypothalamus, thus promoting simultaneously central reduction in appetite and peripheral loss of fat. The levels of SIRT1 were low in the liver, but high in the hypothalamus, a feature that αMUPA mice share with calorically restricted animals.Conclusion:Taken together, αMUPA mice exhibit a unique metabolic phenotype of low-calorie intake and high leptin levels, and could serve as a model for both spontaneous calorie restriction and resistance to obesity. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The in situ measurements will provide a focussed insight into three carefully chosen microclimates (urban, suburban-agriculture, and suburban-desert) and provide at the same time ground-truth data for satellite image analysis, which will expand the acquired knowledge into the spatial domain. In situ measurements were made during a field campaign in Greater Cairo from November 2007 to February 2008. In this study, the dataset of the CAPAC measurement campaign will be presented and analysed in terms of use for a remote sensing study. Measured variables complied with our expectations. The urban area featured a distinct nocturnal heat island. During the day the choice of reference station was responsible for the magnitude of the heat island. The diurnal cycle of radiative temperature at the suburban-desert station clearly exceeded the one at the urban station, thus the urban setting seemed to have a better heat storage than the suburban-desert. The stations also determined the partitioning of the turbulent heat fluxes. While in Cairo and at the suburban-desert station most of the available energy was partitioned into the sensible heat flux, the suburban-agricultural station maintained a high latent heat flux. The radiation and soil heat flux measurements proved to be applicable for comparison with remotely sensed data. However, the analysis of the turbulent heat fluxes showed that several constraints exist: measured fluxes tend to underestimate the actual flux and directional effects complicate the interpretation. An energy balance closure and footprint modelling is necessary to compare measured fluxes with satellite image retrieved products. Finally, turbulent fluxes are time averages, which is contrary to the remote sensing principle. Consequently, a direct use is problematic. © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society.","Cairo; Eddy covariance; Egypt; Energy balance; Remote sensing; Urban; Urban heat island","Cairo; Eddy covariance; Egypt; Urban; Urban heat island; Air quality; Energy balance; Heat storage; Landforms; Measurements; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space optics; Time domain analysis; Heat flux; atmospheric pollution; eddy covariance; energy balance; heat island; in situ measurement; microclimate; remote sensing; satellite data; urban atmosphere; urban climate; Cairo [Egypt]; Egypt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751698667

This condition makes it feasible to utilize both lignite and geothermal energy in a hybrid form for combined power heat, and cold generation, which may lead to optimally energy and exergy efficient, environmentally benign, and economically sound applications. This paper presents a novel concept of hybrid lignite-geothermal plant for a district energy system and hydrogen production facility in Aydin with special emphasis on high performance, green buildings and green districts. In this concept, lignite is first introduced to a partially fluidized-bed gasifier and then to a fluidized-bed gas cleaning unit, which produces synthetic gas and finally Hydrogen. The by-products, namely char and ash are used in a fluidized-bed combustor to produce power. Waste heat from all these steps are utilized in a district heating system along with heat received from geothermal production wells after power is generated there. H2S gas obtained from the separator system is coupled with hydrogen production process at the lignite plant. Absorption cooling systems and thermal storage tanks complement the hybrid system for the tri-generation district energy system. On the demand side, the new, green OSTIM OSB administration building in Ankara is exemplified for greener, low-exergy buildings that will compound the environmental benefits. © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Combined- heat and power; District energy system; Fluidized-bed gasifier; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen production","Absorption cooling; Co-located; Cold generation; Demand-side; District heating system; Energy and exergy; Energy systems; Environmental benefits; Environmentally benign; Gas cleaning; Gasifiers; Green buildings; Green cities; Heat and power; Hybrid forms; Hybrid power; Hydrogen production plant; Hydrogen production process; Lignite reserves; Novel concept; Production wells; Sustainable building; Synthetic gas; Thermal storage; Tri-generation; Cooling systems; District heating; Energy conversion; Exergy; Fluidization; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized bed combustors; Gas generators; Gas producers; Heat storage; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen production; Intelligent buildings; Lignite; Production engineering; Waste heat; Geothermal energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751470615

Molecular recognition processes lead to the formation of supramolecular PNM ensembles containing crystalline building blocks. Such low-dimensional highly ordered regions create a new physical situation and provide unique physical properties based on electron-hole QC phenomena. In the case of asymmetrical crystalline structure, basic physical phenomena such as linear electro-optic, piezoelectric, and nonlinear optical effects, described by tensors of the odd rank, should be explored. Some of the PNM crystalline structures permit the existence of spontaneous electrical polarization and observation of ferroelectricity. The PNM crystalline arrangement creates highly porous nanotubes when various residues are packed into structural network with specific wettability and electrochemical properties.We report in this review on a wide research of PNM intrinsic physical properties, their electronic and optical properties related to QC effect, unique SHG, piezoelectricity and ferroelectric spontaneous polarization observed in PNT due to their asymmetric structure. We also describe PNM wettability phenomenon based on their nanoporous structure and its influence on electrochemical properties in PNM.The new bottom-up large scale technology of PNT physical vapor deposition and patterning combined with found physical effects at nanoscale, developed by us, opens the avenue for emerging nanotechnology applications of PNM in novel fields of nanophotonics, nanopiezotronics and energy storage devices. Two sorts of vapor deposited diphenylalanine peptide nanotubes: Closed-end PNTs of nanobelt shape (a, b) contain cyclic-FF peptide molecules. They are composed from thin plates, do not demonstrate piezoelectric effect, SHG and strongly hydrophobic. Open-end hollow PNTs (c) contain linear FF molecules.

Plug-in electric vehicles promise to contribute to the flexibility of the energy system by creating a link between the power system and the transportation sector and provide the possibility to make use of the inherent energy storage of a large electric vehicle (EV) fleet. The present work investigates the effects of different EV charging strategies on the balance between wind power production and consumption in a future Danish power system. The results show that an electrification of the transport sector will indeed reduce the excess of wind power, but additional mechanisms are needed if the full wind power potential in Denmark is utilized. Further it is foreseen that the vehicle-to-grid option (where the vehicle batteries are used as backup at times with little wind power production) will have very limited effects on the overall energy management and is more likely to be used only for regulation and reserve services, also in the longer perspective. © 2010 .","Electric vehicle; V2G vehicles to grid","Charging strategies; Denmark; Energy systems; High winds; Inherent energy; Plug-ins; Power potential; Power systems; Transport sectors; Transportation sector; V2G vehicles to grid; Vehicle battery; Vehicle to grids; Wind power penetration; Wind power production; Automobiles; Electric network analysis; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy management; System stability; Wind power; Fleet operations; electric vehicle; energy conservation; power generation; transportation; wind; wind power; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957368235

This paper presents a general concept of designing a desalination system which uses a solar collectors' field to drive a reverse osmosis process through an Organic Rankine Cycle. The auxiliary equipment power demand (i.e. cooling pump, collectors' circulator and working fluid pump) is satisfied by a hybrid system based on a PV generator. An inverter is used to convert the DC to AC current while a battery array is also integrated into the system as energy storage. In order to make a complete study of the system, the pumping loads through the sea and to the area's municipal water network have been taken into consideration.The objective of the current work is to study an autonomous desalination system that can be applied to several Greek islands where two problems are to be solved at the same time: the lack of potable water and the absence of electrical grid.The investigation of the financial conditions for the realization of a feasible project of an integrated hybrid desalination system (including Solar Thermal and PV technology) is finally presented. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Hybrid solar thermal; Organic Rankine Cycle; PV; RO desalination","AC currents; Appropriate technologies; Autonomous desalination systems; Battery arrays; Cost effective; Desalination systems; Municipal water networks; Organic Rankine cycles; Power demands; PV; PV generators; Renewable energy systems; Research objectives; RO desalination; Solar thermal; Working fluid; AC generator motors; Auxiliary equipment; DC power transmission; Desalination; Hybrid systems; Innovation; Potable water; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Reverse osmosis; Solar heating; Water filtration; Rankine cycle; desalination; experimental study; osmosis; pressure gradient; thermodynamics; volume",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957354596

In the current work we performed a comparative study where two closely related and morphologically similar copepod species, Calanus finmarchicus (temperate-boreal) and Calanus glacialis (arctic), were exposed to water accommodated fractions (WAF) of oil in a series of parallel experiments. The two species, adapted to 10°C and 2°C, respectively, were compared on the basis of acute ecotoxicity (LC50) and the WAF-mediated induction of the gene encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST). In addition, an experiment was conducted in order to reveal relationships between lipid content and acute toxicity. LC50 values differed between the two species, and the Arctic copepod appeared less sensitive than the temperate-boreal species. The lipid contents of the two species, measured biometrically, were comparable, and the relationships between lipid content and response (reduced survival) to acute WAF exposure followed the same trend: Lipid-rich copepods survived longer than lipid-poor copepods at the same exposure concentration. In terms of GST expression, both species showed concentration-dependent and exposure time-dependent trends. However, as for the acute toxicity data, the Arctic copepod appeared to respond slower and with a lower intensity. From the study it can be concluded that temperature and lipid content are important factors for assessing differences between temperate and Arctic species, and that a delayed response in organisms adapted to low temperatures needs to be corrected for when extrapolating toxicity data from species with other temperature optimums for use in Arctic environments. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus glacialis; Comparative ecotoxicology; Lipid storage; Oil; Stress gene expression; Temperature; Water accommodated fraction","Arctic; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus glacialis; Eco-toxicology; Oil; Crude oil; Ecology; Experiments; Extrapolation; Gene encoding; Risk assessment; Toxicity; Gene expression; anthracene derivative; decalin; glutathione transferase; hydrocarbon; lipid; naphthalene derivative; petroleum; phenanthrene derivative; phenol derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; comparative study; crude oil; crustacean; ecotoxicology; gene expression; lipid; pollution effect; risk assessment; temperature effect; Arctic; article; biometry; concentration response; controlled study; copepod; Crustacea; ecotoxicity; LC 50; lipid composition; nonhuman; priority journal; survival rate; temperature acclimatization; time; water contamination; water temperature; Acute Toxicity Tests; Animals; Arctic Regions; Biological Markers; Copepoda; Gene Expression; Glutathione Transferase; Lipids; Petroleum; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Weather; Arctic; Calanus finmarchicus; Calanus glacialis; Copepoda; Crustacea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650981535

The largest overall source of greenhouse gas emissions is the burning of fossil fuels. The global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, the dominant greenhouse gas of concern, is increasing by roughly two parts per million per year, and the United States is currently the second-largest contributor to global emissions behind China. Limiting the Magnitude of Future Climate Change, part of the congressionally requested America's Climate Choices suite of studies, focuses on the role of the United States in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The book concludes that in order to ensure that all levels of government, the private sector, and millions of households and individuals are contributing to shared national goals, the United States should establish a ""budget"" that sets a limit on total domestic greenhouse emissions from 2010-2050. Meeting such a budget would require a major departure from business as usual in the way the nation produces and uses energy-and that the nation act now to aggressively deploy all available energy efficiencies and less carbon-intensive technologies and to develop new ones. With no financial incentives or regulatory pressure, the nation will continue to rely upon and ""lock in"" carbon-intensive technologies and systems unless a carbon pricing system is established-either cap-and-trade, a system of taxing emissions, or a combination of the two. Complementary policies are also needed to accelerate progress in key areas: developing more efficient, less carbon-intense energy sources in electricity and transportation; advancing full-scale development of new-generation nuclear power, carbon capture, and storage systems; and amending emissions-intensive energy infrastructure. Research and development of new technologies that could help reduce emissions more cost effectively than current options is also strongly recommended. © 2010 by the National Academy of Sciences.

This paper analyses the benefits of smart power grids for the integration of renewable energy resources into the existing grid infrastructure. Therefore, the concept of a smart power grid is analysed, and it is shown that it covers more than for example, time-of-use energy tariffs. Further, the communication technologies used for smart grids are discussed, and the challenge of interoperability between the smart grid itself and its active contributors such as functional buildings is shown. A significant share of electrical energy demand is and will be constituted by large functional buildings that are mostly equipped with automation systems and therefore enable a relatively simple IT integration into smart grids. This large potential of thermal storages and flexible consumption processes might be a future key to match demand and supply under the presence of a high share of fluctuating generation from renewables.

This biomass has not any commercial value and can cause a negative impact on the environment if waste handling systems and storage and treatment structures are not accurately controlled. However, this biomass can serve as feedstock for thermal gasification (partial oxidation and pyrolysis) to produce gaseous and liquid fuels. The current paper presents results on modeling studies to predict the gas composition of mixtures produced by gasification of wax palm husk (WPH) using air-steam for partial oxidation. The parameters investigated by equilibrium model are equivalence ratio and steam-fuel ratio. With the predicted composition of gases, the high heating value was estimated. Atom model was used for comparison purposes. Also, a kinetics model of the pyrolysis of WPH is presented. Thermogravimetric analysis was used to estimate the activation energy and the preexponential factor of Arrhenius equation.

The paper provides a thorough comparison of solar cracking and solar reforming of methane processes against conventional steam methane reforming. The material and energy balances show that solar cracking is the most environmentally friendly hydrogen production technique. Some of the primary advantages of solar cracking include (1) elimination of CO2emission, (2) elimination of costs associated with CO2 sequestration, transportation, and storage, and (3) generation of two commercially viable products, namely carbon black and hydrogen which can be used both as a fuel and a commodity. Considering the hydrogen shortage for different hydrogenation and fuel upgrading processes that the petrochemical industry is facing today, hydrogen production from solar cracking may offer an alternative solution. Therefore, it is important to find less energy intensive and more environmentally friendly hydrogen production techniques to meet the demand of industry. The results show that solar cracking is a more environmentally friendly and commercially competitive process compared to solar reforming and steam reforming considering that it produces virtually no carbon dioxide, but produces the commercially viable carbon black as a by-product.

Projects for carbon capture and disposal in coal seams and depleted oilfields have important economic benefits, ­significantly enhancing gas and oil productivity through enhanced coalbed methane and enhanced oil recovery, respectively. In Brazil and South America as a whole, saline aquifers have the greatest storage capacity and thus the greatest potential for CO2 disposal. Despite the costs of CO2 capture, transport, injection and monitoring in saline aquifers (at present, without direct financial returns), these projects protect the atmosphere by reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Disposal of RW in deep geological repositories raises the environmental protection issue of preventing RW from nuclear power plants from causing underground (deep aquifers) and surface contamination. In both CO2 and RW disposal, the long-term (millennial) safety of underground isolation in deep geological repositories must be assured. Thus, in selecting geological sites for permanent CO2 and RW disposal, the following should be considered: (1) the occurrence of caprocks to prevent leakage; (2) the structural and geological context (stable regions without earthquake hazards); (3) the disposal capacity; and (4) the cost-efficiency of projects. The definition and characterization of disposal sites is a key question for the energy supply and the geopolitical and environmental security of all Latin American developing countries. The need for a clean diversified energy matrix in a regional context of economic growth, global warming and climate change must be agreed upon by governments and by the public. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","CO2 geological disposal; deep geological repository; energy supply; environmental impacts; Potential sites; radioactive waste",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052581936

With the integration of TSR at HIE-ISOLDE it would become the first storage ring at an isotope separator on-line (ISOL) facility. This, in combination with the capability of going to low beam energies (some MeV/u), opens up a broad area of research and offers unique opportunities for studies in nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics. A substantial fraction of the vast number of radioactive beams produced at the ISOLDE facility could be injected into the ring for storage, beam deceleration or acceleration. As injector, the superconducting HIEISOLDE Linac could be used. The project layout at its present stage will be summarized, including the interfacing of the ring with the HIE-ISOLDE Linac beam lines. The different operational possibilities and constraints that arise when the ring is connected to an ISOL facility with a successive charge breeder will be addressed. The aspects of beam storage life-time, with and without an internal gas jet target, and attainable beam intensities at these energies will be discussed. The possibilities to perform beam cleaning inside the ring to suppress isobaric contaminants which can be present from the ISOL production stage will be evaluated.

With the new Brazilian energy matrix, it becomes increasingly necessary to know the behavior of metallic materials used in transport and storage systems of new fuels, in particular, of biodiesel. The corrosivity of traditional fuels against the structural metallic materials is well known both in the pipeline and storage tank systems, which still does not occur with biodiesel. In this study, the corrosivity of biodiesel obtained from bovine fat, soybean and castor oil against carbon steel SAE 1020 and austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 was evaluated, through gravimetric corrosion tests at different temperatures, at three different moisture levels and in closed and open environments. Stainless steel was also studied after sensitization heat treatment to simulate possible changes in microstructure due to welding operations. As the number of variables involved in the study was very large, a statistical design of experiments was adopted which reduced by 50% the amount of tests. This paper describes the adopted test methodologies, the obtained results and the discussion of the influence of the tested variables on the corrosion processes. The corrosivity of the three types of biodiesel was also verified after aging for 60 days and 120 days. The results showed no significant change in the corrosivity of either biodiesel as a function of aging time. Testing was also performed according to the NACE TM 0172 standard test method which indicates a corrosion inhibition effect of biodiesel from castor beans. © 2011, Brazilian Petroleum, Gas and Biofuels Institute - IBP","Biodiesel; Carbon steel; Corrosivity; Stainless steel",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044793074

The increasing consumption rate of this product, predicted for the upcoming years, will require safer and more efficient methods for transportation and storage through the entire transport cicle. Pipelines are the most economical way to transport it. However, there is evidence that pipeline transportation and the bottom of the storage tanks for ethanol might be susceptible to the stress corrosion cracking phenomenon. This work aims to develop a new methodology to simulate the dynamic conditions of the bottom of the storage tanks, due to the loading and unloading of the ethanol. This way, to study the crack corrosion resistance of the materials used on the tanks, was developed a system based on the concept of fluctuating loads, applied in fracture mechanics specimens. The system is composed by: A test cell with capacity of approximately one liter of solution, coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), in order to avoid electrochemical contact between the components and to prevent contamination of the solution (ethanol); A system responsible for the fluctuation of the tractive load in the specimens. Integrated to the equipment, was used a data acquisition system, a universal indicator conected to a load cell with a capacity of five tons, a continuous current source and a precision multimeter with high resolution. The measurement of the crack growth was done by the potential drop method. The system of cyclic loading (fluctuating loads) uses an electromechanical actuator and a timer to relief the static load applied. The frequency was preset to 1,4 x 10-4 Hz.

In many practical applications the solid-liquid phase change is used. For applications accurate knowledge of different thermal parameters has to be available. In particular, the temperature dependence of the enthalpy around the phase transition has to be known with good accuracy. Usually, the phase transitions of PCMs are investigated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at fast dynamic scanning rates resulting in the effective heat capacity from which the (total) heat of transition can be determined. Here we present adiabatic scanning calorimetry (ASC) as an alternative approach to arrive simultaneously at the equilibrium enthalpy curve and at the heat capacity. The applicability of ASC is illustrated with measurements on paraffin-based PCMs and on a salt hydrate PCM. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Adiabatic scanning calorimetry; Enthalpy; Heat capacity; Latent heat; Phase change materials","Calorimeters; Calorimetry; Differential scanning calorimetry; Enthalpy; Heat storage; Latent heat; Specific heat; Temperature distribution; Adiabatic scanning calorimetry; Energy storage capacity; Enthalpy curves; Measurements of; Narrow temperature ranges; Solid liquid phase change; Temperature dependence; Thermal parameters; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027935317

There are several routes by which to convert solar energy to fuels, such as electrochemical, photochemical, photobiological, and the thermochemical route, the last of which is the focus of this chapter. This route involves using solar heat at high temperatures to operate endothermic thermochemical processes. It offers some intriguing thermodynamic advantages, with direct economic implications. It is also an attractive method of storage for solar energy in chemical form. An important vector of this route is the production of hydrogen, a potentially clean alternative to fossil fuels, especially for use in the transportation sector. Synopsis There is a pressing need to develop advanced energy technologies to address the global challenges of clean energy, climate change, and sustainable development. The conversion of solar energy to fuels can basically be done through three routes, separately or in combination: the electrochemical route, which uses solar electricity; the photochemical/photobiological route, which makes direct use of solar photons; and the thermochemical route, which utilizes solar heat, usually at high temperatures, for endothermic processes. © Materials Research Society 2012.",,"Climate change; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Petroleum deposits; Proven reserves; Solar energy; Solar heating; Transportation routes; Advanced energy technologies; Alternative to fossil fuels; Economic implications; Electrochemical routes; Production of hydrogen; Thermo chemical process; Thermochemical routes; Transportation sector; Alternative fuels",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014840508

Electricity is also difficult to store in significant quantities. Therefore, secondary storage of energy is essential to increase generation capacity efficiency and to allow more substantial use of renewable energy sources that only provide energy intermittently. Lack of effective storage has often been cited as a major hurdle to substantial introduction of renewable energy sources into the electricity supply network. The author presents here a comprehensive guide to the different types of storage available. He not only shows how the use of the various types of storage can benefit the management of a power supply system, but also considers more substantial possibilities that arise from integrating a combination of different storage devices into a system.

It does so by assessing the technical, economic, environmental, political, and social risks related to all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle, from uranium mills and mines to nuclear reactors and spent fuel storage facilities. In each case, the book argues that the costs of nuclear power significantly outweigh its benefits. It concludes by calling for investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency as a better path towards an affordable, secure, and socially acceptable future. The prospect of a global nuclear renaissance could change the way that energy is produced and used the world over. Sovacool takes a hard look at who would benefit - mostly energy companies and manufacturers - and who would suffer - mostly taxpayers, those living near nuclear facilities, and electricity customers.

Dough rheological parameters were determined by farinograph, extensograph and microviscoamylograph (Brabender, Germany). Pectin (0.2-1%), guar gum (0.1-0.5%) and inulin (0.6-3%, w/w on flour basis) were added to white wheat dough according to the central composite experimental plan. The results showed that the guar gum was the most effective blend component to decrease dough softening and to raise paste peak viscosity. Pectin significantly negatively affected dough energy. Inulin slightly decreased water absorption and paste viscosity but improved dough energy.

Base of the pyramid, or the daily diet should consist of cereals and cereal products. Because of the global importance of cereals in the diet is very important in their sensitivity to the appearance of mold in certain weather conditions and production of mycotoxins, which can survive from crop to finished product. Despite many years of research and implementation of good agricultural practice (GAP) in food, and good manufacturing practice (GMP) for storage and distribution chain, mycotoxins will be a problem in a future. Mycotoxins are toxic to humans in very small quantities because they accumulate in the body and may be the causative agents of cancer. There is a risk to health if such foods are eaten every day since childhood. How will contaminate the body depends entirely on how people sometimes take these products. International organizations (WHO and FAO) recommended regulatory levels and the recommended daily intake for most mycotoxins, but they are not binding for national legislation. Domestic regulations on the control of the presence of mycotoxins in food are significantly different from those applied in EU countries. Research the market does not do often enough, and inspections of these products in health food stores is relatively rare. According the FAO estimates a quarter of the world's crops contaminated with mycotoxins require constant monitoring and careful risk analysis in production to mycotoxin contamination reduced to a minimum because the world is constantly doing new research, advanced analytics, reveals a new mycotoxins, and all lower amounts can be determined. The study was conducted during 2010. Analysis in accredited laboratory 53 samples of wheat-based products with functional components which are present in our market. The content of mycotoxins in tested foods 100% was within the limits prescribed by the ordinance because some values of mycotoxins in products allowed and considered that they are not risky.","Cereals; Functional; Mycotoxins; Safety","Accident prevention; Commerce; Crops; Engineers; Food products; Food storage; Health risks; Industrial research; Laws and legislation; Nutrition; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Accredited laboratories; Cereals; Functional; Good agricultural practices; Good Manufacturing Practices; International organizations; Mycotoxins; Recommended daily intakes; Cereal products",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991058586

Highly flammable solvent sprayed from the vessel and immediately ignited, causing an intense fire that burned for more than 4 hours. The fire was contained inside the Methomyl-Larvin insecticide unit by the Bayer CropScience fire brigade with mutual aid assistance from local volunteer and municipal fire departments. The incident occurred during the restart of the methomyl unit after an extended outage to upgrade the control system and replace the original residue treater vessel. Two company employees who had been dispatched by the control room personnel to investigate why the residue treater pressure was increasing were near the residue treater when it ruptured. One died from blunt force trauma and burn injuries sustained at the scene; the second died 41 days later at the Western Pennsylvania Burn Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Six volunteer firefighters who assisted in the unit fire suppression activities and two contractors working at the facility were treated for possible toxic chemical exposure. The Kanawha-Putnam County Emergency Management Director advised more than 40,000 residents, including the resident students at the West Virginia State University adjacent to the facility, to shelter-in-place for more than three hours as a precaution. The fire and drifting smoke forced the state police and local law enforcement authorities to close roads near the facility and the interstate highway, which disrupted traffic for hours. The Chemical Safety Board (CSB) investigation team determined that the runaway chemical reaction and loss of containment of the flammable and toxic chemicals resulted from deviation from the written start-up procedures, including bypassing critical safety devices intended to prevent such a condition. Other contributing factors included an inadequate pre-startup safety review; inadequate operator training on the newly installed control system; unevaluated temporary changes, malfunctioning or missing equipment, misaligned valves, and bypassed critical safety devices; and insufficient technical expertise available in the control room during the restart. Poor communications during the emergency between the Bayer CropScience incident command and the local emergency response agency confused emergency response organizations and delayed public announcements on actions that should be taken to minimize exposure risk. Although Bayer CropScience reported that ""no toxic chemicals were released because they were consumed in the intense fires,"" the CSB later confirmed that the only air monitors suitably placed near the unit to detect toxic chemicals were, in fact, not operational at the time of the incident. No reliable data or analytical methods were available to determine what chemicals were released, or predict any exposure concentrations. The methomyl unit used the highly toxic chemical, methyl isocyanate (MIC), in a series of complex chemical reactions to produce methomyl, a dry chemical used to make the pesticide, Larvin. MIC is manufactured in a separate production unit at the facility and stored in large underground pressure vessels. Liquid MIC was pumped to a ""day tank"" pressure vessel near the Methomyl-Larvin unit, which provided the daily production quantity of MIC for the methomyl unit and the carbofuran unit, which is about 200 feet west of the methomyl unit. The MIC storage tank adjacent to the methomyl unit and the MIC transfer piping between the production unit and the manufacturing units were not damaged, nor did the MIC storage tank overheat or pressurize above the operating limits during the fire. The CSB investigation identified the following incident causes: 1. Bayer did not apply standard Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) and turnover practices to the methomyl control system redesign project. The equipment was not tested and calibrated before the unit was restarted. 2. Operations personnel were inadequately trained to operate the methomyl unit with the new distributed control system (DCS). 3. Malfunctioning equipment and the inadequate DCS checkout prevented the operators from achieving correct operating conditions in the crystallizers and solvent recovery equipment. 4. The out-of-specification methomyl-solvent mixture was fed to the residue treater before the residue treater was pre-filled with solvent and heated to the minimum safe operating temperature. 5. The incoming process stream normally generated an exothermic decomposition reaction, but methomyl that had not crystallized due to equipment problems greatly increased the methomyl concentration in the residue treater, which led to a runaway reaction that overwhelmed the relief system and over-pressurized the residue treater. Many industrial facilities in the Kanawha river valley that surrounds Charleston, West Virginia, the state capital, handle thousands of pounds of toxic and flammable materials. Local community involvement in safe handling of hazardous chemicals and emergency planning and the Kanawha Valley Industrial Emergency Planning Council date back to the 1950s. In 1995, the planning council was renamed the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee, which functions as the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) as required by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (SARA Title III). Although federal law requires the owner or operator of the facility to promptly provide information to the LEPC necessary for developing and implementing the emergency plan [EPCRA 303(d)(3)], it does not provide LEPCs or other local agencies with the authority to conduct reviews of facility process safety programs or directly participate in hazard reviews or incident investigations. A few State governments have passed laws that authorize local governments to become directly involved with industry process safety programs. For example, the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act, created in 1986, significantly expands the requirements contained in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program (40 CFR68). In 1999, the Contra Costa County, California Board of Supervisors approved an industrial safety ordinance2 that established broad authority to the county health services department to oversee local refining and chemical industries. The ordinance includes mandatory safety plan submission by regulated industries, and audit and facility inspections by the county. Like Contra Costa County, the Kanawha valley has many facilities that handle large quantities of hazardous materials, some of which are acutely toxic. Furthermore, the valley contains environmentally sensitive areas such as the Kanawha River, which is an important transportation corridor. Yet, the local government does not have the authority to directly participate in facility safety planning and oversight even though many community stakeholders have long campaigned for such authority and involvement. The local government could adopt regulations and implement a program similar to Contra Costa County that would likely improve stakeholder awareness and improve emergency planning and accident prevention. The Bayer CropScience investigation was the agency's first case involving company assertions of Sensitive Security Information (SSI) under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. Federal law requires a company to mark all SSI containing documents and notify the recipient that the documents must be controlled in accordance with Department of Homeland Security regulations. Early in the investigation, Bayer CropScience management asserted that most of their records contained SSI information, and therefore the CSB was prohibited from releasing it to the public. The CSB consulted with the U.S. Coast Guard and determined that the Bayer claim was without basis. The president of Bayer CropScience, LP later admitted in testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce ""[W]e concede that our pursuit of SSI coverage was motivated, in part, by a desire to prevent that public debate [concerning the use of MIC] from occurring in the first place.","Emergency planning and response; Pre-startup safety review; Process hazards analysis; Process safety information; Training","Chemical industry; Chemical reactions; Chemicals; Control systems; Digital storage; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Distributed parameter control systems; Emergency services; Environmental Protection Agency; Equipment; Explosions; Fires; Flammability; Flammable materials; Hazardous materials; Hazards; Heating; Highway administration; Highway engineering; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Landforms; Law enforcement; Laws and legislation; Personnel training; Pesticides; Pressure vessels; Public utilities; Risk management; Safe handling; Safety devices; Safety engineering; Safety valves; Security systems; Solvents; Tanks (containers); Toxic materials; Waterway transportation; Emergency planning; Emergency planning and community right to know acts; Maritime transportation security acts; Process hazards analysis; Process safety informations; Safety reviews; Superfund amendments and reauthorization acts; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Accident prevention",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968754846

Federal policy is based on the premise that nuclear waste can be disposed of safely, but proposed storage and disposal facilities have frequently been challenged on safety, health, and environmental grounds. Although civilian radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of materials, most of the current debate focuses on highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 requires the DOE to dispose of the waste in a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

Over the strenuous objections of the State of Nevada, the Department of Energy (DOE) submitted a license application for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository in June 2008 to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). During the 2008 election campaign, now-President Obama lent support to Nevada's fight against the repository, contending in an issue statement that he and now-Vice President Biden ""do not believe that Yucca Mountain is a suitable site."" Under the current nuclear waste program, DOE hopes to begin transporting spent nuclear fuel and other highly radioactive waste to Yucca Mountain by 2020. That schedule is 22 years beyond the 1998 deadline established by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA). Because U.S. nuclear power plants will continue to generate nuclear waste after a repository opens, DOE estimates that all waste could not be removed from existing reactors until about 2066 even under the current Yucca Mountain schedule. Not all the projected waste could be disposed of at Yucca Mountain, however, unless NWPA's current limit on the repository's capacity is increased. If the Obama Administration decides to halt the Yucca Mountain project, it has a variety of tools available to implement that policy. Although the President cannot directly affect NRC proceedings, the Secretary of Energy could withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application under NRC rules. The President could also urge Congress to cut or eliminate funding for the Yucca Mountain project, and propose legislation to restructure the nuclear waste program. Abandonment of Yucca Mountain would probably further delay the federal government's removal of nuclear waste from reactor sites and therefore increase the government's liabilities for missing the NWPA deadline. DOE estimates that such liabilities will reach $11 billion even if Yucca Mountain opens as currently planned. DOE's agreements with states to remove defense-related high-level waste could also be affected. If the Yucca Mountain project were halted without a clear alternative path for waste management, the licensing of proposed new nuclear power plants could be affected as well. NRC has determined that waste can be safely stored at reactor sites for at least 30 years after a reactor shuts down and is proposing to extend that period to 60 years. While that proposal would allow at least 100 years for waste to remain at reactor sites (including a 40-year reactor operating period), NRC's policy is that new reactors should not be licensed without ""reasonable confidence that the wastes can and will in due course be disposed of safely."" Current law provides no alternative repository site to Yucca Mountain, and it does not authorize DOE to open temporary storage facilities without a permanent repository in operation. Without congressional action, therefore, the default alternative to Yucca Mountain would be indefinite on-site storage of nuclear waste at reactor sites and other nuclear facilities. Private central storage facilities can also be licensed under current law; such a facility has been licensed in Utah but its operation has been blocked by the Department of the Interior. Congress has considered legislation repeatedly since the mid-1990s to authorize a federal interim storage facility for nuclear waste but none has been enacted. Reprocessing of spent fuel could reduce waste volumes and long-term toxicity, but such facilities are costly and raise concerns about the separation of plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons. Storage and reprocessing would still eventually require a permanent repository, and a search for a new repository site would need to avoid the obstacles that have hampered previous U.S. efforts. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Copyrights; Geological repositories; Landforms; Laws and legislation; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuel reprocessing; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor licensing; Nuclear weapons; Radioactive wastes; Site selection; Waste disposal; Waste management; Department of Energy; High-level nuclear waste repository; Interim storage facilities; License applications; Nuclear regulatory commission; Nuclear waste policy acts; Yucca Mountain Project; Yucca mountain repository; Radioactive waste disposal",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946835365

To this end, the Department of Energy (DOE) was authorized by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) to enter into contracts with nuclear power providers to gather and dispose of their SNF in exchange for payments by the providers into the statutorily established Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF). Congress subsequently named Yucca Mountain in the state of Nevada as the sole candidate site for the permanent underground geological storage of collected SNF. Congress also mandated that federal disposal of SNF begin no later than January 31, 1998. Over 10 years ago, DOE breached these contracts by failing to begin the acceptance and disposal of SNF by the statutory deadline established in the NWPA. As a result, nuclear utilities have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on temporary storage for toxic SNF that DOE was contractually and statutorily required to collect for disposal. The breach has triggered a prolonged series of suits by nuclear power providers, many of which continue unresolved to this day. At least 72 breach of contract claims have been filed against DOE since 1998, resulting in the awarding of approximately $1.2 billion in damage awards and settlements thus far. Many of these awards, however, remain on appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and are not yet final. Estimates for the total potential liability incurred by DOE as a result of the Yucca Mountain litigation range as high as $50 billion. Moreover, after decades of political, legal, administrative, and environmental delays, the Obama Administration's FY2011 proposed budget eliminates all funding for the Yucca Mountain project, seeks to close the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, and reemphasizes an intention to pursue other alternatives for the disposal of SNF by establishing the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. Accordingly, contract damages will continue to build as delays in the disposal of SNF continue. DOE's liability for breach of contract was first established in 1996 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Indiana Michigan Power Co. v. U.S. After DOE hesitated to act on its legal obligations, citing the absence of a completed SNF storage facility, the court issued a writ of mandamus mandating that DOE ""proceed with contractual remedies in a manner consistent with NWPA's command that it undertake an unconditional obligation to begin disposal of SNF by January 31, 1998."" The mandamus, issued in Northern States Power Co. v. U.S., essentially prohibited DOE from deflecting liability by arguing that the lack of an existing storage facility constituted an ""unavoidable delay."" In 2006, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC) held that the D.C. Circuit mandamus order in Northern States was void for lack of jurisdiction and could not preclude DOE from raising the ""unavoidable delay"" defense in the former's court. The case was appealed to the Federal Circuit, where the court, en banc, overturned the CFC decision and affirmed the D.C. Circuit's jurisdiction in both Indiana Michigan and Northern States. Accordingly, DOE continues to be prohibited from raising the ""unavoidable delay"" defense in future litigation. This chapter will present a brief overview of the NWPA and its subsequent amendments, provide a survey of key issues that have emerged from the protracted waste storage litigation, describe the jurisdictional conflict between the D.C. Circuit and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, and consider the potential for future liability arising from delays relating to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Budget control; Contracts; Delay circuits; Environmental regulations; Landforms; Law enforcement; Laws and legislation; Network security; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Product liability; Radioactive wastes; Waste disposal; Waste management; Court of appeals for the federal circuit; Department of Energy; District of columbia; Nuclear waste funds; Nuclear waste policy acts; Potential liability; Spent nuclear fuels; Yucca Mountain Project; Radioactive waste disposal",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946829647

Federal policy is based on the premise that nuclear waste can be disposed of safely, but proposed storage and disposal facilities have frequently been challenged on safety, health, and environmental grounds. Although civilian radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of materials, most of the current debate focuses on highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) calls for disposal of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository. NWPA established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) in the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop such a repository and required the program's civilian costs to be covered by a fee on nuclear-generated electricity, paid into the Nuclear Waste Fund. Amendments to NWPA in 1987 restricted DOE's repository site studies to Yucca Mountain in Nevada. DOE submitted a license application for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on June 3, 2008, and NRC docketed the application September 8, 2008. The NRC license must be based on radiation exposure standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which issued revised standards September 30, 2008. The State of Nevada strongly opposes the Yucca Mountain project, disputing DOE's analysis that the repository would meet EPA's standards. Risks cited by repository opponents include excessive water infiltration, earthquakes, volcanoes, and human intrusion. The Obama Administration ""has determined that developing the Yucca Mountain repository is not a workable option and the Nation needs a different solution for nuclear waste disposal,"" according to the DOE FY2011 budget justification. As a result, no funding for Yucca Mountain or OCRWM is being requested for FY2011. DOE filed a motion with NRC to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application on March 3, 2010. DOE's withdrawal motion has drawn opposition from states that have defense-related and civilian waste awaiting permanent disposal. Further consideration of the withdrawal motion was suspended by NRC's licensing board April 6, 2010, pending a ruling on related federal court cases. Alternatives to Yucca Mountain are to be evaluated by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, which held its first meeting March 25-26, 2010. Congress provided $5 million for the Commission in the FY2010 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act. The Commission is to study options for temporary storage, treatment, and permanent disposal of highly radioactive nuclear waste, along with an evaluation of nuclear waste research and development programs and the need for legislation. A draft report is to be issued within 18 months and a final report within two years. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) is to take over the remaining functions of OCRWM and ""lead all future waste management activities,"" according to the FY2011 budget justification. Substantial funding has been requested for NE to conduct research on nuclear waste disposal technologies and options and to provide support for the Blue Ribbon Commission. Congress provided $198.6 million to OCRWM for FY2010 to continue the Yucca Mountain licensing process but terminate all development activities related to the proposed repository. DOE plans to reprogram the FY2010 funding toward shutting down the program. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Accident prevention; Budget control; Environmental Protection Agency; Finance; Geological repositories; Landforms; Laws and legislation; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor licensing; Radiation protection; Radioactive waste encapsulation; Radioactive wastes; Radioactivity; Standards; Waste disposal; Waste management; Waste treatment; Deep geologic repositories; Nuclear regulatory commission; Nuclear waste dis-posal; Nuclear waste policy acts; Nuclear-generated electricity; Research and development programs; Yucca Mountain Project; Yucca mountain repository; Radioactive waste disposal",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946820318

The program is managed by the Department of Energy (DOE). The capacity of the SPR is 727 million barrels, and it currently holds around 704 million barrels of crude oil. In addition, a Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) holds 2 million barrels of heating oil in above-ground storage. At issue in recent years has been whether SPR capacity should be expanded and whether the reserve should continue to be filled. During the period FY1999-FY2007, roughly 139 million barrels of royalty-inkind (RIK) oil were added to the SPR. An estimated 19.1 million barrels was to be acquired during FY2008. RIK oil is turned over to the U.S. government in lieu of cash royalties on offshore oil production from federal leases that would otherwise be paid to the Treasury. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT, P.L. 109-58) permanently authorized the SPR and permits fill only if it can be established that adding to the SPR is not placing upward pressure on prices. However, the Bush Administration continued RIK fill. With gasoline prices exceeding, on average, $3.60/gallon, and approaching $4.00/gallon in some regions, some policymakers proposed that Congress take action to halt RIK deliveries. On May 13, the House and Senate passed H.R. 6022, suspending RIK fill. President Bush signed the legislation into law (P.L. 110-232) on May 19. However, a few days earlier, on May 16, DOE announced it would not accept bids for an additional 13 million barrels of RIK oil that had been intended for delivery during the second half of 2008. An energy bill (H.R. 3044) scheduled to reach the Senate floor during the week of June 9 includes language requiring suspension; presumably, this title will be dropped. The SPR comprises five underground storage facilities, hollowed out from naturally occurring salt domes in Texas and Louisiana. EPCA authorized drawdown of the Reserve upon a finding by the President that there is a ""severe energy supply interruption."" Congress enacted additional authority in 1990 (Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments of 1990, P.L. 101-383), to permit use of the SPR for short periods to resolve supply interruptions stemming from situations internal to the United States. The meaning of a ""severe energy supply interruption"" has been controversial. However, the statute intends use of the SPR only to ameliorate discernible physical shortages of crude oil. The sharp and sustained increase in crude prices during 2008 is attributed to a ""tight"" market that has added new complexities to decision making on when to fill and to use the SPR. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT) required expansion of the SPR to its authorized maximum of 1 billion barrels. Congress approved $25 million in the FY2008 budget for land acquisition for a site in Richton, Mississippi, that would add 160 million barrels of capacity, but rejected spending for other expansion work. In FY2009, the Administration is again seeking funds for this purpose, for which there still appears to be limited support. The FY2008 request was $331.6 million; Congress approved spending of $186.8 million. The FY2009 request is $346.9 million. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The cumulative impact of installing numerous thermoelectric power plants on the water resources of the Southwest, a region with existing water constraints, raises policy questions. Solar Abundance and Water Constraints Converge. Many Southwest counties are premium locations for siting solar electricity facilities, but have constrained water supplies. One policy question for local, state, and federal decision-makers is whether and how to promote renewable electricity development in the face of competing water demands. A principal renewable energy technology being considered for the Southwest is concentrating solar power (CSP), which uses solar cells to convert thermal solar energy into electricity. The steam turbines at CSP facilities are generally cooled using water, in a process known as wet cooling. The potential cumulative impact of CSP in a region with freshwater constraints has raised questions about whether, and how, to invest in large-scale deployment of CSP. Much uncertainty about the water use impacts of CSP remains because its water demand is highly dependent on the location and type of CSP facilities constructed (e.g., whether thermal storage is included and whether wet cooling is used), and because the data for these evolving technologies are preliminary. Water Consumption and Electricity Generation Tradeoffs. In arid and semi-arid regions like the Southwest or in other areas with intense water demand, water supply is an issue for locating any thermoelectric power plant, not only CSP. The trend is toward more freshwater-efficient cooling technologies for CSP and other thermoelectric generation. Why is there concern specifically about the CSP water footprint? CSP facilities using wet cooling can consume more water per unit of electricity generated than traditional fossil fuel facilities with wet cooling. Options exist for reducing the freshwater consumed by CSP and other thermoelectric facilities. Available freshwater-efficient cooling options, however, often reduce the quantity of electricity produced and increase electricity production costs, and generally do not eliminate water resource impacts. The quantity of electricity produced at these facilities, the water intensity per unit of electricity generated, and the local and regional constraints on freshwater will shape the cumulative effect of CSP deployment on southwestern water resources and the long-term sustainability of CSP as a renewable energy technology. Water resource constraints may prompt adoption of more freshwater-efficient technologies or decisions not to site CSP facilities in certain locations. Next Steps. Water constraints do not necessarily preclude CSP in the Southwest, given the alternatives available to reduce the freshwater use at CSP facilities. Moreover, water impacts are one of many factors (e.g., cost, climate and air pollution emissions, land and ocean impacts, wildlife and the environmental impacts) to be weighed when judging the tradeoffs between different energy options. States are responsible for most water planning, management, and allocation decisions and electricity siting decisions. Whether and how the federal government should promote water conservation, efficiency, markets, and regional-and state-level planning and collaboration is a matter of debate. At the same time, federal policies (e.g., energy, agriculture, and tax policy) can affect water-related investments and water use, and operations of federal facilities can affect the water available for allocation. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Since the attacks, Congress has repeatedly focused oversight and legislative attention on nuclear power plant security requirements established and enforced by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05, P.L. 109-58) imposed specific criteria for NRC to consider in revising the ?Design Basis Threat? (DBT), which specifies the maximum severity of potential attacks that a nuclear plant's security force must be capable of repelling. In response to the legislative mandate, NRC revised the DBT (10 C.F.R. Part 73.1) on April 18, 2007. Among other changes, the revisions expanded the assumed capabilities of adversaries to operate as one or more teams and attack from multiple entry points. To strengthen nuclear plant security inspections, EPACT05 required NRC to conduct ?force-onforce? security exercises at nuclear power plants at least once every three years. In these exercises, a mock adversary force from outside a nuclear plant attempts to penetrate the plant's vital area and simulate damage to a ?target set? of key safety components. From the start of the program through 2009, 112 force-on-force inspections were conducted, with each inspection typically including three mock attacks by the adversary force. During the 112 inspections, eight mock attacks resulted in the simulated destruction of complete target sets, indicating inadequate protection against the DBT, and additional security measures were promptly implemented, according to NRC. EPACT05 also included provisions for fingerprinting and criminal background checks of security personnel, their use of firearms, and the unauthorized introduction of dangerous weapons. The designation of facilities subject to enforcement of penalties for sabotage was expanded to include waste treatment and disposal facilities. Nuclear power plant vulnerability to deliberate aircraft crashes has been a continuing issue. After much consideration, NRC published final rules on June 12, 2009, to require all new nuclear power plants to incorporate design features that would ensure that, in the event of a crash by a large commercial aircraft, the reactor core would remain cooled or the reactor containment would remain intact, and radioactive releases would not occur from spent fuel storage pools. NRC rejected proposals that existing reactors also be required to protect against aircraft crashes, such as by adding large external steel barriers, deciding that other mitigation measures already required by NRC for all reactors were sufficient. In 2002, NRC ordered all nuclear power plants to develop strategies to mitigate the effects of large fires and explosions that could result from aircraft crashes or other causes. NRC published a broad final rule on nuclear reactor security March 27, 2009, including fire mitigation strategies and requirements that reactors establish procedures for responding to specific aircraft threats. Other ongoing nuclear plant security issues include the vulnerability of spent fuel pools, which hold highly radioactive nuclear fuel after its removal from the reactor, standards for nuclear plant security personnel, and nuclear plant emergency planning. NRC's March 2009 security regulations addressed some of those concerns and included a number of other security enhancements. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Aircraft; Aircraft accidents; Aircraft plants; Crime; Fuel storage; Fuels; Inspection; Laws and legislation; National security; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactors; Radioactivity; Security of data; Spent fuels; Terrorism; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Large commercial aircraft; Mitigation measures; Nuclear regulatory commission; Radioactive release; Reactor containment; Security enhancements; Security regulations; Treatment and disposal; Radioactive waste disposal",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946720070

This paper focuses on the value of energy storage devices when operating them in combination with intermittent infeed from renewable energy sources. Since forecasts never are perfect, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy is used for keeping the consequences of forecast uncertainties at acceptable levels. Instead of compensating forecast uncertainties with fast acting backup generators or balancing energy, the imbalances can be compensated by means of storage devices, placed close to locations where uncertainties arise. Monte-Carlo simulations show that major part of the disturbances can be compensated by means of storage devices without increasing system operation costs significantly. In cases where storage devices are not sufficient, generator settings are changed from day-ahead schedule, representing additional balancing costs.","Energy storage; Forecast errors; Model predictive control; Multi-carrier energy systems; Power system optimization","Costs; Energy storage; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Natural resources; Predictive control systems; Renewable energy resources; Back-up generators; Energy hub modeling; Energy storage systems; Forecast errors; Forecast uncertainty; Multi carrier; Power system optimization; Renewable energy source; Model predictive control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943801842

One of the major challenges for the renewable energy systems remains matching the intermittent energy supply with the dynamic power demand. This problem can be solved by grid-tie solar system. However for the stand alone systems certain energy storage devices must be added into the system so as to provide power-on-demand. The energy storage devices which include molten salts, superconducting magnets, supercapacitors and underground thermal energy storage must store energy in excess of electricity supply and subsequently meet demand in shortage of supply. © VDE VERLAG GMBH.","Aquifer thermal; Borehole thermal; Concentrated solar power; Cryocoolers; High temperature superconductors; Molten salt; Rankine cycle; Supercapacitors; Superconducting magnets; Superconductivity; Underground thermal energy storage","Aquifers; Capacitors; Energy policy; Energy storage; Environmental impact; Fused salts; Heat storage; High temperature superconductors; Magnets; Rankine cycle; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Superconducting devices; Superconducting magnets; Superconductivity; Thermal energy; Adverse environmental impacts; Concentrated solar power; Cryocoolers; Molten salt; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Standalone systems; Super capacitor; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936851857

Since the attacks, Congress has repeatedly focused oversight and legislative attention on nuclear power plant security requirements established and enforced by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05, P.L. 109-58) imposed specific criteria for NRC to consider in revising the ""Design Basis Threat"" (DBT), which specifies the maximum severity of potential attacks that a nuclear plant's security force must be capable of repelling. In response to the legislative mandate, NRC revised the DBT (10 C.F.R. Part 73.1) on April 18, 2007. Among other changes, the revisions expanded the assumed capabilities of adversaries to operate as one or more teams and attack from multiple entry points. To strengthen nuclear plant security inspections, EPACT05 required NRC to conduct ""force-onforce"" security exercises at nuclear power plants at least once every three years. In these exercises, a mock adversary force from outside a nuclear plant attempts to penetrate the plant's vital area and simulate damage to a ""target set"" of key safety components. From the start of the program through 2009, 112 force-on-force inspections were conducted, with each inspection typically including three mock attacks by the adversary force. During the 112 inspections, eight mock attacks resulted in the simulated destruction of complete target sets, indicating inadequate protection against the DBT, and additional security measures were promptly implemented, according to NRC. EPACT05 also included provisions for fingerprinting and criminal background checks of security personnel, their use of firearms, and the unauthorized introduction of dangerous weapons. The designation of facilities subject to enforcement of penalties for sabotage was expanded to include waste treatment and disposal facilities. Nuclear power plant vulnerability to deliberate aircraft crashes has been a continuing issue. After much consideration, NRC published final rules on June 12, 2009, to require all new nuclear power plants to incorporate design features that would ensure that, in the event of a crash by a large commercial aircraft, the reactor core would remain cooled or the reactor containment would remain intact, and radioactive releases would not occur from spent fuel storage pools. NRC rejected proposals that existing reactors also be required to protect against aircraft crashes, such as by adding large external steel barriers, deciding that other mitigation measures already required by NRC for all reactors were sufficient. In 2002, NRC ordered all nuclear power plants to develop strategies to mitigate the effects of large fires and explosions that could result from aircraft crashes or other causes. NRC published a broad final rule on nuclear reactor security March 27, 2009, including fire mitigation strategies and requirements that reactors establish procedures for responding to specific aircraft threats. Other ongoing nuclear plant security issues include the vulnerability of spent fuel pools, which hold highly radioactive nuclear fuel after its removal from the reactor, standards for nuclear plant security personnel, and nuclear plant emergency planning. NRC's March 2009 security regulations addressed some of those concerns and included a number of other security enhancements. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The aim of this study is to compare two simulation models for describing thermal stratification in the heat storage tank used in the cogeneration (CHP) plant at any time. In this paper analytical and numerical analyses have been carried out to show temperature fields inside the heat storage. The first analytical model is done using an energy balance which is created and solved for each layer of the stratified heat storage. This model shows a simple onedimensional approach to theoretical analysis of thermal stratification. The other numerical model is implemented using a multi-purpose computation fluid dynamics (CFD) software PHOENICS. Two-dimensional transient model was created and solved numerically. The validation of simulated results is made successfully by the comparison against the actual data gathered from Hvide Sande CHP plant in Denmark. A good agreement with actual data is observed.

This transition is inevitable, but there are many scenarios discussed for how and when this will happen. Humans have relied on renewable energy for most of history, and will do so again, as affordable supplies of fossil fuels decline in the coming decades (or centuries). However, there is wide agreement that the world should not give up the benefits of modern technology. The transition to a ‘green’ energy supply has already begun, and technologies for collecting and converting energy from the environment, new means of energy storage, and increased energy efficiency have progressed greatly. That is why there is legitimate hope that the coming change will be possible without a major reduction in the quality of life. Individual mobility and long-distance travel have become vital elements of human existence. This mobility and the freedom it enables are taken for granted by most, and even considered a fundamental right. Most of this mobility is provided by the more than 900 million motor vehicles that now populate roads around the globe. An enormous number – and expected to grow to more than 1.1 billion in less than a decade. If all the motor vehicles on the globe were put bumper to bumper, the resulting giant traffic jam would be 4.5 million kilometres long, or wrap around the globe more than 100 times. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923524337

Until recently, H2 emissions to the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources have been largely disregarded and viewed in large part as a product of incomplete fossil fuel combustion. As H2 production and the fraction of energy-based H2 applications increase, a potential accumulation of H2 in the atmosphere from direct emissions, losses and leakage, and changes in chemical processes in both the troposphere and the stratosphere could result. Vehicle exhaust gas is currently an important source of anthropogenic H2 to the atmosphere, and losses of H2 from production, distribution, storage, and other end-use systems could become increasingly significant contributors. With changing vehicle fleet composition and increasing H2 demand and production for industrial and direct energy-based end-uses, an assessment of well-to-wheel H2 emissions, including H2 emissions from current and emerging vehicle technologies, will help assess the magnitude of future technological anthropogenic H2 emissions to the atmosphere. Objectives and scope Apart from the challenging technical questions associated with the production, transport, and storage of H2, future anthropogenic H2 emissions are an area of increased interest due to their prominence in the global H2 budget (see Figure 4.1). Currently, large uncertainty is associated with the contribution of H2 from technological processes, primarily from fossil fuels (white arrow, Figure 4.1). A detailed analysis of H2 emissions from the major anthropogenic processes that contribute to the present and future global H2 budget has been performed in this work and serves to better quantify the contribution from this sector. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923461085

Record-breaking attendance at fuel cell exhibitions was common, and the news media was full of the ambitious market introduction plans of fuel cell company representatives and the grand hopes of politicians. It is now 2011, and the euphoria surrounding hydrogen has shifted to batteries and all-electric vehicles; the 'electron economy' is being advertised in much the same way. Hype surrounding transportation technology is a common phenomenon, and history provides us with many examples of announcements of 'major breakthroughs'. Some, like fuel injection, caught on; others, like the 'Nucleon' nuclear powertrain, did not. Whether hype hampers or helps society to find and to implement the best solutions for our pressing social and environmental problems is debatable. What is certain is that a thorough analysis of technological alternatives, and perseverance in execution once the best solution (or set of solutions) has been identified, should never be superseded by action plans driven by media attention. The Alliance for Global Sustainability is the framework that facilitated collaboration between John Heywood's group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Alexander Wokaun's team at the Paul Scherrer Institute in investigating vehicle technology alternatives 'Before the Transition to Hydrogen'. With generous financial support from the Swiss Competence Center for Energy and Mobility (CCEM), these two working groups met biannually with sponsors and partners from industry and professional associations, to share ideas and to engage in exciting multidisciplinary research. The results of the Swiss team's lvresearch are contained in this book. Even though, occasionally, the opinions of the partners from opposite sides of the Atlantic regarding the potential of the various transportation energy technologies investigated did not converge, the collaboration was highly successful because of the high value that both research teams placed on objective and unbiased analysis. In particular, the MIT group's strength in combustion engine technology and policy research proved to be highly complementary to the PSI group's technical know-how regarding fuel cells, global energy system modelling, and scenario analysis. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923406232

The optimisation-based strategy is computed regularly by optimising a set of mathematical equations, describing the (generally conflicting) operative goals, in a given time horizon and uses a representative model for the network dynamics, as well as a demand forecast. The approach has been tested on a simulator developed for a 4 reservoirs water network of a commune of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The paper describes the optimisation problem that was defined in order to consider all the objectives desired by the authorities (both the commune and the regional drinking water provider and the national water agency) without ignoring the operating and physical constraints of the network. Based on realistic consumption scenarios, the current situation (tanks always completely filled) and different control strategies (PID level regulation or optimal predictive control) have been compared and the results are discussed. Furthermore, some simple real examples of diagnosis (e.g. leak detection) using daily mean consumption patterns are shown.","Distribution network; Drinking water; Optimisation-based control; Predictive control; Storage","Electric power distribution; Energy storage; Optimization; Potable water; Reservoirs (water); Water distribution systems; Water management; Consumption patterns; Drinking water distribution networks; Drinking water networks; Mathematical equations; Optimisation problems; Physical constraints; Predictive control; Predictive controller; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906234509

The concept is based on heat pump and heat engine technologies utilizing transcritical CO2 cycles, storage of pumped heat in hot water, and ice generation and melting at the cold end of the cycles. The paper first describes the growing need for large scale electrical energy storage and the role of storage in the integration of renewable intermittent generation such as wind energy into the electricity network. The background and a short review on TEES is given and the main principles of (i) reversible heat pumping using vapor compression, (ii) thermal energy storage, and finally (iii) back conversion of thermal energy into electricity via a thermal engine are explained. Following the introduction of TEES as a general concept, the transcritical CO2 based system is presented by providing a description of the thermodynamic cycles and the corresponding operating conditions. Next the overview of an envisioned transcritical TEES plant is given with information on the main equipment including the turbomachines such as compressor and turbine, high pressure plate heat exchangers, and ice storage. Key properties of the proposed transcritical TEES system are then reviewed with an emphasis on energy storage efficiency, scalability, site independence, and minimal environmental impact. Information about the operating characteristics such as start up and standby times and storage duration of the proposed system is also given. The paper is concluded by discussing the future perspectives for the proposed system mainly by focusing on potential technology improvements for the CO2 machines and the storage materials for both hot and cold ends of the system.","Energy storage; Renewable integration; Thermal energy storage","Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Environmental impact; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Thermodynamic properties; Vapors; Wind power; Electrical energy storages; Electricity networks; Electricity storages; Energy storage efficiencies; Heat pumps; Operating characteristics; Renewable integration; Thermoelectric energy; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903650195

An important part of the project was the duty cycle tests according to SORT - Standardised on-road tests cycles (developed by the International Association of Public Transport, UITP). The duty cycle tests generated experimental data, on which this paper's discussion is based upon. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the potential of energy-efficiency improving measures on the powertrain. The ethanol hybrid bus is a series hybrid vehicle with regenerative braking. A start/stop software to avoid idling was optional. A bus with similar exterior properties, but with the ethanol internal combustion engine coupled to a conventional automatic gearbox instead of a hybrid powertrain was used as a reference throughout the project. Based on both experimental data and simulations, several measures to increase the overall energy-efficiency may be proposed. Assessed measures to increase the energy-efficiency include size optimization of powertrain components, such as energy storage and electric motor, and internal combustion engine (identified by using Sankey diagrams), adjustment of the super capacitors energy management system and utilisation of engine start/stop functionality. Analysis shows that the size of the energy storage is well attuned if applied as urban transport. It would be possible to downsize the ICE, from approximately 200 kW to approximately 150 kW, without losing substantial performance. Using the start/stop software reduces the fuel consumption with 15 % in the standardized city duty cycle but has the potential for even further fuel economy improvements in real traffic with more idling.","Energy efficiency; Energy flow analysis; Ethanol hybrid bus; Sankey diagrams; Series hybrid","Carbon dioxide; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Environmental impact; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Fuel economy; Global warming; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Mass transportation; Powertrains; Regenerative braking; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy flow analysis; Hybrid bus; International Association; Powertrain components; Sankey diagram; Series hybrid vehicles; Series hybrids; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903642241

The analysis is based on an experimentally documented implicit finite-difference solution of a set of differential equations which describes the transient thermal behavior of buildings. Phase change process is simulated by using the effective thermal capacity model. Various simple thermal capacity functions are suggested, tested and compared to each other along the typical year in the Athens area. The parameters considered include PCM phase change heat, phase change temperature range, PCM location and way of embodiment within building elements, i.e. in the form of pure PCM layers or in mixtures with structural materials. The problem of incomplete PCM phase change, which leads to reduced exploitation of the available PCM storage capacity, is examined. According to our predictions, the use of construction mixtures containing PCM provides, in certain cases, advantages over pure PCM layers embodied within walls. For PCM mass fractions from 0-30%, the energy savings may reach the 80% of the energy saving obtained with pure PCM. A properly designed PCM passive solar system with the appropriate values of PCM thermophysical properties and of the other parameters involved, may obtain yearly energy savings up to 33% under the Athens weather conditions.","Building heating and cooling; Passive solar systems; Phase change materials","Computer simulation; Differential equations; Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Mixtures; Solar heating; Solar system; Thermodynamic properties; Building element; Building heating; Finite-difference solution; Passive solar systems; Phase change process; Phase change temperature; Storage capacity; Thermal behaviors; Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903642224

During the cold winter in Sweden, external heating are at times needed but a Passive House is limited to a maximum use of 14 W/m2 or around 68 kWh/m2*year for external heating, depending on the heating strategy and the climate zone. The challenge of avoiding external heating during the cold winter climate in Sweden has pushed the design of a Passive House in a direction where problems with excessive temperatures might occur summertime. The aim of this paper is to evaluate a comfort cooling strategy for attaining good indoor climate summertime while maintaining good energy efficiency. The studied strategy is a night cool storage with phase change material. To evaluate this, a Matlab code was used for the analysis of climate files along with the thermodynamical properties of PCM-storages and then used with IDA Indoor Climate for building simulations. The building model is based on an actual Passive House in the district Lambohov in Linköping, Sweden, where continuous logging of temperatures are available. Without comfort cooling the simulations show excessive temperatures summertime which is consistent with the field measurements from the actual house. The results show that the phase change material can be a part of the solution and replace a substantial share of the external cooling when removing excessive temperatures but can not provide sufficient cooling during the hottest part of the summer simulated in this paper.","Building Simulation; Comfort cooling; Passive House; Phase Change Material","Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Houses; Phase change materials; Building simulation; Cooling strategy; External cooling; External heating; Field measurement; Heating strategy; Passive house; Thermodynamical properties; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903640638

Up to now pumped-hydro is the only technology that has been widely used for that purpose. However the spread of this technology is limited by geographic constraints. In the present work, a particular implementation of the storage concept based on thermodynamic cycles, as introduced by ABB Switzerland ltd. Corporate Research, has been analysed thermoeconomically. This concept can be scaled up to a GWh range of stored energy, and is site independent. The underlying idea is to use electricity to power a heat pump transferring heat from a cold source to a hot source (charging mode), while storing the heat and the cold at both sources. Subsequently the energy that has been stored/removed to/from the hot/cold sources can be used to run a heat engine, hence re-delivering the electricity when it is needed (discharging mode). In the implementation presented here, using the ambient temperature as the hot source for both the heat pump and the heat engine allows taking benefit from daily variations of the atmospheric temperature. Indeed, the heat-pump can operate with a higher Coefficient of Performance (CoP) during the night and the heat-engine at higher efficiency during the day. This results in an effective increase of the ratio between the redelivered electricity (discharge) and the stored electricity (charging), compared to a situation where the hot source of both cycles are at the same temperature. The use of solar collectors is a further way to enhance this ratio by increasing the hot source temperature above the ambient temperature during the day. In charging mode, the system consists in an ammonia based Rankine heat-pump interfaced at the evaporator with a latent heat cold storage, and at the condenser to the ambient through aircoolers. In discharging mode an ammonia based Rankine heat-engine is interfaced at the condenser with the latent heat cold storage, and the evaporator(boiler) of the thermal engine is interfaced with hot water produced by a field of flat plate solar collectors. A steady state multiobjective optimization of a 50 MW power output plant was carried out, with the objectives of minimizing the investment costs, and maximizing the ratio between electricity output and input. Several types of cold storage substances have been implemented in the formulation and two different types of solar collector were investigated. A storage efficiency of 57% at a cost of 1200 USD/kW was calculated for an optimized plant using solar energy. Finally, a computation of the behaviour of the plant along the year was carried out, reaching a yearly availability of 84.4%.","Energy storage; Heat-engine; Heat-pump; Solar energy; Thermodynamic cycles; Thermoeconomy","Ammonia; Cold storage; Costs; Energy storage; Engines; Environmental impact; Evaporators; Heat pump systems; Investments; Latent heat; Multiobjective optimization; Pumps; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Temperature; Abb switzerland ltd; Coefficient of Performance; Flat-plate solar collectors; Heat-pump; Hot-source temperature; Thermo-economy; Thermodynamic cycle; Thermoeconomic analysis; Electricity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903640535

This method is also often taken into account when considering systems of carbon capture from flue gases of coal fired power plants. This process is very energy-intensive and significantly reduces the performance of the power plant. Thus it seems appropriate to seek external sources of heat for the purpose of carbon capture installation. In the paper, the integration of a coal-fired power plant with the gas turbine combined heat and power system for carbon capture and storage (CCS) installation has been analyzed. The parameters of the gas unit, which fully meets the needs of CCS for the 900 MW coal power plant with supercritical parameters, have been determined.

Energy storage constitutes an effective way to manage excess RES production, and pumped storage is the most suitable and least expensive solution for large storage and power capacities. The present study aims to investigate the performance of a pumped storage unit introduced into a conventional HPP (Hydroelectric Power Plant) in Greece. At first, the plant operation and the electric grid data for a reference period of one year are used to compute the time variation of water inflow into the dam, and to estimate the RES production rejections depending on of the installed power. Next, a pumping station which is powered by the rejected RES production and raises water from a lower reservoir to the upper main reservoir is modelled. The additional hydraulic energy stored in the dam can be reused to produce stable and controllable electricity through the hydroturbines of the plant. Various scenarios concerning the pumping station power rate and feeding program, as well as alternative methods to increase the hydroturbines production were examined. The operation of the combined system is simulated in detail for the above cases and the energy results were obtained and analyzed. Also, an economic evaluation of the pumped storage scheme is carried out based on current financial conditions in Greece. The results showed that a considerable amount of RES production can be stored and exploited to multiply the HPP annual energy production, but the economic viability of such an investment depends on some critical parameters, which were identified. Certain guidelines concerning the optimum sizing and operation strategy of the pumped storage scheme are finally extracted.","High RES penetration; Hydroelectric power plant; Optimum sizing; Pumped storage; Wind energy rejection","Electric power systems; Environmental impact; Hydraulic turbines; Hydroelectric power plants; Investments; Pumping plants; Reservoirs (water); Wind power; Annual energy productions; Economic evaluations; High RES penetration; Optimum sizing; Pumped Storage; Renewable energy source; Stability and reliabilities; Wind energy rejections; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903589584

DER development raises a number of issues for the different stakeholders. However, it is obviously an opportunity for new, emerging market players, but it brings also new perspectives for incumbents. Participation of DER in the different energy markets requires the setting up of upgraded structures for aggregating small energy sources.

At its first step, the method proposes a so called Target Bond Graph (TBG) that expresses the desired closed-loop behaviour, i.e., the control system specifications, in terms of a desired closed-loop storage function and a power dissipation function. The control law is obtained in a subsequent step via BG-prototyping.

This situation has been exacerbated by the decision of the ­electricity utility to delay the construction of further nuclear-powered electricity generation stations. Notwithstanding the introduction of renewable energies and energy efficiency measures, the use of fossil fuels is therefore expected to increase. At the South African Climate Change Summit held during March 2009, it was announced that South Africa will increase its carbon dioxide emissions until 2020–2025, plateau for 10 years, and thereafter decrease emissions in real terms. Carbon dioxide capture and storage is being investigated as a measure to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions: a Centre for Carbon Capture and Storage was established on 30 March 2009. Preliminary studies have already indicated some potential, and the completion of a carbon geological storage atlas by mid-2010 is expected to result in more accurate information. Presently South Africa has one nuclear-powered electricity generation station which provides a mere 2.8% of primary energy supply; further stations have been postponed. Currently, high-level radioactive waste is stored on-site at nuclear installations. Low- and ­intermediate-level waste is buried in a remote, desert-like location. The Government is undertaking an investigation into the handling and final disposal of nuclear waste to cater for current and future nuclear installations. An institute that will manage radioactive waste on a national basis is the subject of the National Radioactive Waste Disposal Institute Act, 2008 (No. 53 of 2008) that was gazetted on 9 January 2009. Separate institutions address carbon dioxide storage and radioactive waste, and currently there is little interaction between them.

This thermoreversible behavior of MC and HPMC is affected by their properties and concentration in the solvent media, the nature of additives, and thermal environment they are exposed to. Research in understanding the mechanism of the sol-gel transition process has gained considerable interest because of a variety of applications of MC and HPMC as thickeners, binders or matrices in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food industries. This chapter includes investigations on the changes brought about by thermal energy in the specific heat capacity, the storage (G') and viscous (G"") modulii, and the turbidity of the hydrogels. The effects of salt additives are discussed. Differences associated with initial solvent temperature, solvent state, solvent isotopes, temperature history, thermal conditions and the temperature range are highlighted. Reasons for hysteresis seen during the heating and cooling processes are identified and discussed. Mathematical models established for describing sol-gel transitions and related mechanisms are presented. The nature of the mechanisms along with the underlying influence of thermal energy and various media additives are explained. Parameters such as degree of gelation and degelation, the water entrapment point and the gel index are introduced and discussed. The details of the thermodynamics involved and the gelation kinetics are included. The findings highlighted shortcomings in the earlier definition of the gel point as the cross-over point on the G' and G"" plots. The detailed interpretation of various molecule level interactions unfolded the sol-gel mechanisms and the influence of several factors. The obtained test data and the established mathematical models are expected to serve as the guides for customizing various applications of MC and HPMC hydrogels. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This type of CAES would be adiabatic and would if the machines were reversible have a storage efficiency of 100%. However, due to the specific capacity of the storage and the construction materials the air is cooled during and after compression in practice, making the CAES process diabatic. The cooling involves exergy losses and thus lowers the efficiency of the storage significantly. The efficiency of CAES as an electricity storage may be defined in several ways, we discuss these and find that the exergetic efficiency of compression, storage and production together determine the efficiency of CAES. In the paper we find that the efficiency of the practical CAES electricity storage is 25-45% and thus has a quite low efficiency, which is close to the efficiency of the simple diabatic CAES-process. Adiabatic CAES would reach significantly higher storage efficiency about 70-80%.","Compressed air energy storage; Electricity storage; Exergy analysis","Compressed air; Electric energy storage; Environmental impact; Exergy; Pressure vessels; Adiabatic process; Compressed air energy storage; Electricity storages; Exergetic efficiency; Exergy Analysis; Exergy loss; Specific capacities; Storage efficiency; Efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896359758

Over the strenuous objections of the State of Nevada, the Department of Energy (DOE) submitted a license application for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository in June 2008 to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). During the 2008 election campaign, now-President Obama lent support to Nevada's fight against the repository, contending in an issue statement that he and now-Vice President Biden ""do not believe that Yucca Mountain is a suitable site."" Under the current nuclear waste program, DOE hopes to begin transporting spent nuclear fuel and other highly radioactive waste to Yucca Mountain by 2020. That schedule is 22 years beyond the 1998 deadline established by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA). Because U.S. nuclear power plants will continue to generate nuclear waste after a repository opens, DOE estimates that all waste could not be removed from existing reactors until about 2066 even under the current Yucca Mountain schedule. Not all the projected waste could be disposed of at Yucca Mountain, however, unless NWPA's current limit on the repository's capacity is increased. If the Obama Administration decides to halt the Yucca Mountain project, it has a variety of tools available to implement that policy. Although the President cannot directly affect NRC proceedings, the Secretary of Energy could withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application under NRC rules. The President could also urge Congress to cut or eliminate funding for the Yucca Mountain project, and propose legislation to restructure the nuclear waste program. Abandonment of Yucca Mountain would probably further delay the federal government's removal of nuclear waste from reactor sites and therefore increase the government's liabilities for missing the NWPA deadline. DOE estimates that such liabilities will reach ""11 billion even if Yucca Mountain opens as currently planned. DOE's agreements with states to remove defenserelated high-level waste could also be affected. If the Yucca Mountain project were halted without a clear alternative path for waste management, the licensing of proposed new nuclear power plants could be affected as well. NRC has determined that waste can be safely stored at reactor sites for at least 30 years after a reactor shuts down and is proposing to extend that period to 60 years. While that proposal would allow at least 100 years for waste to remain at reactor sites (including a 40-year reactor operating period), NRC's policy is that new reactors should not be licensed without ""reasonable confidence that the wastes can and will in due course be disposed of safely."" Current law provides no alternative repository site to Yucca Mountain, and it does not authorize DOE to open temporary storage facilities without a permanent repository in operation. Without congressional action, therefore, the default alternative to Yucca Mountain would be indefinite on- site storage of nuclear waste at reactor sites and other nuclear facilities. Private central storage facilities can also be licensed under current law; such a facility has been licensed in Utah but its operation has been blocked by the Department of the Interior. Congress has considered legislation repeatedly since the mid-1990s to authorize a federal interim storage facility for nuclear waste but none has been enacted. Reprocessing of spent fuel could reduce waste volumes and long-term toxicity, but such facilities are costly and raise concerns about the separation of plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons. Storage and reprocessing would still eventually require a permanent repository, and a search for a new repository site would need to avoid the obstacles that have hampered previous U.S. efforts. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

But what scaffold with lowered kinetic barriers for hosting webs of metabolic reaction cycles [c.f. Cairns-Smith 1985] could have allowed such tight coupling of energy flow and information, proposed by Morowitz [1955] and extended by a scaling analysis towards (generative, computation-enabling) reversible transformations [Smith 2008b], given that homogeneous energy sources sustain life's self-organization (without external constraints)? Consider a network of interactions where interchanges between environmental fluctuations and system-entropy (extensible to the reversible limit) could be driven and controlled by a permeating deeper level source whose existence instantly registers even before an empirical check. Indeed, the potential of magnetic nano-particles embodying spins for accessing a range of possibilities-from cooperative aspects, asymmetric dynamics to quantum phenomena-- underlies the quest for magnetic (H)-field driven matter as a candidate for life's fountainhead. Here an H-field is the connecting link between the susceptibility-to-field variations and the correlators between interacting spins via FDT, for producing a dissipatively ordered state by harnessing fluctuations. Although differing in mechanism from the familiar quenched spin-glass dynamics (resembling an inhomogeneous frustrated bio-network), the ferrofluid-based associative-network for pattern-storage via field variations [Palm and Korenivski 2009], shows the potential of magnetic dipolar interactions for meeting Anderson's [1983] diversity-cum-stability criteria for origins-oflife, as in his spin glass model (large numbers of degenerate states and slow relaxation between them). As a plausible scenario for materializing these requirements, we have proposed that magnetic rocks could have provided a moderate external H-field, enabling accretion of magnetic nano-particles on the Hadean Ocean Floor, analogous to field- induced structures observed in magnetite-based ferrofluids. To that end, a natural candidate is greigite (Fe3S4) that forms in the alkaline seepage site hydrothermal mound scenario of Russell et al [2005], showing how metabolites could have accumulated in membranous inorganic compartments. Here, catalytic greigite reveals the link to the geochemical origins of life's emergence owing to its close resemblance to iron-sulphur clusters in enzymes (considered ancient). But under today's globally oxygenic conditions it occurs rarely, which interestingly contrasts with its close cousin magnetite appearing across all kingdoms of biology. Local sources, like accumulated magnetized meteoritic matter, could have provided the required field ~4.2-4.3 Gya when life is thought to have been initiated. This was further reinforced by magnetite forming as an alteration product, immediately beneath the mound. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

These issues have been increasingly prominent concernssince the energy crisis. Hence, interest has been growing to adopt renewable energies asviable sources of energy that offer a wide range of exceptional benefits for present andfuture applications, with an important degree of promise especially in the buildingssector. However, the management of the renewable energy sources for space airheating/cooling is usually not economically feasible compared with the traditionalcarriers. In this chapter, we present a passive energy system, called an air-conditioningcupboard which exploits renewable energies [hot water supplied from a solar collector(40-50°C) and cold groundwater (19°C)] as thermal sources, conceived and tested in ourlaboratory (LMTE, Tunisia).To evaluate the air-conditioning cupboard efficiency, indoor experiments werecarried out under varied Tunisian environmental conditions for several days. Resultsshow that the air-heating system has a good thermal effectiveness (80 %). It permits us tomaintain the temperature inside the experimented room at the range of [24-27°C] duringthe cold months and [20-23°C] during hot months. A theoretical model is employed forthe sizing of the air-conditioning cupboard to obtain the required temperature values.This model allows also the determination of the air-cupboard conditioning thermalperformances. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It is found widely across industries from pharmaceuticals,nutraceuticals, agrochemicals, aerosols, personal care products, pigments, ceramics,cement to semi-conductors. Traditionally, milling (or also known as grinding) is regardedas a particle size reduction process, which increases the specific surface area of a solidphase for desired interaction with the neighboring phase. Advanced powdercharacterization techniques have revealed that milling performs more than just a sizereduction role. The mechanical and thermal energies imposed onto a milled powder alterother physicochemical properties like morphology, crystallinity, polymorphism, glasstransition temperature, surface energy, melting properties, as well as lead to particle sizeshift and changes in specific surface area during subsequent storage. These changes oftenhave a pronounced effect on the product performance such as powder flow,aerosolization, dissolution, physical and chemical stability. The underlying scientificknowledge behind these changes has created avenues to engineer new applications aswell as mitigate the milling-induced effects that are detrimental to product performance.This review presents recent developments in milling technologies such as nanomilling,co-milling and post-milling conditioning. Nanomilling using stirred media mills withsuitable surfactants has produced stabilized nanosuspensions below the postulatedgrinding limit of half a micron, and thereby increases the specific surface area by up to10-fold and the saturated solubility by 6-fold. Co-milling or simultaneous milling of twoor more solid component has been effective in controlling the solid-state properties ofmilled powders. Milling-induced amorphization or the loss of long-range crystallinestructure is often associated with stability problems as the amorphous phase isthermodynamically unstable and tends to re-crystallize to the stable crystalline form. Thiseffect can be mitigated by co-milling with crystalline seeds. On the other hand, when anamorphous product is desired as it has advantages of higher solubility, dissolution rateand better compression characteristics over the crystalline form, the addition of polymericadditives during milling has led to stable amorphous solid dispersions. Co-milling withmesoporous materials also results in an amorphous form, which is entrapped insidenanosized channels. Co-grinding has been used to prepare co-crystals, which possessdifferent physicochemical properties from the original components. To alleviateundesired milling-induced effects, new findings in post-milling conditioning as well asrecent research to alternative processes to particle size reduction will be discussed. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The regenerative electromagnetic TMD (EM-TMD) system comprises a pendulum-type TMD, a rotary electromagnetic (EM) damper and an energy-harvesting circuit. The structural vibration energy induced by earthquake or wind, which is a great amount, is absorbed by EM-TMD and converted to electrical energy by the EM damper, and stored in energy storage elements (such as supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries) by the energy harvesting circuit. As a result, the proposed EM-TMD systems can not only effectively protect building structures against excessive vibrations, but also provide regenerative and economical power sources to smart wireless sensing system or other electronic devices. This paper presents a proof-of-concept shaking table experiment in which a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model equipped with a regenerative EM-TMD system has been tested. A prototype of rotary EM damper connected with two types of energy harvesting circuits, were tested and compared in this study. Three important properties, i.e., energy conversion efficiency, output power and control effect, were investigated and discussed.

They are a subject of attention also from the legal-normative point of view, from both national and international aspects, especially regarding the possibilities for their sustainable development. Their natural potential is determined as a quantitative expression of the combination of conditions and resources which are favorable for the all-round activity of society. Their importance for Bulgaria results not only from their significant areal distribution in relation to the whole territory - over 40% or even 50% according to the boundaries outlined in investigations by different authors, but also from their significant natural potential. In relation to the whole territory various natural resources are predominantly found in the mountains of Bulgaria, for example: mineral resources (fuel, metal, and nonmetalliferous) - over 80%; water resources - over 80%, as well as 70% of the storage water capacity with in total 700 large, medium and small dams, and over 70% of the mineral water fields; forest resources - over 70%, as well as two-thirds of the plants growing in Bulgaria, and also considerable resources of game, wild fruits, herbs, mushrooms, etc. A significant percentage of demographic settlements and economic land structures also occur in the mountainous areas of Bulgaria, for instance: about 30% of the population and over 55% of the settlements (the number of municipalities in the mountainous regions is over 140, from in total 260 in Bulgaria); about 65% of the areas for cultivation of tobacco and potatoes; over 85% of areas under meadow, and over 70% of the pasture grounds in the country, etc. The evaluation of the natural potential of the mountains is related to the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the basic natural components (relief&texture, climate, waters, soils, flora, and fauna), and this evaluation is concerned with two aspects - resources and conditions. In this respect climatic characteristics usually represent identification of the conditions of the surroundings but their assessment as a resource, especially as a renewable one, is becoming more and more important. The total, integral natural potential is subdivided into so-called partial potentials which are specific to the corresponding economic activity for which purposes they are intended, for instance: industry-, mineral-, water-, forest-, energy-potential, building potential, recreational potential, etc. Especially important is the assessment of aspects of the partial potentials that are related to the state and tendencies of change of natural components' characteristics under conditions of anthropogenic pressure, such as: self-clearing, regeneration, changeability, steadiness, etc. At the same time attention is paid to revealing degradation processes provoked by anthropogenic activity, by so-called physiognomic landscape components, grounding on the specific mountain landscape spectra typical for large morphographic units. On the basis of these analyses a concept is discussed for optimization of interactions in the system Nature-Society-Economy, with accents placed on priority economic activities with emphasis on environmental protection, in mountain territories, according to the principals of sustainable development. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Assessment of the: relief, climate, waters, soils, vegetation, animals, landscapes; Bulgarian mountains; Nature potential; Sustainable usage of mountin resources",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889767465

Macedonian energy sector is the main emitter of greenhouses gases (GHG) with share of about 70 % in the total annual emissions. Also, 70-75 % of emissions are associated with the electricity generation due to the predominant role of the lignite fuelled power plants. Recently, the government has adopted a strategy for the use of RES which identifies a target of 21% of final energy consumption from RES by 2020. In this paper analyses are conducted in order to investigate to which extent and in which way the absorption capacity of the power system for RES electricity can be improved. For this purpose, combining various conventional and RES technologies, including pump storage hydro power plant and revitalisation of the existing lignite power plants six scenarios for the power system expansion are developed by making use of EnergyPLAN model. Critical excess of electricity (CEEP) analyses are conducted in order to identify the maximal penetration of wind electricity. The results have shown that in the exiting capacities maximal penetration of wind electricity in 2020 is 13 % of total electricity consumption.

CO2 emissions are hence expected to increase significantly. Gasification is a mature technology for energy production that permits an easier separation of CO2 for its storage. As modern societies are producing everincreasing amounts of wastes with negative impact on the environment, new technologies have been developed to co-gasify these wastes either with coal or alone, thus resolving a serious problem of waste disposal. Wastes gasification reduces the dependence on fossil fuels and co-gasification with coal could provide the benefit of security in fuel supply, as the availability of wastes and biomass fuels could vary from region to region and show seasonal changes. Gasification experimental conditions and technologies and syngas cleaning methods are key issues for the production of a clean gas that could find a wide range of applications. This chapter will concentrate on syngas end-uses, focusing on new ones, like gas turbines or engines in IGCC, synthesis of methanol, ethanol and dimethyl ether, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and hydrogen production.

Several sequestration approaches are possible. Carbon capture and storage can only be applied to present emissions from large CO2 emitting sources such as power stations. Another possible approach is to capture CO2 directly from the air. Carbon sequestration in forests, soils, or in ocean plankton, are of this type, as is mechanical air capture. Mechanical air capture can in principle also draw down past CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, and even compensate for emissions of other greenhouse gases. However, the energy costs for capture are very high, so that energy availability becomes a problem. The sequestration phase is the same as for CO2 from fossil fuel combustion. Sequestering CO2 in the deep ocean would lead to both ocean acidification and adverse consequences for marine life. Estimates for the quantity of CO2 that can be ultimately sequestered in geological formations such as disused oil and gas fields, and saline aquifers, both on land and in the seabed, vary by orders of magnitude. But such estimates may be beside the point, since sequestration requires not only that adequate safe geological storage capacity be available, but that CO2 can be safely introduced at the rate desired, which could amount worldwide to tens of Gigatonne of CO2 per year. Furthermore, there is a small risk of catastrophic blowout from injection wells, which means that local citizen opposition could be intense.",,"Aquifers; Carbon capture; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Offshore gas fields; Alternative energy source; Atmospheric concentration; Carbon sequestration; Energy availability; Fossil fuel combustion; Geological formation; Ocean acidifications; Orders of magnitude; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883612441

The models rely on a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) that combines a super-capacitor (SC) with a Rechargeable Battery (RB).While the SC has low energy storage capability but is capable of providing high level of energy throughput and frequent charge cycles, theRB has higher energy storage capability but limited charge cycles. Our proposal for the protocol associated with HESS assigns different weights to the residual energy in both energy storage systems whilst favouring routes with more SC energy and harvesting rates. The main innovation is the application of a new routing cost metric to prolong the network lifetime. An energy model framework has been developed in MATLAB with different application scenarios to test the proposed cost metric. The simulation results show that, by using the HESS flexible energy-aware cost-benefit function, significant extension of the network lifetime is achieved by means a balance between the energy consumption and the reliable delivery of data packets. © 2011 River Publishers.","Hybrid energy storage system; Rechargeable battery; Routing protocol; Supercapacitor; Wireless sensor networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873341401

For this reason two optimization algorithms are implemented, where the storage capacity is assigned certain costs and is able to vary in size. The objective of the first optimization is to identify the optimal power infeed as well as the necessary battery capacity in order to maximize the profits of the wind farm. The objective of the second optimization is to identify the necessary battery capacity, which in relationship with the wind power infeed will minimize the total costs of the system. The wind farm is assumed to provide ""cheap"" energy to the network and has no knowledge of the effects its power infeed has on the Ideational Marginal Prices (LMPs) it receives. It has been found that for small wind farms, which cannot influence the LMPs with their infeed, the maximum profit policy coincided with the power infeed policy for the minimization of the costs. On the contrary, the wind farm could not identify the optimal policy which would maximize its profits, when its size is big enough to influence the LMPs. Incentives are identified so that the wind farm can receive a price signal which will be of benefit for both the wind farm and the system.","Incentives; Large wind penetration; Storage; Wind farm","Algorithms; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Optimization; Profitability; Wind power; Economic operations; Incentives; Large wind penetrations; Optimal integration; Optimization algorithms; Second optimization; Storage capacity; Wind farm; Electric power system interconnection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869450763

The recovered energy can be stored in various ways. However, previous studies made by the authors have shown that in hydraulically operated regenerative systems a pressure accumulator seems to be potential option as energy storage. Hydraulic accumulator has also some disadvantages, e.g., energy losses in form of heat transfer. The efficiency can be improved by using different heat recovery methods. To compare these methods numerically, a reliable model of an accumulator is needed. The primary aim of this study is to build a multidisciplinary model of a basic piston type hydraulic accumulator and to validate the model with experimental measurements. The second aim is to experimentally test the effects of a honeycomb heat regenerator by efficiency point of view. The results manifest that multidisciplinary modeling is useful and valid tool for modeling the piston type hydraulic accumulator. The results also indicate that the heat regenerator attached inside the accumulator's gas volume improves energy efficiency significantly.

The binding of SWNT to RC results in an accumulation of positive (the oxidized primary electron donor, P+) and negative (semiquinone forms, Q-A and Q-B, the reduced primary and secondary quinones, respectively) charges followed by slow reorganization of the protein structure after excitation. The photochemical activity of the SWNT/RC complexes remains stable for several weeks even in dried form. In the absence of SWNT the secondary quinone activity decays quickly as a function of time after drying the RC onto a glass surface. Polarography measurements substantiate the idea that there is an electronic interaction between the RCs and SWNTs after light excitation, which was suggested earlier by optical measurements.

Batteries and supercapacitors have different qualities in terms of power and energy density and cyclic life time.

This is only one of many reasons why alternative drive concepts, especially electric mobili-ty, have never been more in focus than today. A future change from combustion engines to electrical drives leads to additional loads, which gives rise to the necessity to take corrective measures in the energy supply sector. In order to be able to scrutinize the impacts on the power grid, a model has been developed with the help of the software MATLAB to generate stochastic load profiles for electric vehicles. The model exclusively deals with electric vehicles with lithium ion batteries. All parameters originate from the transport statistics of the motorized individual traffic in Austria. In the end the calculated outcome of a driving profile mix for 100 battery powered electric vehicles is consolidated into a total load profile. The resulting implications of some uncontrolled and controlled charging scenarios are discussed. As a consequence of the assumption that most charging processes take place in residential areas, a comparison of the overall load profiles with standardized load profiles for regu-lar households is carried out. If the charging processes are started immediately after the respective arrivals at home without being con-trolled, this will result in a rise of the evening load peak. It is shown that by means of several load cycles per day - provided the expansion of the charging infrastructure - this negative effect is limited. Anyway, the overall goal is a well controlled consumer-oriented charging process in order to shift the energy consump-tion to the night load depression. For this purpose several scenarios are elaborated and its advantages and drawbacks are described. Finally various approaches for the implementation of the highlighted scenarios are presented. © 2010 WEVA.","Battery powered electric vehicle; Charging infrastructure; Controlled consumer-oriented charging process; Household scenario; Stochastic load profile","Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Lithium-ion batteries; MATLAB; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Carbon; Electric batteries; Electric machine control; Secondary batteries; Battery-powered electric vehicles; Charging infrastructures; Controlled consumer-oriented charging process; Household scenarios; Stochastic load profiles; Process control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867946786

However, the output voltage of this TE-PV hybrid energy system is governed by the voltage of the battery, which is affected by the state of charge of the battery and the charging/discharging current. Furthermore, in order to improve the power density and life cycle of the battery, the ultracapacitor (UC) has been proposed to hybridize with the battery to form a hybrid energy storage system. In this paper, a multi-hybrid energy system is proposed for HEVs, which incorporates the advantages of the TE-PV hybrid subsystem and the ultracapacitor-battery (UC-B) hybrid subsystem. On the one side, the TE-PV hybrid subsystem can provide the higher fuel economy due to the increase of on-board renewable energy, the better energy security due to the use of multiple energy sources, and the higher control flexibility due to the coordination for charging the same pack of batteries. On the other side, the UC-B hybrid subsystem can provide faster transient power, higher power density and longer battery lifetime.

Restricted computational power, reduced memory, narrow bandwidth and energy supplied present strong limits in sensor nodes. Therefore, maximizing network lifetime and minimizing energy consumption are always optimization goals. To overcome the computation and energy limitation of individual sensor nodes during image transmission, an energy efficient image transport scheme is proposed, taking advantage of JPEG2000 still image compression standard using MATLAB and C from Jasper. JPEG2000 provides a practical set of features, not necessarily available in the previous standards. These features were achieved using techniques: the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and embedded block coding with optimized truncation (EBCOT). Performance of the proposed image transport scheme is investigated with respect to image quality and energy consumption.

Thus, in itself, it is an environmentally benign process. However, when judging the environmental merits of any fuel or energy carrier, it is important to consider the other, often complex processes related to additional stages of its life cycle, particularly its production, transport, and storage. Only by considering the cumulative burdens on the environment and the total consumption of primary energy resources can a fair comparison be made between the available and proposed options. LCA is a central element in the assessment of technologies and production routes, enabling a comparative evaluation of the environmental performances of different options. LCA methodology, sometimes referred to as ‘cradle-to-grave’ analysis, considers cumulative burdens stemming from the entire lifetime (construction, operation, and dismantling) of the directly and indirectly related industrial activities involved in the production of goods or the provision of services. By considering the consequences of an option according to these principles, a fair and unbiased evaluation of the merits and shortcomings can be achieved. In turn, an LCA forms a crucial aspect of a broader understanding from the perspective of sustainability, and can inform a decision-making process of the true level of either energy dependency or security that an option is likely to represent. For options which are ‘renewable’ or ‘non-fossil’ with regard to the direct conversion processes, a complete account of the background processes will determine whether a reduction of the reliance on conventional fuels will actually occur. Particularly for emerging energy systems, such as the use of hydrogen in transport, conducting such assessments at an early stage of development is important in order to identify the most promising options as well as determine environmentally significant aspects of an individual production route. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863779725

Three experimental groups ('Exper 1', 'Exper 2', 'Exper 3') with differing UEDMA to TEGDMA ratio in the matrix together with a control group ('Control') based on bis-GMA-MMA resin matrix were prepared by light-curing. The storage conditions for each group were dry storage at room temperature for 24 h and 30- and 60-day immersion in deionized (DI) water at 37C, which further divided each group into three subgroups. For all the four composition groups, mechanical properties including hardness, flexural strength and modulus in both three-point and four-point bendings were tested (n = 6), together with water sorption and solubility study (n = 6) and fracture site scanning with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The experimental specimens were relatively strong and stiff in three-point bending compared to previous research. The same specimens in three-point bending had a lower flexural modulus and fractured at higher flexural stress than in four-point bending. According to the SEM images after fracture, some resin matrix was still bound to the fiber surface, showing cohesive-interfacial fracture type and relatively stable matrix-fiber adhesion.

It has many potential applications such as polymer filler, sensor, energy conversion, and energy storage devices. Graphene-based nanocomposites are under an intense spotlight amongst researchers. A large amount of graphene is required for preparation of such samples. Lately, graphene-based materials have been the target for fundamental life science investigations. Despite graphene being a much sought-after raw material, the drawbacks in the preparation of graphene are that it is a challenge amongst researchers to produce this material in a scalable quantity and that there is a concern about its safety. Thus, a simple and efficient method for the preparation of graphene oxide (GO) is greatly desired to address these problems. In this work, one-pot chemical oxidation of graphite was carried out at room temperature for the preparation of large-area GO with ~100% conversion. This high-conversion preparation of large-area GO was achieved using a simplified Hummer's method from large graphite flakes (an average flake size of 500 μm). It was found that a high degree of oxidation of graphite could be realized by stirring graphite in a mixture of acids and potassium permanganate, resulting in GO with large lateral dimension and area, which could reach up to 120 μm and ~8000 μm(2), respectively.

This sort of effects goes under the name of Mach effects. Proving their existence would lead to a relatively fast development of rapid space transportation systems. Several tests have been pursued by Woodward himself and others, the results being sometimes elusive and contrasting. The potential of this research field, however, justifies further investigation. Until now, the tests have been conducted using exclusively capacitors as means of energy storage, and the acceleration has been supplied by the Lorentz force or by a piezoelectric actuator. The present work explores the possibility to search for Mach effects in bodies subjected to impulsive forces caused by a nonuniform magnetic field. Such magnetic field would provide both the acceleration and the change in the internal energy of the body, required for the expression of Mach effects. It will be shown that an impulsive (bell shaped) force applied to a special sort of test body should produce an anomalous final speed of the body itself.

A Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) rotovator-based space-elevator version called ""sling-on-a-ring"" may overcome them. This mass-lifting system uses the spatial stability of an orbital ring, accessorized for transfer and storage of momentum and electrical power. A high-tensile-strength equatorial circum-terra loop of colossalcarbon tube (CCT) fiber has solar-power and station-keeping units and rotating sling modules attached. Long sling assemblies (∼600 km) periodically descend from the orbital ring into the atmosphere (to ∼13 km). At perigee, the sling's rotational tip velocity almost cancels the orbital ring's velocity relative to Earth's surface. Split-second timing detaches a ∼10-ton payload from an ordinary aircraft and jerks it into space by sling and ring momentum, with the proven specific strength of CCTs now under development. This system eliminates the immense mass in space of other space-elevator systems, but needs extremely-long (100km) compressive members. Conceptual analysis for mass reduction of these structures is the subject of this paper. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Significant structural modifications in the environment of the isolated defects, especially the strontium vacancy, as well as defect aggregates were found. The experimental band gap energy of Sr 2MgSi2O7 was well reproduced by the calculations.

The Kuwaiti Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW) formed a committee to study the introduction of solar energy to generate EP. Meanwhile, the government formed a committee to take the necessary steps to build the first nuclear power plant (NPP) for EP production and desalting seawater. This study addresses the technical and economical aspects of using NPP and RE in generating EP in Kuwait in comparison with presently used combined cycle stations which are operated with natural gas or oil fuel. The results of this study indicate that installing wind energy (WE) or solar cells photovoltaic solar cells (PV) power plant (PP) cannot be considered a capacity addition. Capacity addition is required to handle the ever increasing peak load. The WE and PV PPs are primarily fuel savers for the existing fossil fuel plants. The intermittent and the nondispatchable nature of the WE and PV plants make them unable to generate consistent output like fuel-fired PPs. Their output should be taken by the grid and this decreases the load on the operating dispatchable PPs and thus reduces their fuel consumption. Among the thermal solar concentrating PP options (solar tower, solar dish with Stirling engine, and parabolic trough mirrors), the ones using parabolic trough are the only solar type PP that have reached commercial maturity with well-proven records of reliability and availability. This type of PP should be augmented with supplementary fossil fuel or thermal storage system to become a dispatch-able plant. © 2011 Desalination Publications.

The experiment was a Completely Randomized Design (CRD). At the end of the 15th week, blood was collected from 24 of the rabbits through cervical cutting while 16 were treated with niacin for another 8 weeks. The blood was collected to ascertain whether the high dietary energy diets was stressogenic on the rabbits through their blood parameters. The result showed significant (p<0.05) reduction in all the blood parameters except the white blood cells. This tended to indicate that the high dietary treatments (B and D) did impose stress on the rabbits, hence, these blood constituents were altered compared to the control and groundnut oil (A and C) diets. The observed significant (p<0.05) reduction in haemoglobin, packed cell volume and neutrophil production indicate that the oxygen supply to tissues and organs of the rabbits were different and not normal. The significant (p<0.05) pattern was quite the same when the effect of niacin treatment was considered in another analysis.

The husked coconut fruits stored at both 10EC and 30EC and the dehusked coconut fruits stored at 10EC showed no evidence of microbial spoilage at the end of the three months storage period. However, dehusked coconut fruits stored at 30EC deteriorated. Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger were the principal fungal agents associated with the spoilage. An investigation of the proximate composition of the dehusked fruits stored at 30EC indicated a marked significant difference in the percentage composition of moisture, protein, ascorbic acid and carbohydrate content of 3.97±0.28, 3.98±0.07, 0.01±0.002 and 9.27±1.02 respectively as against 46.82±0.43, 3.77±0.05, 2.48±0.15 and 11.89±0.22 obtained for dehusked coconut fruits prior to storage. These results suggest that the deterioration in nutritional composition was due to breakdown of protein and carbohydrate by the spoilage fungi. Further tests confirmed the ability of the isolated spoilage fungi to utilize the different carbohydrate and nitrogen sources as source of carbon and energy. Aspergillus flavus showed the ability to grow and utilize more of the various carbohydrate sources than Aspergillus Niger, although the latter utilized lactose better. Both fungi showed evidence of growth and complete utilization of nearly all the nitrogen sources, except cysteine and L-glutamine, which could not support the growth Aspergillus niger.

During its development, this technology has been confronted with difficulties in industrial application for paper industry. One of the main problems in laser cutting process is coloration of paper material during and after cutting. Coloration of paper material can appear due to influence of several factors, such as heat and light, which can cause changes in chemical, physical, optical and mechanical properties of paper surface. In this study it was assumed that energy required for successful laser cutting has to be pre-calculated in order to eliminate energy oversupply. A simple mathematical model found from literature was used for calculation of required cutting energy. This model took into account such parameters as paper grade, sample thickness and specific heat of paper. Due to this, cutting energy can be calculated and estimated for paper samples of different composition and consequently with different properties. Paper samples with different composition were laser cut with different parameters. Optical characteristics, such as yellowness, changes in yellow-blue hue and green-red hue, of laser cut paper samples were measured during 12 day of storage time in controlled laboratory conditions. Paper material samples were cut by Trumpf TLF 2700 HQ CO2 laser, with clean pressured air as cutting gas.

The methodology for willow stem chaff moisture content and temperature variation testing and experimental results are presented. One year growth of willow stems, chopped by the forage combine Maral 125 chopper, were used for experimental investigation of the storage of willow stem chaff and the drying in the stores by natural ambient air. It was found that the mast chaff in the individual storage sections was not dried uniformly from the bottom to up. The chaff in the first store was dried most intensively when ventilating with full blowing air quantity of 1300±20 m3/(t×h): moisture content of chaff in the first and fourth sections decreased to 19.6% and 43.0%, respectively. The mass variation was less intensive in the second store, where the chaff was ventilated by blowing half the quantity of air. The chaff dried worst in the third store, where active ventilation was not used. In this store, heating of the mass and mould were observed in all layers of the chaff. When transporting and handling moldy willow chaff, mold spores can get into the air and lead to respiratory diseases of people working in stores. Burning of moldy fuel leads to emissions of harmful substances into the ambient air.

To improve the power quality and satisfy the requirements of power system, it is necessary to integrate different-rating BESS composed battery modules (BM) and power conditioning system (PCS) into the microgrid. The BESSs can supply suddenly changed loads, especially for sensitive loads that must have uninterruptible power supply. A new control strategy included slack mode control and load mode control is presented to enable the BESSs operate in two operation mode: the free-slack operation mode and the load-sharing operation mode. In the load sharing operation mode,the controller enable various load proportionally shared by two different-rating BESS parallelly operating without communication between them In the free-slack mode operation, the BESSs acting as a free-slack can adequately balance the active and reactive power of the microgrid to maintain the voltage and frequency at point of common coupling (PCC) to a desired level. The advantage of the proposed control method is that the unified controller is employed for the two operation mode without swithing between different controllers.

The power controller of SMES designed without taking such uncertainties into account, may fail to stabilize the system. By considering both coil size and system uncertainties, this paper copes with the optimization of robust SMES controller. No need of exact mathematic equations, the normalized coprime factorization is applied to model system uncertainties. Based on the normalized integral square error index of inter-area rotor angle difference and specified structured H ∞ loop shaping optimization, the robust SMES controller with the smallest coil size, can be achieved by the genetic algorithm.

Advancements in electronic component design and equipment allow a bioimpedance analysis using a simple medical device. The aim of this work is to design a medical device which estimates the blood flow and calculates some hemodynamic parameters on the plethysmographic wave. We designed an equilibrated bridge designed on a small circuit board with connections for power and bioimpedance electrodes. A programmable function generator and an oscilloscope were connected to a computer and were tasked to drive and receive data from the circuit. The alternating - current generator is the current source; a series resistor limits the amount of current that passes through the subject. The frequency of the delivered current is between 20 kHz and 250 kHz. Because the skin impedance increases at higher frequencies, a small amount of energy will be delivered to the patient, that ensuring the safety of the system. The circuit was validated by testing its current output over a range of frequencies and comparing measured values of impedance across a test circuit to expected values.

The goal of the work, launched in 2007, is to test in situ sequestration of CO2 and mimic the natural carbon mineralization process that contributes to the global carbon cycle. The Hellisheidi site provides both a suitable basalt storage site as well as a stream of nearly pure CO2 from a parallel pilot project. This paper, drawing from earlier research, aims to re-evaluate the costs associated to the CarbFix method for this specific site. The pilot program, along with its known costs and operations, is scaled to higher flow rates of CO2. The findings indicate that at low CO2 flow rates the project is heavily weighted in capital costs while higher CO2 flow rates are subject to the variable costs such as electricity and water. In light of this, research should continue to assess the water and energy requirements for the system. The CarbFix technology employed elsewhere would undoubtedly encounter large CO2 point sources and will then be sensitive to these variable costs.

The few material used, even less than conventional lightweight solutions - the most common is plasterboard with light steel frame structure - allow a lower specific embodied energy and other more favourable environmental impact indicators. Compared to conventional heavyweight solutions, such as hollow brick walls, lightweight membranes allow easier deconstruction/ reuse. In the outer skin, architectural membranes can be used as passive or active systems, for heating (promoting greenhouse effect) and cooling (shading or even evaporative cooling). Lightweight materials are more viable to be used on invariably hot or cold climates, than on temperate climates, as in this context they present problems related with its low thermal storage capacity. However, the research of new architectural membrane materials, with passive and active behavior for thermal regulation, allows extending its possibilities to interior dividing partitions in order to fulfill contemporary demands of comfort. Active and/or passive systems can be used to regulate thermal gains - for example by radiant panels and/or evaporative cooling, but also to achieve thermal inertia. In pavements, thermal storage lightweight elements, using natural Phase Change Materials, were already studied and reported on previous studies from the first author.

The success of this new technology depends heavily on the performance of the energy storage systems under use. As development advances further, it becomes more and more obvious that it is absolutely vital to understand and control the thermal behaviour of the energy storage system. Because design and layout of the traction battery cooling system will vary from one application to another, numerical simulation methods provide efficient tools to model, simulate and analyze the cooling system and thermal behaviour before prototypes become available for testing. In addition, simulation models can be easily subjected to arbitrary conditions and load profiles, also allowing for coupled simulations including thermal, electric and drive dynamic vehicle behaviour. This paper presents the development and layout of the thermal model of an electric vehicle traction battery. The model is created via a widely-used numerical simulation software package. In order to validate the simulation model, single-cell heat transfer simulations are carried out using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools. The model is intended to cover a wide range of cooling system layouts. Its modular structure allows modelling nearly any design which employs bottom plate cooling. The model is built by linking battery cells to cell packs and cell packs to cell stacks. The coolant flow through the battery system can also be exactly directed by linking the cooling channels of the various cells to each other.",,"Automobile cooling systems; Battery Pack; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer software; Cooling; Electric traction; Energy storage; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Thermal management (electronics); Thermoelectric equipment; Coupled simulation; Detailed modeling; Energy storage systems; Heat transfer simulation; Modular structures; Numerical simulation method; Numerical simulation software; Thermal behaviours; Automotive batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959961918

Under normal physiological conditions, the growth and development of the foetus depends upon nutrients such as glucose, lipids and amino acids. In addition to the maternal and foetal status, genetic factors are also reported to play a role. The main function of the placenta in all species is to promote the selective transport of nutrients and waste products between mother and foetus. This transport is facilitated by the close proximity of the maternal and foetal vascular systems in the placenta. The foetus depends on the placental supply of nutrients, which regulates energy reserves by means of glycogen storage. Also, the synthesis of foetal hepatic glycogen guarantees energy reserves during perinatal asphyxia or maternal hypoglycaemia. However, the foetus can also obtain energy from other resources, such as gluconeogenesis from the intermediary metabolism of the Krebs cycle and most amino acids. Later, when the placental glucose contribution ends during the transition to the postnatal period, the maturation of biological systems and essential metabolic adaptations for survival and growth is required. The maintenance of normoglycaemia depends on the conditions that determine nutrient status throughout life: the adequacy of glycogen stores, the maturation of the glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic pathway, and an integrated endocrine response. © 2012 Veterinarni Medicina.","Foetal glycogenolysis; Hypoxia; Neonatal gluconeogenesis","Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959954957

Owing to its very high thermal capacity, the temperature of the ground is lower than that of the outdoor air in summer and higher in winter. Consequently, the heating and cooling energy of a building considerably sunk into ground is lower than that of a corresponding aboveground building. In aboveground buildings the type of soil on which they are founded may influence only slightly their annual energy balance since the floor is the only envelope being in direct contact with soil. In buildings partly sunk into ground (earth-sheltered buildings) not only the floor but also the walls and the flat roof are in contact with soil whereby the kind of soil may have a significant influence on the annual energy balance of the buildings. Separate analyses of an aboveground building and an earth-sheltered building with its south elevation exposed and glazed in 80% and a one meter thick layer of soil on its flat roof were carried out.

The relationship between increased visceral adiposity and obesity-related co-morbidities has lead to the recognition that variation in fat distribution contributes to ethnic differences in the prevalence of obesity-related diseases.

Their excellent performance in supercapacitors is believed to result from the large-area exposure of active (110) crystal planes. The Co3O4 nanosheets showed the best performance due to their larger surface area and ability to provide a better pathway for charge transfer, and are promising electrode materials for application in practical supercapacitors.[InlineMediaObject not available: see fulltext.] © 2011 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","energy storage; mesoporous; single crystal; supercapacitors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959642978

In this study we have therefore investigated the temperature dependence of the dose response for such dosimeters, regarding both irradiation and storage conditions. Methods: Dosimeter samples in cuvettes were irradiated to 5 Gy. The temperature for the different cuvettes during irradiation and post-irradiation storage was varied in the range of 3-30 C in order to quantify the temperature dependence of the dosimeter response. The optical properties of the dosimeter samples were measured using a spectrophotometer before irradiation as well as at several times after irradiation to quantify the temporal variation of dose response (expressed as the optical density change induced by irradiation) as a function of storage temperature. Results: The measurements show considerable temperature dependencies of dose response both during irradiation and storage. Fit to an Arrhenius equation revealed an activation energy of 1.4 0.2 eV for the variation in irradiation temperature, indicating a contribution from a thermally activated process. Variation in dose response at different storage temperatures showed an exponential increase with time followed by a decrease in optical density. Exponential Arrhenius fits to rate constants gave activation energies of 1.7 0.2 eV for the increase in dose response and 2.3 0.5 eV for the subsequent decrease, in this case dominated by thermally activated processes. Conclusions: Due to the exponential dependencies, stabilization of the dosimeter during irradiation at low temperatures (e.g., 5 C) is preferable in clinical use to optimize the accuracy of the dose response. In addition, a low storage temperature is recommended in order to minimize the post-irradiation temporal change in dose response and thereby increase the post-irradiation stability of the dosimeter. The measurements in this study show that if the observed temperature and temporal dependencies are not considered, this could potentially deteriorate the accuracy of the dosimeter. © 2011 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","3D dosimetry; radiochromic; radiotherapy; temperature","Activation energy; Density (optical); Density measurement (optical); Dosimeters; Irradiation; Optical instruments; Radiation chemistry; Radiotherapy; Rate constants; Temperature; Temperature distribution; Exponential increase; Irradiation temperature; radiochromic; Storage temperatures; Temperature dependence; Temperature dependencies; Temporal variation; Thermally activated process; Radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959554641

Batch tests were conducted to estimatethe SMP kinetics. The biomass associated products (BAPs) kinetics were estimated with results in tune with previous experiments. The utilization associated products (UAP) kinetics estimation was instead complicated by two aspects which regularly occur when spiking readily biodegradable COD: storage phenomena (not accountable in ASM2d); the non-uniformity between the polysaccharide fraction, easily biodegradable, and the protein fraction, which proved to be refractory to biodegradation. The procedure for UAP kinetics estimation would thus require further analysis. UAPs were found in full scale markedly predominant compared to the BAPs. The data analysisrevealed that the membrane rejection mechanism was identified as SMP loading rate dependent, emphasizing the need of a more careful consideration towards this parameter when working in a dynamic environment. The work discusses the feasibility of the SMP extension studies in dynamic conditions. Fine tuning of the membrane rejection factor, the necessity of more frequent sampling, and experimental determination of the additional kinetics SMP parameters become necessary and burdensome adaptations of the ASM calibrations. However both nutrients removal, sludge production and energy consumption modelling were not improved by including the SMP fraction in the modelling. SMPs did not correlate with fouling rates in this full scale MBR, indicating a strong drawback, since the main drive for these models is thus not accomplished. © 2011 Desalination Publications.

Nevertheless, the experience of Algeria in solar drying is recent and limited to drying of fruits, vegetables, medicinal and aromatic herbs. The effectuated review has given an idea about the existing functional dryers in this country with presentation of their different design aspects and in some cases the mathematical modeling for well describing and predicting their behaviours. The solar dryers were classified into two classes according to their operation mode and without taking into account if the dryers are using auxiliary sources of energy. The two classes are: passive dryers and active dryers. On the other hand, each class was divided into subclasses representing the type. We have found the direct and indirect types for the passive dryers, but only indirect types for the active dryers. Mixed types were not developed. The solar dryers were developed and tested in two different climatic regions which are the north of the country and the Sahara. In the most studied cases, one or multiple auxiliary sources of energy were used in order to increase the performances of the dryer or to decrease drying time. Consequently, we register the utilization of pebbles as a heat storage system, resistances as electrical heater, gas-ring and photovoltaic cells in order to give independency against the use of the traditional electrical energy. In the case of the active dryers, adding fans and temperature and flow controllers has permitted the control of the drying conditions. Depending on the dryers, the dried quantities vary from 200 g to 36 kg. Comparison between many studied cases for different modes and types and with open sun drying method was furthermore done. With a few exceptions to some solar dryers which present problems of complexity and was not practical and easy for manipulation to the agricultural producer, the majority of the developed solar dryers have presented satisfactory results. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Active dryers; Auxiliary sources; Food; Herbs; Mathematical modeling; Passive dryers","Drying; Food products; Heat resistance; Heat storage; Mathematical models; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Thermal processing (foods); Auxiliary source; Drying condition; Electrical energy; Electrical heater; Flow controllers; Heat storage systems; Herbs; Solar irradiation; Solar dryers",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958179987

The new algorithm of predicting the lowest-energy structures enables simultaneous inspection of the potential energy surface of a given system, calculation of its vibrational properties, and assessment of chances for obtaining a metastable ambient-pressure structure via decompression. Our calculations indicate that at room temperature the differences in the vibrational and entropy terms contributing to the Gibbs free energy of different polymorphs of silane are negligible in comparison with corresponding differences in the zero-point energy corrections, in contrast to earlier suggestions. We also show that the Fdd2 polymorph should be metastable upon decompression up to 5 GPa, which suggests the possibility of obtaining a polymeric ambient-pressure form of SiH4.

The packed bed cylindrical column is filled with spherical capsules of PCM (paraffin wax) that is used for a solar water heating application. In this study, the physical model is developed to use for analyzing the thermal performance of packed bed-PCM latent heat thermal energy storage. The model depends on energy a balance equation that can be applicable only to the sensible heat storage materials and can be converted to an enthalpy equation that can be applicable to the PCM storage bed. The governing equations are numerically solved using simple an explicit and first order finite difference technique. The results obtained are used for the thermal behavior of both charging and discharging modes. The effects of mass flow rate and inlet heat transfer fluid temperature (Stefan number) on the thermal performance of the PCM capsules of different radii are investigated. The melt/solid fraction distribution of the bed as function of time and axial position during charging and discharging modes is investigated. The results show that higher inlet heat transfer fluid temperature and higher mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid indicates a shorter time for complete charging processes. The complete solidification time is also longer compared to the melting time. This is due to the very low heat transfer coefficient during solidification.

The amount of energy supplied from solar radiation depends on the weather conditions, the available area and on the capture temperature. The weather conditions are difficult to account for. However, the collectors' area and temperature are design parameters. Usually there is an upper limit on the area of the collectors, both by available space and the cost. It determines the maximum energy that can be captured at different temperatures. The storage temperature should be the lowest possible to ensure maximum solar heat capture and minimum losses to the ambient. The resulting temperature level is determined by a trade off between the temperature levels of the process demands and the solar supply temperature. The higher is the temperature of the capture, the lower is the efficiency of the storage system and the amount of heat captured. Too low storage temperature may result in infeasibility of the heat transfer to processes. By constructing the Minimal Capture Temperature Curve (MCTC) and the Captured Solar Energy Curve (CSEC) the most favourable temperature of the storage and capture of energy from solar source is determined using simple targeting techniques.

At the same time, the use of nonlinear switching power supplies is more and more widespread nowadays, that creates serious nonlinear distortion in the line. In addition, the insufficient energy storage capacity commonly available in public energy distribution networks makes it very difficult to operate it an efficient and balanced way. Therefore, a novel control method for combining small domestic power plants using renewable energy and electric vehicle battery chargers where the battery can be used as temporal energy storage is proposed in this paper. The method is not only capable of optimizing the working point of the plant, but also implements active power factor (PF) correction and lowers the extant harmonic distortion in the line. In addition, the proposed control method allows one to create systems that can absorb the peaks of power production, or can feed power back into the grid in fluctuating energy production. The novel element is the voltage level controller which independently optimizes the effective value of the voltage at the connection point. This controls the energy flow direction between the grid, the renewable power source and the EV batteries. The system is able to communicate with an external controller through a Smart Grid Interface to be an element of a larger grid control scheme as an executer part. The proposed controller has been verified by simulation in Matlab environment, and as a result, substantial improvement of the output voltage and current effective value and waveform could be achieved. Robustness of the method against nonlinear loads has also been tested.

Traditionally, optimization of water networks (WNs) was performed using mono-objective functions (freshwater consumption, investment and/or operating costs etc). Lately, multi-objective function optimization was used in order to get a set of solutions (Pareto front - PF) from which to choose using non-quantifiable criteria. In the present paper, we used a complex two level optimization. The outer level optimizes the schedule of the water using units (WUs) according to their windows of opportunity with respect to the freshwater consumption, while the inner level uses a dual-objective function to optimize the topology of the semi-continuous WN: a) the freshwater consumption and b) the combined investment and operating cost of the pipe network, designed for the optimum diameter. The targeted schedule should ensure a maximum wastewater reuse between the discontinuous WUs and a minimum quantity of water for storage. The WN has N discontinuous WUs with respect to the processed raw materials, but continuous with respect to water flow, each handling at most K contaminants, and one storage tank (ST) of limited capacity. A single freshwater source is available. For each time interval, the network (the overlapping WUs) is abstracted as an oriented graph having the WUs and the ST as nodes and the flow pipes as arches. The WUs operating within a time interval are ranked also according to their maximum critical outlet concentration of contaminants. Therefore, water reuse is allowed from the WUs having lower maximum outlet concentrations to the ones with higher limits. The mathematical model consists of total and partial mass balance equations for each WU and the ST. Multi-objective genetic algorithm was the method of choice for optimization, as implemented in Matlab™. The same synthetic case study optimized for minimum freshwater consumption was used to test this new approach. The results are analyzed and discussed with respect to the mono-objective optimization as well.

One of these alternatives is the family of vehicles powered by purely electric energy. Besides its advantages, the main disadvantage of this solution is that the storage of the necessary amount of electrical energy needed for the long term operation of the vehicles is not completely solved. Therefore there is a rapid development in the field of batteries with small size and high storage capacity. An important prerequisite of development and testing of such batteries is the presence of a model suitable for the comparison of different battery types and describing the underlying physical mechanisms. Models used so far describe only the current-voltage characteristics without taking the various temperature circumstances into account. The charging, discharging, and capacity parameters of batteries used for energy storage are highly temperature dependent, so temperature must be taken into consideration for the correct description of such batteries. The proposed paper presents a general temperature dependent model of a family of batteries developed for vehicle electronic use. Besides the model derivation, the methodology and instruments developed for the correct measurements of the temperature dependent parameters are also presented together with a Matlab/Simulink block for the temperature dependent battery.

The engine of offshore development spending remains largely fuelled by the continuing move into deeper waters and harsher environments, and this trend was evidenced by several flagship projects that either came onstream or moved into the development phase during 2010. According to the analyst Infield Systems, the forecast demand for energy means the offshore industry will have to go through a minor revolution to satisfy the global thirst for hydrocarbons. This rising spend trend is further added to because many of the same solutions are equally applicable to one of the other main emerging areas for new potential - the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. With remote locations and ice-bound weather windows of several months, the necessity of disconnectable floating production units and permanent seabed processing systems, either linked to floating systems or tied back directly to shore, in these regions is indisputable. Projects currently in the front-end engineering and design stage such as Gazprom's huge Shtokman gas field offshore Russia will be the pioneers for other similar fields following close behind. Meanwhile, Shell is planning a large-scale project in the Browse basin off the coast of Western Australia. If this gets an internal final investment decision (FID) as expected later in 2011, it would be the world's first floating LNG (FLNG) facility. The operator is currently in the FEED phase for the FLNG unit, which is expected to produce 3.6 million ton/yr of LNG, 400,000 ton/yr of LPG, and 1.3 million ton/yr of condensate. First LNG would flow by 2016. In addition, nearly 200 offshore projects around the world are currently in either design or planning stages that will potentially require a floating production or storage system, according to Washington-based industry analysts International Maritime Associates. The analyst has flagged up a total of 196 projects that could require a floater and the fundamentals driving the floating production market look very strong. The current order backlog consists of 49 production floaters, including 35 floating production, storage and offloading vessels, six production semisubmersibles, one tension leg platform, three floating storage and regassification units, and four FLNG vessels.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953738870

It was followed by one of the world's first guidelines for capture and transport. Designed to support both industry and regulators, the guidelines represent a breakthrough that aims to speed up the large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS). The purpose this guideline is to contribute to the safe, reliable, and cost-efficient pipeline transport of CO2 in the dense, high-pressure phase. It describes a systematic approach to managing risks and uncertainties during the whole lifetime of a pipeline, including design, testing, inspection, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning. Current emerging frameworks for regulating CCS are suggesting that responsibility and liability for a storage site should be transferred to a national or state authority when the operator has established confidence that the storage site can provide safe long-term storage of injected volumes of CO2. Another yet unresolved liability issue relates to the handling, transport, and storage of CO2 across national borders, e.g., if CO2, which is captured in one country is either transported to another country to be stored there, or is stored in one country and migrates in the subsurface across a national border. To address technical and regulatory issues with the storage part, the DNV CO2QUALSTORE guideline was developed. It defines a structured approach to selecting and qualifying CO2 storage sites. The guideline provides operators with a tool for safely managing the site selection, characterization, operation and closure phases of a CO2 project without causing any significant safety or environmental risks. It also provides guidance on the criteria and procedures for issuing storage permits and other relevant permits and certificates.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953735303

Reverse osmosis is a very effective way to produce clean drinking water. Designing small scale photovoltaic powered brackish water reverse osmosis system (PV-BWRO) requires feed water characterization, proper pre-treatment setup, module design configuration, energy consumption evaluation and reject water management. Feed water characterization is done for optimum RO module arrangements and pre-treatment design to prevent fouling and scaling. Success of small scale PV-BWRO system designation depends on ability to minimize cost of water produced. Among all the parameters effecting cost, energy is the most influential. Energy consumption is reduced by including energy recovery device (ERD) in the system. It can be further reduced by including battery for stable supply of energy enabling the pumps to operate at optimum level. Problem with battery is energy loss during charging/discharging and high cost of maintenance and replacing. Instead of storing energy, another option is to store produced fresh water in storage tank. The capacity of the tank is determined based on average consumption of water by the population at the location of the system build. Reject water from RO system need to be managed properly. Improper disposal will cause contamination and disturb ecosystem. Powering RO systems with PV panels have a lot of advantages which includes maintenance free, easy installation and last up to 25 y. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Brackish water; Desalination; Photovoltaic; Reverse osmosis; Small scale",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953708557

Genetic algorithm (GA) optimization technique is utilized to satisfy two purposes. The first is to minimize the formulated objective function, which is the total cost of the proposed hybrid system. Whereas, the second is to ensure that the load is served according to certain reliability criteria, by maintaining the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) of the system lower than a certain predetermined value. Two computer programs are designed, using MATLAB code in a two M-files, to simulate the proposed hybrid system and to formulate the optimization problem by computing the coefficients of the objective function and the constraints. Also, these two programs are utilized together with the GA tool under MATLAB software to yield the optimum PV, wind, and battery ratings.

Resulting monitoring and measurement applications at high altitudes but also close to the Earth surface would be extremely useful and are targeted by several research groups and institutions. The question of how to choose the main design parameters of the airplane for a specific mission, considering the current state-of-the-art technologies involved, however, is not easy to answer. A tool is presented performing such a multi-disciplinary optimization. Solar airplanes using both batteries as energy storage devices as well as their capability of flying performance-optimizing altitude profiles can be sized and evaluated in terms of various performance measures. Simulation results show that sustained flight in the Stratosphere is hard to achieve, if the altitude needs to be kept constant. A simulated Remote Control (RC) model size solar airplane allowed to vary altitude proves to be capable of flying multiple day-night cycles at medium and high latitudes during summer. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Conceptual design; Endurance simulation; Multi-disciplinary optimization; Solar airplanes; Weight prediction model","Altitude profiles; Design parameters; Earth surface; Endurance simulation; Energy storage devices; Energy sustainability; High altitude; High Latitudes; Model size; Multi-disciplinary optimization; Multi-disciplinary optimizations; Performance estimation; Performance measure; Research groups; Simulation result; Solar airplanes; State-of-the-art technology; Weight prediction model; Aircraft; Aircraft control; Altitude control; Computer simulation; Conceptual design; Durability; Flight simulators; Mathematical models; Optimization; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951518315

The paper is based on the EREC's Agency forecast until the year 2040, which foresees the share of 82% of RES, extended to 100% of RES. The key element that creates conditions for achieving this ambitious scenario is an innovative combination of RES and pump storage hydroelectric (PSH) power plants, the so-called Concept-H, which can simultaneously use the energy of local RES (sun and wind) and local precipitation (natural waterflows) and in this way can provide continuous supply of electric power and energy to consumers. The methodology is based on the model of equivalent RES and equivalent reservoir that allows a comprehensive view of available RES and hydro system. The total required land use of RES system would be 29,517 km 2 of RES (which would amount to about 0.5% of the total technical potential of using RES), total reservoir volumes would be 880 km3 (which is only 8% of all artificial reservoirs built in the world to the date) and the orientation estimate of investment in TRES would then be approximately 1% of world GDP in 2009, which clearly shows that the TRES is realistically feasible. It has been shown that implementation of the green strategy of energy balance fulfilling can be realized with present day technology. Precisely this fact shows that further increase of efficiency of RES and their combining into RES-PSH power plants, along with increase in the cost of classic power fuels and the growing needs for environment protection, the proposed solution of TRES realization could be widely important and thus become a serious alternative to the existing energy strategies and a guideline to decision makers throughout the world. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The first one involves a PV - diesel based power system, while the second one integrates RES and hydrogen technologies for the development of a self - sustained power system. The main objective is the replacement of the diesel generator and a comparison between these two options for autonomous power supply. Model simulations of the two power systems before and after the replacement, an optimization of the component sizes and a techno - economic analysis have been performed for the purpose of this study. A sensitivity analysis taking into account future cost scenarios for hydrogen technologies is also presented. The results clearly show that the Cost of Energy Produced (COE) from the PV - hydrogen technologies power system is extremely higher than the PV - diesel power system. However, the adopted PV - hydrogen technologies power system reduces to zero the Green - House Gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis indicates that COE for the latter system can be further reduced by approximately 50% compared to its initial value. This could be achieved by reducing critical COE's parameters, such as PEM electrolyser and fuel cell capital costs. Hence, a possible reduction on the capital costs of hydrogen energy equipment in combination with emissions reduction mentioned above could make hydrogen - based power systems more competitive. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Autonomous power system; Energy storage; Hybrid energy system; Hydrogen technologies","Autonomous power system; Before and after; Capital costs; Component size; Cost of energies; Diesel generators; Emissions reduction; Hybrid energy system; Hydrogen Energy; Hydrogen technologies; Hydrogen-based power systems; Initial values; Model simulation; PEM electrolyser; Power supply; Power systems; Techno-Economic analysis; Computer simulation; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Emission control; Flywheels; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Sensitivity analysis; Technology; Cost benefit analysis; diesel; economic analysis; energy efficiency; hydrogen; numerical model; optimization; power generation; sensitivity analysis; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79751478479

Turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat acquired using the eddy covariance technique were accompanied by net radiation and water heat storage measurements. In April the lake was near isothermal, whereas in May the development of a thermocline was enabled by dark water color and a sheltered location. The thermocline continued to deepen until September down to the depth of 3.5 m and prevented the deeper water from interacting with the atmosphere. The sensible heat flux was governed by the air-water temperature difference and had its minimum in the afternoon (values down to -45 W m-2) and peaked in the early morning (values up to 32 W m-2). The monthly means ranged from -9 W m-2 (April 2005) to 24 W m-2 (July 2008). The diurnal variation of the latent heat flux, controlled by vapor pressure deficit, had an opposite diurnal phase with a maximum in the afternoon (values up to 120 W m-2) and minimum in the morning (values down to ∼2 W m-2). The monthly averages ranged from 4 W m-2 (October 2008) to 77 W m-2 (July 2006). Furthermore, the lake acted as a heat sink until July and August when the maximum heat content was about 230 MJ m-2. The monthly energy balance closure varied from 57% to 112%, and the average closure was 82% (residual 16 W m-2) and 72% (residual 23 W m-2) for 2006 and 2007, respectively.

To practically use an organism in such applications on a larger scale the microbe has to be formulated and stabilised. In this review we give an overview of our experience of formulating and stabilising P. anomala strain J121 in a wider perspective. The stabilisation techniques we have evaluated were liquid formulations, fluidised bed drying, lyophilisation (freeze-drying) and vacuum drying. With all methods tested it was possible to obtain yeast cells with shelf lives of at least a few months and in all cases the biocontrol activity was retained. Fluidised bed drying was dependent on the addition of cottonseed flour as a carrier during the drying process. In liquid formulations a sugar, preferentially trehalose, was a required additive. These two kinds of microbial stabilisation are easily performed and relatively inexpensive but in order to keep the cells viable the biomaterial has to be stored at cool temperatures. However, there is room for optimization, such as improving the growth conditions, or include preconditioning steps to enable the cells to produce more compatible solutes necessary to survive formulation, desiccation and storage. In contrast, lyophilisation and vacuum drying require a lot of energy and are thus expensive. On the other hand, the dried cells were mostly intact after one year of storage at 30°C. Inevitably, the choice of formulation and stabilisation techniques will be dependent also on the intended use. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Biopreservation; Fluidised bed drying; Formulation; Freeze-drying; Vacuum drying","trehalose; antifungal activity; article; biological control agent; cell viability; desiccation; flour; fluidized bed; freeze drying; fungus growth; low temperature; nonhuman; Pichia anomala; priority journal; shelf life; storage temperature; vacuum; yeast cell; Colony Count, Microbial; Desiccation; Freeze Drying; Microbial Viability; Pest Control, Biological; Pichia; Plant Diseases; Micropus; Pichia anomala",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79451475324

It is, therefore, important to find ways to reduce the influence of variations in wind power generation on these plants without forsaking large amounts of wind power. Using a unit commitment model, this work investigates the possibility to reduce variations by means of a moderator, such as a storage unit or import/export capacity. The relation between the reduction in CO 2-emissions and the power rating of the moderator is investigated, as well as the benefit of a moderator which handles weekly variations compared with a moderator which has to be balanced on a daily basis. It is found that a daily balanced moderator yields a decrease in emissions of about 2% at 20% wind power grid penetration. The reduction in emissions is mainly due to an avoidance of start-up and part load emissions and a moderator of modest power rating is sufficient to achieve most of this decrease. In the case of a weekly balanced moderator, emissions are reduced as the moderator power rating increases. At 40% wind power grid penetration, a weekly balanced moderator reduces emissions with up to 11%. The major part of this reduction is due to the avoidance of wind power curtailment. The simulated benefit (CO2-emissions and costs) from adding a general moderator is compared with emissions from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies and cost data of five available moderator technologies; transmission capacity, pumped hydro power, compressed air energy storage, flow batteries and sodium sulphur batteries.

The objective was to compare basal and insulin mediated VLDL-TG kinetics, oxidation, and adipose tissue storage in type 2 diabetic and healthy (nondiabetic) men. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Eleven type 2 diabetic and 11 healthy men, matched for BMI and age, were included. Ex vivo-labeled VLDL-TG tracers, blood and breath samples, fat biopsies, indirect calorimetry, and body composition measures were applied to determine VLDL-TG kinetics, VLDL-TG fatty acids (FA) oxidation, and storage in regional adipose tissue before and during a hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic clamp. RESULTS-VLDL-TG secretion was significantly greater in diabetic compared with healthy men (basal: 86.9 [31.0] vs. 61.9 [30.0]-mol/min, P- 0.03; clamp: 60.0 [26.2] vs. 34.2 [17.9] μmol min-1, P = 0.01). The insulin mediated suppression of VLDL-TG secretion was significant in both groups. VLDL-TG clearance was lower in diabetic men (basal: 84.6 [32.7] vs. 115.4 [44.3] ml · min-1, P = 0.08; clamp: 76.3 [30.6] vs. 119.0 [50.2] ml · min-1, P = 0.03). During hyperinsulinemia fractional VLDL-TG FA oxidation was comparable, but in percentage of energy expenditure (EE), significantly higher in diabetic men. Basal VLDL-TG storage was similar, but significantly greater in abdominal compared with leg fat. CONCLUSIONS-Increased VLDL-TG in type 2 diabetic men is caused by greater VLDL-TG secretion and less so by lower VLDL-TG clearance. The ability of hyperinsulinemia to suppress VLDL-TG secretion appears preserved. During hyperinsulinemia VLDL-TG FA oxidation is significantly increased in proportion of EE in type 2 diabetic men.

Male factor infertility is a common condition with unknown etiology in most of the cases. Sperm abnormalities could possibly lead to infertility. As sperm motility depends on intact mitochondrial function and energy levels. Thus reduced intracellular creatine stores may contribute to decreased sperm motility leading to male infertility as creatine /phosphocreatine system plays major role in making and breaking of ATP, thus in energy kinetics. We developed and validated a denaturing high performance liquid chromatograph (DHPLC) method for the molecular analysis of SLC6A8 and GAMT genes involve in creatine biosynthesis and transport as a possible source of human male infertility by analyzing DNA from 64, clinically confirmed, infertile men. No mutation/polymorphism was detected in the exonic regions of both genes in all the patients and in fertile healthy controls indicating that SLC6A8 and GAMT genes may not be directly involved in human male infertility.","Creatine transporter; DHPLC; GAMT; Male infertility","creatine; DNA; guanidinoacetate methyltransferase; membrane protein; SLC6A8 protein; unclassified drug; article; biosynthesis; controlled study; denaturing high performance liquid chromatography; DNA polymorphism; exon; gene mutation; human; major clinical study; male; male infertility; molecular dynamics; validation process; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; DNA; DNA Mutational Analysis; DNA Primers; Exons; Guanidinoacetate N-Methyltransferase; Humans; Indicators and Reagents; Infertility, Male; Male; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Plasma Membrane Neurotransmitter Transport Proteins; Protein Denaturation; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651397009

The GaAs NWs were grown via the vaporliquidsolid method with Au-nanoparticles as catalysts. Enhancement in emission of at least an order of magnitude was observed from the GaAsAlGaAs coreshell NWs as compared to the bare GaAs NWs grown under similar conditions, which is an indication of improved radiative efficiency. The improvement in radiative efficiency is due to the passivating effect of the AlGaAs shell. Variation in bandgap emission energy as a function of temperature was analyzed using the semi-empirical BoseEinstein model. Results show that the free exciton energy of the GaAs coreshell agrees well with the known emission energy of zinc blende (ZB) bulk GaAs. Further analysis on the linear slope of the temperature dependence curve of photoluminescence emission energy at low temperatures shows that there is no difference between coreshell nanowires and bulk GaAs, strongly indicating that the grown NWs are indeed predominantly ZB in structure. The Raman modes show downshift and asymmetrical broadening, which are characteristic features of NWs. The downshift is attributed to lattice defects rather than the confinement or shape effect. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","A1. Nanostructures; A1. Optical microscopy; A3.

Matrix converters (MCs) allow the direct ac/ac power conversion without dc energy storage links; therefore, the MC-based UPFC (MC-UPFC) has reduced volume and cost, reduced capacitor power losses, together with higher reliability. Theoretical principles of direct power control (DPC) based on sliding mode control techniques are established for an MC-UPFC dynamic model including the input filter. As a result, line active and reactive power, together with ac supply reactive power, can be directly controlled by selecting an appropriate matrix converter switching state guaranteeing good steady-state and dynamic responses. Experimental results of DPC controllers for MC-UPFC show decoupled active and reactive power control, zero steady-state tracking error, and fast response times. Compared to an MC-UPFC using active and reactive power linear controllers based on a modified Venturini high-frequency PWM modulator, the experimental results of the advanced DPC-MC guarantee faster responses without overshoot and no steady-state error, presenting no cross-coupling in dynamic and steady-state responses. © 2010 IEEE.","Direct power control (DPC); matrix converter (MC); unified power-flow controller (UPFC)","Active and reactive power; Active and reactive power controls; Capacitor power; Cross-couplings; Direct power control; DPC controller; Fast response; High frequency HF; Input filter; Linear controllers; Matrix converter; Phase matrix; Power conversion; Sliding modes; Steady state errors; Steady state tracking; Steady-state response; Unified power flow controllers; Controllers; DC power transmission; Dynamic response; Electric load dispatching; Flow control; Linear control systems; Power control; Power converters; Reactive power; Electric control equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650921968

Information storage in liquids can be thus expressed in absolute energy units. Three liquid systems are analyzed in some detail. The first is a solution of a chiral substance, e.g., amino acid in water, where the degree of optical rotation provides the measure for order while the heat liberated upon racemization is the energy corresponding to the negative entropy. The second is a neat chiral fluid, e.g., 2-butanol, complying with the same parameters as those of chiral solutions.

Modeling of the autonomous wind system is considered as the first step in the optimal sizing procedure. In this paper, more accurate mathematical models for characterizing the main subsystems (wind generator and unit of storage) are proposed. Based on lack of energy to generate probability (LEGP), percentage of the surplus of energy produced (PSEP) and the cost of the kilowatt-hour produced (C kWh), the second step consists in optimizing the sizing of a system. A simulation software code has been developed to carry out the analysis for optimizing the size of the system.

Most small heat plants built so far are constructed for moisture contents of about 35% on wet basis. Therefore, the material must be dried. Because artificial drying induces additional costs, storing the material in piles roadside as whole trees until desired moisture content is obtained is considered beneficial. Traditionally, leaf seasoning has been considered an efficient method. To increase the understanding of these processes, a study on drying whole trees in piles has been accomplished at three different locations with different climatic conditions. The study focuses on the following explanatory variables: harvesting season, location, climatic conditions, position in the pile, tree species, and relative crown length. The effect of covering the piles in order to reduce the moisture uptake during winter was also studied. Models, estimating the moisture content with time profiles, were developed.During spring and summer the moisture content was reduced to approximately 35% also when the material was harvested in the autumn the year before. The climatic conditions were important for the drying result, but drying was effective also in the moist climate in western Norway. Covering the dry piles before the winter was important in order to maintain the requested moisture content. The effect of covering the material harvested in autumn was limited. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Climatic effects; Forest fuel; Leaf seasoning; Modelling; Moisture content; Storage","Climatic effects; Forest fuel; Leaf seasoning; Modelling; Moisture content; Storage; Curing; Drying; Fuel storage; Fuels; Harvesting; Moisture determination; Piles; Reforestation; Moisture; broad-leaved forest; climate effect; energy use; moisture content; pile; seasonality; timber; Curing; Drying; Fuels; Harvesting; Moisture Content; Norway; Reforestation; Storage; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650530409

As the nature of the wind power is unpredictable, more balancing power is desired for a stable and reliable operation of the power system. The present balancing power in Denmark is provided mostly by the large central power plants followed by a number of decentralized combined heat and power units and connections from abroad. The future energy plans in Denmark aim for 50% wind power capacity integration which will replace many conventional large power plant units. The limited control and regulation power capabilities of large power plants in the future demands for new balancing solutions like vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems. In this paper, aggregated electric vehicle (EV)-based battery storage representing a V2G system is modeled for the use in long-term dynamic power system simulations. Further, it is analyzed for power system regulation services for typical days with high and low wind production in the Western Danish power system. The results show that the regulation needs from conventional generators and the power deviations between West Denmark and Union for the Coordination of Electricity Transmission (UCTE) control areas are significantly minimized by the faster up and down regulation characteristics of the EV battery storage. © 2010 IEEE.","Battery storage; electric vehicles (EV); load frequency control; regulation; vehicle-to-grid (V2G); wind power","Balancing power; Battery storage; Central power plants; Combined heat and power units; Control area; Denmark; Down-regulation; Electricity transmission; Energy plan; EV battery; Large power; Load-frequency control; Long term dynamics; Power capability; Power systems; regulation; Reliable operation; Typical day; Vehicle to grids; vehicle-to-grid (V2G); Wind power capacity; Automobiles; Electric control equipment; Electric frequency control; Electric load management; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Power plants; Press load control; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650323389

Keeping storage capacity constant, the costs of the strategic stock are around 20% of the value of the storage market for Denmark, and 16% for Italy.

Several parameters affecting biocatalysis at moderate pressures were investigated as follows: pressure, different forms of immobilized biocatalysts, glucose concentration, pH, temperature and the presence of catalase. Glucose 2-oxidase (GOX2) was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B-IDA-Cu(II) column at pH 6.0. Purified enzyme and catalase were immobilized into a polyethersulfone (PES) membrane in the presence of glutaraldehyde and gelatin. Enhancement of the bioconversion of d-glucose was done by the pressure since an increase in the pressure with compressed air increases the conversion rates. The optimum temperature and pH for bioconversion of d-glucose were found to be 62 °C and pH 6.0, respectively and the activation energy (E a) was 28.01 kJ mol-1. The apparent kinetic constants (V′max, K′m, K′cat and Kcat/K′m) for this bioconversion were 2.27 U mg-1 protein, 11.15 mM, 8.33 s-1 and 747.38 s-1 M-1, respectively. The immobilized biomass of C. versicolor as well as crude extract containing GOX2 activity were also useful for bioconversion of d-glucose at 65 bar with a yield of 69.9 ± 3.8% and 91.3 ± 1.2%, respectively.

The hydrolytic cleavage of TAG generates non-esterified fatty acids, which are subsequently used as energy substrates, essential precursors for lipid and membrane synthesis, or mediators in cell signaling processes. Consistent with its central importance in lipid and energy homeostasis, lipolysis occurs in essentially all tissues and cell types, it is most abundant, however, in white and brown adipose tissue. Over the last 5 years, important enzymes and regulatory protein factors involved in lipolysis have been identified. These include an essential TAG hydrolase named adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) [annotated as patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein A2], the ATGL activator comparative gene identification-58 [annotated as α/β hydrolase containing protein 5], and the ATGL inhibitor G0/G1 switch gene 2. Together with the established hormone-sensitive lipase [annotated as lipase E] and monoglyceride lipase, these proteins constitute the basic ""lipolytic machinery"".

However, with carbon capture and storage, the efficiency will be penalized by almost 10% units. To limit the energy consumption for a carbon capture NGCC plant, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is necessary. Utilizing EGR increases the CO2 content in the gas turbine exhaust while it reduces the flue gas flow to be treated in the capture plant. Nevertheless, due to EGR, the gas turbine will experience a different media with different properties compared with the design case. This study looks into how the turbomachinery reacts to EGR. The work also discusses the potential of further improvements by utilizing pressurized water rather than extraction steam as the heat source for the CO2 stripper. The results show that the required low-pressure level should be elevated to a point close to the intermediate-pressure to achieve optimum efficiency, hence, one pressure level can be omitted.

The microcapsulated PCMs were prepared by coating n-eicosane with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) shell. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and particle size distribution (PSD) analysis were used to characterize the PMMA/eicosane microcapsules as microcapsulated PCMs. The PSD analysis indicated that the average diameter of microcapsules was found to be 0.70 μm under the stirring speed of 2000 rpm. Thermal properties and thermal reliability of the microcapsules were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) methods. From DSC analysis, the melting and freezing temperatures and the latent heats of the microcapsules were measured as 35.2°C and 34.9 °C, 84.2 and-87.5 J/g, respectively. TGA analysis indicated that PMMA/eicosane microcapsules degrade in three steps at considerably high temperatures. Accelerated thermal cycling tests have been also applied to show the thermal reliability of the microcapsules. All results showed that thermal properties make the PMMA/eicosane microcapsules potential PCM for thermal energy storage. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the execution of a group key agreement protocol which involves all the nodes in the network must be very carefully selected having in mind both the computation and communication efficiency. In this paper, we present an efficient group key agreement protocol which is particularly suitable for energy constrained, dynamically evolving wireless ad hoc networks. The topology of the network is reflected in a structure composed by small clusters. This clustering allows the synchronous execution of efficient tripartite key agreement protocols based on pairings. The required computations are simple for the devices to implement, the size of the exchanged messages is minimum and the storage memory required in every node is very small. The proposed protocol achieves a good energy balance and is very flexible because it can be used either as contributory, non-contributory, unauthenticated or authenticated protocol by simply modifying a step of the protocol. Finally, we compare the communication/computation complexity of the unauthenticated and authenticated versions of our protocol with previously known protocols and show that they compare favourably with them. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The power flow of this connection can be bidirectional, so vehicles can charge and discharge. This vehicle-to-grid option can aid to improve grid efficiency and reliability. A simulation covering an entire day is essential to obtain an accurate assessment of the impact of PHEVs. It is important to know when, statistically, vehicles are available for charging or discharging. In this work is shown that uncoordinated charging of PHEVs in distribution grid can lead to local grid problems. Therefore, coordinated charging and discharging is investigated and a voltage constraint is implemented. These vehicles can support the grid in terms of voltage control and congestion management. In that way, the distribution grid can handle more PHEVs without reinforcements. Distributed generation units are more common nowadays in the distribution grid with some of these generation units based on intermittent renewable resources. This paper shows that there could be a good combination with PHEVs as they can provide storage to take care of the excess of produced energy and use it for driving or release it into the grid at a later time. In that way, consumption and generation are more efficiently matched. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Charging strategy optimization; Distribution grid; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Renewable energy; Vehicle-to-grid","Charging strategies; Distribution grid; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Renewable energies; Vehicle-to-grid; Automobiles; Electric discharges; Electric potential; Electric vehicles; Optimization; Power generation; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Traffic congestion; Voltage regulators; Mesh generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958052583

The natural gas compressors are usually driven by an electric motor or a gas turbine system, offering possibilities for energy management, one of these consisting in generating energy for use in-plant or to commercialize as independent power producer. It can be done by matching the natural gas demand, at the minimum pressure allowed in the reception point, and the storage capacity of the feed duct with the maximum compressor capacity, for storing the natural gas at the maximum permitted pressure. This allows the gas turbine to drive an electric generator during the time in which the decreasing pressure in duct is above the minimum acceptable by the sink unit. In this paper, a line-pack management analysis is done for an existing compression station considering its actual demand curve for determining the economic feasibility of maintaining the gas turbine system driver generating electricity in a peak and off-peak tariff structure. The potential of cost reduction from the point of view of energy resources (natural gas and electric costs) is also analyzed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
